        "text": "A friend of Aarvan owns a film studio, Satvi Films (SF), in Bengaluru. Aarvan has\n      recommended that MM take over SF. SF has a reputation for making high-quality films that\n      are very popular and it is accustomed to making full-length films for the Indian market. It has\n      also made social marketing advertisements for Indian television. SF produces films to meet\n      the precise demands of its customers, including producing them to customer specifications\n      and tight deadlines. There are often pressures to get work done on time, especially as SF\n      does not allow overtime working. Rachel is concerned that SF ’s managers are autocratic and\n      that many of its employees lack the freedom to be creative. Although the pay scales at SF\n      are lower than average for India, its managers do receive financial rewards, such as bonuses.\n      To assess the possible takeover, Rachel is analysing financial information for SF (Table 1).\n                     Table 1: Selected financial information for SF for 2019 and 2020\n\n                                                                 2019      2020\n\n                        Stocks ($ millions)                       2          4\n\n                        Cash ($ millions)                        20         10\n\n                        Debtors ($ millions)                     18         16\n\n                        Current liabilities ($ millions)         30         25\n\n                        Gross profit margin (%)                   8          7\n\n                        Net profit margin (%)                     4          2\n\n      Aarvan thinks that a takeover of SF will reduce MM ’s production costs and that owning SF\n      would make it easier for MM to produce the advertisements that customers want. Aarvan\n      knows that the owner wants to sell, so SF would be cheap and easy to buy.\n      However, Javed thinks that SF does not have enough experience in making short, attention-\n      grabbing advertisements: its main experience is in making full-length films for cinema\n      release. He also thinks that it would be difficult to manage two very different businesses,\n      each with different conditions of employment.\n\n      (a)     Define the term social marketing.\b[2]\n\n      (b)     Using Table 1:\n\n              (i)    calculate the current ratio for SF for 2020 (show all your working);\b[2]\n\n              (ii)   suggest one reason why SF may have a liquidity problem.\b                           [2]\n\n      (c)     Explain two factors that may influence the motivation of employees at SF.\b[4]\n\n      (d)     Recommend whether MM should take over SF.\b[10]\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n© International Baccalaureate Organization 2021",

        "text": "ELE’s ability to penetrate the Indian car rental market. Further, sales revenues in India would\n   fluctuate as exchange rates have been volatile. For example, in 1995 one euro purchased\n   42 Indian rupees, whereas in 2021 one euro purchased 89 rupees.\nThe Operations Management Department were asked to produce a report on operations\nmanagement practices and strategies for economic, social (in terms of human resources) and\necological sustainability for ELE’s current and future projects.\nA summary of that financial and non-financial information is presented below.\n\n\nZeat Division (line 95): Expected to be profitable for a maximum of 20 years, subject to the\nexternal environment. A case can be made for ecological sustainability because as long as\nthe world produces electric engine cars, these cars will still need air in their tyres. However,\nin the long-term gas stations are likely to become a thing of the past as more car owners\nrecharge their electric batteries at home and work.\n\n\n\nDevelop new Indian market (line 102): €2.5 billion to establish operations across India,\nincluding the purchase of a new fleet of rental cars. There is much growth potential in India,\nhowever, India does not have sufficient infrastructure for electric vehicles yet, especially\noutside of its megacities such as New Delhi – population 27 million. Most of its rental fleet\nwould need to be petrol engines or hybrid technology. However, the government has set a\ntarget to have at least 30% of new vehicles being electric vehicles by 2030. Thus, a new\nIndian rental car division would be able to shift to electric vehicles over time, aligning with\nthe company’s green objectives. This division would employ many people locally but also\nforce many local car rental companies to close.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  Page 3|5\n\f          IB Business Management Higher Level Paper 1 Examination\n                      IB Business Management: www.BusinessManagementIB.com\n\n\n\nNew brand In3T (line 118): €2 billion required to build the technology, market the new brand\nand, most expensively, purchase a new electric vehicle fleet for its European operations. This\noption is expected to be increasingly profitable across time as demand for green energy\nproducts continues to grow and European carbon emissions become increasingly more\nregulated. This option aligns well with environmental goals at ELE but there is a substantial\nsocial cost as many employees would be made redundant.\n\n\nThe board of directors believes basing its rental fleet on electric cars should be a strategic\npriority for the company but is concerned about the high cost of achieving economies of\nscale, problems associated with obtaining finance, and future technologies that may make\nrental cars obsolete. However, there are two main advantages ELE would have with both of\nits rental car strategic options:\n▪     Barriers to entry are high in the car rental industry with the cost of financing a large fleet of\n      vehicles being especially prohibitive. Where barriers to entry are high, competition is low\n      and profit margins high.\n▪     There would be a good degree of product differentiation with either option; a recognised\n      and global car rental brand in the case of India; in the case of In3T, a rental car brand with\n      cutting edge technology that has truly green credentials.\n\n\na.

        "text": "In 2022, the global home water filter market was $14 billion.\n\n     SVT’s product penetration in Europe and the United States of America (USA) is high and\n     growing but low in the rest of the world. In 2022:\n     y SVT’s total sales revenue from home water filters was $4.9 billion\n     y the average revenue earned per water filter was $20\n     y 90 % of SVT’s home water filter sales were to Europe and the USA.\n\n     In 2022, SVT announced the closure of its European and USA water filter manufacturing\n     factories. Water filter profit margins had fallen for three years, partly because of increasing\n     costs of energy, rent and labour. SVT has since built a huge new factory in Asia to\n     manufacture home water filters.\n\n     SVT’s market research, using quota sampling, found that 80 % of households that purchased\n     an SVT water filter:\n     y had an above-average income\n     y owned two or more cars.\n\n     In January 2023, SVT:\n     y launched an advertising campaign in Europe and the USA highlighting the lack of potable water\n        for millions of people in less economically developed countries (LEDCs)\n     y announced a 5 % worldwide increase in the price of its home water filters.\n\n     SVT committed to use the revenue from the 5 % price increase to provide two million free\n     WF15 water purifiers annually to charities in LEDCs. It costs SVT $10 to make a water purifier.\n\n     Some disagreement occurred among the board of directors regarding this price increase.\n     Some directors felt it would highlight SVT’s vision and commitment to helping people\n     in LEDCs, but others believed sales might fall, impacting profits in SVT’s Consumer\n     Products Division.\n\n     (a)   Define the term quota sampling.\b[2]\n\n     (b)   (i) \t\u0007Calculate SVT’s home water filter market share in 2022 (show all your working).\b[2]\n\n           (ii)   Calculate the number of home water filters SVT sold in 2022 to the rest of the\n                  world (excluding Europe and the USA) (show all your working).\b[2]\n\n     (c)   Explain two factors that SVT would have needed to consider when deciding where to\n           open the new factory in Asia. \b                                                                 [4]\n\n     (d)   Discuss whether SVT should have increased the price of its home water filters.\b               [10]\n\n\n\n\b",

For example:\n\n     If MAT is the two-dimensional array shown in Figure 3a, then isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT)\n     should output that the table has been correctly completed.\n\n     If MAT is the two-dimensional array shown in Figure 3b then isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT)\n     should output that the table has not been correctly completed.\n\n(This question continues on the following page)\n\f

  The description of the algorithm for the isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT) sub-program is\n          as follows:\n          y Initialize a one-dimensional array, FLAGS, with zero (0) values.\n          y Visit all elements of the MAT array.\n             y Use the number stored in the MAT array to match up the index in the FLAGS array.\n             y Assign one (1) to the FLAGS array at that index.\n          y Inspect elements of the FLAGS array.\n             y If all the elements in the FLAGS array are one (1), output a message saying that the\n                 table has been completed correctly; otherwise, output a message saying that the table\n                 has not been completed correctly.\n\n          For example, the FLAGS array for the MAT array shown in Figure 3a is:\n

        "text": "A team of four high-school students decided to create a computer program for younger\n      students to help them learn to count and recognize whole numbers from 1 to 25.\n\n      A table partially completed with numbers from 1 to 25 is given to a younger student. The table\n      consists of five rows and five columns (see Figure 2). The younger student must enter the\n      remaining numbers. Each number from 1 to 25 should be entered only once.\n\n                         Figure 2: Example table partially filled with numbers\n\n                                              24     1\n\n                                                     7    14\n\n                                         4     6                22\n\n                                        10                21     3\n\n                                        11          25           9\n\n      Each of the four students is responsible for creating several sub-programs that will be\n      included in the program.\n\n      (a)   List three advantages of using sub-programs in this situation.\b                             [3]\n\n(This question continues on the following page)\n\f                                                  –7–                                           2225 – 6419\n\n\n(Question 13 continued)\n\n     The sub-program inputCheck() should return a valid input number.\n\n     This will ensure that the younger student’s input is a number in the range 1–25 inclusive.\n     If the input number is not in this range, an appropriate message is output. The process will\n     be repeated until a valid number is input.\n\n     For example:\n\n     For the sub-program call N = inputCheck(), if the following appears on the screen:\n\n           Enter a number:\n            0\n           The number is not in the range from 1 to 25. Please try again.\n           Enter a number:\n            50\n           The number is not in the range from 1 to 25. Please try again.\n           Enter a number:\n            10\n           Your number is valid.\n\n\n\n     Then the value of N would be 10 after execution.\n\n     (b)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for the sub-program inputCheck().\b[4]\n\n(This question continues on the following page)\n\n\n\n\n

static two-dimensional array.\n\n                                     Figure 3: Two examples of data\n\n            Figure 3a: The two-dimensional               Figure 3b: The two-dimensional\n            array is correctly completed                 array is not correctly completed\n            because each of the numbers from             because the number 17 is missing\n            1 to 25 appears only once.                   and the number 12 appears twice.\n\n                    [0] [1] [2] [3] [4]                         [0] [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\n             [0]     2    24     1     8

   25    2    9\n\n     The sub-program isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT) accepts the two-dimensional array MAT\n     and outputs an appropriate message to indicate if it has been correctly filled.\n\n     For example:\n\n     If MAT is the two-dimensional array shown in Figure 3a, then isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT)\n     should output that the table has been correctly completed.\n\n     If MAT is the two-dimensional array shown in Figure 3b then isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT)\n     should output that the table has not been correctly completed.\n\n(This question continues on the following page)\n\f                                                                            –9–                                                                            2225 – 6419\n\n\n(Question 13 continued)\n\n          The description of the algorithm for the isCorrectlyCompleted(MAT) sub-program is\n          as follows:\n          y Initialize a one-dimensional array, FLAGS, with zero (0) values.\n          y Visit all elements of the MAT array.\n             y Use the number stored in the MAT array to match up the index in the FLAGS array.\n             y Assign one (1) to the FLAGS array at that index.\n          y Inspect elements of the FLAGS array.\n             y If all the elements in the FLAGS array are one (1), output a message saying that the\n                 table has been completed correctly; otherwise, output a message saying that the table\n                 has not been completed correctly.\n\n          For example, the FLAGS array for the MAT array shown in Figure 3a is:\n
