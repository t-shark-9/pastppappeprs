Yeast uses lipids rather than glucose in respiration at low temperatures.\nB. Addition of glucose has a greater impact on rates of cell respiration at lower temperatures.\nC. Rates of cell respiration increase with temperature.\nD. More glucose is produced at higher temperatures.– 9 – M19/4/BIOLO/SPM/ENG/TZ1/XX",
