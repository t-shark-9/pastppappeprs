              Kangaroos can communicate with humans, study finds




                                           Non-essential image removed




1        Kangaroos can use body language to communicate with humans in a similar way to
         domesticated animals such as dogs, horses and goats, a new study has found.

2        Researchers at the Universities of Sydney and Roehampton studied kangaroos at three
         locations across Australia and found that the animals were capable of “seeking help” by gazing
         intently at a human while striving to access food placed in a closed box, instead of merely
         attempting to open the box themselves. Such behaviour is usually associated with domesticated
         animals. Gazing at humans when stretching for inaccessible food and alternating that gaze
         between the humans and the task, is often interpreted as an attempt at communication, the
         report said.

3        Dr Alexandra Green, a co-author of the study, said rather than just giving up when they couldn’t
         open the box, the vast majority of the kangaroos looked to the researcher and then back to the
         box, a gesture interpreted as a request for help.

4        “Their gaze was pretty intense,” said Dr Green. “We’ve previously thought only domesticated
          animals try to ask for help with a problem. But kangaroos do it too. If they can’t open the
          box, they look at the human and back to the container. When asking for assistance, some
          approached the human and started scratching at them. Some of the braver ones even used
          their noses to nudge the human,” Dr Green said.

5        Dr Alan McElligott, who is also the lead author of the research, said their study found that
         communication between animals can be learnt and that the behaviour of gazing at humans to
         access food is not related to domestication.

6        “Indeed, kangaroos showed a very similar pattern of behaviour we have seen in dogs, horses
          and even goats when put to the same test,” said Dr McElligott, who previously led a study that
          found goats can understand certain human signals.

7        “Our research shows that the potential for communication towards humans by animals has
          been underestimated. This signals an exciting development in this area,” Dr McElligott added.
         “Kangaroos are the first marsupials to be studied in this manner and the positive results should
          lead to more research into other animals beyond the usual domestic species.”

                                  Why Kids Need to Spend Time
                                           in Nature
         As the suburbs continue to expand, nature is parcelled
         off more, and kids seem less inclined to spend time in a
         fenced-in yard, let alone jump the fence into a neighbor’s
         yard or walk in the woods. Moreover, for kids who are            Non-essential image removed
 5       growing up with multiplayer video games and social
         media accounts, indoor activities can seem more sociable
         and even safer.

         Most studies agree that kids who play outside are happier
         and more attentive. They appear less anxious than kids
10       who spend more time indoors. While it’s unclear how
         mood improvements occur, there are a few things we do know about why nature is good for
         your kids’ minds.

         [ – 28 – ]
         The way that kids play outdoors has a lot less structure than most types of indoor play. There
15       are infinite ways to interact with nature and letting your child choose how they treat nature
         means they have the power to control their own actions.

         [ – 29 – ]
         This unstructured style of play will soon have kids responding to their surroundings. They will
         be able to use their imagination, improvise their own activities, and approach the world in more
20       inventive ways.

         [ – 30 – ]
         Living things die if mistreated or not taken care of properly and entrusting a child to take care of
         the living parts of the environment means they’ll learn what happens when they forget to water
         a plant or pull a flower out by its roots.

25       It presents new possibilities
         Nature may seem less inspiring than your child’s violent video game, but in reality, it activates
         more senses—they can see, hear, smell, and touch outdoor environments. As the young spend
         less and less of their lives in natural surroundings, their senses narrow, and this reduces the
         richness of human experience.

30       It aids well-being
         Most ways of interacting with nature involve more exercise than sitting on the couch. Your kid
                                               –5–                                           8822 – 2240


     doesn’t have to be joining the local soccer team or riding a bike through the park—even going
     for a walk will get their blood pumping.

     It generates curiosity
35   Nature creates a unique sense of wonder for kids that no other environment can provide. The
     phenomena that occur naturally in backyards and parks every day make kids ask questions.

     It replaces indifference with serenity
     In natural environments, we practice an effortless type of attention known as “soft fascination”
     that creates feelings of pleasure and peacefulness, not tiredness and boredom.

40   So, while screen time might be the easier, more popular choice for your children, it’s important
     to set aside time for outdoor play.
