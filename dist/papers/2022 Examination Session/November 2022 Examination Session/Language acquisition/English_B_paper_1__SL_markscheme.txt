Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3
             Basic grammatical structures are used.

             Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
    4–6
             complex structures.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    7–9      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
  10–12
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type, appropriateness
of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

You recently spent time talking with a teenager from a culture different to your own. You found the
experience very rewarding, and you want to express your thanks. Write a text reflecting on your
meeting with your new friend and explaining what you have learned from the conversation.
Email                      Journal                      News report

Criterion B:
• The two required aspects of the task are (i) “reflecting on your meeting with your new friend”
  and (ii) “explaining what you have learned from the conversation”.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to those two elements, but both should be given some
  developed attention. If any aspect is ignored or given only cursory attention (e.g. very brief and
  general or in a single sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded since the task
  has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• Discussion of (i) may include background information about the meeting (e.g. how or where they
  met the teenager), the activities made and/or the ideas discussed. This should be accepted as
  long as they are reflected on and there is some sense of focus on the conversation itself.
• Ideas presented should include at least some cultural aspects, which was interesting/inspiring to
  the writer.
• The text should convey a sense of thanks or gratitude for the experience.
• The two aspects of the question “reflect” and “explain” may be presented in an overlapping
  manner and thus may not be presented separately.

Criterion C:
Choice of text type:
                           Text type        Rationale
Appropriate                Email            The text type is appropriate for sending a personal
                                            communication to a recipient known to the writer (‘new
                                            friend’).
Generally appropriate      Journal          The text type is appropriate for reflection, but would
                                            not communicate those ideas to an external audience.
                                            The choice may be considered “appropriate” if the
                                            response makes clear that they are expressing thanks
                                            for the experience more generally, rather than to the
                                            new friend.
Generally inappropriate    News report      While this text type could describe the meeting and
                                            lessons learned, it would lack the direct personal
                                            connection between writer and reader as it is a mass
                                            media text.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• informal with possibly some semi-formal flashes
• friendly, excited, grateful tone

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

You have read a book whose ideas you believe are very relevant to young adults. Write a text
aimed at schoolchildren aged 11–16 in which you explain the main themes of the book and why
you recommend it as an important and relevant work.

Journal                Review              Speech

Criterion B:
• The two required aspects of the task are (i) “explain the main themes of the book” and (ii) “why
  you recommend it as an important and relevant work”.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to those two elements, but both should be given some
  developed attention. If any aspect is ignored or given only cursory attention (e.g. very brief and
  general or in a single sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded since the task
  has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• “themes” in (i) may be interpreted broadly, beyond a literary understanding of the term, e.g. the
  subject matter, the message etc. It should, however, be more than a retelling of the narrative.
• Ideas in (ii) should be linked to the ways in which the book is important or relevant specifically
  for young adults.
• It is not necessary for the response to explain why the work is important AND relevant, provided
  a general sense of its relevance and importance are conveyed.
• The response may include some shortcomings of the work; however, it should be a positive
  evaluation overall.
• It is expected that the “themes” be plural i.e. there should be at least 2 distinguishable themes
  explained. Still, if there is only one well-developed theme that is effectively explained and
  supported, this should be accepted.

Criterion C:
Choice of text type:
                            Text type     Rationale
Appropriate                 Review        The text type is an appropriate for evaluating a book

Generally appropriate       Speech        While the text type is suitable for informing a large
                                          group of audience, it is not typically used for evaluating
                                          a book. The choice may be considered “appropriate "if it

Generally inappropriate     Journal       The text type is primarily used for personal reflection.
                                          The writer could explain to themselves the main themes
                                          and relevance of the book but would not be able to
                                          communicate these ideas to an external audience.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Task 3

You are unhappy about the level of noise in your neighbourhood, especially late at night or early
in the morning. You want to raise awareness among local people about this. Write a text in which
you describe the problem and suggest something that can be done to address the matter.

News report                    Review                 Speech

Criterion B:
• The two required aspects of the task are (i) “describe the problem” and (ii) “suggest something
  that can be done to address the matter”
• Equal weight does not have to be given to those two elements, but both should be given some
  developed attention. If any aspect is ignored or given only cursory attention (e.g. very brief and
  general or in a single sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded since the task
  has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• Discussion of (i) should identify at least one source of noise in the neighbourhood and describe
  its effects on the population.
• It is expected that the ideas would link principally to something that occurs in the night or in the
  morning, but this is not essential (“especially” at night or early in the morning but not
  exclusively).
• The suggestion(s) in (ii) may relate directly to the source of the noise identified in (i) or relate
  more generally to the overall problem of noise levels. The suggestions may be to eliminate
  noise or to reduce noise levels.

                                             may be considered “appropriate” if the response
                                             covers the task elements (describe and suggest)
                                             through objective reporting and explicitly addresses
                                             ‘local people’.
Generally inappropriate    Review            The text type is typically used to evaluate items and
                                             events. It is not usually used to address a specific
                                             audience about a single issue.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• semi-formal register (with possibly some flashes of formality)
• serious, cautionary and persuasive tone.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.
