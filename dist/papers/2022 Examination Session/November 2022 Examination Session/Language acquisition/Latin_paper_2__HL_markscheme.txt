            • Metaphor to stress the death of queen Amata (lucemque exterrita fugit, 660).
            • Contrast between images of light and darkness referring to life/ death

              hope.
            • Metaphor (strictisque seges mucronibus horret ferrea), emphasizing enemies

Option B — History

Extract 3      Caesar, De Bello Gallico 7.80

3.   (a)    The tactic: the Gauls had scattered archers and infantry among their cavalry
            (inter equites sagittarios expeditosque interiecerant) [1]. Also accept references
            to the motives of these tactics, i.e., to give relief to their retreating troops (suis
            cedentibus auxilio succurrerent) or to hold out against the attack of our cavalry
            (nostrorum equitum impetus sustinerent).
            The result: many Romans were unexpectedly wounded (de improviso vulnerati)
            [1] and left the battle (proelio excedebant) [1].

     (b)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been

     (d)    (Before the battle) either they were eager/anxious (intenti) or they trusted that
            they were superior (esse superiores confiderent) [1]; (afterwards) they retreated
            feeling sad (maesti) or despondent (victoria desperata) [1].

                                                                                                     Total: [10]

Option B — History

Extract 4      Livy Ab Urbe Condita 22.6.8–7.4

4.   (a)    They couldn’t tell whether they were victorious in battle or unconscious of all that
            had been going on behind them [1]; on account of the fog [1].

            promise [1].

     (c)    Livy makes his account credible and engaging through a variety of stylistic
            features. Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any
            point supporting the argument and up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the
            argument: [2] if very coherent and well argued; [1] if coherent and well
            argued; [0] if incoherent and poorly argued or if no details from the text are given.
            Points, which must address the question, may be taken from anywhere in the
            extract. They may include:
            • Accurate numbers of the outcome of the battle (sex milia, quindecim milia,
               decem milia), stressing the objectivity of the discourse.

               address the reader
            • Programmatic statement: explicit claim of using a source contemporaneous to
               the battle (ego... Fabium, aequalem temporibus huiusce belli, potissimum
               auctorem habui), stressing his closeness to the truth.
            • Asyndeton in the enumeration of outcomes of the battle and in the
               enumeration of Hannibal’s actions, highlighting the factual presentation.
            • Contrast: the imprecision of other writers (multiplex… ab aliis/ ego...), in
               contrast with the accuracy of his own discourse.
            • Litotes (haud multo), stressing the difficulty of accepting the defeat by
               Romans.
            • Visual imagery (the fog, the sunrise) to depict vividly the setting of the end of
               the battle.
            • Irony (Punica religione) to depict Hannibal and the Carthaginians as enemies
               incapable of keeping their word.
            • Chiasmus (memorata populi Romani clades) highlighting the exceptional
               nature of the battle in Roman history.

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

            argued; [0] if incoherent and poorly argued or if no details from the text are given.
            Points, which must address the question, may be taken from anywhere in the
            extract. They may include:
            • Metaliterary allusion to the distich elegiac as opposed to the epic hexameter
               (arma gravi numero violentaque bella parabam/ Cupido... surripuise
               pedem).
            • Contrasts/adynata between the different areas and functions of gods and
               goddesses, stressing the differences between elegy and other kinds of poetry
               (quid, si praeripiat flavae Venus arma Minervae ventilet accensas flava
               Minervae faces?; quis probet in silvis Cererem regnare iugosis, lege
               pharetratae virginis arva coli?; Crinibus insignem quis acuta cuspide
               Phoebum/ instruat, Aoniam Marte movente lyram?).

              Phoebus).
            • Apostrophe to Cupid (saeve puer, puer), stressing the conflict of the poet who
              cannot sing a form without the appropriate matter for it.
            • Alliteration (line 11), stressing the musical rhythm of Mars’s lyre.
            • Rhetorical questions of the poet addressing Cupid (quis...?, quid...?, quis...?
              Cur...?, an...?).
            • Repetition (quis, quid, quis), stressing the poet’s indignation to Cupid.
            • Metonymy (aut puer aut longas compta puella comas), representing
              love/lovers as the subject for elegy.
            • Enjambment (parabam/edere), emphasizing the poet’s anxiety to write his
              work.
            • Contrast (gravi numero and numeris levioribus), suggesting the inherent
              seriousness of epic, and the lighthearted nature of elegiac poetry.

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

Option E — Social criticism

Extract 7      Horace, Epodes 16.1–22

7.   (a)    Porsenna was an enemy of Rome (or other relevant historical fact, such as: laid
            siege to the city of Rome, Etruscan king). Do not accept “Etruscan” [1]; the
            reference implies that even the siege of Rome by Porsenna was less dangerous
            than civil war (or similar) [1].

     (b)    Allobrox/the Gauls is/are disloyal in changing situations (infidelis) [1], Germany is
            wild (fera) [1], Hannibal was shameful/accursed to his ancestors (abominatus)
            [1].

     (c)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been

            they become pale (ora pallor inficit); their minds are stunned (or similar)
            (mentes stupent).

     (c)    Horace depicts Rome and the Romans through a range of stylistic features.
            Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point
            supporting the argument and up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the
            argument: [2] if very coherent and well argued; [1] if coherent and well
            argued; [0] if incoherent and poorly argued or if no details from the text are given.
            Points, which must address the question, may be taken from anywhere in the
            extract. They may include:
            • Direct address (scelesti, 1; or scelus 18): blunt/forceful “insult” to bring home
               the Romans’ misconduct.
            • Rhetorical question (quo ruitis? 1), the Romans are eager to act violently.
            • Rhetorical question/metonymy (cur dextris aptantur enses? 1–2),
               misconduct/eagerness.
            • campis atque Neptuno super (3), universal bloodshed: extent of Romans’
               violence.
            • non ut ... dextera (5–10) (with relevant supporting Latin): two just causes of
               war neglected in favour of a self-destructive war: the Romans are foolish or
               wicked.
            • Tricolon ascendens (lupis, leonibus, feris 11–12); litotes (neque dispar 11–
               12), the Romans’ character is equalled to that of dumb/wild animals.
            • Metaphor (furor rapit (13) or caecos (13), or fata Romanos agunt (17)): the
               Romans are presented as out of their minds/crazed.
            • Tricolon (tacent, pallor inficit, mentes stupent 15–16), sudden realization.
            • sacer cruor (20): this bloodshed makes the Romans guilty of sacrilege.

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

Option G — Villains

Extract 10      Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 3.44.1–6

10.   (a)    Award [1] up to [2] for any of the following: he held a high rank / led an honest
             cohort (honestum ordinem); he was of exemplary character (exempli recti); at
             home and in the field (or more literal) (domi militiaeque).

      (b)    Award [1] up to [2] for any of the following answers: he arrested the girl (virgini
             manum iniecit); he claimed that she was of servile status (serva sua natam
             apellans or servamque appellans); he ordered her to follow him (sequique se
             iubebat); he threatened to drag her off if she delayed (cunctantem abstracturum).

      (c)    Livy uses a variety of stylistic devices to portray the characters in this extract,
             aiming to trace a clear opposition between Verginius, Verginia and Icilius on the
             one hand, and Appius Claudius and Marcus Claudius on the other. Accept a range
             of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
             argument and up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument: [2] if very
             coherent and well argued; [1] if coherent and well argued; [0] if incoherent and
             poorly argued or if no details from the text are given. Points, which must address
             the question, may be taken from anywhere in the extract. They may include:
             • Simile/comparison/allusion: between this episode and that of Lucretia, in order
                to stress the seriousness and establish a parallel between the characters
                (haud minus ... quam quod).
             • Contrasting vocabulary to characterize Verginius, Appius / Marcus Claudius
                (honestum ordinem, vir exempli recti, viro acri, expertae virtutis/
                stuprandae libido, amore amens, ad crudelem superbamque vim).
             • Anticipation: Livy starts the episode telling us its outcome and magnitude
                (nefas) and preparing us to identify bad and good characters in the story.
             • Vocabulary of excess applied to Appius Claudius: libido, amens, libidinis, to
                stress the violence of his feelings.
             • Litotes: haud minus, stressing the magnitude of the crime in comparison to
                Lucretia’s.
             • Periphrasis to refer to the maiden (Verginia), stressing her vulnerability and
                passivity (filiam, hanc virginem, virginem, puellae, virgini).
             • Repetition of the word “virgo” to stress the maiden’s innocence.
             • Repetition (serva sua natam servamque) to stress the state of servitude the
                man was forcing on Verginia.

                                                                                                   Total: [10]

                                                Section B

Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:
• use relevant examples from the prescribed passages to support the response (candidates are not
   expected to provide exact quotes)
• demonstrate knowledge of historical, political and cultural contexts beyond those embedded in the
   prescribed passages.

Criterion B (Understanding and argument) assesses how well the response demonstrates understanding
of the chosen option. Ideally, a candidate will:
• build a critical analysis that responds directly to the prompt in a clear, logical and imaginative way
• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
    option.
                                                                                                   Total: [12]

Criterion B: Understanding and argument
• How well does the response demonstrate understanding of the chosen option?
• How well is the argument constructed?

       Marks         Level descriptor

          0          The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

         1–2         The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the chosen option
                     without addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the
                     examples.
                     The argument has limited focus, coherence and development.

         3–4         The response demonstrates limited understanding of the contexts and
                     background knowledge pertinent to the chosen examples.
                     The argument has focus but has limited coherence and is not developed.

         5–6         The response demonstrates an understanding of the chosen option by
                     addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples in a
                     limited way.
                     The argument has focus and coherence but is not developed.
