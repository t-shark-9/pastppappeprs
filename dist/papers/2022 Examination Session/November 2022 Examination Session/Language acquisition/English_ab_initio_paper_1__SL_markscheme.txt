Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is limited
           Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1-2    Basic grammatical structures are used.
           Language contains errors in basic structures. Abundant repetition and inaccuracies
           interfere with meaning.
           Command of the language is generally effective.
           Vocabulary is generally appropriate to the task, and varied.
           Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more complex
    3-4
           structures.
           Language is generally accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
           structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
           Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
           Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    5-6
           A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
           Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message

To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
   • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
   • To what extent are ideas developed?
   • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery
      of the message?

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.

Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

              The register and tone are appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of the task.
              The response fully incorporates the conventions of the chosen text type.


Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type,
appropriateness of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

If candidates indicate their choice of text type but they produce another, examiners must mark the
response based on what they have produced.

 You have decided to keep a record of all the books you read for the next month. Write your first
 text about this project. In your text, explain why you have decided to do this, what you hope to
 achieve, and record the book that you finished today.

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
   • Explain why you have decided to do this, for example:
           o You read an article about how books can influence young people for the better.
           o Your uncle recently gave you his collection of books.
   • Explain what you hope to achieve, for example:
           o You want to pass on book recommendations to your friends.
           o You want to keep track of the books you have read.
   • Record the book you finished today:
           o Give the title of a specific book.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

Generally appropriate       Diary                 The text type is suitable for writing in the first
                                                  person, but is primarily a private text used for
                                                  reflection, rather than offering an explanation,
                                                  which implies another reader.
Generally inappropriate     Speech                The text type is generally inappropriate in that it is
                                                  typically used to communicate a message to a
                                                  specific group of people. The immediacy of the
                                                  final part of the question also means a prepared
                                                  speech is unlikely.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register
• Enthusiastic tone

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

    Your local IT shop is owned by a family friend. He/she has offered to give a discount to students
    at your school who need new IT equipment. Write a text to the family friend to express thanks, to
    explain what IT equipment students need most and when students will come to the shop.

    Letter                        Social media posting                    Speech

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Express thanks, for example:
        o “Thank you for offering a discount...”
• Explain what IT equipment students need most:
             o
             List of relevant equipment such as laptops, tablets; may explain why such items are
             necessary.
•     Explain when students will come to the shop:
             o   Give dates, days or times.

Generally appropriate          Social media     The text type is suitable for communicating a range
                               posting          of messages, but it is not typically written for a single
                                                individual, so letter is more likely.

Generally inappropriate        Speech           The text type is generally inappropriate because it is
                                                typically used to communicate with a group of
                                                people. It would also be of a level of formality
                                                unnecessary for the context/audience.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register
• Friendly tone indicating a personal relationship between sender and receiver

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 3

    Last week you went on a tour of a mountainous region with a guide. You learned a lot and you
    want to tell your geography classmates about the tour. Write a text to explain where you went,
    what you saw, and how it helped your learning about geography.

    Diary                          Social media posting                        Speech

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Say where you went:
        o Name any mountainous area, real or imagined.
• Say what you saw, for example:
         o Any physical features, such as valleys, peaks, volcanic rock...
         o Any land uses of mountainous areas, such as grazing sheep, tourism...
•     Say how the trip helped your understanding of geography, for example:
            o   You studied the Ice Age in class and saw evidence of it on the trip.
            o   You studied the economics of mountain areas in class and saw evidence of this on the
                tour.

Generally appropriate         Social media     The text type is suitable for sharing information with
                              posting          a specific audience, but it lacks the immediacy of the
                                               speech and opportunity for spontaneous interaction.

Generally inappropriate       Diary            The text type is generally inappropriate because it is
                                               typically used for reflection rather than to
                                               communicate information to others.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register.
• Tone is likely to be enthusiastic but it is possible for it to be critical or balanced.

Appropriate                    Report           The text type is suitable for evaluating an experience
                                                objectively, and for sharing this with an individual
                                                who in a professional has an interest in the outcome
                                                (the team leader).
Generally appropriate          Presentation     The text type is suitable for providing an account of
                                                your experiences, but it is less likely to be used for
                                                the context due to the amount of time involved and
                                                the audience’s potential need to appraise many
                                                different similar experiences.
Generally inappropriate        Article          The text type is generally inappropriate because it is
                                                a mass media text, and usually not intended for a
                                                specific audience that has asked for the text.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Closer to formal than semi-formal.
• Respectful and evaluative tone; maybe some humour.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 5

 You believe a change to the length of the school day would be good for students and staff. Write
 a text for the school’s management team to explain what change you recommend and describe
 two or more benefits of the change.

 Email                           Presentation                         Review

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• What change you recommend:
        o Longer or shorter day, probably with suggested times.
• Two benefits, for example:
         o   Increased attention span / effectiveness of learning.
         o   Increased time to devote to subjects / better examination outcomes.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                            Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                 Presentation      The text type is suitable for persuading, or making a
                                              case to, a number of people at the same time. A
                                              presentation also provides the opportunity to explore
                                              the ideas further at the end.
Generally appropriate       Email             The text type is suitable for a range of
                                              communication, including a form of proposal, but it is
                                              typically sent to an individual. It also allows of less
                                              opportunity to explore ideas further, so less suited
                                              than the Presentation.
Generally inappropriate     Review            The text type is generally inappropriate because it is
                                              typically used to address an event that has already
                                              happened.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Formal register.
• Respectful and perhaps enthusiastic tone.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 6

    You recently visited a new cinema in your town or city. Write a text to tell other people in your town
    or city about the cinema. In your text, describe the cinema’s location, your experience when you
    visited it, and whether you recommend it.

    Article                            Email                    Review

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Describe the cinema’s location, for example:
        o In relation to other landmarks in the town or city.
        o In relation to other cultural sites in the town or city.
• Describe your experience of the visit, for example:
        o Positive and negative aspects of the experience: service, food, comfort...
•     Whether you recommend it:
              o   Yes/no or balanced answer acceptable.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                               Text type        Rationale
Appropriate                    Review           The text type is suitable because it is for a mass
                                                audience (people in your town) and relates to an
                                                experience in the past. Further, reviews often focus
                                                on the arts.
Generally appropriate          Article          The text type is suitable for informing a mass
                                                audience but it has more general application than a
                                                review.
Generally inappropriate        Email            This text type is generally inappropriate because it
                                                has a limited distribution and the recipients are
                                                usually known to the writer.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register.
• Evaluative, though not necessarily neutral, tone.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.
