                                                 Section A

1.   (a)   State two features of batch production.                                                  [2]

           Batch production: is the production of a group of identical products (the word
           “batch” refers to the fact that the items in each group go together from one stage
           of production to the next).

           Features of batch production include:
           • identical products are produced in batches;
           • the method is suitable to produce a variety of goods;
           • group of products are produced at one time;
           • one stage of operation is carried out on whole batch and then the whole
             group is passed on to the next stage;
           • same type of machines arranged at one place;
           • the work involves some repetition;
           • batch production often has changeover costs when production shifts from
             one batch to the next.

           Accept any other relevant feature.
           Award [1] for each relevant feature stated up to a maximum of [2].

           No reference to TI needed.

     (b)    For the year ending 31 May 2022:

           (i)    calculate TI’s gross profit (X) (no working required);                            [1]

                  Sales revenue- cost of goods sold
                  =$1000000-$700000 = $300 000
                  Gross profit: $300 000

                  Award [1] for the correct answer. No working required.

                  Do not reward formula only.

                  N.B. accept $300, 300, or 300 000.

           (ii)   construct a fully labelled profit and loss account for TI.                        [3]

                   Profit and loss account for TI for the year ending 31
                   May 2022
                   Sales revenue                          $1 000 000
                   Cost of goods sold                     $700 000
                   Gross profit                           $300 000
                   Expenses                               $200 000
                   Net profit before interest and tax     $100 000
                   Interest                               $22 000
                   Net profit after interest before tax $78 000
                   Tax                                    $20 000
                   Net profit after interest and tax      $58 000

                  N.B. mark from the heading down through net profit after interest and tax. In
                  the spirit of positive marking, disregard anything that follows (such as
                  dividends and retained profit).
                                             –5–                N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           If the profit and loss account is constructed following a generally accepted
           format and is correct in all respects, award [3].

           Award [2] for a largely accurate profit and loss account but with one error of
           mathematics or labelling or two errors of order.

           Award [1] if the candidate shows some understanding of what a profit and loss
           account is, but the actual account constructed is not in a generally accepted
           format and has numerous errors.

           N.B. if the profit and loss account does not have a heading to the effect of “for
           the year ending May 31, 2022,” award a maximum of [2].

           N.B. a heading such as “as of 31 May 2022” or “at 31 May 2022", or one that
           says merely “profit and loss account” (or something to that effect) is
           inaccurate.

(c)   Calculate TI’s current ratio at 31 December 2022 (show all your working).                [2]

      Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
      Current ratio = (cash + debtors + stock)/current liabilities
      Current ratio = ($14 000 + $80 000 + $65 000)/$90 000 = 1.7666666

      Award [2] if the candidate has the correct answer and shows working.

      Award [1] if the candidate makes a mathematical error (thus the answer is incorrect)
      OR if the candidate has the correct answer but does not show working.

      N.B. accept 1.76666, as long as the candidate carries the number out to at least
      three decimal places (1.766)), 1.77, or 1.8 (Allow rounding).

      If the candidate states their answer as 1.76, award [1] because of the rounding
      error.

      Accept, if the candidate shows their working as (14+80+65)/90.

      If the candidate puts a percentage sign after the ratio, the answer is incorrect (the
      candidate may have calculated the ratio correctly and, thus, would get [1] for correct
      working, but they would not get [1] for a correct answer.

      Award no marks merely for writing the formula.

(d)   Using your answer in part (c), comment on the relationship between the changes in
      TI’s current ratio from 2021 to 2022 and the changes in its net profit margin from
      2021 to 2022.                                                                               [2]

      TI’s current ratio fell from 2.1 to 1.77 and its net profit margin declined from 14.8% to
      10.0%. The reduced profitability probably meant lesser profits to retain and
      fund ongoing operations. As a result, TI probably had to contract its current
      asset position, perhaps cash, to support trading activity. The situation might
      reflect an increase in current liabilities (and more interests to pay), another
      approach to make up for the lesser retained earnings.

      Award [1] for some understanding of the possible relationship between the changes
      in TI’s net profit margin and the current ratio from 2021 to 2022.

      If the candidate does not directly and accurately address the relationship between
      the current ratio and the net profit margin but demonstrate some understanding of
      both the current ratio and the net profit margin, award [1].

      Award [2] for a clear explanation.

      N.B. award [0] if the candidate merely restates the decline in the two ratios.
                                                  –7–                 N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.   (a)   Define the term brand awareness.                                                          [2]

           Brand awareness is a marketing term that describes the degree of consumer
           recognition of a product or service by its name, logo or sound.

           N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.
           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [0] marks if the candidate writes a response along the lines of repeating the
           stimulus such as “customers are aware of the brand.”

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding of
           consumer recognition of the product or service.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above and indicates that the consumer recognizes the brand be at least
           one of the following: name, logo or sound.

     (b)   Using Table 2, draw a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for FS for 2022.               [4]

            300               15000        12000         27000        21000         -6000

            600               15000        24000         39000        42000         3000
            700               15000        28000         43000        49000         6000
            800               15000        32000         47000        56000         9000

           Candidates do not need to create the table above – these are the figures for the break-
           even chart.
                                       –8–                  N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Candidates could also calculate the break-even point using this alternative method:

Break-even point (units) = Fixed costs / (Price per bracelet – Variable cost per
bracelet)
Break-even point (units) = $15000 / ($70 - $40) = $15000 / $30 = 500 bracelets
Break-even point ($) = Price per unit x units = $70 x 500 = $35 000; or
Break-even point ($) = Fixed costs + (Variable cost x units) = $15000 + ($40 x 500) =
$35000
Break-even point = 500 bracelets (x-axis) and $35000 (costs/revenues; y-axis)

Award marks as follows:

[1] for a correctly labelled and accurately drawn total revenue (TR) line – can be TR
or revenue (but not “sales” on its own).

[1] for a correctly labelled and accurately drawn total cost (TC) line.

[1] for identifying the break-even point. Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow
pointing to the break-even point and label the arrow. However, accept as an
accurately labelled break-even point a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even
point, provided that the line is labelled “break-even point”.

[1] for correctly labelling BOTH axes – y-axis must have both costs and revenue; x-
axis must have some indication of quantity, e.g. units/quantity/items/bracelets.

A break-even chart that is not neat, not drawn with a straight edge, or is not drawn to
scale can be awarded a maximum of [2] if the total revenue and total cost lines and
axes are all correctly labelled.

If a candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0].

N.B. do not penalize if graph paper is not used. However, drawn diagrams must have
a consistent verifiable scale, otherwise it cannot be determined if TR and TC are
accurate, even if correctly labelled.
                                                –9–              N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Using Table 2, calculate:
      (i)    the profit or loss in 2022 for FS if production and sales increase to 1200 bracelets (show
             all your working);                                                                 [2]
             Profit = Total revenue – total costs
             Profit = 1200 bracelets x ($70) – [$ 15 000 + (1200) x ($40)]
             Profit = $ 84 000 – [$ 15 000 + $ 48 000]
             Profit = $ 84 000 - $ 63 000
             Profit = $ 21 000
             Alternative method:
             Profit = [(Price per bracelet -Variable costs per bracelet) x 1200] - total costs
             Profit = [($70 – $40) x 1200] - $ 15 000
             Profit = [$30 x 1200] - $ 15 000
             Profit = $36 000 - $ 15 000
             Profit = $ 21 000
             Or
             Break-even quantity = 500
             Output beyond break even is 1200 - 500 = 700
             Unit contribution = 70 - 40 = 30
             Profit = 700 x 30 = $21 000
             Award marks as follows:
             [1] If a candidate who has shown working provides a correct procedure (thus,
             demonstrates an understanding of the underlying concepts) but has made an error in
             calculation or the answer does not include $.

             [1] If a candidate does not show any working and simply writes $21 000.

             [2] if a candidate provides the correct answer with working. A correct answer must
             include $.

      (ii)   the price FS would need to charge per bracelet if it sells 800 bracelets and wants to make
             a profit of $10 000. Assume that the costs remain the same (show all your working). [2]

             Target profit = total revenue – total costs
             $ 10 000 = $ 800X – [$ 15 000 + (800 x 40)]
             $ 10 000 = $ 800X – [$ 47 000]
             $ 10 000 + $ 47 000 = 800X
             $ 57 000 = 800X

3.   (a)   State two features of a private limited company.                                              [2]

           A private limited company is a limited company whose shares cannot be sold to the
           general public.

           Features of a private limited company include:
           • incorporated, therefore a separate legal entity whose owners have limited liability;
           • shares are not sold in a public market;
           • restricted number of shareholders, who are usually family and friends;
           • legal continuity;
           • typically better access to finance, at least compared to a sole trader;
           • typically lesser access to finance, at least compared to a public limited company;
           • though laws vary from country to country, in general private limited companies are allowed
             to keep most or all of their financial information confidential.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each relevant feature up to a maximum of [2] marks.
           N.B. no description is required.

     (b)   With reference to TJ, explain one economy of scale and one diseconomy of scale.               [4]

           An economy of scale occurs when, because of growth, a business is able to lower its per unit
           cost of production. Two examples of economy of scale in the stimulus are:
           (1) workers were specializing more than in years past and;
           (2) the firm now buys raw materials in bulk.

           In both instances, TJ can have specialized workers because of the expanded scale of
           operations.

           A diseconomy of scale occurs when, because of growth, a business experiences increased
           per unit cost of production. Two examples of diseconomy of scale in the stimulus are:
           (1) Current work areas are overcrowded and;
           (2) maintenance costs were increasing.

           Because of growth, TJ had to pack an expanded workforce and equipment into the same
           factory, lowering efficiency. Also, because some resources (managerial time and financial
           resources) were devoted to supporting growth, TJ had fewer resources to have a reasonable
           equipment update program.

           Accept any other relevant economy of scale and diseconomy of scale, such as, for a
           diseconomy of scale, overspecialization (though a response based upon overspecialization
           cannot earn an application mark).

           Mark as 2+2

           Award [1] for a clear understanding of one economy of scale and an additional [1] for
           application to the stimulus. Award a maximum of [2].

           Award [1] for a clear understanding of one diseconomy of scale and an additional [1] for
           application to the stimulus. Award a maximum of [2].

           In the definitions, candidates must say something along the lines of “average cost” or “per
           unit.” If they do not, award a maximum of [1] per term.

      application award [1].

(c)   With reference to TJ, explain the relationship between investment, profit and cash
      flow.                                                                        [4]

      At some point in TJ’s past, the business opened its current factory, which required capital
      expenditure, an investment. With this factory, the company was able to manufacture scissors
      and build a steady customer base. Growth appears to have been steady and good, and
      indications, from the net profit margins, that the company was profitable (5.0% NPM in 2021
      and 4.4% in 2022).

      From these profits, the business was able to generate cashflow, which it used to fund growth.
      Eventually, because of growth, the company started to experience diseconomies of scale and,
      thus, the NPM fell in 2022. To rectify this situation, the company now needs to make a new
      investment, either to build a second factory or to build a new large factory and sell the old one.

      Without that investment, sales growth will eventually stall (TJ will be at its maximum capacity)
      and have inefficient operations. As its NPM continues to fall, competitors will have a pricing
      advantage and could start pulling TI’s customers away. Already, the industry average NPM is
      1.6% higher than TJ’s. When that happens, sales will fall, profits will fall, and cash flow will
      worsen.

      Award [1] for some understanding of the terms investment, profit, and cashflow.

      Award [2] if the candidates also demonstrates some understanding of the relationship
      between the three words but does not apply to the stimulus.

      Award [3] if the candidates knows the three terms, understands their relationship, and applies
      the concepts to the stimulus. with a clear explanation.

      Award [4] if the candidates knows the three terms, understands their relationship, applies the
      concepts to the stimulus. with a clear explanation, and refers to some of the financial
      figures to give concreteness to their response.

(d)   Recommend whether TJ should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                     [10]

      Option 1 (Keep the current factory and build a second one in Mexico):

      The advantages include:
      • a smaller capital investment compared to building one new large factory;
      • the new factory will be located near a potentially large and profitable market, and that
        geographic proximity will probably give some potential customers some comfort knowing
        that shipping distance will be lower and potentially less complicated. Though students are
        not expected to know this fact, they might refer to the fact that Mexico is one of the United
        States’ top trading partners;
      • the overall cost of the investment is lower.

      The disadvantages include:
      • though the construction will eliminate some diseconomies of scale, it will introduce new
        other ones;
      • TI has never operated a facility in Mexico, so the company lacks extensive first-hand
        knowledge of the local market conditions, laws, and customs;
      • more difficult to coordinate/manage.

      Option 2 (Build a new factory):

      The advantages include:
      • all operations will be at one site, which means there does not have to be duplication of
        plant management and few planning and organizational costs;
      • all of TI’s operations will be brand new, built-for-purpose, with modern equipment.

      The disadvantages include:
      • the capital investment is substantial higher to build one new large factory;
      • TI’s owners would have to sell some additional shares, which will lead to dilution of
        ownership;
      • selling old industrial sites is difficult and often the actual sales price is lower than
        forecasted.

      Accept any other relevant advantages and disadvantages.

      N.B. Judgments include:
      • choosing Option 1, if justified.
      • choosing Option 2, if justified.
      • assuming that the uptick in sales to the North American market was not permanent, and
        looking for a less costly way (than Option 1 or Option 2) to meet short-term demand
        variability, such as subcontracting.
      • expanding the existing factory, but on a lesser scale than suggested in Option 1.

      Accept other relevant judgments, if justified.

4.   (a)   Define the term equity.                                                                      [2]

           Equity is the measure of value that the owners have in the company or business. It is
           calculated by:
                      a. subtracting all debts from total assets, or
                      b. adding share capital and accumulated retained earnings

           An alternate definition is something along the lines of “Equity finances assets or is used to pay
           off liabilities” and then the candidate provides one of the two ways above to calculate equity.

           Candidates are not expected to use the exact wording above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys a partial understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer
           above.

           N.B. If a candidate merely states the correct way equity is calculated but otherwise offers no
           other definition, award [1]. No application required. Do not credit examples.

           N.B. if a candidate writes something like “It shows how much a company would have if they
           liquidated all their assets,” do not accept. Unless a company has substantial “hidden
           equity,” typically in real estate, rarely will the results of a liquidation equal the book
           value equity of a going concern.

     (b)   With reference to the new residents of Uisge, explain one advantage for employees of
           teleworking.                                                                      [2]

           Advantages of teleworking include:
           • less expensive for employees (savings of fuel, vehicle maintenance and parking), as they
             do not have to drive to Glasgow every day; if a candidate explains this point, they must
             state "Glasgow" to get the application mark.
           • not commuting saves time, which may allow people to spend more time with their families.
             Many of the people moving to Uisge are in “young families”.greater employee satisfaction.
             Commuting less frequently to work, employees can enjoy Uisge’s slower paced life, one of
             the reasons they moved there in the first place.
           • cheaper housing is available in Uisge compared to Glasgow.
           • eliminates the need to relocate.

           N.B. “If a candidate says teleworking is convenient” but offers no explanation as to why, award
           [1].

           Accept any other relevant advantage.

           Award [1] for an identifying or describing of an advantage with or without application.

           Award [1] for explanation of an advantage with no application.

           Award [2] for explanation of an advantage and application.

           If a candidate states a generic advantage with no possible reference to the stimulus, such as
           higher productivity from home (which is also an advantage to their employer) or
           convenience, award a maximum of [1].
                                            – 15 –                 N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      N.B. Teleworking is not the same thing as flexible working schedule. Many teleworkers
      are at their home work stations the same hours they are when working at their employer’s
      offices.

      Maximum award: [2].

(c)   Explain three possible reasons for the decline of sales at SSG.                            [6]

      Possible reasons that SSG’s sales revenue is falling include:
      • People are attracted to MM because of their lower prices than SSG.
      • New residents to Uisge do not have the same brand awareness and loyalty to SSG than
        long-established residents. Without that awareness and loyalty, they may be buying
        sporting goods in stores in Glasgow or, after MM opened, at MM.
      • Many consumers, and in all likelihood the new residents who are proficient in modern
        computer technologies (as they telework), are ordering sporting goods from online
        retailers.
      • MM sells many types of products other than sporting goods, including groceries,
        clothing, hardware, and electronics. Consumers may find it convenient that they can
        shop for a variety of needs, including sporting goods, at MM and not have to make a
        dedicated trip to SSG.

      Accept any other relevant and plausible explanation.

      Mark as 2 + 2 + 2

      Award [1] for an identification or description of a reason with or without application.

      Award [1] for explanation of a reason with no application.

      If a candidate states a generic advantage with no possible reference to the stimulus, award a
      maximum of [1].

      Maximum award [6].

(d)   Evaluate the two options that Douglas is considering (Option 1 and Option 2).             [10]

      Douglas really does not have very good options.

      Option 1: Given MM’s price advantage, SSG is unlikely ever to compete genuinely in terms
      of price. Further, lowering prices, reducing staff, and operating more leanly could very well
      undermine SSG’s branded identity of excellent service. Customer loyalty will erode, and
      then MM’s USP, incredibly low prices, will further hurt SSG.

      The advantage of this option is that the future is unknown. MM has not been successful in
      every market it has entered. If MM is unsuccessful, this cost-cutting, lean-operating
      approach may get SSG through a few difficult years. If MM then withdraws from the
      market, SSG can return to being the excellent-customer-service store for which it is
      known.

      Option 2: The disadvantage of this option is that the large chain is offering to buy SSG for
      well below its book value. The chain has clearly factored in the impact that MM will have on
      SSG’s future income streams and has discounted them accordingly.
                                      – 16 –              N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The advantage of selling the business now is that the Stewart family can get £1 100 000
equity out of the business. If SSG stays in business and does not sell to the large chain,
possibly the increased competition will lead the business to start making losses, in which
case the equity position will erode and could eventually leave the Stewart family with little to
no value. Selling the business now guarantees that the family at least gets something.

5.   (a)   State two characteristics of a niche market.                                                 [2]

           Niche market is a well-defined segment of a market with consumers in that market having
           specific characteristics.

           Characteristics include:
           • is made up of that segment of consumers within the larger market place, who possess a
             common demographic, purchasing behaviour and lifestyle.
           • segment likely to be very small compared to the market as a whole.
           • it has its own distinctive set of needs, preferences, or identity, making it unrelated from the
             traditional market.
           • it often gives firms the opportunity to deliver goods and/or services that target the audience,
             and to build a competitive position in the market to defend against new entrants.
           • products or services are often tailormade hence able to charge higher prices.
           • products are generally more expensive than products for a mass market.
           • customer loyalty tends to be higher than in a mass or large market.

           N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

           Accept any other relevant characteristic.

           Award [1] for each relevant characteristic stated up to a maximum of [2]. An example is not
           necessary but may help to clarify a definition.

     (b)   Explain two methods that MM could use to reduce its labour turnover.                  [4]

           Methods include:
           • MM could change the pay structure, allowing for increases in pay, providing opportunities
             for bonuses, or offering fringe benefits (perks) to prevent employees from going to
             competitors who offer better salaries. In 2021, 3 people gave pay as a reason for leaving.
           • MM could be creative with low-cost rewards, such as flexible work hours, employee
             discounts, etc.
           • MM could create new posts with promotion in mind, that way employees become aware of
             career progress opportunities. In 2021, 2 people gave lack of promotion as a reason for
             leaving.
           • MM could recruit internally for vacant senior posts, that way employees know that they have
             a chance of promotion provided they meet qualifications. Application similar to above.
           • MM could invest in training, which subsequently could help promote career opportunities
             and professional advancement (as stated above), given that according to the table
             employees left for a more interesting job. This training is likely to be needed if MM
             transitions to more complex keyboards with additional features.
           • MM could make job more interesting by proceeding with the change marketing strategy
             which would involve moving from batch to job production methods. In 2021 5 people gave
             being offered a more interesting job as a reason for leaving.
           • MM could provide meaningful feedback in appraisals of employees so that they feel
             respected and seen (no opportunity for an application mark if a candidate expresses this
             idea.

           N.B. regarding application, candidates must use wording from the stimulus or directly
           and explicitly link the response to the stimulus. For example, if a candidate says “offer
           better pay” they have not applied that response to the stimulus. Thus, they receive [1]. If the
           candidate says “MM could offer better pay, as 3 employees left last year because of higher
           pay offered by a competitor,” they have linked the response to the stimulus.

      Further, if a candidate writes that “MM should motivate its employees” or “improve motivation,”
      even if they name a theorist, this response is not enough. They must correctly specify a
      method to reduce labour turnover.

      Finally, if a candidate cites from the table in the stimulus with no precise and appropriate
      method, award [0].

      Accept any other relevant method.

      Mark as 2 + 2

      For [2], candidates must identify a method, explain it, and apply it to the stimulus up to a
      maximum of [4].

(c)   Explain two ways in which MM’s profits could be affected by changing from batch production
      to job/customized production.                                                     [4]

       Answers should reflect the idea that profits are determined by (revenues – costs) and that
       either element could be affected.
       Ways include:
       • smaller volumes are likely to be produced. This could lead to lower incomes, and
          possibly lower profits but that depends on the price relative to home/school sales. It states
          that these individually produced items could be sold at a much higher price. The profits
          also depend on what happens to costs;
      • the per unit cost is likely to increase because (1) in general it is cheaper per unit to produce
          with batch production than by job production and (2) the new keyboards will be more
          complex. Whether this increases or decreases profits will depend on price;
       • the change in production method leads to increased costs (hiring skilled workers,
          training existing workers etc.) which would have a downward impact on profits;
       • the change in production method is also likely to be more time consuming hence adding to
          production costs, However, this may not affect profits adversely if higher prices negotiated
          in advance offset this cost increase;
       • the marketing strategy is likely to be different. The new market is much more of a niche
          market and easier to target so may cost less. Price is less likely to be a key element of the
          strategy giving the opportunity for higher prices negotiated in advance with musicians.
          These suggest a reduction in marketing costs and a possible increase in profits.

      Accept any other relevant influence on profits.

      N.B. answers must reflect the impacts specifically on profits NOT just on costs.

      Accept any other relevant influence on profits.

      Mark as 2 + 2

      Award [1] for each influence on profits and an additional [1] for an explanation of the influence
      in context. Award a maximum of [2] per influence.

      Maximum award overall: [4].

(d)   Discuss the impact on MM’s marketing mix if MM changes its target market to
      professional musicians.                                                   [10]

      Price:
      • current price is set low and aimed at consumer market via shops and contracts with
         schools. Likely to be a standard price, as low as possible;
      • new price is negotiated. Likely to be different for each professional musician customer,
         depending on the specification. Likely to be much higher due to the uniqueness of each
         product and its complexity relative to existing market;
      • change is from standard process to negotiated, custom prices – more work and skills;
      • it is not known whether the new niche market is competitive. If so, this may affect the
         degree of flexibility with pricing.

      Place:
      • currently distributed through third party retail outlets or through direct supply to
         schools. The requirements of these customers remain fairly constant;
      • new arrangements will be sales direct to the customer. MM lacks experience in this type
         of marketing where customers often have varied requirements meaning MM need to be
         constantly aware of market changes;
      • change is from mixed retailer/direct to all direct so some skills already.

      Promotion:
      • currently likely to be done by retail outlets with the addition of the free training packages.
        Currently, MM probably relies mostly on below-the-line (BTL) promotion and that is unlikely
        to change, though it may switch to different types of BTL promotion. Promotion to schools
        may be done through personal contact or through educational exhibitions, conferences,
        etc.;
      • new promotion could be through musical publications or direct contact. Mass methods
        of promotion wasteful and not appropriate. Overall effect could be to lower promotion costs;
      • change is to in house rather than relying on others. However, this may involve hiring staff
        with specialist knowledge adding to costs.

      Product:
      • currently a standard design, fairly simple in terms of standard features. Appearance may
        be less important to the current target market. This may enable MM to save on finishing
        costs;
      • changing to a tailor-made product with customized features. Musicians likely to each
        have the owned demands in terms of appearance and features. Lack of standardization of
        the product however may increase costs of customized production but may well be offset by
        higher prices.

      People:
      • currently, MM has 50 employees, and some of them have left in search of better
        opportunities. MM should find out if there is a skills gap to implement the change they have
        in mind. Those staff involved directly with musicians will need to understand the specific
        needs of this type of customer. Dealing with schools was likely a much simpler task.
        Rectifying any skills gap through training or external hiring may prove expensive. However,
        job production may prove more motivating to staff and hence reduce the high cost of labour
        turnover.
                                        – 20 –             N22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Process:
• MM should find out if there are any internal barriers in the way to delivering the best
  customer value at the time of changing the product design by adding the range of different
  sound features and improving the appearance of the keyboards. This will depend on how
  MM interact with musicians during the design part of the process.


Physical evidence:
• how does MM reassure the customers? Are MM staff well-trained? Will they continue to
  offer free online courses? Does MM offer a place where professional musicians can come
  and try/test the products?

The overall judgment is that no element of the marketing mix will remain unchanged and that
MM will have to take on more responsibility for its own marketing and develop some skills.
Also, the transition to the new market will not happen overnight, hence, MM will need to run
two complimentary marketing strategies alongside each other for an undetermined period of
time. This could lead to a lot of marketing confusion regarding where their priorities lie.

A conclusion with judgment is expected.

Candidates do not have to address the extended marketing mix, which is higher level only.
However, if a candidate does address a P in the extended marketing mix, accept.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further guidance below.

N.B. the marks listed in the left column are maximum awards. Candidates could technically
have a response that addresses two Ps in a balanced way yet still lacks the depth, precision,
or application for [4] (for example). In other words, use the table below as a guideline but also
make some holistic judgment about the quality of the response.

                                                        arguments made and has more
                                                        than a nominal conclusion.
