Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Explain why the existence of positive externalities of consumption would lead to
             allocative inefficiency and thus a welfare loss.                                         [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: Positive externalities, consumption externalities, welfare loss,
               allocative inefficiency.
             • Diagrams: A diagram to show positive externalities in consumption and the
               welfare loss associated with the free market level of output.
             • Theory: An explanation that because there are positive externalities of
               consumption, a welfare loss exists, where the marginal social benefit exceeds
               the marginal social cost at levels of output up to the point where marginal
               social benefits are equal to marginal social costs. The socially optimum level
               of output would be greater than the level of output provided by a free market.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the policies a government might adopt to
      respond to a market situation in which significant asymmetric information exists.    [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: Asymmetric information, adverse selection, moral hazard.
      • Diagram: Not needed for this question.
      • Theory: Candidates should consider government responses to markets in
        which asymmetric information is considered problematic such as legislation
        and regulation, the provision of information. Candidates might also consider
        private responses such as signalling and screening where a government
        decides not to intervene.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): An evaluation of the different policies available to the
        government when there is asymmetric information in the context of the
        examples offered by the candidate. Candidates might conclude that the best
        course of government action is to do nothing and allow private responses to
        the asymmetric information. Or, alternatively, that government action in certain
        situations may be imperative.
      • Example(s): A relevant real-world example(s) in which asymmetric information
        exists.

               debt.
             • Diagrams: Candidates might use an AD/AS diagram to illustrate changes in

               diagram.
             • Theory: An explanation of how government debt might be measured as a
               percentage of GDP. Candidates may also explain how a budget deficit is
               related to government (national) debt. Candidates might explain sustainable
               debt in terms of servicing costs, credit ratings and how future taxation and
               government spending might be impacted by debt and whether these are
               sustainable.

        trade-off revealed by the short-run Phillips curve and the lack of a trade-off
        indicated by the long run Phillips curve in which the economy is assumed to

3.     (a)   Explain how a free trade area is different from a common market.                         [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: Free trade area, common market.
             • Diagrams: Candidates may answer the question without the use of diagrams,
               but they might decide to devise a diagram using for example a Venn diagram
               to help explain the difference.
             • Theory: An explanation that a free trade area is an agreement between two or
               more countries to reduce or remove tariffs and other barriers to trade between
               them. A common market is a level of economic integration in which countries
               share common external barriers to trade. Between members there are no
               controls on the movement of goods and services and there is freedom of
               movement for the factors of production.
