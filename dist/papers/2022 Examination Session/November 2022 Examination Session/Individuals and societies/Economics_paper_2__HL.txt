Answer one question.

1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Overview of Tanzania

     1   Tanzania is one of Africa’s fastest growing economies with an average of 7 % annual economic
         growth since 2000. It is a politically stable country, rich in wildlife and natural resources.
         However, the growth has been concentrated in urban manufacturing, using capital intensive
         production. The benefits from this growth have not reached all people and significant
         inequalities exist between urban and rural areas. Although the relative poverty rate has fallen
         over the last 15 years, the number of people living in absolute poverty has increased.

     2   Most people are employed in the slow-growing agricultural sector that relies on unskilled
         labour. Although incomes increased from 2008 to 2018, the demand for agricultural goods
         only increased by 21 % during this time period. Over 70 % of Tanzania’s population lives in
         rural areas, relying on subsistence farming with limited tradable crops. Only 30 % of land is
         being used for agricultural production. With investment, the remaining unused land could be
         developed and generate income for farmers.

     3   The rural sector struggles to meet Tanzania’s food requirements due to low levels of skilled
         labour and productivity. Additionally, high youth unemployment leads to large numbers of
         unskilled rural youth migrating to the cities, often finding employment in the informal sector
         where wages and working conditions are poor. Insufficient investment and lack of government
         support for diversifying the agriculture sector have been blamed for the persistent inequalities
         and poverty.

     4   Tanzania’s cities have experienced a growing middle class with strong purchasing power and
         political influence who have placed demands on the government for cheaper electricity, better
         infrastructure, and more imported goods. In response, the government provided subsidies for
         electricity in city centres and tax benefits to foreign companies operating in Tanzania. There is
         concern that these measures may worsen inequality and lead to social unrest.

     5   The growth of Tanzania’s manufacturing and service sector was funded through aid and large
         government borrowing, resulting in high national debt. Most of the government borrowing was
         from foreign sources and in US dollars (US$), which is a concern due to a recent depreciation of
         the Tanzanian shilling (Tanzania’s currency) against the US$. Some of the debt was borrowed
         domestically and placed upward pressure on interest rates. Higher interest rates have resulted
         in crowding out but helped keep inflation under control.

Text B — Strategies and opportunities for Tanzania

   1    Previous governments have used interventionist supply-side policies to improve access to
        water, education, and health services. However, the health service improvements are not
        keeping up with population growth and many young people are still not completing secondary
        school. Infrastructure has improved, but it is still insufficient as producers in the rural sector find
        it difficult to reach markets and access supplies.

   2    Aid organizations are currently supporting new sustainable businesses in rural areas through
        training programmes, especially for women and young people, who make up most of the
        unemployed in rural areas. Economists have advised the government to improve access to
        credit through microfinance organizations and to simplify regulations to make it easier to start
        new businesses.

   3    The government is establishing property rights in rural areas to provide security for farmers.
        Historically, farmers could easily lose their land, which reduced their incentive to invest in
        productive farming methods. The government wants to develop Tanzania’s land resources and
        lower its reliance on imported food. To reduce food imports, a subsidy will be granted to dairy
        farmers to allow them to compete against imported dairy products.

   4    Tanzania is a member of the East African Community (EAC) customs union and common
        market. However, Tanzania needs to improve human capital and encourage diversification so
        that the benefits of regional integration can reach the poor. These policies can also help attract
        foreign direct investment (FDI). Opportunities for growth through trade will expand as the EAC
        works towards becoming a monetary union in 2024.


Text C — Oil pipeline to be constructed

        Tanzania and Uganda plan to construct a major oil pipeline from Uganda through Tanzania,
        ending at a port in Tanzania. This will attract FDI which could help fund infrastructure and
        generate jobs. However, environmentalists are concerned about potential ecological damage
        due to the waste created during the construction of the pipeline. Economists have suggested
        the waste could be avoided through a circular economy approach in the planning and
        construction stage.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Lebanon

     1   Lebanon is in the Middle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, and is home to nearly
         7 million people. Lebanon is in an economic crisis, facing a recession, huge government debt
         and rising income inequality, poverty and inflation. Corruption and poor governance have been
         blamed for misallocation of funds that has led to low levels of investment and extensive capital
         flight. Additionally, Lebanon has one of the most unequal distributions of wealth in the world. In
         2019, the top 10 % of income earners owned over 70 % of personal wealth in Lebanon.

     2   Infrastructure in Lebanon is poor, water and sewerage systems are basic, and roads are
         inadequate. Electricity supply is unreliable with people going without power for much of the day.
         In 2020, major buildings including food storage buildings, schools and hospitals were damaged
         in Beirut (the capital city of Lebanon). This was concerning as 85% of the country’s food arrives
         through Beirut. Fortunately, humanitarian aid was given by the international community to help
         rebuild the damaged buildings.

     3   Despite a history of inflows from luxury tourism and remittances (money sent by a foreign
         worker to their home country), there is a persistent current account deficit. To help with this,
         the Lebanese central bank has used high interest rates to attract financial inflows. Additionally,
         the government has borrowed funds from overseas. However, the misuse of these funds
         and overspending have contributed to one of the highest foreign debts in the world. Lebanon
         recently defaulted on foreign debt repayments worth 1.2 billion euros, which damaged its
         international credit rating, making it difficult to access loans needed to help solve its current
         economic problems.


Text E — Further challenges facing Lebanon

     1   Social unrest is prevalent and intensified when the government suggested raising revenue by
         imposing an indirect tax on social media applications such as WhatsApp. As the government
         struggles to pay its debts, people are concerned that subsidies on necessities such as wheat,
         medicine and fuel will be removed.

     2   Mismanagement of the state-run electricity and telecommunications sectors has resulted in
         unreliable services and high telecommunication prices. The state-run monopoly firms make
         losses, and the electricity sector relies heavily on government subsidies, putting pressure on the
         budget deficit.

     3   Lebanon currently has a managed exchange rate system with the Lebanese pound (Lebanon’s
         currency) linked to the US dollar (US$). However, the government is finding it difficult to
         maintain the exchange rate at the desired level due to insufficient reserve assets. Recent
         falling remittances, low levels of exports and lack of foreign direct investment (FDI) are placing
         downward pressure on the Lebanese pound. Lebanon has limited natural resources and a
         small manufacturing industry, thus relies heavily on imports. As a consequence, the gradual
         depreciation of the Lebanese pound has led to cost-push inflation.

(Question 2 continued)

Text F — Reforms and strategies for economic recovery

   1   The Lebanese government is seeking help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to
       restructure the government debt and develop its infrastructure. However, loans from the IMF will
       require the following conditions to be met:
       y procedures and processes established to ensure good governance, including enforcement of
          anti-corruption laws
       y financial sector reforms implemented to build confidence in the banking system and laws to
          control capital flight
       y government spending reduced and revenue increased through higher corporate, wealth and
          personal income taxes for high-income earners. Introduction of a tax on imported luxury
          goods and an increase of indirect taxes
       y partially privatizing the electricity and telecommunications sectors to increase efficiency and
          encourage the exploration of new energy sources
       y transitioning from a managed to a floating exchange rate system.

   2   Other organizations are offering development aid to rebuild infrastructure and support small to
       medium-sized businesses to develop the manufacturing sector and attract FDI. Currently, the
       manufacturing sector accounts for only 12.5 % of gross domestic product (GDP). Some experts
       recommend that Lebanon decreases its reliance on food imports by developing its own food
       industry. However, Lebanon must commit to establishing good governance systems before aid
       organizations will provide their support.

   3   Lebanon has resisted seeking help from the IMF and other agencies in the past due to concerns
       about high levels of interference and imposed conditions that may conflict with their own
       government objectives.
