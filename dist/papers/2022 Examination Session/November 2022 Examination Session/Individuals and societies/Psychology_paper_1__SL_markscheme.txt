                                          Section A
Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Describe one study related to genetics and behaviour.                                           [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one study
     related to genetics and behaviour.

     The description of the study should include the aim, procedure, results, and conclusions of
     the study.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:

     •   Bailey and Pillard (1991) on genes and sexuality
     •   Bouchard et al. (1990) on the relationship between genes and intelligence
     •   Caspi et al. (2003) on the relationship between the 5-HTT gene and depression
     •   Caspi et al. (2002) on the “warrior gene” and anti-social behaviour
     •   Gilbertson (2002) on genes, hippocampal size and PTSD
     •   Holland (1988) on genes and anorexia
     •   Kendler (2006) on genes and depression
     •   Kendler and Prescott (1998) on genes and drug addiction
     •   Tobi et al. (2018) The Dutch Hunger Winter study - genes, stress, and obesity
     •   Wedekind (1995) on the relationship between genes, the immune system, and mate
         selection.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If the candidate describes or explains the link between genetics and behaviour, but does not
     describe an appropriate study, award up to a maximum of [4].
                                                 –5–                N22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   With reference to one relevant study, describe the influence of emotion on one
     cognitive process.                                                                             [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of the influence
     of emotion on one cognitive process with reference to one relevant study.

     Responses may focus on any cognitive process that is affected by emotion such as
     perception, memory or decision making.

     Appropriate research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Bechara et al. (1999); Denes-Raj and Epstein (1994) studies of emotion and decision-
       making
     • Brown and Kulik (1977); Neisser and Harsch (1992) studies of flashbulb memory
     • Nutt and Lam (2011); Overton (1964) studies of state-dependent memory

     If a candidate addresses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to the
     first cognitive process described.

     If a candidate addresses the influence of emotion on one cognitive process without including
     a relevant study, a maximum of [5] should be awarded for the response.

     If a candidate describes a relevant study but does not describe the influence of emotion on
     one cognitive process, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.
                                                  –6–                N22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   Describe one effect of stereotypes on behaviour with reference to one relevant study.             [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one effect of
     stereotypes on behaviour with reference to one relevant study.

     Effects of stereotypes on behaviour and relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • the influence of recall (Allport and Postman, 1947; Cohen, 1981; Martin and Halverson,
        1983)
     • the effect on academic performance (Spencer et al., 1977; Steele and Aronson, 1995;
        Shih et al., 2002)
     • the effect of priming elderly stereotype on walking speed (Bargh et al., 1996)
     • misdiagnosis in mental health (Zhang, 1998).

     If a candidate describes more than one effect, credit should be given to the description of the
     first effect.

     If a candidate describes one effect of stereotypes on behaviour without making reference to
     a relevant study, up to a maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate describes a relevant study but does not describe one effect of stereotypes on
     behaviour, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1     Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2     Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.

B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

   3–4   The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

   5–6   The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                 N22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


          Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves to
   1–2
          repeat points already made.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
   3–4
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
   5–6
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                 N22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


         There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
   1–2
         discussion, if present, is superficial.

         The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
   3–4
         most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

         The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
   5–6
         and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

         The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
    1
         the response.

    2    The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                                Section B
4.   Discuss the effect(s) of one or more pheromones on behaviour.                                   [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review on the
     influence of one or more pheromones on behaviour.

     Candidates may address the effect of pheromones in relation to specific aspects of
     behaviour or address behaviour in general. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may address the ambiguity of research into pheromones and include research
     that shows a lack of evidence for their existence or they may argue for their existence. Both
     approaches are acceptable.

     Relevant research may include but is not limited to:
     • Mishor et al. (2021) on the role of pheromones in aggression in humans
     • Lundstrom and Olsson (2005); Hare et al. (2017); Zhou et al. (2014); Saxton et al.’s
       (2008) studies on the effects of androstadienone on women's attraction to men and
       assignment of gender figures
     • Cutler's (1998) study on sexual behaviour in men
     • Wedekind et al. (1995) investigating mate preference
     • Doucet et al.’s (2009) study on maternal behaviour.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • to what extent pheromones have an effect on human behaviour
     • how the findings of the research have been interpreted and applied
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • the value of animal research.

     Animal research may be used to describe the effect of pheromones but the response must
     then be linked to human behaviour. If there is no explicit link to human behaviour the
     response should be awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking.
                                                  – 11 –               N22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Evaluate one or more models of memory.                                                             [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of one or more models of memory.

     Relevant models may include, but are not limited to:
     • Levels of processing model
     • Multi-Store Model of Memory
     • Working Memory Model
     • Flashbulb memory theory
     • Schema theory.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Baddeley and Hitch’s (1974) studies on the evidence of working memory
     • Craik and Tulving’s (1975) study of the Levels of Processing Model
     • Peterson and Peterson (1959) on the role of rehearsal and memory consolidation
     • Murdock’s (1962) or Glanzer and Cunitz’s (1966) studies on the serial position effect
     • Studies of brain damage to support the theory: Milner’s (1966) study of HM; Warrington
       and Shallice’s (1974) study of KF
     • Bartlett’s (1932) study of the role of schema on memory storage
     • Brown and Kulik’s (1977) study of flashbulb memory.

     Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
     • assumptions made by the model
     • the difficulty of testing the whole model
     • cultural considerations
     • measurement of constructs (eg surprise, rehearsal, schema)
     • contradictory evidence or characteristics of memory that are not addressed by the model
     • the strengths and limitations of the evidence to support the model

     Candidates may evaluate one model to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may evaluate
     more than one model to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should
     be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.
                                                – 12 –               N22/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss one or more effects that enculturation has on human cognition and/or behaviour.        [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one or
     more effects enculturation has on human cognition and/or behaviour.

     Enculturation is defined as the process by which people learn the necessary and appropriate skills
     and norms in the context of their culture.

     Candidates may address the effects of enculturation in relation to cognitive aspects and/or
     behaviour. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Relevant effects of enculturation may include, but are not limited to:
     • Effects on parenting behaviours: Fagot et al. (1974); Barry (1959)
     • Effects on memory: Demorest et al (2008) on musical memory; Martin and Halvorson
       (1983) on reconstructive memory; Kearins (1981) on memory strategies among
       indigenous Australians
     • Effects on conformity: Berry and Katz (1967)
     • Effects on impulsivity: Lamm et al.’s (2017) marshmallow study of self-control in German
       vs Cameroonian children; Chen et al.’s (2005) study of online shopping behaviour.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • methodological limitations in measuring and testing the effects of enculturation
     • the inability to establish a cause-and-effect relationship
     • ecological and internal validity of research
     • ethical considerations in investigating enculturation
     • areas of uncertainty – eg the inability to account for individual difference.

     Candidates may discuss one or a small number of potential effects of enculturation on
     human cognition and/or behaviour in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may
     discuss a larger number of potential effects of enculturation on human cognition and/or
     behaviour in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.
