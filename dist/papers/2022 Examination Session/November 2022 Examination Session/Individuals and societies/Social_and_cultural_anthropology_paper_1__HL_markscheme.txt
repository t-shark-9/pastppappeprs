The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of responses we
may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible answers should be
appropriately rewarded if relevant.

                                                Section A
1.   Define the term gender and describe how it is understood and applied in the context of
     the passage.                                                                                      [4]

     This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and
     understanding of the term “gender” and apply it in relation to the text. Candidates may
     write in terms of any of the following guidelines, but other definitions or applications will
     also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the passage.

     Possible ways of defining the term:
     • as a constitutive element of social relations based on culturally constructed
       distinctions relating to sex
     • as a fundamental way of signifying power relations, with reference to hegemonic
       masculinity
     • in relation to inequality and distribution of status, resources, values
     • as a category of analysis that rejects biological determinism
     • In relation to gender roles or performance, gender expression, gender identity or
       gender socialization
     • In relation to Judith Butler’s theory.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples of description and application:
     • Hegemonic masculinity in regard to white, middle-class males
     • Hipster challenges to this
     • Gender fluidity
     • Multiple masculinities
     • Gender in relation to sexualities.

     Other appropriate applications should be credited.

          1–2        The response demonstrates a basic knowledge and understanding of the
                     concept.
                     There is a partial application of the concept in relation to the text.
          3–4        The response demonstrates sound knowledge and understanding of the
                     concept; the concept is described in detail.
                     The concept is clearly applied in relation to the text.

2.   Analyse the ethnographic data presented in the passage using the concept of society.           [6]

     This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
     ethnographic text using the key concept of society to help make sense of the
     ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
     understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the
     context of the passage, developing an analysis with reference to the ethnographic data
     of the extract.

     Possible ways of defining the key concept:
     • The organization of people into groups and networks and interrelationships
     • Also sustained by social relations and institutions, norms, values, statuses, and roles
     • Groups with some coherence that distinguish themselves from other groups.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples and ways of analysing:
     • Hipsters as a distinct social group/subculture
     • Social class
     • Social norms (career, family)
     • Social networks (hipsters, family)
     • In relation to conflict and social conformity
     • Race/ethnicity
     • Structure and agency
     • Friendship/kinship.

     Other appropriate examples and ways of analyzing should be credited.

        Marks       Level descriptor
          0         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
         1–2        The response offers a common-sense or superficial understanding of the
                    key concept.
                    There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some
                    ethnographic examples are presented but these are only partially relevant.
          3–4       The response demonstrates an understanding of the key concept and
                    establishes its relevance to the text.
                    There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are
                    some inconsistencies.
                    Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the
                    analysis.
          5–6       The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept,
                    discussing this in the context of the text.
                    There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a
                    detailed interpretation of the ethnographic data.
                    Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.
                                                  –5–                 N22/3/SOCAN/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of identity or culture is
     evident in this passage with how it is evident in one ethnographic example you have
     studied. Make reference to theory in your answer.                                         [10]

     Candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other
     contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must
     demonstrate an understanding of how either the key concept of identity or culture
     relates to this ethnographic context. Either of the key concepts on which such
     comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any
     anthropological issues raised by the text.

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates
     should be able to establish a relevant comparison with any other group or society
     based on either of these concepts. The response should be structured as a
     comparison, highlighting similarities and differences. Candidates must situate the
     comparative case in terms of place, author, and fieldwork context.

     For identity, possible ways of defining the key concept include the following:
     • Personal view of the self or view of an individual in the eyes of a group
     • Group identity (age, class, ethnicity, subculture)
     • Career as an identity marker
     • Gender, masculinity, and sexuality
     • Idea of imagined community.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples from the text about identity may include:
     • Hipster as subcultural identity
     • Performing identity through work, art, consumption, relationships
     • Constructing own masculinity in contrast to hegemony.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

     Possible examples of theory in relation to identity may include:

     •   Practice theory
     •   Performance theory
     •   Feminist theories
     •   Postmodernism
     •   Symbolic theories.
     •   Symbolic interactionism (Erving Goffman)
     •   Marylin Strathern’s theory on the dividual person.

     At HL, candidates need to use theory in the response in order to achieve more than [4].
     Any other relevant theories.

For culture, possible ways of defining the key concept include:
• Organized system of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs, and material production
  that humans create and manipulate in their daily lives (see pp. 133-4 of TSM).
• Shared social construction of meanings
• Such meanings are not static, but dynamic, fluid and can be contested.

Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

Possible examples from the text about culture may include:
• Culture and subculture
• Construction of masculinity
• Hegemonic masculinity
• Hipster values e.g. art and creative careers
• Exclusivity of subcultural membership and ethnocentrism
• Hegemonic culture and subcultural resistance and/or accommodation
• Interrelation between class, ethnicity, and culture/subculture.

Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

Possible examples of theory in relation to culture may include:
• Practice theory
• Performance theory
• Interpretivism
• Feminist theories
• Postmodernism.

At HL candidates need to use theory in the response in order to achieve more than [4].

Any other relevant theory.

4.   Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in
     this passage to the approaches to research used by one other anthropologist you have
     studied. Make reference to concepts, ethnographic material and theory in your answer.     [10]

     Here, candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis
     on the methodological and theoretical perspectives of the ethnographer as the focus on
     which such comparisons should be established.

     By “approaches to research” the question essentially refers to the research methods
     used by the anthropologist to gather data. However, as theory is required for level 5–6
     and above, it is expected that candidates will also discuss theory with reference to
     approaches.

     Possible comparative examples regarding approaches may include:
     • Multi-sited ethnographies
     • Ethnography close to home
     • Using friends as gatekeepers
     • Participant observation
     • Informal/ethnographic interviews
     • Content analysis of print and online material.

     Candidates may also make mention of other relevant methodological terms. For example:
     • qualitative methods
     • insider/outsider
     • access to the field
     • rapport.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

     Possible examples of theory in relation to approaches may include:
     • Feminist theories
     • Performance theories
     • Subcultural theories.

     Any other relevant theory.

5.   What does it mean to be a person? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
     ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                     [10]

     This question requires candidates to develop an argument that is built on an
     understanding of the following “big anthropological question”: What does it mean to
     be a person? This response should include argumentative discussion and analysis
     and should be supported by making reference to the passage and by relevant, detailed
     ethnographic material that gives evidence of the understanding of this big question in
     different cultural contexts. This big anthropological question should be the very
     backbone of the response.

     In the development of their response, candidates may make reference to a number of
     ideas or propositions connected to the question. For this reason, below are some ideas
     that may appear in candidates’ responses. However, any other relevant lines of thought
     should be rewarded.

     Possible issues to develop an argument may be:
     There are many different ways that candidates can approach this question, and any
     valid discussion of the concept “person” and the relation of the person to society is
     acceptable. While it is not possible to predict how they will use any additional
     ethnographies, in relation to the passage they may focus on:
     • Subcultural identities
     • Personhood
     • Commodification
     • Resistance movements
     • Gender and identity
     • Class and society
     • Race and society
     • Age and society.

     Other appropriate discussion and arguments should be credited.

                                                Section B
6.   With reference to either stimulus A or stimulus B and your own knowledge, discuss
     the defining features of anthropological ethics.                                               [10]

     This question requires candidates to develop a response in which they demonstrate an
     understanding of the anthropological ethical issues raised by the stimulus material, and
     an ability to engage in a critical discussion applying their own knowledge.

     If stimulus A is used:
     This extract is based on an academic paper in which anthropologists critique the use of
     anonymity in writing ethnography. While anonymity is often viewed as the standard way
     to present participants, critics of anonymity argue that the process can be
     disempowering, turning people into data and reproducing broader power dynamics.
     The stimulus allows for a wide range of responses.

     Candidates may develop a discussion based on:
     • when anonymity is and is not appropriate
     • representation, voice, and the autonomy of participants
     • power relations in research
     • different interpretations of anonymity (e.g. deidentification).

     Other possible relevant lines of thought should be credited.

     If stimulus B is used:
     In this case, it is likely that candidates will discuss anthropological ethics stressing the
     importance of representation and challenging anthropology’s colonial roots, in
     particular.

     Candidates may develop a discussion based on:
     • repatriation of museum material, cultural rights
     • tangible/intangible heritage
     • representation and museum material
     • colonialism and race
     • decolonizing curriculum/museums
     • collaborative approaches to curation/representation
     • The colonial gaze.

     Other possible relevant lines of thought should be credited.
