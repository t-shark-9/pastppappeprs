                                               ELE PLC

     Emma and Lucas De Smet opened their first gasoline (petrol) station in Antwerp, Belgium, in
     1969. The business was set up as a private limited company, ELE Ltd. Emma and Lucas opened
     additional gasoline stations by reinvesting profits. By 1979, ELE Ltd. had a chain of 100 gasoline
     stations across Belgium. That same year, ELE became a public limited company. Emma and Lucas
 5   each retained 26 % of the shares in ELE PLC. The additional capital that this raised partially funded
     external growth.

     The business continued to expand in the 1980s and 1990s by acquiring smaller chains of
     gasoline stations. By 1999, ELE had 700 gasoline stations in Belgium, France, Spain, and the UK,
     employing 5500 staff.

10   ELE remained a family business and, in May 1999, the De Smets’ son and daughter, Hugo and
     Giselle, joined ELE after graduating from university.

     In 2000, the board of directors, consisting of Emma, Lucas, Hugo and Giselle, made the decision
     that, rather than opening more gasoline stations in the future, the business would grow revenues
     through diversification and expansion of the retail operations of the 700 gasoline stations.

15   Over the next decade, ELE made three strategic changes: a takeover of Zeat PLC, expansion of
     gasoline station retail operations, and diversification into car rentals.

     Strategic changes

     The takeover of Zeat PLC

     In 2000, ELE raised EUR 49 million from internal sources to take over Zeat PLC.

20   Based in the UK, Zeat PLC had long-term contracts to supply and maintain air compressors
     to gasoline stations across all European Union (EU) countries, including ELE’s. These air
     compressors were used by customers to inflate their car tyres. Emma and Hugo felt that the
     revenue stream from the maintenance contracts alone was too good an opportunity to miss. They
     also believed that this business had the potential to become more profitable.

25   The ELE board of directors decided to retain the Zeat brand name but operate it as a separate
     division of ELE, with Lucas as the director.

     Lucas identified that improvements within the Zeat division were possible in:
     y productivity levels
     y delivery dates
30   y air compressor servicing
     y employee motivation
     y employee absenteeism.

     Lucas implemented a rapid modernization programme of Zeat’s batch production manufacturing
     method. New machinery was purchased, and cellular manufacturing was introduced. Within two
35   years, the Zeat division became more profitable.

     Until 2005, the Zeat division was only a business-to-business (B2B) supplier, but Lucas believed
     a business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing opportunity existed for a small, low-cost electric air
     compressor to inflate car and bicycle tyres at home. This new compressor would run off a car’s
     electrical supply. ELE’s Marketing Department conducted market research into this opportunity
40   using stratified sampling, and analysis of the collected data confirmed Lucas’s idea that there was
     a gap in the market for this product.
                                                   –3–                                             8822 – 5001


     To fill this gap in the market, the Zeat division launched the MiniC compressor in 2006, which
     it produced in its UK factory. Initially, the MiniC was sold only in ELE’s gasoline station stores
     (shops), but Lucas soon realized that another distribution channel was needed. He held
45   discussions with buyers from retailers, and within a year, the MiniC was on sale in thousands of
     retail outlets across the EU.

     Expansion of gasoline station retail operations

     In 2005, the gasoline stations became a separate division within ELE. Hugo was appointed as the
     division’s director. He initiated a refurbishment of gasoline station retail stores, in which the floor
50   space in each store was increased. This enabled a wider range of products to be sold. Previously,
     the stores only sold newspapers and confectionary, but with this refurbishment they became
     convenience stores supplying food and drink items. This refurbishment, which also included the
     installation of point-of-sale stock management software, was financed from retained profits and
     completed by 2009.

55   Diversification into car rentals

     In the first decade of the twentieth century, the demand for car rentals grew significantly worldwide.
     In 2010, ELE’s directors decided to set up a car rental business financed by a combination of
     retained profits and external finance. Giselle was appointed director of the car rental division.

     Giselle was passionate about change and the need to modernize. On her office door hung a sign:
60   “Embrace change with open arms”. This slogan became Giselle’s mantra. She wanted to grow
     the car rental division further. In 2015, she gained board approval to open car rental offices in all
     the major airports in Belgium, France, Spain and the UK, and implemented a car rental booking
     service at ELE gasoline stations. Now, ELE car rentals can be booked online, over the telephone,
     and face to face at one of their counters in gasoline stations or at any airport office. ELE is also
65   considering launching a smartphone booking app that would allow customers to book a rental car
     in less than a minute.

     Giselle believed much of the car rental division’s success was attributable to its approach to human
     resources. A graduate recruitment policy had been adopted, and training was provided annually.
     Giselle encouraged internal recruitment and wanted:
70   y employees with ambition and initiative
     y employees who shared her belief in embracing change
     y internal promotion when management-level vacancies arose.

     The car rental division uses self-appraisal and both formative and summative appraisal. Each office
     manager meets with the employees they directly line manage for a monthly meeting scheduled
75   during normal working hours. Once a year, employees receive a written appraisal from their
     manager. Feedback from employee appraisal interviews demonstrates that the career prospects
     provided by ELE are an important factor in staff recruitment and retention. Employees also value
     the opportunities that self-appraisal and formative appraisal provide for ongoing clarification of
     their job roles and performance. Appraisal interviews are also used to identify the training needs of
80   employees in order to personalize training, rather than providing identical training to all employees.

     Giselle regularly visits ELE car rental counters at gasoline stations and airports. These visits
     are unannounced. She wants to experience, first-hand, the customer service provided by her
     employees. As part of each visit, she meets the manager and then works on the rental counter
     serving customers.

                                                    –4–                                            8822 – 5001


 85   Changes in the boardroom

      In 2019, Emma and Lucas stepped down from the board of directors but remained as the majority
      shareholders in the business. They were replaced as directors by Giselle’s twins, Monica and
      Oliver, who had both joined the business in 2011. Monica was appointed as Giselle’s deputy.

      ELE’s future

 90   Between 2010 and 2020, all three of ELE’s divisions remained profitable. The ELE board
      scheduled meetings in 2021 to discuss a 10-year plan for the business. Oliver was asked to
      produce a report on the challenges and opportunities the business would face. Having read the
      report, both Hugo and Giselle felt that the title of the report should just be “challenges”, but Monica
      disagreed: she saw opportunities, not challenges. Extracts from Oliver’s report are shown below.

 95   Oliver’s report

        Zeat division                                      Car rental division
        y The gasoline station compressor market is        y Sales revenue growth is predicted to slow
          saturated but consistently profitable.             down significantly from 2022 onwards.
        y Zeat’s market share of supplying air             y Competition in the countries in which ELE
          compressors to gasoline stations had               car rentals operates is fierce.
          increased to 75 %.                               y ELE may need to enter new markets.
        y Zeat’s factory will not require any              y India is a market with growth potential.
          additional investment for another five years.
        y Sales of the MiniC were consistent
          despite increased competition from
          cheap imports.


        Gasoline station division
        y Many governments have announced that sales of new gasoline and diesel cars will be
          banned from 2030.
        y Car companies are making decisions to end the production of gasoline and diesel cars.
        y Worldwide sales of electric cars rose by 43 % in 2020.
        y Falls in battery prices will reduce the price of electric cars.
        y Electric cars are predicted to be cheaper to purchase than gasoline- or diesel-powered
          models by 2025.
        y Gasoline sales are expected to gradually decline—a decline that will gain pace as the
          decade progresses.


      Having read Oliver’s report, Hugo, Giselle and Monica proposed changes to the business. Hugo
      suggested that changes would be needed in the gasoline station division in the near future and
      proposed a strategy to close the least profitable stations and redevelop the sites as convenience
      stores. He argued that these sites have prime locations, good access, and on-site parking. The
100   gasoline pumps would be removed, and the existing stores would need to be enlarged. These sites
      would still operate as sites for ELE car rentals.
                                                   –5–                                           8822 – 5001


      Giselle made a presentation to the board. She wanted to expand the car rental division to India.
      Her presentation highlighted that most car rental businesses in India:
      y are small and local
105   y owned 20–50 cars
      y only operated in one or two cities.

      Giselle’s presentation also highlighted that:
      y only 4 % of cars on roads were rental cars
      y foreign and domestic tourism is growing
110   y urbanization is rapid
      y public transportation is basic but cheap.

      Giselle wanted Monica to become the director of a new car rental division in India. However,
      Monica disagreed completely with her mother. During a gap year in the USA, she saw how, in
      one city, a new innovative business model using disruptive technology had changed the car rental
115   market. She compared this new business model to the impact that companies like Uber had on the
      taxi industry.

      Rather than enter the Indian market, Monica recommended a fundamental change to the ELE car
      rental division in Europe: to gain first-mover advantage, she wanted to launch a new brand, In3T,
      enhanced by technology. For this new brand:
120   y all cars would be electrically powered;
      y customers would sign up as members;
      y membership would be free;
      y members would book a car using the In3T smartphone app;
      y car availability would be identified using the In3T app;
125   y cars would be hired by the hour and unlocked and started using the app;
      y cars could be left, at the end of the rental period, at any of the many designated locations in
         the city.

      This service would have few overheads. Booking offices would not be needed. A call centre that is
      available 24 hours a day would handle any member queries.

130   In the meantime, Monica suggested that Giselle might want to remove the sign on her door…
