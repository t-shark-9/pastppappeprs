Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   Evaluate the reasons for the expansion of the Silk Road during the Tang dynasty.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the expansion of the
     Silk Road under the Tang dynasty, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Reasons may
     predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may evaluate the importance of the successful military campaigns under Hou Junli and
     the recapture of the Four Garrisons of Anxi which kept the Road open. They may evaluate the
     importance of Chinese openness to foreign influence on technology and culture, and internal
     transport improvements, such as the canal system, which made it easier to get goods to market for
     export and import. The high demand for goods from China, such as silk, lacquerware and
     porcelain, and the Middle East and central Asia, such as Uighur horses, ceramics and silverware,
     made the Silk Road trade lucrative. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   To what extent did the end of the Mongol Empire cause the decline of the Silk Road in the 15th
     century?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
     end of Mongol Empire caused the decline of the Silk Road in the 15th century. Candidates may
     consider the role of Tamerlane, who kept the Road partially open, as far as Tabriz in Persia, until
     his death in 1405; during the ensuing anarchy Samarkand was devastated and the direct overland
     routes were closed. Circuitous routes were necessary to avoid bandits. They may point out that it
     had been Tang strength which had kept the Road open in the past. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example instability in China in the late Yuan and Tianshun periods, the fall in
     demand for Chinese silk, and the increasing attractiveness of the maritime alternative, but with a
     focus on the issue in the question. It would be valid to challenge the question by pointing out that
     trade and the exchange of ideas did continue. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –5–                 N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   “The Gempei War (1180–1185) significantly transformed Japan.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     Gempei War (1180–1185) significantly transformed Japan. Candidates may argue that the Gempei
     War fundamentally transformed Japan’s society and political structure. They may refer to
     Minamoto’s defeat of Taira, the removal of the capital from Kyota to Kamakura and the beginning
     of a feudal society. Candidates may discuss the declining power of the emperor who would
     become little more than a symbolic figurehead and would not possess any political or military
     power until the rule of Meiji. The increasing power of the Shogunate into a hereditary military
     dictatorship may also be considered as well as the growing power and influnce of the samurai.
     However, candidates may argue that the shoguns and samurai had already held significant
     influence before the Gempei War. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   Discuss the significance of samurai weapons and armour to samurai life.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the significance
     of samurai weapons and armour to samurai life. Candidates may refer to the strongly held belief
     amongst the samurai that their armour and weaponry was crucial to their victory on the battlefield.
     Samurai armour was thought to channel divine power and the concepts/beliefs in Yin Yang and
     Taoism were present in their items. The five Taoist elements, (fire, wood, earth, water and metal)
     had to be represented in their armour and weapons and even the positioning of these items was
     significant as it ensured the “Circle of Creation” was intact. Much of how the samurai wore their
     uniform and armour was to ensure they were ready for the afterlife and to show their intention of
     not returning from the battlefield unless successful. Candidates may argue the significance of this
     preparation and these items is that it demonstrates how spiritual, disciplined and focused the
     samurai were. Candidates may argue that weaponry was only one aspect of samurai life, indeed
     many samurai never saw conflict. Candidates may discuss the importance for the samurai of
     balancing bu (art of warfare) and bun (art of peace-artistic and intellectual side). The samurai
     patronized the arts and were often skilled artists themselves and engaged in calligraphy, painting,
     poetry and performing tea ceremonies. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                    N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Discuss the reasons for, and the impact of, China “looking out”.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
     and impact of, China “looking out.” Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons and impact, or
     they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may refer to China’s construction of the world’s largest imperial fleet in the 1400s.
     China was the leading maritime power in the years 1400–1433 as the Yongle Emperor wanted to
     dominate trade in the region and extend the tributary system. Candidates may discuss Zheng Ho’s
     voyages which significantly increased Chinese influence: after his fourth voyage envoys from 30
     states came to pay tribute to the Ming court. Candidates may argue that the impact of “looking out”
     was often negative. Zheng’s voyages were hugely expensive and this cost meant China’s land
     forces were neglected. This left China vulnerable to a Mongol invasion. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   “Isolationism had an entirely negative impact on China and Japan.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that isolationism had an entirely negative impact on China and on Japan. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of China and Japan, or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However, both
     aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how isolationist policies
     developed in China predominantly as a result of their belief that they were at the centre of the
     universe and had no need for foreign ideas or objects. However, China did not fully isolate as it
     continued to develop its tributary system which greatly benefited the Chinese court. Candidates
     may argue that a negative impact of isolationism was that mercantilism was frowned upon so all
     trade stopped, there were also no developments in science and technology as traditional
     Confucian ways were enforced. China also neglected to develop its navy and coastal defences
     leaving them vulnerable. Candidates may argue isolationism in Japan protected their religion and
     culture as well as leading to years of peace. Candidates may discuss the ways that Japan did not
     fully isolate because they maintained links with the Dutch, Chinese and Koreans. New
     technological developments made it into Japan through Dutch learning and there was still limited
     trade at various trading posts. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   Compare and contrast the impact of Babur and Humayun on the rise of Mughal power.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the impact of Babur and Humayun on the rise of the Mughal Empire, referring to both throughout.
     There does not need to be equal treatment of each ruler. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe
     but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. For comparison candidates may
     refer to the importance of military success to conquering and retaining territory. Babur’s remarkable
     victories over the Afghans, and his defeat of the Rajputs and others may be compared with
     Humayun’s reconquest of northern India after the Sher Shah’s death. Both emperors were
     religiously tolerant; neither of them left an administrative legacy. For contrast, candidates may refer
     to Humayun’s poorer record on the battlefield, as he was forced to flee to Persia, as the Sur
     Emperors took his place. He only took personal charge of military campaigns towards the end of
     his reign. Babur was the founder of the Mughal Empire; Humayun maintained it.


8.   “The weakness of Aurangzeb’s rule was the main reason for the decline of the Mughal Empire.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the weakness of Aurangzeb’s rule was the main reason for the decline of the Mughal Empire.
     Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may consider Aurangzeb’s religious policies, which moved away from the
     tolerant approach of his predecessors: some Hindu temples were destroyed and Islamic law
     enforced. Military decay had started under Aurangzeb. Armaments were not kept up to date; wives
     and concubines accompanied armies at war. An effective administrative system was not
     established by Aurangzeb, his predecessors or successors. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example, a succession of weak late Mughal emperors, such as Bahadur Shah,
     Jahndar Shah and Farrukhsiyar, who failed to control a fractious nobility, and the absence of a
     fixed rule of succession, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    “The introduction of the Ethical Policy (1901) was of little benefit to the Dutch East Indies.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the introduction of the Ethical Policy was of little benefit to the Dutch East Indies.
      Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may discuss economic progress, such as increased production
      of raw materials, especially, rubber, and a prosperous oil industry, although the benefits favoured
      the outer islands. Public health expenditure was vastly increased, with progress in anti-malarial
      campaigns and vaccination, but there were few doctors. Village reform foundered on corruption
      and maladministration. Educational improvements saw increased enrolment in village schools and
      an improved supply of skilled workers to European enterprises, but literacy levels remained low.
      Devolution of political power was very limited, with only a tiny Indonesian electorate; new urban
      and regional authorities were in the hands of Dutch and Chinese officials. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Evaluate the consequences of the Philippine Revolution (1896).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the consequences of the Philippine
      Revolution weighing up its importance or otherwise. Consequences may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      evaluate the impact of the overthrow of the Spanish colonial government and the Declaration of
      Independence in 1898. They may refer to the declaration of the First Republic and the adoption of
      the Malalos Constitution. Although the republic lost its independence in 1901, after war the with the
      US, the revolution may have persuaded the Americans, who granted a degree of autonomy in
      1907, to commit to eventual Philippine independence, which was promised in the Jones Act of
      1916. Candidates may argue that the revolution helped to forge the national identity of a
      linguistically and ethnically diverse country, and to promote the formation of the Philippine
      Independent Church. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   Evaluate the political and social consequences for India of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of
      1857.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political and social consequences
      for India of the Great revolt, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Consequences may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and social consequences, or they may prioritize
      their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to the establishment of direct rule of the British government and the
      installation of a Viceroy, supported by a new council with Indian-nominated representation. There
      may be appraisal of Macaulay’s educational reforms, the ending of interference in Indian religious
      traditions, and reform of the army. After the revolt, relations between the British and Indians
      worsened, resulting in increased surveillance and regulation of the Indian population and more
      racial segregation. Indian access to the higher levels of the civil service and military remained
      barred. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


12.   Discuss the reasons for the rise of resistance and nationalism in Burma after the Third Anglo-
      Burmese War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of reasons for the
      rise of resistance and nationalism in Burma after the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Reasons may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may discuss the dispatch of the Burmese king into exile and the detachment of religion
      from the state, resulting in the collapse of influence of the monkhood and the secularisation of
      education. They may discuss the impact of repressive measures such as mass executions,
      strategic hamlets programmes and internal deportation all of which led to the rise of resistance.
      Education policies, which excluded science from the curriculum, and favoured only a tiny elite, led
      to the growth of nationalist ideas. Economic policies were damaging; many Burmese farmers were
      forced to borrow at unaffordable rates from Indian investors and lost their land. Burmese workers
      were undercut by cheap Indian labour, causing unemployment and crime to soar. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   To what extent can the rule of Qianlong be considered successful?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      rule of Qianlong can be considered successful. Results of his rule may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      consider the successful campaigns in Turkmenistan, Taiwan, Burma and Xinjiang, and flourishing
      agriculture and trade, encouraged both by reduced taxation and rents and the promotion of new
      methods of farming and flood control. There may be consideration of his patronage of the arts,
      resulting in a flowering of literature, calligraphy, painting, porcelain, and jade and ivory work,
      although there was censorship. His resistance to western ideas, including his rejection of an
      embassy from George III of England, and his reinforcement of rigid bureaucracy, stored problems
      for the future, while his final years were blighted by favouritism towards the corrupt Hoshen and
      numerous revolts, such as the White Lotus rebellion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   To what extent did Japan’s economy and society change under the Tokugawa Shogunate?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Japan’s economy and society changed under the Tokugawa Shogunate. Changes may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economy and society, or they may prioritize their
      assessment of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may refer to the declining fortunes of the samurai, whose fixed incomes were proving inadequate,
      and military skills waning. Bonds of kinship were being replaced by labour contracts, perhaps
      leading to rising social tensions. Direct attacks on property suggested that landowners were not as
      benevolent as in the past. There was shift in economic power from declining larger cities to smaller
      towns. Population growth had halted. Candidates may argue that social change was limited to
      some extent by a ban on foreign travel. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Evaluate the impact of tensions between settlers and indigenous people in Australia.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the tensions between
      settlers and indigenous people in Australia. Candidates may refer to the impact of the Wars of
      Resistance which led to the deaths of over 40 000 Indigenous Australians and approximately 2000
      settlers. The Indigenous people carried out raids on settlers' farms and the retaliation was severe.
      An official inquiry on the Waterloo Creek Massacre stated that a disproportionate amount of force
      had been used and that settlers were taking the law into their own hands. Candidates may
      therefore argue that these tensions had led to a state of lawlessness. The ongoing violence
      between the settlers and indigenous communities often led to the forcible removal of aboriginals
      from their lands. Candidates may discuss how reserves were created for the indigenous
      communities and consequently they lost their connection to the land and their freedom. They also
      lost control over many aspects of their lives and were continuously under surveillance. Long term
      issues related to living on these reserves included poverty, lack of educational and employment
      opportunities and poor healthcare. Candidates may also argue that attempts by the settlers to
      “civilize” the local population, such as forcibly taking children from their own families to Christian
      missions all stemmed from these initial conflicts. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   “The achievement of dominion status was not a major factor in creating a national identity.”
      Discuss with reference to either Australia or New Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the achievement of dominion status was not a major factor in creating a national identity. For
      New Zealand, candidates may refer to the fact that the achievement of dominion status in 1907
      was largely a cosmetic change. Most New Zealanders did not want independence from Britain at
      this time and an attempt to launch a “Dominion Day” was largely unsuccessful. Their trade, culture,
      language, defence was all still tied to the UK although New Zealand was beginning to develop its
      own culture with Maori influences. For Australia, candidates may argue that Dominion status,
      declared in 1901, was somewhat significant. Australia began to develop more progressive social
      policies than the UK and the creation of the federation led to the beginnings of a national identity
      and culture. Other arguments may be addressed, for example that the growth of towns/cities or
      involvement in the First World War were more significant factors in the development of a national
      identity in both Australia and New Zealand. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   Evaluate the role of Prince Gong during the Tongzhi Restoration.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of Prince Gong during the
      Tongzhi Restoration. Candidates may refer to his role in the Xinyin coup which brought him to
      power, and the fluctuations in his influence as a supporter of the Self-Strengthening Movement
      caught in the crossfire of court intrigue. They may evaluate his role in the suppression of the
      Taiping Rebellion and the negotiation of the Treaty of Beijing at the end of the Second Opium War.
      He also was instrumental in founding the Zongli Yamen (de facto foreign ministry). There may be
      evaluation of his mixed record in foreign affairs, including the calamitous Lay-Osborn flotilla, the
      triumphant adjudication between the Danes and Prussians, and his negotiations with the French
      after the Tianjin Massacre. His promotion of educational reform, notably the Tongwen Guan, a
      college for linguists and technology students, may be evaluated. Candidates may argue that his
      role was not as significant as that of other key reformers including Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and
      Zuo Zongtang. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


18.   “The threat from foreign powers was the most important reason for the Meiji Restoration (1868) in
      Japan.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the threat from foreign powers was the most important reason for the Meiji Restoration.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to Commodore Perry’s humiliation of Japan in 1853, and his
      imposition of a humiliating “unequal treaty” which inflicted serious economic damage including
      cheap imports, which drove domestic producers out of business, inflation and currency
      devaluation. The political damage to the bakufu was significant, and the ensuing factional strife
      paved the way for change. It may be argued that nationalism was stimulated by the need to push
      back against the foreign threat. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example the rising
      power of the Satsuma and Chosu, who were instrumental in toppling the Shogunate, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Discuss the significance of the Simon Commission (1928) and the Round Table Conferences
      (1930–1932) to the struggle for independence.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the significance
      of the Simon Commission and the Round Table Conferences to the struggle for Indian
      independence. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the Simon Commission and the Round
      Table Conferences, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the wholly British membership of the
      Commission, which inspired a campaign of civil disobedience. Allegations of brutality of the
      authorities were corroborated by the death of protester Lal Lajpat Ral. The short-lived Round Table
      Conferences, attended by a few Indians, including Gandhi and Ambedkar, who agreed the
      compromise Poona Pact. Both the Simon Commission and Round Table Conferences produced
      some elements of the Government of India Act, notably in relation to provincial rule and direct
      elections. However, in both, the British government’s lack of commitment to independence was
      apparent and this increased support for independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate Mountbatten’s role in the partition of the South Asian subcontinent (1947).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Mountbatten’s role in the partition of
      the South Asian subcontinent, weighing up his strengths and limitations. Candidates may evaluate
      the wisdom of his decision to accelerate the timetable to independence, and his support of the
      Radcliffe Partition plan which resulted in widespread communal violence. Candidates may argue
      that Mountbatten was handed an impossible task by the British government, but may question
      whether Mountbatten foresaw the problems which accompanied partition, and the degree to which
      he believed that acceleration of the timetable would either reduce, increase and/or delay the
      ensuing violence. They may evaluate his negotiations with Jinnah and Nehru and his alleged
      favouritism towards Nehru, and determine whether Mountbatten could have prevented partition.
      Mountbatten’s negotiations with the princely states may also be evaluated; while he persuaded the
      majority of them to join India, the tricky issue of Kashmir was unresolved. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   “The invasion of Manchuria (1931) and of China (1937) had a significant impact on Japan’s
      relations with the West.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the invasion of Manchuria and of China had a significant impact on Japan’s relations with the
      West. Candidates may refer to the response of the League of Nations to Japan’s invasion of
      Manchuria. Japan faced condemnation as a result of Lord Lytton’s report and responded to this by
      simply leaving the League. Similarly, although the images and stories of Japan’s bombing of
      Shanghai and attack on Nanjing shocked the world candidates may suggest that their relations
      were not irrevocably affected. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and argue
      that relations with Japan had actually been tense since the end of the First World War and they
      may refer to Japan’s disappointment with the Versailles and Washington Treaties and US attitudes
      towards Japanese immigrants in the 1920s. Candidates may also argue that Japan’s relations with
      Germany and Italy strengthened at this time through the Anti-Comintern and Tripartite Pacts.
      Candidates are likely to argue that relations only significantly deteriorate after Japan’s advances
      into SE Asia and the US embargoes. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   “Japanese misjudgements were the main reason for their defeat in the Pacific War (1941–1945).”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Japanese misjudgements were the main reason for their defeat in the Pacific War. Candidates may
      refer to the nature of Japanese occupation. Japan’s belief in “Asia for the Asians” did initially give
      them support with local populations who believed that Japanese occupation may help in their fight
      for independence from the colonial powers. However, the nature of their rule, including massacres,
      conscription into hard labour and use of comfort women meant that local groups often formed
      strong resistance to the Japanese making it harder for them to maintain control. Candidates may
      also argue that Pearl Harbor was a mistake. Japan had woken a “sleeping giant” but knew it would
      not be able to fight a long war against it. Another key argument candidates may present is that
      Japan overstretched itself and that the size/scale of its empire was unwieldly. Candidates may
      challenge the assumption in the question and suggest other factors were more significant in
      explaining Japan’s defeat, including US industrial strength and technological developments.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   To what extent were economic conditions the main reason for the rise of communism in China by
      1936?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      economic conditions were the main reason for the rise of communism in China by 1936.
      Candidates may refer to the long-term economic problems that had faced China, and in particular
      the suffering amongst the peasantry. Farming was still very backward and peasants had to deal
      with corrupt and oppressive landlords. The communists promised land reform and this increased
      support for the CCP amongst the peasantry. There were serious social inequalities for women as
      their lives were strictly controlled and they were essentially regarded as the property of their
      father/husband. The communists promoted the ideas of equality which appealed to women and
      young people. Candidates may argue that the GMD’s rule had done little to address these issues
      as Jiang had focused predominantly on the middle class and urban developments, in contrast the
      CCP promised to address these problems. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the
      question and argue that other factors were more significant in the rise of communism. These could
      include the long-term political failings to establish a democratic republic, the strengths of the CCP
      and Mao, the Civil War from 1927, the failings of the Nanjing Decade and even the invasion of
      Manchuria by the Japanese. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the social impact of Japanese rule in Korea up to 1945.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the social impact of Japanese rule in
      Korea. Candidates may refer to the ways Korean society was subjugated in the first ten years of
      Japanese rule. Examples may include book burnings, the imprisonment of intellectuals and
      religious oppression. Candidates may go on to suggest that in the period following the March 1st
      Movement there was some cultural accommodation. There was a degree of relaxation of
      censorship and Korean arts and literature began to develop. Japanese developments in
      infrastructure also had a social impact as improvements in transportation and communication
      changed the Korean way of life, particularly in urban areas. Candidates are likely to argue that the
      period during the Sino-Japanese War years had the most devastating impact on Korean society.
      The assimilation process sought to eliminate Korean culture and identity. Koreans were forced to
      adopt Japanese culture, language and religion with the majority of Koreans even forced to change
      their names. The social impact of the conscription of Korean men into forced labour and the use of
      comfort women had a long-term social impact on Korea. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

25.   Examine the reasons for both resistance and collaboration in Malaya during the Second World
      War.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the reasons for both
      resistance and collaboration in Malaya during the Second World War. Reasons may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of resistance and collaboration, or they may prioritize their examination of one of
      them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may examine the
      hardships of Japanese rule led to resistance, compounded by incompetent administration,
      including food shortages, inflation, sharp falls in income, and brutal martial law. Chinese people,
      singled out as enemy aliens (many thousands of them were killed), became the backbone of the
      Malayan People’s Anti-Japanese Army, which was supported by the British. The cession of four
      northern provinces to Thailand also spawned a resistance movement, the Pahang Watania.
      Collaboration came from some Malayan nationalists, such as Muda, on the understanding that
      Malaya would be granted independence, and most of the sultans, who had been given limited self-
      rule. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


26.   “Indonesian independence was achieved mainly as a result of external influences.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Indonesian independence was achieved mainly as a result of external influences. Reasons may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to Japanese encouragement of, and planning for, independence during the
      period of occupation which included the drafting of a constitution. The United Nations exerted
      considerable pressure on countries supporting the Dutch after 1945, and persuaded the Dutch to
      withdraw. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the evolution of Indonesian
      nationalism before 1939, the impact of indigenous resistance to the Dutch in war-time, the role of
      the Indonesian Communist Party and the leadership of Sukarno and Haita, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. It would be valid to point out that external influences, namely foreign support
      for the Dutch forces after 1945, delayed independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   To what extent do you agree that changes in education were the most successful social
      development of Mao’s China?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      changes in education were the most successful social development of Mao’s China. Candidates
      may refer to the huge literacy programmes launched that transformed China’s literacy rates from
      just 20 % to approximately 70 % of the population. Mandarin was Romanised into pinyin making it
      more accessible for the masses. However, candidates may argue that education was very
      politicized and that political ideology permeated most elements of the curriculum and school life.
      Candidates could also argue that educational developments were limited as millions of rural school
      age children still did not have access to schooling. Candidates may also suggest that the Cultural
      Revolution undid many of the positive developments. During this period, physical labour was
      celebrated rather than intellectual activity and schools/universities closed down as millions went to
      the countryside to be “re-educated”. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and
      argue that other social developments were more significant. These may include healthcare,
      religion, communes and women. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Discuss the reasons for Deng Xiaoping’s emergence to power following the death of Mao.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      Deng Xiaoping’s emergence to power following the death of Mao. Candidates may briefly refer to
      Deng’s earlier achievements, in particular his involvement in the Long March, Civil War and Sino-
      Japanese War to demonstrate that he was perceived as a revolutionary veteran. Deng had also
      demonstrated calm and effective leadership following the devastation caused by the Great Leap.
      Candidates may argue that this placed Deng in a strong position to gain power. Following Mao’s
      death, Deng publicly criticised the Cultural Revolution predominantly placing the blame on the
      Gang of Four. He took care to praise Mao for his revolutionary zeal but acknowledged that
      mistakes were made. Candidates may argue that this approach enabled Deng to gain a huge
      amount of support amongst the public and the party. Deng very quickly started to eliminate the
      chaos and return things to normal (Boulan Fanzheng) and demonstrated this when he reopened
      universities and reinstated exams. Candidates may argue that his promise of economic
      development and the dismantling of communes also won him considerable support. Even though it
      was Hua Guofeng that officially held the title of General Secretary, candidates are likely to argue
      that Deng’s popularity ensured he was China’s Paramount Leader. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   “The division of Korea (1945) was the main cause of the Korean War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the division of Korea (1945) was the main cause of the Korean War. Candidates may refer to
      the decision made by the Allies to divide Korea at the conferences in Tehran and Yalta. Korea was
      divided along the 38th Parallel into US and Soviet occupation zones. Candidates may discuss how
      the actions of the US Military Government in Korea, including banning the People’s Republic of
      Korea committees, strikes/protests and eventually introducing martial law were resented amongst
      the population. Candidates may argue that the elections held in both zones were likely to have
      been manipulated to secure regimes loyal to their ally. Candidates may also discuss how the
      regime of Syngman Rhee was perceived as corrupt and a puppet of the US and this led to further
      support for a united Korea. Kim Il-sung, keen to prove himself to Moscow, launched an invasion of
      the south which in turn led to US involvement. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example the Cold War context and in particular, the policy of containment and also China’s desire
      to show itself as a regional power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “The leadership of Ho Chi Minh was the main reason for the Viet Minh victory over the French in
      1954.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      leadership of Ho Chi Minh was the main reason for the Viet Minh victory over the French.
      Candidates may refer to how Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the independent Democratic Republic of
      Vietnam just hours after the Japanese surrender. Once the French tried to re-establish colonial rule
      fighting broke out. The Viet Minh fought an effective guerrilla war against the French with aid from
      communist China. By 1954 the UK and the US refused to support French efforts to re-claim their
      colony. Candidates may argue that the French had over-estimated their own strength believing that
      their artillery and air superiority would secure their victory. Candidates may also discuss how Ho
      Chi Minh had won great support amongst the peasantry during their campaign against the
      Japanese during the Second World War and that their promise of land reform was hugely popular.
      The effective military leadership of General Vo Nguyen Giap may also be addressed. It was Giap
      who planned and led the successful attack against the French at Dien Bien Phu and he is
      described by many as one of the greatest military strategists of the century. Candidates could also
      argue that the Vietnamese were fed up of foreign intervention in their country and the majority now
      supported the ideas of nationalism and independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947.

31.   “Nehru successfully achieved his foreign policy aims.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Nehru
      successfully achieved his foreign policy aims. Candidates may consider Nehru’s conduct of the
      Kashmir crisis which resulted in the partition and stalemate, although the Pakistani incursion was
      repelled. Similarly, despite a treaty signed in 1954, the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1962 was
      reversed, but the North West frontier issue was unresolved. Despite Nehru’s preference for a
      peaceful foreign policy, Goa was regained from Portugal by force. Candidates may evaluate
      Nehru’s use of continued membership of the Commonwealth and his co-founding of the Non-
      Aligned Movement to promote Indian leadership on the world stage. His resistance to what he saw
      as American imperialism in Japan and his support of Chinese membership of the UN gained him
      prestige in the developing world, although alliance with the USSR proved unproductive, as he
      received little support in his disputes with Pakistan and China. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Examine the causes and consequences of the 1971 uprising in Ceylon/Sri Lanka.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the causes and
      consequences of the 1971 uprising in Ceylon/Sri Lanka. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      causes and consequences, or they may prioritize their examination of either of them. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may examine the impact of a saturated
      labour market, which impacted particularly on university graduates and the young poor, who were
      at the heart of the uprising. Economic crisis forced the government to cut the rice subsidy, which
      resulted in political instability. The Maoist JVP gave ideological leadership and catalysed
      revolutionary violence. As a result of the uprising, because North Korea may have supported the
      uprising, foreign policy was realigned to a more neutral stance. The government strengthened its
      security forces, and may have become more authoritarian. Reform was hastened, including land
      reform in 1972 and nationalisation of the plantations in 1975. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   To what extent had attitudes towards indigenous peoples become more positive in Australia and
      New Zealand by 2005?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      attitudes towards indigenous peoples become more positive in Australia and New Zealand. For
      Australia, candidates may refer to how there was growing international criticism in the 1950s
      regarding Australia’s treatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In response, the
      government established the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement and over the next 15
      years this council sought to improve the rights and opportunities of their indigenous communities.
      Improvements were slow and several indigenous organisations attempted to bring about positive
      change themselves. There was a Freedom Ride in New South Wales to promote these concerns.
      Changes were made to the constitution in 1967 to ensure indigenous people had the same
      constitutional rights and 90 % of the Australian population supported this decision which candidates
      may suggest shows positive change. For New Zealand candidates may talk about how policies of
      self-determination replaced the idea of assimilation in the 1970s and 1980s. The Treaty of
      Waitangi Amendment Act also settled many grievances regarding land rights. Candidates may
      argue that one of the most positive developments was the way Maori culture was celebrated by all
      New Zealanders. It influenced food, language, culture, education and government. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Discuss the reasons for, and impact of, changing international alignments of either Australia or
      New Zealand.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and impact of, changing international alignments of either Australia or New Zealand. Candidates
      may discuss the significance of the Second World War which had demonstrated Britain’s inability
      to protect them. Consequently, both countries looked for stronger and closer allies. The ANZUS
      Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States came into force in 1952 with the
      purpose of providing mutual aid in the event of aggression. The US was seen as a powerful and
      strong ally against the spread of communism. Candidates may also discuss how both Australia and
      New Zealand started to look to Asia more. The Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty (SEATO)
      was signed in 1954 creating collective defence treaties. Candidates may argue that a negative
      impact of closer ties with the USA was Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam War. In the 1980s
      and 1990s, economic ties with Asia were strengthened through the Asia Pacific Co-operation
      (APEC) and the Asean Regional Forum (ARF). Candidates may argue that as both countries
      strengthened their economic ties with Asia, this impacted the nature of immigration into both
      countries. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
            India) (1980–2005)

35.   “The economic and social impact of tourism has mainly been negative.” Discuss with reference to
      two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that economic and social impact of tourism has mainly been negative. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of their two chosen Asian countries, or they may prioritize their discussion of one.
      However, both countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the negative
      and positive environmental impact of tourism. In many parts of Asia tourism has led to the
      destruction of the natural environment but with sustainable/eco-tourism the money used from
      tourism can actually help to preserve the environment. Candidates may also discuss the impact on
      local culture and religion. With sustainable tourism these cultures and traditions can actually be
      kept alive but there are also examples of lasting damage, particularly to sites of cultural
      importance. In terms of economic impact, candidates may discuss the money that tourism can
      bring in. In many parts of Asia, tourism is one of the largest sources of income for the people.
      However, often money created by tourism goes to large corporations and does not positively
      impact the local community. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   “Traditional culture has been undermined by globalization.” Discuss with reference to two Asian
      countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that traditional culture has been undermined by globalization. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of their two chosen Asian countries, or they may prioritize their discussion of one.
      However, both countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may argue that in reality
      globalization means an expansion of Western European and North American culture. It could be
      argued that this leads to a significant weakening of national and localised cultural identity. In
      particular, candidates may discuss the undermining of indigenous culture within Asian countries.
      Candidates should give specific examples relevant to their case study of the ways, and extent, to
      which traditional culture has been undermined. This could include discussions on language, food,
      clothing, festivals, beliefs and way of life. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the
      question by arguing that globalization can lead to the protection of traditional cultures. For
      example, from the 1990s onwards, the United Nations created forums and organizations to
      celebrate and preserve indigenous culture. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
