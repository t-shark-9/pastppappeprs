           Award [1] for each valid point in the definition up to [2].

           Note for examiner: To be awarded 2 marks, the answer should demonstrate that the student
           has knowledge of what an influencer is, (that they have followers) by adding some more
           information about what they can do to have an impact on others on social media.

     (b)   Outline one strategy that Laura could use to separate her work and personal
           online environments (lines 35–36).                                                     [2]

           Answers may include:
           • Separate devices
           • Using a separate device for personal and work online activities.

           • Separate login details
           • Using separate log in details for personal and work activities e.g. personal
             email account for personal activities and work email account for all work
             related online registrations.

           • Set times of use/Turn on do not disturb mode
           • Clear time divisions between work and home life online e.g. not using social
             media during working hours and not working during leisure time.

           • Location of use
           • Keep separate the physical location when online for work and personal
             reasons e.g. never work online in the bedroom.

           • Who you interact with.
           • Have different groups of people on your personal and work online platforms
             for example Don’t friend people from work on any personal online platforms

           Award [1] for each strategy identified and [1] for an outline of it up to [2].
                                                 –5–                  N22/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Websites often allow users to register using their social media login as an
           alternative to creating new account details. Explain one concern Hugo might
           have if he used single sign-on for new websites.                                     [2]
           Answers may include:
           • Dependency on one social media account
           • Should Hugo no longer wish to have an account with the social media account
             he uses, deleting it will impact all of the websites that he uses to log in with
             that account.

           • Blocking of social media websites
           • Should Hugo be using the website at school and the social media site is
             blocked, this may impact his ability to log onto other websites.

           • Security
           • Should Hugo’s social media account be hacked, all websites Hugo registered
             with using the same social media details would also be vulnerable.

           • Privacy
           • Increased access of Hugo’s life to social media companies
           • Hugo may not want the Social Media company to have access to other
             aspects of his online behaviour.
           • Websites may have access to more personal data e.g. profile image, birthdate
             depending on the policies of the websites and social media companies.

           • Lack of trust
           • The social media platform can gain access to Hugo’s data from these other
             websites Hugo may not trust how the social media company will use his
             personal data e.g. companies advertising on his social media feeds or sending
             spam to his contacts.
           Award [1] for identifying a concern of logging on to a new website using social
           media login details and for developing the point [1] up to [2].

     (b)   Explain two ways in which Daniela could determine the accuracy of news on
           social media sites (lines 41–43).                                                    [4]
           Answers may include:
           • Fact check – cross check the news with other online reputable news sources.
           • Digital literacy skills - to check the news item e.g. Are you looking at the
             original article? Who created the article? when was it created? What was the
             motivation for publishing? Where was it published?
           • Media bias checking websites - Use media bias checking websites to
             determine the source of news and detail of the bias by the reporters.
           • Check the URL – reputable news sources have their own domains and are
             more likely to report accurate news.
           • Check the comments section if available under the news item – if the
             comments talk about the news being fake, then it probably is.
           • Reverse image search – if the news item has an image, use reverse image
             search to see the source of the original image and if it has been used in other
             stories.
           • Check past posts from a social media site to see if they have been accurate
             and use this to determine the likelihood of the newly posted news on the same
             site.

           Award [1] for describing the way [1] for development of the way up to [4].
           Mark as [2] + [2].

3.   Discuss whether the use of social media has led to the growth of filter bubbles.             [8]

     Reasons why social media has led to the growth of filter bubbles
     • Algorithms keep track of your online activity. These algorithms give you content
       based on what they think you like, and what you are likely to consume.
     • A social media site may hide posts from friends with different viewpoints, or a news
       site may only display articles it thinks you’ll agree with.
     • You may not realize you are in a filter bubble because algorithms do not ask
       permission or tell you when they are active.
     • Online users spend vast amounts of time on social media with the consequence of
       spending more time in a filter bubble.
     • Users’ “friend” individuals from their own “real life” who may share the same beliefs,
       opinions and values.
     • Relationship between content and target advertising/products promoted by
       influencers?
     • Use of # organise content by topic which can reduce diversity.


     Reasons why social media has not led to the growth of filter bubbles
     • Individuals choose online sources other than social media that conform to their own
       beliefs e.g. the choice of news channel, newspaper.
     • Human nature – it is human nature to want to select opinions and news reports that
       support one’s viewpoint and ignore ones that don’t support.
     • Misinformation campaigns can be found on a variety of online sources not just social
       media platforms.
     • Media and cultural studies suggest that we each have multiple identities, which we
       perform according to the social contexts we find ourselves in, not just that found on
       social media.
     • The focus of media coverage, media scholarship and political debate over
       emphasizes the role of platforms and their algorithms on filter bubbles and their
       impact on society.
     • Users have some control of their social media filter bubbles by unfollowing users,
       using hash tags for wider topics of interest and the right to be forgotten. Each of
       these could be used to stop filter bubbles getting larger.


     Note for examiner: Definition: A filter bubble is a situation in which an internet user
     encounters only information and opinions that conform to and reinforce their own
     beliefs, caused by algorithms that personalize an individual’s online experience.

4.   “Every time you post on social media, you give up your rights to privacy, lose control of
     your data, and create a permanent digital footprint.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?                                                                             [12]

     Answers may include:

     Rights to privacy
     Ways to prevent invasion of privacy
     • Social media has privacy settings which a user can adjusted e.g. Facebook –
       Choose who can see your profile, posts, pages followed, friend requests, select
       whether facial recognition technology is activated for your photos; Twitter – do not
       track options.
     • Timeline review process which allows a user to check through any photos or posts
       you are tagged before it appears in the profile.
     • Social media companies allow you to turn off access by advertisers to your personal
       data.
     • A choice of profile settings makes it easier for non-IT specialists to manage their
       privacy settings.
     • Transparency: Users have the ability to download the information that the social
       media company holds.
     • Data protection laws are being updated and social media companies are having to
       comply with new regulations.

     How privacy rights are sacrificed
     • When information is posted online it is no longer private.
     • Social media platforms are vulnerable to security attacks e.g. malicious scripts,
       botnets, phishing attempts.
     • Social media platforms are good delivery system for malware distributors.
     • Due to the popularity of social media sites, they are a popular target for security
       attacks.
     • Users may not keep up to date with changes and updates to privacy settings.
     • Sometimes companies share user's data with third party entities without the user's
       knowledge or consent.
     • Online social tracking – like buttons work with ad cookies to track users across
       different site to track your online behavior.


     Lose control of data
     • Repost and sharing: Social media allows users to repost and reshare comments,
       photos and videos. Once this has happened you lose control of your data.
     • Third-party access: Third-party access to personal data, means that users have no
       control of how their data is used by these third-party organizations.
     • Data breaches: Data breaches on social media servers, will lead to a loss of control
       of the data that has been leaked.
     • User’s technical and digital citizenship knowledge: Non-digital natives are not
       always aware of how their data is being used by others or how to adjust their privacy
       settings
                                            –9–                  N22/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Creation of permanent digital footprint
• Data on social media platforms is saved on servers, if an account is deleted, it is
  kept but not shared.
• The digital footprint exists in different forms e.g. screenshots of posts may be kept
  even if original post is deleted.

 Ways to control digital footprint
• Data protection laws e.g. GDPR are tightening up on the duration of data being
  stored and the right to be forgotten.
• Data protection laws are not globally consistent.

Way to prevent loss of control
• Privacy settings: Social media users have the ability to adjust privacy and security
  settings on social media which gives them some control of their data.

Research:
Candidates should refer to cases they have discovered in their research, personal or
on news sites and other sources, where digital imprinting has had negative and/or
positive impacts, for example, from celebrity cases to personal cases, including their
own experiences.
