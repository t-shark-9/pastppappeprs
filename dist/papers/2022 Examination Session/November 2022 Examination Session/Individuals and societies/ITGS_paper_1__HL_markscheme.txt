Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                          Section A

1.   Virtual learning environments

     (a)   (i)    Identify two hardware devices that a university lecturer could use to record
                  a lecture.                                                                     [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • PC/laptop/cellphone
                  • Microphone
                  • Webcam / video recording device
                  • Audio interface

                  Award [1] for identifying each hardware device up to [2].

           (ii)   Identify the steps that a university lecturer may use to upload course
                  material to the virtual learning environment (VLE).                            [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • Convert the recording into the correct format for uploading (compress if
                    needed).
                  • Enter URL of VLE landing page / access bookmark / open the university
                    website on a browser.
                  • Go to the login option.
                  • Provide login credentials / user ID and password.
                  • Open the platform (VLE).
                  • Use drop down menus to select course.
                  • Upload the course material / drag file from local computer or cloud to the
                    location.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step up to [4].
                                             –5–                  N22/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   The university needs to choose between open-source software and proprietary
      software to develop the virtual learning environment (VLE).

      Analyse these two options.                                                                 [6]

      Using open-source software:
      • Open-source software is often free or low-cost, may allow the university to acquire
        more software within a limited budget/may suit budget constraints.
      • Open-source community is very active and is continually making updates which may
        be a more efficient mechanism than the staged releases by proprietary software
        companies.
      • The open-source community can often provide immediate help with any software
        problems.
      • Open-source software can be changed or customized to suit the university
        requirements.
      • The source code is available for programmers to modify.
      • Open-source software may not have all the options/features needed by the
        university.
      • Using open-source software for the VLE may require hiring more programming staff
        to upgrade the software.
      • Is the open-source software secure?
      • The open-source software can be personalized to the university’s needs

      Using proprietary software:
      • Proprietary software includes safeguards such as guarantees / warranties. (support is a
        new point and is included at the end).
      • Most proprietary software can be fully customized to suit the university requirements.
      • Companies that provide proprietary software generally provide frequent security
        updates/patches as they have a vested interest in keeping their product secure.
      • The user interface may be a more familiar design as the software is considered as part of a
        whole package.
      • Proprietary software may have a greater range of features/options than open-source
        software.
      • Proprietary software may demand a higher level of investment by the university.
      • Manufacturers of proprietary software can provide support and assistance to the company.

       Marks    Level descriptor

       [0]      No knowledge or understanding of ITGS issues and concepts. No use of
                appropriate ITGS terminology

       [1–2]    A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the
                topic or the reason is not clear. Uses little or no appropriate ITGS
                terminology. No reference is made to the scenario in the stimulus
                material. The response is theoretical.

       [3–4]    A description, unbalanced or partial analysis of the issues related to the use
                of open source and proprietary software. There is some use of appropriate
                ITGS terminology in the response.

       [5–6]    A balanced and detailed analysis of the issues related to the use of open
                source and proprietary software. Explicit and relevant references are made
                to the scenario in the stimulus material. There is appropriate ITGS
                terminology throughout the response.

(c)   Students are in the process of selecting a university to complete their degree.
      They have two options:

      • Option 1: A traditional university using face-to-face environments.
      • Option 2: A university only offering online courses using a virtual learning
        environment (VLE) platform.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                                   [8]

      Answer may include:

      Reasons for opting for face-to-face learning
      • Students can focus better in F2F environment, learning from home may have
        distractions.
      • Access to resources – students will have better access to resources, e.g.
        laboratories, library, sports facility, etc.
      • Face-to-face learning may be more effective in organizing students and their
        studies.
      • Improve social and interpersonal skills – students may have greater bonding in F2F
        environment -they will have the ability to interact with professors and students in
        class physically.
      • Students may have better learning opportunities-they can get instant answers, can
        create a better network with fellow students, the professors.
      • the degree earned in F2F environment may carry more value than VLE.
      • Unlike VLE, it is easier to enforce compulsory attendance in F2F environment –
        students are more likely to succeed when they attend classes consistently.
      • It is not necessary to have the technology at home.

      Reasons for opting for online learning
      • Greater access to university courses overseas or in other states as they can study
        from home.
      • Students will have greater flexibility – they can learn at their own pace, in their own
        time ensuring that they understand each topic before moving on. But this requires
        motivation and good organizational skills. Can repeat the videos as many times as
        you want.
      • Professors can track students’ progress more efficiently using the content access
        logs and provide more personalized support to them – implies professors are given
        time to do this.
      • University can restrict the availability of any activity, resource or course section
        according to conditions such as date, grade obtained, group or other activity
        completion. This may need to be flexible to allow for special cases.
      • Learning through VLE would mean that learners can look after their families or work
        while studying as study can be done at a time that suits them.
      • There may be opportunities to collaborate with other students from different
        countries allowing a global perspective.
      • Less expensive – no need for traveling, hostel fees, etc.
      • Students will be able to build better organizational skills – but some students may
        find this challenging.
      • Good option for those with physical needs.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS terminology
      between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to social and ethical
      impacts.

                   • PSD / Photoshop document
                   • RAW / raw image formats

                   Award [1] for each file format identified up to [2].

           (ii)    Define the term image resolution.                                                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • The density of the pixels in the image / the number/amount of dots, or pixels
                     per inch.
                   • Resolution is measured in pixels per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI).
                   • The sharpness and clarity of an image (the higher the number of pixels, the
                     greater the resolution).

                   Quality – only accept if it is related to resolution.

                   Award [1] for identifying each appropriate statement up to [2].

           (iii)   Identify two biometric authentication methods that could be used to access
                   the simulator.                                                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Fingerprints.
                   • Facial recognition.
                   • Voice recognition.
                   • Iris recognition.
                   • Retina scan / Eye scan.

                   Award [1] for identifying each appropriate authentication method up to [2].

(b)   (i)    Distinguish between a model and a simulation.                                 [2]

             Answers may include:
             • A model is a simplification of the key characteristics, behaviours and
               functions of the selected system or process.
             • A model is based on the algorithms and equations used to capture the
               behaviour of the system being modelled.
             • A model is used to ask ‘what if’ questions.
             • A model is a ‘representation’ of a real-life object/system.

             • A simulation is the actual running of the program that contains these
               equations or algorithms.
             • A simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model / in a
               simulation, models can be used to study existing or proposed
               characteristics of a system.
             • Simulation takes user input to simulate a situation – to run through
               various scenarios.

             Award [1] for identifying each difference between a model and a simulation,
             up to [2].

      (ii)   Explain why the quality of user documentation is important for the success
             of the simulator.                                                             [4]

             Answers may include:
             • Good user documentation will make information easily accessible.
             • The details included in user documentation may explain the functionality
               of the simulator to the users. / It helps them have the best product
               experience.
             • It may prevent equipment from being damaged through incorrect use
             • It may simplify the understanding of the simulator to new users who can
               learn to use the simulator quickly.
             • It can cut support costs / less dependency on the developer’s direct
               support.
             • It may help the users troubleshoot certain common operational issues
               related to the simulator. / FAQs included in user documentation may
               have answers to most common issues faced by the users.

(c)   To what extent do the benefits of using simulators for training soldiers outweigh
      the concerns?                                                                          [8]

      Answers may include:

      Benefits of using simulators in the training process
      • Cost-effective and time-saving.
      • It can avoid danger and loss of life / safe environment to learn in / soldiers can
        be placed into a risk-free environment, which will let them safely carry out any
        combat drills without any harm.
      • Highly immersive experience – VR/AR / Conditions can be varied and
        outcomes investigated.
      • Soldiers can experience a variety of environments and scenarios, e.g.
        changes in terrain/changes in weather conditions.
      • Progress can be measured objectively / soldiers’ training performance can be
        recorded digitally for further analysis or training purposes.
      • Simulations can be slowed down to study a soldier’s behaviour more closely.
      • Simulators allow soldiers to experience any type of vehicle in a far more
        immersive and realistic way.
      • Soldiers can navigate environments native to any part of the world.

      Concerns associated with the use of simulators in the training process
      • Simulations are not always able to completely recreate real-life situations.
      • Use of VR/AR may cause eye strain.
      • To simulate a scenario, a thorough understanding is needed and an awareness
        of all the factors involved. This relies on developers being given complete and
        accurate data.
      • The developer may not be able to visualize real war like situation and may miss
        out important considerations.
      • Simulators can be very expensive and require constant updates and
        maintenance.
      • Trainees need to be trained on how to use the software and/or hardware and
        this takes up time and costs money.
      • No real consequences for mistakes may result in trainees underperforming and
        not being fully engaged in the training, thus producing inaccurate results.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

                   • Encryption translates original data (plain text) into an alternate form
                     (cipher text).
                   • The encryption process uses an encryption algorithm.
                   • Encryption keys have a predetermined length / longer keys are more
                     difficult for an attacker to guess than shorter ones.
                   • A key is used for encrypting and decrypting / to transform the cipher text
                     back into the plaintext.
                   • An asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, uses
                     two separate keys; a public key and a private key.
                   • Even if encrypted data is intercepted, it cannot be used/read.

                    Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of encrypted messages up to [2].

           (iii)   Identify one advantage for Tap2Talk users of receiving notifications.              [1]

                   Answer may include:
                   • Notifications can keep users updated e.g. promotional offers, social
                     media post by friends/relatives, emergency updates, news.
                   • It reminds the user to visit the app.
                   • Notifications can popup on screen even when the app is closed.
                   • Notifications are generally free for users to receive.

                   Award [1] for identifying an advantage of receiving notifications up to [1].

           (iv)    Identify one disadvantage for Tap2Talk users of receiving notifications.           [1]

                   Answer may include:
                   • Frequent notifications such as promotional messages may be irritating
                     for users.
                   • The notification may come at an awkward time for the user, for example,
                     due to time zone differences.
                   • The notifications often disappear after they have been accessed or
                     phone is restarted / users may lose access to important notifications.

                    Note to examiners: Do not accept a disadvantage that people next to you can see
                    notifications.
                   Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of receiving notifications up to [1].

(b)   A number of Tap2Talk users are concerned about ticking a single check box to agree to the
      new terms of service and privacy policy (see Figure 3).

      Explain why Tap2Talk users might be concerned about ticking a single check box
      to agree to the new terms of service and privacy policy.                                [6]

      Answers may include:
      • Users will just click the accept check box as it is quick and will not read the
        policy terms in detail.
      • The language in the terms of conditions is so complex that users would not
        understand it.
      • The terms and conditions can be very long and in a very small font size and
        users will not read the whole document.
      • The user needs to use this service therefore they will agree to the terms and
        conditions almost regardless of what is included in them.
      • An unticked checkbox may lead to the termination of services.
      • Users know that the privacy policies in their country or region may be different
        from the company’s country or the country where the data is stored.
      • New terms of service and privacy policy are not clear or easy to understand
      • There is not a validation method to check if the end user is the one accepting
        the new terms of service and privacy
      • There is not a validation method in case terms are accepted by mistake
        (additional checkbox)
      • If the user wants to change his decision during the process, there is no option
        to go back to previous conditions

(c)   Tap2Talk has decided to share its users’ data with a third party, GlobalConnect.
      This will mean that all user data, such as text messages, locational information
      and media, will be held in GlobalConnect’s database.

      Discuss the impacts of this decision for Tap2Talk users.                             [8]

      Answer may include:

      Advantages for the users
      • They can enjoy highly personalized / targeted product suggestions.
      • Locational information may let the company combine user’s movements with
        information from other people and deliver services that benefit everyone.
      • This may minimize marketing communications irrelevant to them.
      • They can receive offers to help them save money on the things they buy often
      • They may get recommendations to try something new.
      • Users may have better backup capabilities – text message and media stored
        in GlobalConnect’s servers may help the user retrieve them if they are
        lost/deleted from their device.

      Disadvantages for the users
      • The pictures, text messages, locational information stored in GlobalConnect
         database may be hacked and misused.
      • They may be concerned about the breach of their personal data and the risks
         associated with identity theft.
      • User may not be aware of how their data is going to be used by
         GlobalConnect.
      • Users may be concerned about the confidentiality of their data, e.g. they may
         not be willing to disclose places of their visit to GlobalConnect or any third

                   Answers may include:
                   • Supervised learning – algorithm learns with a specific dataset provided
                     by a programmer, provides answers that can be used to evaluate its
                     accuracy on training data.
                   • Unsupervised learning – provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries
                     to make sense of by extracting features and patterns / it is a self-learning
                     technique without human intervention.

(b)   Explain the difference between an artificial neural network (ANN) and an expert system.   [6]

      Answers may include:
      • ANNs are based on statistical modeling of data which can process data input
        from multiple machine learning algorithms.
      • ANN have the ability to learn themselves and produce output that is not limited to
        the input provided.
      • ANNs learn from examples so they can work through real-time events.
      • ANNs can perform multiple tasks in parallel without affecting the system
        performance.
      • Input is stored in its own network not a database, so the loss of data does not
        affect how it works.
      • Machine learning can adapt to changes in circumstances more rapidly.
      • Expert systems are rule based systems which means their capabilities are
        restricted to the information within them – ANNs can answer new questions.
      • Expert system uses if-then statements when doing inference which cannot
        accommodate possible answers that are not binary.
      • Expert systems require new rules to be created to increase their capabilities
        whereas ANNs can learn from examples.

(c)   Discuss the impact on Coco Financial of using artificial intelligence (AI)
      algorithms to detect fraud.                                                           [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of using AI algorithms to detect fraud
      • Can collect data faster using this method – providing faster results.
      • Error rate is much lower – the algorithms follow rules and does not deviate
        from them.
      • Carries out data analysis – provides information enabling users to see trends.
      • Eliminates the straight forward cases – allow employees at Coco Financial to
        focus on unusual cases that do not appear solvable by the AI.
      • Increased success of the AI algorithms will lead to the AI system being trusted
        – more cases checked using it (a virtuous circle).

      Disadvantages of using AI algorithms to detect fraud
      • It takes time and money to train the software.
      • AI algorithms may provide results but not the analysis that leads to the results.
      • AI algorithms do not provide a human perspective – information may be
         skewed / analysed using incorrect algorithmic assumptions.
      • There may be algorithmic bias.
      • Employees at Coco Financial will still need to check the data being input to
         ensure it is accurate or incorrect data input will lead to incorrect outcomes.
      • Employees at Coco Financial will need to ensure that external factors such as
         changes in the law are incorporated.

                   • Data labelling is not necessary, so it saves time
                   • …because the algorithm will learn for itself

                   • May allow for hidden patterns / correlations to be found in the data / able
                     to perform thousands of routines, repetitive tasks within a relatively
                     shorter period of time compared / subjective defects which are hard to
                     train like minor product labeling errors etc. can be detected

(b)   TSE Global needs to decide whether to use black-box or white-box testing.

      Analyse these two options.                                                            [6]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of white-box testing
      • It is internal software testing and can find internal errors.
      • This type of testing of software is started after detail design document / early
        in the SDLC.
      • Applicable to the lower levels of software testing.
      • It is suitable for algorithm testing.
      • Data domains along with inner or internal boundaries can be better tested.
        Focuses on the code rather than the user.
      • Easier to automate as the testing is carried out at a modular scale (rather than
        the whole product).

      Advantages of black-box testing
      • No knowledge of implementation is needed.
      • No knowledge of the internal structure of the code is required as it only tests
        the operation of the system.
      • It is less time consuming.
      • It is cheaper.
      • Can be done by trial and error ways and methods.
      • Focuses on the end user.

(c)   Discuss whether TSE Global should incorporate ethical design at each stage of
      software development.                                                                [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of ethical design being used at each stage of the software
      development process:
      • The software design is predicated on the principal of not causing harm / being
        beneficial in use.
      • Transparency which may lead to increased trust in the software.
      • May be able to identify algorithmic bias as the steps involved in testing may be
        discreet enough for this to be determined.
      • Can identify errors within the system at each stage (so they do not perpetuate
        themselves in subsequent stages).
      • The increased focus on ethical design may lead to an understanding of how
        (ethical) hackers may be trying to gain unauthorized access to an
        organization's network.

      Disadvantages of ethical design being used at each stage of the software
      development process:
      • Involving with a range of stakeholders at each stage will lead to an increase in
         development time (which may have commercial ramifications in a commercial
         environment).
      • The increased involvement of stakeholders may lead to increased costs in the
         development of the software, and this may make it not viable financially.
      • Increased transparency may lead to compromising of sensitive company

6.   Autonomous underwater robots

     (a)   (i)     Identify two sensors required by the autonomous underwater robots.            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Pressure sensor
                   • Altimeter
                   • Tilt sensor
                   • Gyro
                   • Magnetic compass
                   • Navigation acoustic sensor
                   • Camera (vison sensor)
                   • Proximity sensor
                   • Temperature sensor
                   • Infra-red sensor
                   • pH sensor.

                   Award [1] for each sensor identified, up to [2].

           (ii)    Identify two items of data that could be collected by the autonomous
                   underwater robots.                                                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Water temperature
                   • Salinity / pH
                   • Coral hardness
                   • Quantity of nutrients.

                   Award [1] for each of the items stated above, up to [2].

           (iii)   Identify two advantages of fuzzy logic compared to inference rules.           [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Fuzzy logic has variable processing, which allows for multiple non-binary
                     values to be processed with the same variable.
                   • Fuzzy logic attempts to solve problems with an open range of data that
                     makes it possible to obtain an array of conclusions.
                   • Fuzzy logic considers all available information and making the best
                     possible decision given the input.
                   • It is useful in complex situations where judgement and reasoning are
                     involved.

                   Award [1] for each advantage of using fuzzy logic compared to inference
                   rules, up to [2].

(b)   (i)    Explain one reason why an agile project development (scrum) methodology
             would be used for the development of the underwater robots.                      [2]

             Answers may include:
             • The area underwater robotics is constantly evolving – the agile method
               allows the developers to constantly make changes.
             • Allows the client to be involved throughout the process.
             • More adaptable than using a waterfall project development
               methodology.
             • Able to eliminate / change approaches that do not work.
             • May lead to greater specialization during the development leading to
               better outcomes.

             Award [1] for the identification of a reason why an agile project development
             methodology and [1] for the explanation of that reason, up to [2].

      (ii)   Explain two reasons why prototyping would be used in the development of
             the autonomous underwater robots.                                                [4]

             Answers may include:
             • Show the client what to expect
             • Reduce revising the project, eliminate approaches that don’t work

             • Test the design
             • Allows clients to make changes, get feedback to help improve the product

             • Gives more information about the potential costs
             • Which allows the developer to make an informed decision about whether to
               develop the final product

             Award [1] for the identification of a reason why prototyping would be used and
             [1] for the explanation of that reason, up to [2].

             Mark as [2] + [2].

(c)   Discuss whether autonomous underwater robots instead of humans should be
      used to monitor the condition of coral reefs and make decisions, such as whether
      to restore them.                                                                     [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of autonomous underwater robots over humans
      • Robots do not make decision based on emotion – preservation of coral reefs
        is an emotive topic and humans could be biased.
      • Robots do not get tired or need time off - work can proceed faster – time is
        running out with climate change affecting reefs.
      • A number of autonomous robots working together would be able to monitor a
        larger area of coral than a team of divers.
      • The increased information being gathered by the autonomous robots would
        allow more detailed analysis / modelling of the coral reef.
      • Decision making is likely to be consistent between swarms of autonomous
        robots.
      • The autonomous robots may be linked to AI to process this information and
        better decision making linked to the preservation / sustainability of the coral
        reef being made.
      • Robots can reach places that are too dangerous.
      • Robots can perform repetitive tasks.
      • Robots can collect more data than humans.

      Disadvantages of autonomous robots over humans
      • The initial cost of using the autonomous robots may be greater than using a
         team of divers.
      • The autonomous robots may need to be trained using data sets of existing
         coral reefs.
      • Are there likely to be enough datasets that can be used for this purpose /
         different coral reefs may have subtle differences in their ecosystems (water
         temp / pH) which may impact on the decision making.
      • Can the autonomous robots be programmed to understand the human
         emotions that may mean that areas of reef that hold emotional attachment
         may be left to die.
      • Can the autonomous robot be trusted to make the right decision?

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
