The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of responses we
may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible answers should be
appropriately rewarded if relevant.

1.   Define the term gender and describe how it is understood and applied in the context of
     the passage.                                                                                      [4]

     This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and
     understanding of the term “gender” and apply it in relation to the text. Candidates may
     write in terms of any of the following guidelines, but other definitions or applications will
     also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the passage.

     Possible ways of defining the term:
     • as a constitutive element of social relations based on culturally constructed
       distinctions relating to sex
     • as a fundamental way of signifying power relations, with reference to hegemonic
       masculinity
     • in relation to inequality and distribution of status, resources, values
     • as a category of analysis that rejects biological determinism
     • In relation to gender roles or performance, gender expression, gender identity or
       gender socialization
     • In relation to Judith Butler’s theory.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples of description and application:
     • Hegemonic masculinity in regard to white, middle-class males
     • Hipster challenges to this
     • Gender fluidity
     • Multiple masculinities
     • Gender in relation to sexualities.

     Other appropriate applications should be credited.

         Marks       Level descriptor
           0         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
          1–2        The response demonstrates a basic knowledge and understanding of the
                     concept.
                     There is a partial application of the concept in relation to the text.
          3–4        The response demonstrates sound knowledge and understanding of the
                     concept; the concept is described in detail.
                     The concept is clearly applied in relation to the text.

2.   Analyse the ethnographic data presented in the passage using the concept of society.           [6]

     This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
     ethnographic text using the key concept of society to help make sense of the
     ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
     understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the
     context of the passage, developing an analysis with reference to the ethnographic data
     of the extract.

     Possible ways of defining the key concept:
     • The organization of people into groups and networks and interrelationships
     • Also sustained by social relations and institutions, norms, values, statuses, and roles
     • Groups with some coherence that distinguish themselves from other groups.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples and ways of analysing:
     • Hipsters as a distinct social group/subculture
     • Social class
     • Social norms (career, family)
     • Social networks (hipsters, family)
     • In relation to conflict and social conformity
     • Race/ethnicity
     • Structure and agency
     • Friendship/kinship.

     Other appropriate examples and ways of analyzing should be credited.

        Marks       Level descriptor
          0         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
         1–2        The response offers a common-sense or superficial understanding of the
                    key concept.
                    There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some
                    ethnographic examples are presented but these are only partially relevant.
          3–4       The response demonstrates an understanding of the key concept and
                    establishes its relevance to the text.
                    There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are
                    some inconsistencies.
                    Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the
                    analysis.
          5–6       The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept,
                    discussing this in the context of the text.
                    There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a
                    detailed interpretation of the ethnographic data.
                    Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.
                                                  –5–                 N22/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of identity or culture is
     evident in this passage with how it is evident in one ethnographic example you have
     studied.                                                                                  [10]

     Candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other
     contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must
     demonstrate an understanding of how either the key concept of identity or culture
     relates to this ethnographic context. Either of the key concepts on which such
     comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any
     anthropological issues raised by the text.

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates
     should be able to establish a relevant comparison with any other group or society
     based on either of these concepts. The response should be structured as a
     comparison, highlighting similarities and differences. Candidates must situate the
     comparative case in terms of place, author and fieldwork context.

     For identity, possible ways of defining the key concept include the following:
     • Personal view of the self or view of an individual in the eyes of a group
     • Group identity (age, class, ethnicity, subculture)
     • Career as an identity marker
     • Gender, masculinity and sexuality
     • Idea of imagined community.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples from the text about identity may include:
     • Hipster as subcultural identity
     • Performing identity through work, art, consumption, relationships
     • Constructing own masculinity in contrast to hegemony.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

     For culture, possible ways of defining the key concept include:
     • Organized system of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs, and material production
       that humans create and manipulate in their daily lives (see pp. 133-4 of TSM).
     • Shared social construction of meanings
     • Such meanings are not static, but dynamic, fluid and can be contested.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples from the text about culture may include:
     • Culture and subculture
     • Construction of masculinity
     • Hegemonic masculinity
     • Hipster values e.g. art and creative careers
     • Exclusivity of subcultural membership and ethnocentrism
     • Hegemonic culture and subcultural resistance and/or accommodation
     • Interrelation between class, ethnicity, and culture/subculture.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

4.   Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in
     this passage to the approaches to research used by one other anthropologist you have
     studied. Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.            [10]

     Here, candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis
     on the methodological and theoretical perspectives of the ethnographer as the focus on
     which such comparisons should be established.

     By “approaches to research” the question essentially refers to the research methods
     used by the anthropologist to gather data.

     Possible comparative examples regarding approaches may include:
     • Multi-sited ethnographies
     • Ethnography close to home
     • Using friends as gatekeepers
     • Participant observation
     • Informal/ethnographic interviews
     • Content analysis of print and online material.

     Candidates may also make mention of other relevant methodological terms. For example:
     • qualitative methods
     • insider/outsider
     • access to the field
     • rapport.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

Identification of ethnographic material includes: fieldwork location(s), fieldwork
context(s)*, group(s) studied, and ethnographer(s).
*Fieldwork context refers to when the fieldwork was carried out regardless of the
publication date of the material.


     Marks      Level descriptor
       0        The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
      1–2       Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented but in limited detail;
                relevance is only partially established.
                The response is not structured as a compare and contrast.
                The identification of ethnographic material is missing.
      3–4       Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented and although this is
                in limited detail, its relevance is established.
                The response is structured as a compare and contrast, but this is not
                balanced and lacks detail.
                The identification of ethnographic material is partially complete.
      5–6       Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is
                established and explained.
                The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast; however,
                either comparison (similarities) or contrasts (differences) are explained in
                detail, but not both.
                The identification of ethnographic material is mostly complete.
      7–8       Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is clearly
                established and explained in detail.
                The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast with
                comparisons (similarities) and contrasts (differences) being discussed in
                detail, although this is not balanced.
                The response demonstrates anthropological understanding.
                The identification of ethnographic material is mostly complete.
    Capped      If fieldwork location(s), fieldwork context(s), group(s) studied and
     marks      ethnographer(s) have not been fully identified, no more than 8 marks will be
                awarded.
     9–10       Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is clearly
                established and discussed in detail.
                The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast with
                comparisons (similarities) and contrasts (differences) discussed critically.
                The response demonstrates anthropological understanding.
                The identification of the ethnographic material is complete.
