Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Richard I of England (1173–1199) — Impact: Political impact in France: growth in prestige and strength
of the Capetian monarchy; expansion of royal control.

Source A                Rigord, a 12th century French historian, writing about the life and deeds
                        of the Capetian monarch Philip II in the chronicle Gesta Philippi Augusti
                        (completed c1207).

In the year 1193, King Philip II raised troops and went to take Gisors; shortly after, he took in his power
all the Norman region of Vexin, that the King of England had usurped. After taking Gisors and the whole
March of Normandy, King Philip II returned to Saint-Denis, which the King of England Henry II and his
son Richard I, had long kept by force, against all rights …

As winter approached, King Philip II, having raised an army, invaded Normandy. There he took the city
of Evreux and subdued [captured] other strongholds, destroying several; he took a large number of
prisoners and laid siege to Rouen. But, after having examined the fortifications of this city [Rouen] and
calculated what such an attack would cost him, he despaired and withdrew at last. He ceased the war
and concluded an agreement with John, nicknamed Lackland, brother of the King of England. It was an
uncertain treaty of alliance, for events soon proved to Philip II all the bad faith of his enemy.


Source B                Jonathan Duncan, an historian specializing in French history, writing in the
                        academic book The Dukes of Normandy (1839).

Philip II thought that the favourable moment had arrived to take away Richard I’s control of his continental
dominions, but Philip II was still under the obligation of his oath to Richard, and Pope Celestine had
refused to absolve him from it.

Philip II now pursued a different line of policy. He offered Prince John his sister Alice in marriage and
promised to aid him in seizing the crown of England, provided he would give up Gisors, the Vexin, Tours,
and the whole of Normandy, except Rouen and its territory.

John, who was surnamed Lackland, because he never received any independent estates from his father,
gladly listened to these proposals, and signed the treaty. John then paid homage to the King of France
for all the domains he held in that country; after which he collected troops, and attacked England, but
being opposed by the barons, he only succeeded in capturing some few castles of little importance.

While these negotiations were proceeding, Philip II sent word to Richard I that he could no longer
recognize him as one of his vassals, and ordered the seneschal of Normandy to place in his hands all
the fortresses of the province. The misfortunes and the captivity of Richard I made men forget his faults.
The seneschal resisted Philip II in the field; and the English territories beyond the Loire were defended
by the King of Navarre, father-in-law to Richard I.
                                                         –3–                                                  8822 – 5302


Source C                 Jim Bradbury, an historian specializing in the military history of the Middle Ages,
                         writing in the academic book Philip Augustus: King of France 1180–1223 (1998).

Philip II sought to gain advantage from his early return from the Holy Land. He had been accused of
planning an invasion of Richard I’s lands despite his oath to him, and only stopped because the French
barons opposed it, but this seems to be a lie. Philip II’s plans were more subtle and could be considered
legal. He properly claimed the lands promised by Richard at Messina, the return of his abandoned sister
Alice, together with her dowry lands, including Gisors.

Philip II met the seneschal and nobles of Normandy and handed to the seneschal the agreement made
in Messina. [Richard I] the Lionheart’s men refused to accept the legality of the document, questioning
Philip II’s claim. Richard I had also sent back men to guard strategic strongholds. Gisors and territory in
the Vexin were the lands in question.

Philip II managed to use Alice by suggesting her marriage to John, as he tried to win over John by
promises. John was dissatisfied with his position and was willing to listen to Philip II’s suggestions. Only
the advice of Richard I’s ministers and his mother Eleanor stopped him from joining Philip II.

                         (2017).

In 1937 the Japanese occupied Beijing and the Nationalist capital, Nanjing, then in 1938 they took the
temporary capital at Wuhan. Each time, the Nationalists moved their capital inland, settling in 1938 in
Chongqing, Sichuan … Despite numerous Japanese offensives after 1938 they failed to hold the new
territory. Japan’s army needed to concentrate to fight Nationalist armies, but also to scatter [disperse]
to fight Mao’s guerrillas. However, it could not do both simultaneously. As soon as the Japanese army
departed for battles elsewhere, Communist forces returned … As the Japanese pushed ever further from
the sea they overextended the supply lines needed to support their military. While the Chinese could not
defeat Japan, they could still deny it a rapid victory as Japan lacked the forces to control China’s vast
size. Japan’s military strategy also made its economic goals unachievable by causing the collapse of
the Chinese economy. Unfortunately for Japan, its military strategy destroyed the Chinese economy and
also undermined its own home economy. From 1937 onward territorial expansion no longer benefited
the Japanese economy. On the contrary, it became an increasing burden so that by 1940 the Japanese
faced food shortages at home.

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

Read sources M to P and answer questions 13 to 16. The sources and questions relate to case study
2: Apartheid South Africa (1948–1964) — Protests and action: Increasing violence: the Sharpeville
massacre (1960) and the decision to adopt the armed struggle.

Source M                P J Wessels, the commission appointed judge, presenting his findings in the
                        Commission of Enquiry Report into the Occurrences at Sharpeville (15 June 1960).

There was a detailed examination about the steps which police officers should have taken to disperse
the large crowd before they opened fire. In my opinion this is not the issue. The police justify their actions
by referring to the conduct of the demonstrators, which was regarded as an attack. The police say they
fired because their lives were in danger. That, at any rate, is the pattern of the evidence of all of the
police who testified before me. Naturally, I did not call all the police who fired as witnesses but there is no
reason to believe that any fired simply to disperse the crowd. The police and especially the officers were
aware of the steps which should have been taken before force was used to disperse the crowd. Their
conduct at other demonstrations that day is evidence of this.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Rwanda (1990–1998) — Causes of the conflict: Other causes: colonial legacy.

Source Q                 Paul J Magnarella, a professor of Peace and Justice Studies, writing in the
                         academic article “The Background and Causes of the Genocide in Rwanda” for
                         the Journal of International Criminal Justice (2005).

During 1933–34 the Belgians conducted a census and introduced an identity card system that indicated
the Tutsi, Hutu or Twa “ethnicity” of each person. The Belgians used ownership of cows as the key
criterion for determining which group an individual belonged to … The criterion used had pre-colonial
origins. One cannot blame the Belgians for having created ethnic divisions among Rwandan groups …

This practice, which was carried on until its abolition by the 1994 post-genocide government, had
the unfortunate consequence of firmly attaching a sub-national identity to all Rwandans and firmly
dividing them into categories. For many people this carried a negative history of either dominance or
subordination, superiority or inferiority, and exploitation. In their “Hutu Manifesto” of 1957, Hutu leaders
referred to the identity card categories as “races”, indicating how inflexible these labels had become in
their minds.

                   [Source: Magnarella, P. J., The Background and Causes of the Genocide in Rwanda,
                     Journal of International Criminal Justice, 2005, Volume 3, Issue 4, pp. 801–822,

Source R                 An extract from the “Hutu Manifesto”, written by Hutu intellectuals to address the
                         issue of race relations to the 1957 United Nations (UN) Visiting Mission
                         (24 March 1957).

What is the indigenous racial problem? The problem is above all else a problem of political monopoly
owned by one race, the Tutsi. A political monopoly which given the current structures, also becomes an
economic monopoly … much to the Hutu’s despair, who see themselves as forced to remain as eternal
manual labourers …

We demand action be taken from above …

We ask Belgium to give up forcing the Hutu to constantly follow in the Tutsi’s footsteps. We ask that in
social relations, for example, we abandon the custom of requiring the Hutu to behave like the Tutsi in
order to be considered socially acceptable. Because if we claim to respect cultures, it is also important to
acknowledge the differences in Rwandan culture …

People have taken notice of the indirect [Belgian] administration’s support of the Tutsi monopoly. In
order to monitor this racial monopoly, we strongly oppose – at least for now – the removal of the “Hutu”,
“Tutsi”, “Twa” categories in official identification documents. Their removal is likely to further promote the
advantage [of the Tutsi] by preventing statistics from reflecting the Tutsi monopoly. No one said that it
was the name that bothered the Hutu; it is rather the privileges of a favoured Tutsi monopoly, which runs
the risk of reducing the majority of the population to systematic [institutionalized] inferiority …

We are committed to warn the authorities against the dangers that could result, sooner or later, from the
continuation of a racist monopoly in Rwanda.

Source S               Charles Andre, a professor of neurology, writing for the academic journal
                       Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria [Archives of Neuropsychiatry] (2017).

From 1933 onwards, everybody was issued a racial identity card stating his or her original ethnic group.
Belgian officials came to the region to classify people according to stereotypical anatomical features.
Head, face and body measurements were taken to determine the ethnic classification of the population.
Tutsis had a taller stature. The head shape, eye colour, skin tone (lighter) and the size of the noses
(longer and narrower) were considered to resemble white Europeans.

This classification system had lasting consequences. It was still in use and became a central tool to
rapidly identify and kill Tutsis during the 1994 genocide …

The importance of explicit racial classification of the Rwandan population, introduced by Belgian
colonizers, must not be underestimated as a driving force for ethnic discrimination and hatred. Before the
arrival of the Belgians, Tutsi and Hutu people did not see each other as different races, but both sides
soon brought racial issues into their discourse and later as a justification for violence.
