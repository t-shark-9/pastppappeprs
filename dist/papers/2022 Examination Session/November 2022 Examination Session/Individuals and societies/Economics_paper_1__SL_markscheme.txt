1.     (a)   Explain two forms of government intervention in markets.                                 [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: government intervention, markets.
             • Theory: explanation of any two of the following forms of government
               intervention: price ceilings (maximum prices), price floors (minimum prices),
               indirect taxes, subsidies, direct provision of services, command and control
               regulation and/or legislation. An import tariff intervention and related diagram
               is equally rewarded.
             • Diagram: showing how governments intervene in markets (price ceilings, price
               floors, indirect taxes and/or subsidies).

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one form of government intervention
             is explained.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the view that governments should intervene if

        be provided, benefits derived from government provision vs. private sector
        provision, costs of provision.

        have not intervened in response to public goods.

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: fiscal policy.
             • Theory: explanation of any two of the following goals: low and stable inflation,
               low unemployment, increase short run economic growth, promote a stable
               economic environment for long-term growth, reduce business cycle
               fluctuations, equitable distribution of income and/or external balance.
             • Diagram: Appropriate diagram(s) to show attainment of the two goals chosen.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one goal of fiscal policy is explained.

             Candidates who explain and diagram the supply-side effects of fiscal policy
             should also be fully rewarded.

             The goals of fiscal policy can be explained either through why it is used (eg
             stable inflation) or how it is used (eg cutting tax). Both approaches should be
             equally rewarded.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the use of fiscal policy to close a

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: fiscal policy, deflationary/recessionary gap.
      • Theory: explanation of how expansionary fiscal policy will increase AD moving
        the economy closer to its full employment level, closing a
        deflationary/recessionary gap.
      • Diagram: AD/AS diagram to illustrate expansionary fiscal policy to close a
        deflationary/recessionary gap.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): effectiveness depends on the shape of the aggregate
        supply curve and where the economy is operating; potential strengths of fiscal
        policy such as targeting of specific sectors and effectiveness in a deep
        recession; potential constraints on fiscal policy such as political pressures,
        time lags and sustainable debt; possible conflicts with other macroeconomic
        objectives, monetary and/or supply-side policies might be considered as
        alternatives, but the emphasis of the response should be on fiscal policy.
      • Example(s): real-world examples of where governments have attempted to
        close a deflationary/recessionary gap using fiscal policy.

      part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

3.     (a)   Explain two factors that might cause an appreciation of a currency.                      [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: appreciation.
             • Theory: explanation of any two of the following factors: foreign demand for
               exports, domestic demand for imports, inward foreign direct investment,
               inward portfolio investment, remittances, speculation, relative inflation rates,
               relative interest rates, relative growth rates and central bank intervention.
             • Diagram: exchange rate diagram showing appreciation of a currency.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one cause of an appreciation is explained.

             Where students just answer with an increase in demand or a decrease in supply without
             explaining the underlying causes of these changes then a maximum of [6] is rewarded.
