Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed
but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or
significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks
allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be
rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   “Religious factors were the most important reason for the fall of the Umayyads.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the fall
     of the Umayyads was the result of religious factors. Causes may predate the timeframe but must
     be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the opposition from
     religious groups and scholars who denounced the worldly nature of the regime. Opposition from
     the Shi'a sect which denied the Umayyad right to the Caliphate was constant and gained support in
     Iran and other areas. Other relevant factors may be addressed such as the Umayyad
     discrimination against non-Arabs and a series of weak caliphs after 800 CE. Tribal revolts caused
     by opposition to centralized rule and a large uprising in Iran created rebel armies which the
     Umayyads lacked the strength to defeat. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   To what extent was the decline of ‘Abbasid authority the result of external forces?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
     decline of ‘Abbasid authority was the result of external forces. Causes may pre-date the time frame
     but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the constant
     assault on the Empire from nomadic tribes such as the Seljuks and Mongols. Conflict with the
     Byzantines, Crusaders, and the Umayyads in Spain resulted in territorial and financial losses. The
     Seljuks took over the Empire in the 11th century and reduced the caliph to a figurehead, furthering
     weakening the central government. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example success
     of religious opponents such as the Fatimids who challenged ‘Abbasid rule. The reduced quality of
     leadership and dynastic rivalry caused decline, as did financial mismanagement which led to
     seizure of land and power by local authorities. The size and complexity of the Empire made it hard
     to rule and produced many separatist movements which reduced central control. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   “Religious factors were the most important reason for the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that religious factors were the most important reason for the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty.
     Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may discuss the appeal of the Fatimid ideology to dissident Islamic sects who opposed
     the ‘Abbasids. The Fatimid belief in the Mahdi attracted many to whom a belief in a better future
     proved appealing. The missionary system of the Fatimids was crucial in spreading their beliefs
     over a wide area and attracting adherents. Their inclusivity and belief in tolerance for all sects and
     faiths was a key religious tenet which gained them many supporters amongst Muslims and non-
     Muslims. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example their military power and strong
     leadership were major reasons for their success in establishing a powerful state. ‘Abbasid
     unpopularity in various regions was also a reason for their success. Their financial and commercial
     connections were crucial in supporting their power and as a means to spread their ideology further.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


4.   To what extent did external challenges cause the decline of the Fatimids?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     external forces were responsible for the decline of the Fatimids. Causes may predate the
     timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
     the resurgence of the Sunni orthodoxy under the Seljuks who opposed the Fatimids and used their
     forces to reduce their territory. The invasion of the Crusaders led to a significant loss of territory
     and prestige which undermined their influence and power. The rise of charismatic Sunni leaders
     such as Saladin led to the overthrow of the Fatimids and the end of their Empire. Other relevant
     factors may be addressed, for example; a series of weak leaders led to internal division and
     factionalism, economic decline in the 12th century weakened their power as did increased ethnic
     strife in the army. Ideological disputes with other Shi’a followers undermined their support as did
     their association with the Assassins. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   “The outcome of the First Crusade (1096–1099) was a result of the military skills of the Crusaders.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     outcome of the First crusade was the result of the military skills of the Crusaders. Causes may
     predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may discuss the military skills and training of the members of the First Crusade, all highly skilled
     soldiers. Their armour and equipment proved very effective against many of the weapons and
     tactics of their opponents. Their siege warfare skills were superior and allowed them to capture and
     hold cities. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the assistance that they received
     from the Byzantine Empire and their religious devotion which enabled them to overcome hardships
     and setbacks. The political and military weakness of their opponents meant that they faced weak
     opposition in many cases. The economic and logistical support of the Italian city states was also a
     key factor in their success. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Evaluate the contribution to Muslim success in the Crusades of two of the following: Nur al-Din,
     Salah ad-Din (Saladin), Baibars.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions to Muslim success in
     the Crusades of two of the named examples. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both or
     prioritize their evaluation of one individual. However, the evaluation of two individuals will be a
     feature of the response. Nur-al-Din’s contributions may include his victory in the Second crusade,
     his creation of a powerful Syrian state and his introduction of the concept of jihad to unify and
     inspire the Muslim forces. Salah ad-Din (Saladin) further unified the Muslims by eliminating the
     Fatimids and continued to unify and strengthen the Muslim forces. He began the recovery of
     Crusader territory for Islam and reconquered Jerusalem which was a huge boost to Muslim power
     and confidence. His excellent military skills led to the reconquest of many Crusader towns and
     castles. His defeat of the Third Crusade prevented any resurgence of Christian power. He did not
     succeed in holding the city of Acre which allowed the Christians to retain some presence in the
     area. Baibars unified Egypt and Syria and defeated the Mongols who were allies of the Christians
     and posed a significant threat. He recaptured Antioch and Nazareth and all other Christian territory,
     reducing them to the city of Acre. He also eliminated the Knights Hospitaller. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –7–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   “Military power was the most important reason for the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that military power was the most important reason for the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans.
     Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may discuss the military skills of the Ottoman leader Osman and his successors who
     led highly trained and skilled armies. The Ottomans possessed large military forces and were
     equipped with modern technology - superior to that of their opponents. Their home territory gave
     them a strategic advantage as it was close to the Balkans making it easy to attack that region.
     Their opponents such as Byzantium and the Balkan states were weak and in decline which made it
     hard for them to resist. The Ottoman invaders were popular with the population of the Balkans who
     welcomed them and helped them overthrow their native rulers. The Ottomans faced no opposition
     from the Western powers who could not co-operate to oppose their expansion into Europe. The
     Ottomans received aid from Western sources such as the Genoese who were anxious to obtain
     trading concessions in the Balkans. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the reasons for the fall of Constantinople (1453).

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the fall of
     Constantinople in 1453. Candidates may evaluate the strength of the overall Ottoman strategy
     which involved building fortifications on the opposite side of the Bosporus to bombard the city and
     cut off its trade and communications. The Ottomans had a very large army, well-trained and
     equipped. Their siege guns were the largest in the world and the first to be able to smash the walls
     of Constantinople. The Ottomans used innovative technology such as bringing ships overland to
     the Golden Horn to destroy the Byzantine fleet and to attack the city at its weakest points. The
     weakness of the Byzantine Empire was a factor as it did not have the population, military or
     economic power to oppose the Ottomans for any length of time. The garrison of Constantinople
     was only 7000 strong. As such they were unable to defend all the walls and were greatly
     outnumbered by the Ottomans. Another factor was the failure of the west to provide aid to
     Constantinople against the Ottomans; even their Venetian allies abandoned them as a lost cause.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Compare and contrast the reasons for the rise of the Ghana Empire and the Mali Empire.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the reasons for the rise of the Ghana Empire and the Mali Empire, referring to both throughout.
      There does not need to be an equal number of each. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. For comparisons, candidates may refer to
      the similar geographical locations of the two Empires. Positioned at the nexus of a series of trans-
      Saharan trade routes in gold and salt which connected west Africa to North Africa and the
      Mediterranean, each empire was able to engage in this lucrative trade while levying taxes on
      passing caravans. This wealth allowed the two empires to expand territory and control more trade
      routes and goldfields, further contributing to their rise. Another reason for the rise of the two
      empires was the powerful state created at an early stage in the emergence of each. For contrasts,
      candidates may refer to the role played by a single individual, Sundiata Keita, in the rise of the Mali
      Empire, which meant that its rise was more sudden. Candidates may also refer to the importance
      of military conquest to the rise of the Mali Empire, unlike the Ghana Empire which emerged mainly
      due to its control of trade.


10.   Examine the importance of trade to the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili culture.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the expansion of
      trade in the Indian Ocean region and the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili culture.
      Assessment of importance may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may examine the geographical reach of the Indian Ocean
      trade, which meant that the emerging Swahili city states came into contact with far-flung regions
      such as the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, India and the Far East. Many foreign traders settled in the
      city states and some married into Swahili society. Due to trade, Swahili, which incorporated words
      from other languages, emerged as a lingua franca. This made communication easier and
      contributed to the development of a cultural melting pot. Later on, the growing political influence of
      Oman and Portugal contributed to cosmopolitanism. Other relevant interrelationships may be
      considered, for example between the Islamic faith and the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili
      culture, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   “The Mfecane/Difaqane was mainly caused by the actions of Shaka.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Mfecane/Difaqane was mainly caused by the actions of Shaka. Causes may predate the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may argue that the
      immediate cause of the Mfecane was a Zulu attack on the neighbouring Ndwandwe. Shaka had
      turned the Zulu army into a formidable fighting force, with the introduction an age grade regimental
      system and the adoption of new weapons and military tactics. Candidates may also refer to
      Shaka’s complex and violent personality. Zulu culture, which Shaka promoted, was based on cattle
      wealth and the assimilation of the women and children of defeated enemies into Zulu society. This
      provided an incentive for the Zulu to attack other groups. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      such as the role played by other groups such as the Ndebele, the prolonged drought which led to
      increased tensions across the region, competition between Nguni kingdoms to control trade with
      the Portuguese, and the destabilising effects on the region of slave raids from the Cape, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “Responses to external threats were the main cause of the unification and expansion of Ethiopia.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that responses to external threats were the main cause of the unification and expansion of
      Ethiopia. Candidates may discuss Tewodros’s success in building a powerful standing army and
      acquiring modern weaponry, which allowed him to withstand external threats from Egypt and the
      Ottoman Empire. However, his response to the Napier Expedition was a failure and resulted in his
      suicide. Yohannes consolidated the unification and expansion of his state through victories over
      Egyptians at the Battle of Gura and the Sudanese at the Battle of Kufit. Menelik defeated the
      Italians at the Battle of Adowa and then negotiated with the British Empire to secure favourable
      frontiers in the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1897. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for
      example effective leadership and administration, economic factors, and the elimination of internal
      rivals, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   “The ending of the Atlantic slave trade had no impact on the East African slave trade.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      ending of the Atlantic slave trade had no impact on the East African slave trade. Candidates may
      refer to the fact that the East African slave trade was already well-established in the nineteenth
      century, and that any surge in the trade can be explained by internal factors such as increased
      labour demand from clove plantations. They may argue that the ending of the Atlantic trade
      resulted from reduced demand for slaves from the Caribbean, which meant there was no
      significant shift in demand to East Africa. They may note that the same pressures which led to the
      British ban on the Atlantic slave trade were eventually brought to bear on the East African trade
      too. This led not to a boost in the trade, but to its eventual demise. Alternatively, candidates may
      argue that the ending of the Atlantic trade led directly to a sharp increase in the East African trade
      in the early to mid-nineteenth century. They may note that plantations in Brazil remained labour-
      intensive until well into the nineteenth century, meaning that demand from the western hemisphere
      remained strong. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


14.   Examine the significance of industrialization and economic changes to the decline of the Atlantic
      slave trade.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between industrialisation and
      economic changes and the decline of the Atlantic slave trade. Candidates may examine the
      importance of the industrial revolution to the British economy. This meant that Caribbean sugar,
      and the triangular trade between Britain, West Africa and the Caribbean, were no longer essential
      to its overall economic success. However, candidates may also refer to the fact that British sugar
      imports actually increased in the late eighteenth century, while also noting that much of the trade
      was now sourced from alternative markets such as Brazil and Cuba. Candidates may examine
      increases in mechanization on the sugar plantations, which resulted in reduced labour demand.
      Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example the significance of humanitarian
      activity and slave revolts to the decline of the slave trade, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   Examine the contribution of European traders, missionaries and explorers to the growth of
      European interest in Africa.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the activities of
      European traders, missionaries and explorers and the growth of European interest in Africa.
      Contributions may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of traders, missionaries and explorers, or they may
      prioritize their examination of one or two of these groups. However, all three will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to the connection between the groups. Livingstone, himself a
      missionary and explorer, extolled the virtues of the “three C’s” of colonialism: Christianity,
      commerce and civilisation. Missionary activity was often a route to colonisation, with governments
      keen to consolidate gains made by missionary groups as “the flag followed the cross”. On the
      coast of West Africa especially, European powers established forts to protect the commercial
      activities of traders, who used this protection to push into the interior. Exploits of explorers led to
      growing public enthusiasm for colonisation, and some explorers such as Stanley, de Brazza and
      Peters became forward agents of colonialism. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Examine the significance of the military and political weaknesses of African states to the partition
      of Africa.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the military and
      political weaknesses of African states and the partition of Africa. Weaknesses may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Significance may
      extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may examine the stark disparity in military power between African states and their
      European counterparts. European powers had well-trained professional armies equipped with
      modern industrial weaponry like machine guns, in contrast to the traditional weapons used by
      African troops. African states that were able to acquire modern weapons, like the Ethiopians and
      Mandinka, were able to hold their own in warfare against European rivals. Politically, some African
      empires such as Kanem-Bornu had collapsed or fragmented prior to the arrival of Europeans,
      meaning that the latter were faced with smaller, weaker kingdoms. African politics was
      characterised by rivalry and colonizers were able to take advantage using the strategy of “divide
      and conquer”. The effects of regional warfare (such as the Mfecane) often facilitated colonization.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   Discuss the reasons for the success and failure of Mandinka resistance to French rule.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the success and failure of Mandinka resistance to French rule. Reasons may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of success and failure, or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. For success, candidates may discuss the political
      and military leadership of Samori Toure. Samori was able to raise a well-trained professional army
      and use his ability as a trader to acquire weapons from Sierra Leone. His tactical flexibility allowed
      him to repeatedly outmanoeuvre the French, and his success as a guerrilla strategist allowed the
      Mandinka to sustain resistance even after defeat in conventional warfare. For failure, they may
      discuss Samori’s failure to secure allies, such as the British or the Asante. He was unable to buy
      weapons after the Brussels Convention of 1890. By 1898 the French had quelled resistance
      elsewhere in West Africa and were able to turn their full military might on the Mandinka.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


18.   “The results of collaboration were mostly positive for African rulers and their states.” Discuss with
      reference to two of the following: Lewanika, Khama, Apolo Kagwa.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the results of collaboration were mostly positive for African rulers and their states, with
      reference to two of the three named rulers. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      the two rulers selected or they may prioritize their discussion of either. However, both will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may discuss that collaboration meant that African states
      avoided military confrontation with European armies, probably ensuring their survival. Leaders
      such as Lewanika and Khama were able to retain their crowns under colonialism while Apolo
      Kagwa was appointed prime minister, and were often able to exercise sub-imperialism by
      dominating traditional rivals. Leaders and their supporters often formed a political and economic
      elite in the new dispensation. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example the argument
      that the results of collaboration were negative because it entailed a loss of full independence, or
      because it did not always go to plan, as was the case for Lewanika in his negotiations with the
      British South Africa Company, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Discuss the reasons for the creation and collapse of the Central African Federation.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the creation and collapse of the Central African Federation. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of the reasons for creation and collapse, or they may prioritize their discussion of either. However,
      both will be a feature of the response. For creation, candidates may discuss settler pressure on the
      colonial authorities, with the smaller settler communities in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland
      feeling that throwing in their lot with Southern Rhodesia would be the best guarantee of their
      interests. There was a sense that the three territories were already economically inter-dependent,
      and that federation would promote further development by creating a larger pool of cheap African
      labour. Another factor was the election in Britain in 1951 of a Conservative government that
      favoured federation. For collapse, candidates may argue that African resistance to federation was
      led by new nationalist leaders like Banda and Kaunda, who demanded an immediate end to
      federation and full independence. There was also growing resentment within the federation of the
      domination of Southern Rhodesia and its headstrong prime minister Roy Zelensky. Meanwhile,
      developments elsewhere in Africa suggested that a white-dominated regional federation was no
      longer tenable. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


20.   Compare and contrast economic development in Nigeria and Senegal during the colonial period.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      economic development in Nigeria and Senegal during the colonial period, referring to both
      throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. For comparison, candidates may
      refer to the export-oriented economic model followed by the colonial authorities in each colony,
      with small-scale peasant-based production of cash crops such as groundnuts favoured in each.
      Taxes on peasant production were used to pay for the cost of colonial administration in both
      colonies. Spending on public services such as education and healthcare was limited, although
      there was some investment in transport infrastructure, initially railways and then roads, during the
      early period of colonisation. Candidates may note that there was some development of industry in
      each colony, particularly in urban areas. For contrast, candidates may note that the colonial
      economy of Nigeria was considerably more diversified: cotton, palm oil and tin were produced in
      large quantities in addition to groundnuts. The economy of Senegal was closely integrated with that
      of other parts of French West Africa, while Nigeria’s economy was more independent.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Evaluate the contribution of leaders and leadership to the achievement of independence in Angola.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of leaders and
      leadership to the achievement of independence in Angola, weighing up their significance or
      otherwise. Candidates may evaluate the creation of the MPLA in 1956 by Agostinho Neto and
      other radical nationalists. Neto was able to build a coalition of anti-colonial parties from other parts
      of Portuguese Africa. The liberation war began in 1961 with a series of MPLA-led attacks in
      Luanda and an invasion of northern Angola by Holden Roberto’s UPA (later FNLA). Candidates
      may evaluate the significance of Jonas Savimbi, who split from the FNLA to form UNITA and was
      able to open a new front against Portuguese forces in the southeast of the country. The three
      leaders travelled abroad and won the support of the USSR, Cuba and China for their struggle.
      Towards the end of the independence war, Neto, Roberto and Savimbi fell out and their armies
      fought against each other. However, they put aside their differences to conclude the Alvor
      Agreement with Portugal in 1975. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
      weakness of the Estado Novo, the Carnation Revolution of 1974, and the support provided by
      other countries such as Zambia, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   “The attitude of colonial powers was the main reason for the peaceful achievement of
      independence.” Discuss with reference to either French West Africa or Tanganyika.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the attitude of colonial powers was the main reason for the peaceful achievement of
      independence, with reference to either French West Africa or Tanganyika. Candidates may discuss
      official encouragement of African nationalist leaders: the French in West Africa because of its
      policy of assimilation, the British in Tanganyika due to obligations arising from its status as a UN
      Trust Territory. The result was the emergence of talented politicians such as Senghor, Houphouet-
      Boigny, and Nyerere. France was prepared to introduce important constitutional changes such as
      the 1958 Constitution, which would have led to a federal West African Community. The rejection of
      this proposal by Guinea left the French with no alternative but to grant immediate independence to
      all of its West African colonies. In Tanganyika, British Governor Richard Turnbull proved amenable
      to compromise during the Lancaster House Conferences, which led to quick independence. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed, for example the relative moderation of nationalist leaders, the
      absence of white settler communities, and the lack of a dominant ethnic group in Tanganyika, but
      with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   Examine the impact on the Ottoman Empire of the rise of Muhammad Ali.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the rise of
      Muhammad Ali and the Ottoman Empire. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may argue that the loss of Egypt was
      a major military, financial and status loss to the Ottomans. The Egyptian army was a threat to the
      Ottomans which forced them to ally with their traditional enemy, Russia to prevent an Egyptian
      takeover. This was a major change in Ottoman foreign policy with negative implications. The
      weakness of the Ottomans encouraged French and British intervention to protect the Ottomans.
      This led to more foreign control and commercial domination by the West. Muhammad Ali’s
      conquest of the Sudan resulted in loss of control to the Red Sea trade routes and threatened the
      pilgrimage routes, a blow to Ottoman prestige. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the factors that led to the growth of the Committee of Union and Progress up to 1908–
      1909.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors that led to the growth of the
      Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) up to 1908–1909. Candidates may evaluate the
      persistent military weakness and territorial losses at the end of the 19th century and evaluate how
      these encouraged reformers and modernizers to make changes to save the Empire. Prominent
      nationalists and army officers such as Enver Bey and Mustafa Kemal joined the CUP and this
      attracted more supporters. A desire to return to the traditions of the Young Ottomans who had tried
      reform in the 1870s began to grow amongst the new educated classes. The Platform of the CUP
      which included nationalism as well as racial and religious equality attracted support as did their
      emphasis on a more democratic, secular and progressive state. These factors appealed to many
      non-Muslim and non-Turkish groups. The increased German support for the Ottoman Empire gave
      confidence to the CUP and allowed them to attract more supporters who felt that the Empire would
      survive and recover its strength. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   “Allied diplomacy in the Middle East was a total failure up to 1923.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Allied
      diplomacy in the Middle East was a total failure up to 1923. Candidates may refer to the ongoing
      conflicts and resentment which occurred after the establishment of the mandate system by Britain
      and France. The anger at the breaking of promises such as the Hussein-McMahon exchanges
      created permanent resentment of the West and ensured that conflicts would persist. The Balfour
      Declaration which created a Jewish homeland in the Middle East created long-term strife in the
      region. Britain and France were compelled to maintain large military forces in the region to
      maintain their hold on the region at a time when they were trying to reduce military expenditures.
      Candidates may refer to Egypt in the response and discuss the uprisings and conflicts that
      occurred as a result of the decision to deny Egyptian independence These uprisings led to
      Egyptian independence as Britain was unable to control the situation. Turkey may also be
      considered as the Treaty of Sevres proved a failure which led to conflict with Turkey and forced the
      Allies into a humiliating reversal of their position in the Treaty of Lausanne. Candidates may argue
      that allied diplomacy led to some short-term success: for example, in winning Arab support against
      the Ottomans during the war, and in ensuring that post-war mandates for governing former
      Ottoman territories were awarded to themselves. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   Evaluate the contribution of the Wafd Party to the achievement of Egyptian independence.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions of the Wafd Party to
      the achievement of Egyptian independence, weighing up its strengths and weaknesses or
      otherwise. Candidates may evaluate how the Wafd Party formed in 1913 and dominated the
      national assembly. The First World War limited their influence but they had created the foundation
      of the modern nationalist movement. Their leader, Zahgul, had tremendous status amongst the
      Egyptian population, his deportation to Malta led to large uprisings and more support for
      independence. The British were forced to respond by appointing Allenby as governor and a
      commission under Lord Milner to study the Egyptian question. Their recommendations for Egypt
      were rejected by the Wafd amid further unrest. This led to the 1922 declaration of Egypt as a
      sovereign state with some British presence. Other relevant factors may be evaluated, such as
      British desires to reduce problems in the Empire and their inability to maintain military control of
      Egypt. Also, Egypt had never been a British colony and therefore a change in status was easier to
      accept in Britain and the only real concern was the Suez Canal. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   “The Organization of African Unity (OAU) failed because of weaknesses in its structure.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the OAU failed because of weaknesses in its structure. Candidates may discuss that the OAU
      was confederalist. This meant that member states were not bound by its decisions and it struggled
      to respond to disputes and conflicts. The issue was compounded by its official position of non-
      interference in the internal affairs of its members, which meant that it was unable to respond to
      crises such as the Nigerian Civil War. Critics of the OAU argued that it was excessively
      bureaucratic and that limited its ability to respond quickly and decisively in the event of a crisis.
      Most member states also belonged to regional organisations like ECOWAS and SADCC. These
      shared many of the same objectives of the OAU, including the promotion of greater economic
      cooperation and closer political integration. This diluted the focus of the OAU on some of its key
      objectives. Other relevant factors may be discussed, for example political divisions between the
      Casablanca and Brazzaville groups within the organisation, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates may argue that the OAU was not entirely a failure because its Liberation
      Committee contributed to the end of colonial rule and white minority rule on the continent.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


28.   Evaluate the impact of United Nations (UN) intervention in two of the following: Congo,
      Mozambique, Somalia, Rwanda.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of UN intervention in two of
      Congo, Mozambique, Somalia and Rwanda, weighing up the success or otherwise in each.
      Assessment of impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries selected, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of either. However, both will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may evaluate the relative success of UN intervention in Mozambique, where it helped
      end a decades-long civil war by enforcing disarmament and monitoring the implementation of
      peace treaties. They may argue that intervention was a failure in Rwanda, where the UN was
      unable to stop the genocide by radical Hutus of Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and in Somalia, where
      the UN was unable to enforce ceasefire agreements and was caught up in the conflict between
      rival warlords. In Congo, the UN helped prevent the secession of the Katanga region and avoid a
      full civil war following the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. However, it proved deeply unpopular
      with many Congolese. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Examine the social and political consequences for South Africa of the discovery of diamonds and
      gold up to 1899.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the discovery of
      diamonds and gold and subsequent social and political developments in South Africa. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of social and political consequences, or they may prioritize their
      examination of either. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may examine
      ways in which the annexation of the diamond fields of Griqualand West by the British led to tension
      with the Boer republics. They may argue that the First Anglo-Boer War was caused by Britain’s
      determination to federate South Africa so that all of its mineral wealth fell under its control. The
      discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand led to rapid urbanisation and the demographic
      transformation of the Transvaal. The result was a culture clash between the Uitlander and Boer
      populations. Uitlanders agitated for more political rights and were supported by the Cape
      government, as the franchise issue became a source of conflict in the lead-up to the South African
      War. The mineral revolution also transformed the lives of Africans, with the introduction of a
      migrant labour system and the enforcement of segregation in the new mining cities. Other relevant
      factors may be examined, for example economic consequences, but with a focus on the issue in
      the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


30.   Examine the importance of the lifting of the ban on the African National Congress (ANC) to the end
      of the apartheid system.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the lifting of the ban
      on the ANC and the end of the apartheid system. Candidates may examine that the lifting of the
      ban meant that the government could now negotiate directly with the party supported by the
      majority of South Africans. The legitimacy of any transition process would have been limited
      without the participation of the ANC. The lifting of the ban was followed by the release from prison
      of Nelson Mandela, whose role in subsequent developments was key. De Klerk and Mandela
      agreed to the creation of CODESA, the purpose of which was to create a multi-racial transitional
      government and prepare a new constitution. The trust established between the two helped them
      navigate many challenges in the transition from apartheid, including a controversial whites-only
      referendum, the assassination of Chris Hani, and the Boipatong and Bisho massacres.
      Negotiations between the NP and the ANC led to the marginalisation of the Inkatha Freedom
      Party, whose attempts to derail negotiations through violence met with failure. Candidates may
      conclude that the ultimate significance of the lifting of the ban was the victory of the ANC in the first
      non-racial elections in 1994. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   “Colonialism did little to change the role of women.” Discuss with reference to two African
      countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that colonialism did little to change the role of women in two African countries. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of each country or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them.
      However, both countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the role of
      colonialism in introducing new laws and social practices which ended or limited traditional customs
      such as polygamy and slavery which impacted women. In addition, education was made available
      to some women for the first time and the arrival of Western women provided new role models for
      women in terms of occupations, family life and independence. New legal systems and social
      welfare organizations gave women new opportunities and support. Missionary groups often sought
      to make changes in social structures and strike down practices that they considered backward.
      However, candidates may note that strong traditions, religion and economic circumstances limited
      women’s ability to change their roles. Also, colonialism did not have women’s rights as its primary
      goal and may have preferred to leave traditions undisturbed in some societies in order to maintain
      peace with the leaders of the society. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Compare and contrast developments in education in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      two African countries in terms of developments in education, referring to both throughout. There
      does not need to be an equal number of each. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may compare and contrast the
      following factors: creation of schools and school systems with respect to numbers and types of
      schools; their location and availability by age and gender; the curriculum offered in terms of
      material and general focus; teacher development versus reliance on teachers from other countries;
      the development of links to offer opportunities for students to pursue advanced studies in foreign
      countries as well as the development of post-secondary education, both academic and technical;
      the percentage of the population of both genders with access to education; the education levels
      achieved by the majority; impediments to education experienced and the degree of support both
      domestic and foreign available to support education. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate the impact of the Suez Crisis on Egypt and Israel up to 1967.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Suez Crisis on Egypt
      and Israel. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one, but both must be a feature of the response. For Egypt, candidates may evaluate Egyptian
      control of the Suez Canal and financial benefits, acquisition of large amounts of British and French
      property and expulsion of Western citizens. Egypt became the leader of the Arab world in its quest
      for independence from the West. Their success inspired other Arab states to expel Western
      influence. Egypt became an ally of the USSR and gained military power as a result. For Israel,
      candidates may argue that their military victory confirmed their advantage over Arab states, and
      that they gained additional support from the USA which was worried about the spread of Soviet
      influence. They had to prepare for further conflict as the rise of Nasser brought about increased
      hostility from a number of Arab states. Palestinian militancy increased which presented security
      problems. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


34.   Discuss the social and economic effects of the White Revolution in Iran.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
      economic effects of the White Revolution in Iran. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe but
      must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. Candidates may discuss economic
      effects such as the expansion of industry and communication which led to increases in urban
      employment and higher standards of living for urban workers. Land reform had disappointing
      results as it failed to transfer land to peasants and led to unemployment and poverty in rural areas.
      The impact of increased government spending on infrastructure and military led to increased
      inflation and misuse of resources which weakened the economy and depressed living standards.
      Social effects included a great expansion of education and improved rights for women including
      suffrage, employment and education. Urbanization increased dramatically and a larger, educated
      middle-class evolved. These groups supported progress and change and when democracy and
      wealth were not achieved, they became opponents of the regime. Other social effects were the
      opposition of the clergy and the traditional leaders who resented the attack on Islamic and
      traditional values and became powerful opponents of the regime. The economic and social
      changes promoted division and unrest. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35.   Evaluate the success of two African countries in dealing with the challenges posed by disease
      and poverty.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the success of two African countries in
      dealing with the challenges posed by disease and poverty. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of both issues or they prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both issues will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the development of public health measures and
      education to limit disease, and the expansion of medical services of all types to provide access to
      care and treatment to more individuals over a wider geographic range. They may also examine
      changes in the education system in order to provide for healthcare personnel and the enlistment of
      international agencies or other countries to provide further medical support. With respect to
      poverty, candidates may evaluate the introduction of new industries, crops and enterprises to
      expand employment and provide higher incomes. The solicitation of foreign aid and support may
      also be examined in addition to education changes, designed to increase skill levels and incomes
      as well as the introduction of new ideas in agriculture and other traditional areas to boost outputs
      and incomes. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


36.   “Personal ambition was the main reason for the establishment of a single-party state.” Discuss with
      reference to two African countries.

      This question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that personal ambition was the main reason for the establishment of the single-party state in two
      African countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both states or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one but both states must be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the
      various factors that led to the establishment of a single-party, including wars and invasions,
      financial or economic crises, and racial and/or ethnic tensions leading to the emergence of a single
      dominant group. They may also refer to external pressure and/or interference from other countries
      as well as ideological or religious factors. Candidates may also discuss the emergence of
      individuals who used personal charisma as a means of establishing themselves as the leader of a
      party or movement, and/or their exploitation of popular grievances in order to fulfil their own
      ambitions or goals. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
