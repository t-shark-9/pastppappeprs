Paper 2 assessment criteria

Criterion A — Focus on the question                                                                 [2]

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being
raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking
down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they
understand the issues or problems.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1        Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2        Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.

Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding                                                           [6]

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas
of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
  1–2
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
  3–4
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
  5–6
             Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–               N22/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer                                                     [6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
  1–2
            Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  3–4       partly explained.
            Research selected partially develops the argument.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  5–6       thoroughly explained.
            Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                   –5–               N22/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D — Critical thinking                                                                         [6]

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
  1–2
            Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

            The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
  3–4
            Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

            The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
  5–6
            Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

Criterion E — Clarity and organization                                                                  [2]

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
    1
             throughout the response.

    2        The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss the role of one or more classification systems in the diagnosis of one or more
     disorder(s).

     Refer to paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the role of
     one or more classification systems in the diagnosis of one or more disorder (s).

     Candidates may refer to one or more classification systems as long as they are clearly used
     in relation to diagnosis of one or more disorder(s).

     Classification systems for psychological disorders include, but are not limited to:
     • DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)
     • ICD-11 (The International Classification of Diseases, World Health Organization, 2018)
     • CCMD-3 (Chinese Society of Psychiatry, 2001)

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to
     • Hafstad et al.’s (2017) study comparing ICD-11 and DSM-5 in diagnosing PTSD in
       survivors of a traumatic event
     • Tolentino and Schmidt’s (2018) research investigating DSM-5 in relation to levels of
       depression severity
     • Zheng et al.’s (1994) comparison of CCMD-2 and DSM-III-R systems in relation to
       diagnosis of various psychiatric disorders
     • Kleinman’s (1982) research and Parker et al.’s (2001) study comparing neurasthenia in
       China with depression in DSM-III
     • Lobbestael, Leurgans & Arntz (2011) research on interrater reliability in relation to a
       number of psychological disorders such as major depression, OCD, and general anxiety
       disorder
     • Bolton’s (2002) study examining the validity of classification systems

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • Purpose of diagnosis
     • Usefulness of diagnostic manuals in helping clinicians to make more accurate diagnoses
        as well as inform decisions about treatment
     • Clinical interviews versus classification systems
     • Problems of co-morbidity
     • Reliability and validity of diagnosis using classification systems
     • Cross-cultural issues in diagnostic tools in relation to specific disorders
     • Ethical considerations in diagnosis
     • Labelling and stigmatization
     • comparison of different classification systems

     Since the question is very open there are a number of pathways by which discussion could
     be achieved - marks awarded should reflect the degree to which material is used/shaped to
     the question

     Candidates may discuss the role of one classification system in order to demonstrate depth
     of knowledge, or may discuss the role of several classification systems in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

        consequences in a large number of countries
     • Makino et al.’s (2004) study regarding prevalence of eating disorders in Western and
        non-Western countries.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • age (for example, higher prevalence rates for depression in the elderly population and
        increasing rates among youth)
     • gender (for example, higher prevalence for depression in women)
     • risk factors such as exposure to conflicts, traumatic events, physical or psychological
        abuse
     • social and cultural factors (for example, poverty, social, and cultural norms)
     • availability of mental health services and treatment (for example, social determinants in
        relation to access to treatment and health services)
     • Diagnostic criteria and classification systems
     • Risk of relapse once the research is over
     • Methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into prevalence rates
        of disorders.

     Candidates may discuss prevalence rates of one disorder in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss prevalence rates of a larger number of disorders in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

3.   Discuss one or more ethical considerations in research related to the treatment of one or more
     disorder(s).

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one or
     more ethical considerations in research related to the treatment of one or more disorder(s).

     Ethical considerations may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative (what
     guidelines were not followed).

     Relevant ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to

     • Short and long-term side effects of treatments
     • The physiological and psychological side-effects of experimental treatments
     • Risk of relapse and lack of follow-up once the research is over
     • Research ethics committee.

     For Criterion B (quality of knowledge of ethical issues) examiners need to be aware that some
     candidates provide minimal information about ethical issues and focus on other aspects of
     studies or address ethical issues only in a general manner.
     In awarding marks and establishing 'best fit' for knowledge and understanding examiners should
     take into account level of detail and context.
     Ethical considerations only identified or described in generic terms should be awarded marks in
     the lowest (1-2) band.
     Ethical considerations described within relevant studies should be awarded marks in the mid (3-
     4) band.
     Ethical considerations are described within relevant studies and clearly linked to the topic being
     focused on should be awarded marks in the top (5-6) band.
                                            –9–               N22/3/PSYCH/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Candidates may discuss one ethical consideration related to the research into treatment of
disorder(s) in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of
ethical considerations related to research into the treatment of disorder(s) in order to
demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Candidates may display breadth of knowledge by
considering ethical issues in relation to more than one disorder. All approaches are equally
acceptable.

Developmental psychology

4.   To what extent does poverty and/or socio-economic status influence cognitive and/or social
     development?

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
     poverty and/or socio-economic status on cognitive and/or social development.

     Candidates may address only cognitive development or only social development or may
     address both. Either approach is equally acceptable.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Bhoomika et al.’s (2008) research on the effect of malnutrition on cognitive performance
       in Indian children.
     • Wertheimer’s (2003) research on the correlation between academic achievement and
       living in poor families.
     • Schoon’s (2002) longitudinal study investigating the long-term effect of poverty on
       academic achievement and attainment in adult life.
     • Bernstein’s (1971) research on the influence of socio-economic status on the use of
       language in children
     • Russell et al.’s (2008) research on the influence of poverty on parenting

     When responding to the command term “to what extent”, considerations may include, but
     are not limited to:
     • methodological considerations related to the research into poverty/socio-economic
        status
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • alternative explanations or factors
     • practical applications.

     In order to respond to the command term “to what extent”, it is appropriate and useful for
     candidates to address other factors (e.g. protective factors) that may influence cognitive
     and/or social development.

     Candidates may address one or a small number of potential influences of poverty/socio-
     economic status in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge or may address a larger
     number of potential influences of poverty/socio-economic status in order to demonstrate
     breath of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Discuss the development of gender identity and/or social roles.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     development of gender identity and/or social roles.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • gender schema theory that stresses the key role of cognitive processes in the
       development of gender roles
     • social cognitive theory that highlights the importance of the social environment and
       emphasizes the potency of observational and modelling processes
     • theory of psychosexual differentiation that is based on the assumption that gender roles
       are related to genetic sex determined by chromosomes
     • evolutionary theory that attempts to locate gender role differences in a historical
       evolutionary context with focus on biological sex differences
     • social role theory assuming that beliefs about gender roles derive from observing what
       men and women do within a given society.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Martin and Halvorson’s (1983) study showing the role of gender schemas on gender
       roles
     • Witt (1997); Fagot’s (1978) studies showing the influence of parents on gender roles
     • Neculaesei (2015); Mead’s (1935) studies showing that gender roles depend upon the
       society
     • Money and Ehrhardt’s (1972) study claiming that children are gender neutral at birth
     • Eagly and Wood’s (2016) study on social role theory of sex differences.

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into the development
        of gender identity/social roles
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence.

     Candidates may discuss the development of gender identity or social roles in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss the development of gender identity and
     social roles in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

6.   Discuss one or more ethical considerations related to one or more studies used to investigate
     how humans develop as learners.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of ethical
     considerations related to one or more studies used to investigate how humans develop as
     learners.

     Ethical considerations may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative (what
     guidelines were not followed) or a combination of both.

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • deception
     • protection from physical or mental harm
     • briefing and debriefing
     • right to withdraw from a study
     • informed consent
     • anonymity/confidentiality.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Waber (2007); Giedd (2004); Chugani et al.’s (2001) studies on the effects of maturation
       of the nervous system on cognitive development
     • Cowell et al. (2006); Corky’s (1997) studies on brain damage and memory deficits
     • Deary et al. (2006); Bouchard et al.’s (1990) studies on genetic inheritance in intelligence
     • Piaget and Inhelder (1956); McGarrigle and Donaldson (1974); Samuel and Bryant’s
       (1984) studies on stages of cognitive development
     • Siegler (1978); Case’s (1992) studies on the information-processing approach to
       cognitive development.

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • the difficulties of ensuring anonymity and confidentiality in psychology research
     • the role of informed consent in research with children
     • why deception was or was not used
     • decisions as to why certain ethical guidelines were/were not followed
     • changes over time in adherence to ethical standards/guidelines.

     For Criterion B (quality of knowledge of ethical issues) examiners need to be aware that some
     candidates provide minimal information about ethical issues and focus on other aspects of
     studies or address ethical issues only in a general manner.
     In awarding marks and establishing 'best fit' for knowledge and understanding examiners should

     (3-4) band.
     Ethical considerations are described within relevant studies and clearly linked to the topic being
     focused on should be awarded marks in the top (5-6) band.

     Candidates may discuss one or a small number of ethical considerations related to one or a
     small number of research studies in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may
     discuss a larger number of ethical considerations related to a larger number of research
     studies in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

7.   Evaluate one or more studies related to health beliefs as determinants of health.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
     studies related to health beliefs by weighing up the strengths and limitations. Although a
     discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly
     balanced to gain high marks.

     Candidates are likely to write about health beliefs in relation to health topics in the
     psychology guide, namely stress, obesity, addiction, chronic pain, and/or sexual health.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Lewis et al. (2010) qualitative study on health beliefs and behaviour in relation to severity
       of obesity in Australia
     • Kearney et al.’s (2006) study on stress and the immune system
     • Fleary and Ettienne’s (2014) survey on whether causal health beliefs about obesity are
       associated with weight perceptions and decisions to lose weight
     • Polivy's (2001) false hope theory regarding dietary goals and optimism
     • Weinberger et al.’s study on health beliefs and smoking behaviour.
     • Pribadi and Devy’s (2020) Correlational study on the role of health beliefs on the
       intention to stop smoking behaviour among young women in Indonesia
     • Gatchel's (2017) study on fear avoidance belief and chronic pain
     • Boone and Lefkowitz’s (2008) correlational study on safer sex among adolescents based
       on the health belief model
     • Chapin’s (2010) study on the role of optimism bias in adolescent risky sexual practices.

     Evaluation of selected studies may include, but is not limited to:
     • Methodological and ethical considerations
     • Supportive and contrary findings
     • Cultural and gender considerations
     • The application of the empirical findings
     • How the findings of research have been interpreted
     • Implications of findings.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, in criterion A we assess to what extent is the
     response focused on the question. Responses that are generic, lack a focus on the specific
     question and seem as pre-prepared essays of relevance to the general topic (but not to
     evaluation of one or more studies) should be awarded 0 marks. If the response identifies which
     studies will be evaluated but there is also extra information that is not relevant or necessary for
     the specific question then 1 mark should be awarded. Responses that are clearly focused on
     evaluating one or more studies should gain 2 marks.

     Marks awarded for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts relating to
     research studies. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more specifically
     knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen studies

     Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and
     assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this doesn't
     have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
     should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
study/studies.

If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

Candidates may evaluate one study related to health beliefs as determinants of health in
order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may evaluate a larger number of studies
related to health beliefs as determinants of health in order to demonstrate breadth of
knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

8.   Contrast two explanations of one or more health problems.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the differences
     between two explanations of one or more health problems, referring to both of them
     throughout.

     Candidates are likely to write about health problems in relation to health topics in the
     psychology guide, namely stress, obesity, addiction, chronic pain, and/or sexual health.

     Relevant explanations to contrast may include, but are not limited to:
     • sociocultural
     • biological
     • cognitive.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • DiFranza et al.’s (2005) research on biological factors in adolescents’ smoking history
       and addiction
     • Powel and Chaloupka’s (2003) study on the role of parental influences on the probability
       of youth smoking
     • Unger et al.’s (2001) cross-cultural survey on adolescent smoking considering the peer
       factor as well as individualistic and collectivistic cultures
     • Volkow et al.’s (2002) fMRI study of obese individuals indicating one possible
       explanation of overweight (support of the theory of compulsive overeating)
     • Prentice and Jebb’s (1995) correlational study on increase in obesity and car ownership
       and television viewing.
     • Teevale et al.’s (2010) mixed-method study on the role of sociocultural factors in obesity
       in Pacific adolescents and their parents.

     Contrasting discussion points may include, but is not limited to:
     • effectiveness of explanations
     • degree of research evidence
     • methodological considerations of supporting research
     • practical applications

     If the candidate provides only an implicit contrast, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [2] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded
     marks according to the best fit approach.

9.   Discuss one or more sociocultural factors in promoting health.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one or
     more sociocultural factors in promoting health.

     Candidates are likely to write about health beliefs in relation to health topics in the
     psychology guide, namely stress, obesity, addiction, chronic pain, and/or sexual health.

     Sociocultural factors in promoting health may include, but are not limited to:
     • Social media
     • Peer groups / role models
     • Family
     • cultural influences
     • advertisements
     • governmental influence.

     Responses may address health promotion as a general term (e.g. anti-smoking
     programmes, anti-obesity workshops) or by addressing a specific approach (e.g.
     "Challenge!" Health promotion programme or Canada on the move programme). Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Kreuter and Lukwago’s (2003) study of cultural appropriateness in health promotion
       programmes
     • Resnicow et al.’s (1999) study on cultural sensitivity in public health
     • Kalichman and Coley’s (1995) study on the role of cultural influence on health
       communication in relation to HIV
     • Sepstrup’s (1999) study on the role of media in health promotion.
     • Peckmann and Reibling’s (2006) research investigating the effectiveness of fear appeals
       in promoting anti-smoking attitudes in teens
     • Beiner et al.’s (2006) investigations of ex-smoker’s view of effectiveness of various anti-
       tobacco programmes
     • Baskerville et al.’s (2015) study on the effect of digital social media campaigns on young
       adult smoking cessation.
     • Jane et al.’s (2018) review of the role of social media for health promotion and weight
       management.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into the sociocultural
        factors in promoting health
     • social engineering (that is, laws) versus health promotion programmes
     • the effectiveness of health promotion programmes
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • assumptions on which health promotion programmes are based
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence

     Candidates may discuss one sociocultural factor in promoting health in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of sociocultural factors in
     promoting health in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   Discuss one or more ethical considerations in one or more studies investigating personal
      relationships.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of ethical
      considerations in studies investigating personal relationships.

      Relevant ethical considerations could include, but are not limited to:
      • obtaining informed consent
      • avoiding harm or suffering of participants
      • the use of deception
      • the right to withdraw
      • the need for debriefing
      • addressing and recording sensitive information
      • protection of children in family research (studies on divorce)
      • videotaped observational data involve unique challenges in terms of the protection of
        privacy.

      Examples of studies linked to ethical research may include, but are not limited to:
      • Flora and Segrin’s (2003) study using interviews investigating relational history in
        married and dating couples
      • Gupta and Singh’s (1982) study interviewing couples in love relationships and arranged
        marriages
      • Glenn’s (2005) study using interviews and questionnaires to investigate cultural
        grounding of personal relationships
      • Gatter and Hodkinson’s (2016) study of Tinder versus online dating agencies, using
        correlational design with a convenience sample and snowball sampling
      • Levenson and Gottman’s (1983) observational study of marital dissatisfaction.

      While the response may include some description of studies, the main focus of the
      response should be on the ethical considerations.

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • the considerations of conducting research in a different culture
      • why deception is used
      • the difficulties of ensuring confidentiality in research investigating personal relationships
      • the role of informed consent when conducting research into personal relationships
      • decisions as to why certain ethical guidelines were/were not followed
      • changes over time in adherence to ethical standards/guidelines
      • In longitudinal research, the researcher may through repeated assessments, realize that
         family problems are indeed worsening. Thus, longitudinal researchers face important
         decisions about whether to disclose information that could benefit the family but change
         the natural course of the phenomenon under study.

      For Criterion B (quality of knowledge of ethical issues) examiners need to be aware that some
      candidates provide minimal information about ethical issues and focus on other aspects of
      studies or address ethical issues only in a general manner.
      In awarding marks and establishing 'best fit' for knowledge and understanding examiners
      should take into account level of detail and context.

Ethical considerations are only identified or described in generic terms should be awarded
marks in the lowest (1-2) band.
Ethical considerations are described within relevant studies should be awarded marks in the
mid (3-4) band.
Ethical considerations are described within relevant studies and clearly linked to the topic
being focused on should be awarded marks in the top (5-6) band.

Candidates may discuss one or a small number of ethical considerations in greater depth or
may discuss a greater number in less depth, thereby demonstrating a breadth of
understanding. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

11.   Evaluate one or more studies investigating co-operation and/or competition in group dynamics.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term "evaluate" requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
      the strengths and limitations of one or more studies related to co-operation and/or
      competition in group dynamics. Although both strengths and limitations should be
      addressed, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Sherif’s (1961) Robbers Cave study
      • Aronson’s (1971) jigsaw classroom
      • Beeman and D’Amico’s (1956) study of the effects of co-operation and competition on
        cohesiveness of small groups
      • McCallum, Harring, Gilmore, Drenan, Chase, Insko, and Thibaut’s (1985) study on
        competition and co-operation between groups and individuals using the Prisoner’s
        Dilemma.
      • Tauer and Harackiewicz (2004) experimental study on the effects of cooperation and
        motivation on intrinsic motivation and performance.

      Evaluation of the study/studies may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations in research related to co-operation and/or
        competition in group dynamics
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
      • implications of the findings
      • assumptions and biases in research related to co-operation and/or competition in group
        dynamics.

      In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, in criterion A we assess to what extent is the
      response focused on the question. Responses that are generic, lack a focus on the specific
      question and seem as pre-prepared essays of relevance to the general topic (but not to
      evaluation of one or more studies) should be awarded 0 marks. If the response identifies which
      studies will be evaluated but there is also extra information that is not relevant or necessary for
      the specific question then 1 mark should be awarded. Responses that are clearly focused on
      evaluating one or more studies should gain 2 marks.

      Marks awarded for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts relating to
      research studies. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more specifically
      knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen studies.

      Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and
      assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this doesn't
      have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
      should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

      Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
      study/studies.

      If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
      should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

12.   Discuss promoting prosocial behaviour.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of promoting
      prosocial behaviour.

      The concept of promoting prosocial behaviour may refer to any method or campaign that
      develops prosocial behaviour or a more general application of a model and/or theory, ie
      social learning theory.

      Relevant studies related to promoting prosocial behaviour may include, but are not limited

      • Pollock’s (2014) field study done in Rwanda, concerning Subido methodology.

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into promoting
         prosocial behaviour
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
      • implications of the findings
      • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
      • assumptions and biases
      • areas of uncertainty
      • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
      • practical applications
      • comparison/contrast of different forms of promoting social behaviour.
