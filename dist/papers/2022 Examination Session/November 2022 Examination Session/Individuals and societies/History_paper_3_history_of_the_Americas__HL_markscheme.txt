Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.        Examine the role of state authorities in the political organization of indigenous societies.

          The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the role of state
          authorities and the political organization of indigenous societies. Candidates may examine the role
          of state authorities as administrators, and their network of officials to control local populations to
          varying degrees. They may also consider examples of state authorities that combined civil and
          religious roles in order to ensure political unity through religious celebrations. Candidates may also
          consider that state authorities were also military leaders. From those positions and in accordance
          with their performance in gaining lands, prisoners and wealth, they reinforced their leadership.
          Other relevant factors may be considered like their role as law representatives and/or judges, an
          essential practice to keep the community organized; and their responsibility imposing and
          legitimizing the tribute. Candidates may also examine the role state authorities played as
          benefactors redistributing food in times of disaster, sponsoring important buildings, roads,
          assistance, and promoting art works. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
          and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.        Examine the contributions of two indigenous societies to scientific development and the arts.

          The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the contributions of
          two indigenous societies to scientific development and the arts. Regarding scientific development,
          candidates may refer to the knowledge about plant species that allowed many indigenous
          populations to develop different types of crops. Candidates may also examine the indigenous
          knowledge about their medicinal properties, which was instrumental in pharmacological
          development. Candidates may also consider technological innovations such as the canoe, kayak,
          or snowshoe that helped transporting people and products. Regarding art, candidates may
          examine the production of memorial and religious art (like in the cases of Incas and Mayas)
          referring to their high level of complexity in the designs. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
          presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                 N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Examine the impact of Pizarro’s conquest of the Incas on Spanish exploration in Latin America.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between Pizarro’s conquest of
     the Incas and Spanish exploration in Latin America. Candidates may consider that the defeat of
     the Incas meant a victory over the most powerful empire in the region and opened a path to further
     incursions into America. Candidates may consider that the conquerors were able to plunder
     supplies from the local Inca storehouses and used them to pay the expenses the exploration of
     America required. Candidates may also examine that the conquest meant that many indigenous
     communities were freed from the Inca rule, a situation that benefitted the Spaniards who took
     advantage of their isolation to conquer them and their lands and/or use them as collaborators in
     the exploration. Other relevant factors may be considered, for example, the impact of the conquest
     in Europe since it improved Spain’s status as a powerful kingdom and promoted new enterprises to
     explore America. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


4.   “The conquest of indigenous populations led to significant multiracial issues.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the conquest of indigenous populations led to significant multiracial issues. Candidates may
     discuss that multiracial issues began with European colonization and were conditioned by factors
     that varied according to the region, the number and nature of the indigenous societies, the origins
     and goals of its colonists, and the extent and type of slavery practiced. Candidates may discuss
     that the genetic and cultural mixing between Europeans, Africans, and indigenous peoples started
     almost immediately, and that the offspring of mixed unions were recognized as socially inferior.
     Candidates may discuss that as a result of multiracial unions, a new social classification and
     hierarchy appeared known as a sociedad de castas (“society of castes”). Candidates may discuss
     that in all cases, mixture occurred in a setting in which Europeans were dominant and thus were
     able to exploit black and indigenous labour and to enforce cultural changes. Candidates may also
     discuss that besides this stratification, many black and indigenous people resisted the colonial
     powers, organized rebellions, and/or managed to escape. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example the reaction to multiracial issues among European intellectuals and
     authorities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                 N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   Evaluate the economic and social impact of yanaconaje in Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic and social impact of
     yanaconaje in Spanish America. The yanaconaje, in its origin an Inca institution, was applied by
     the Spaniards to indigenous people who were incorporated into the ownership of a plot, or fugitives
     from the mita who were captured and went on to serve as dependents of a Spaniard in agriculture
     or herding. Candidates may consider that indigenous peoples under yanaconaje usually served as
     skilled artisans, while others worked in the mines, allowing the conquerors to benefit from their
     work. Candidates may also evaluate the economic impact of the order from the Crown that in 1691
     recognized those under yanaconaje as “free labourers” giving them the possibility to work for
     market-rate wages. Regarding the social impact, candidates may consider that though separate
     from their families, the yanakunas were not completely dislocated from their communities. Many
     still owned lands, and some worked on farms where they lived with their relatives. Candidates may
     also evaluate that in urban areas the yanakunas owned and passed down real estate as a result of
     their more privileged status. Other relevant factors may be considered as social impact like the
     greater degree of acculturation to Spanish custom and language in the case of yanakunas living in
     the cities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


6.   “Resistance to authority in Colonial America was mainly due to economic factors.” To what extent
     do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     resistance to authority in Colonial America was mainly due to economic factors. Candidates may
     support the statement considering that the monopoly rules limited the economic activity of
     merchants, artisans and farmers in America. They can also refer to the fragile economic situation
     of indigenous and African slaves who also took part in many movements of resistance. Candidates
     may also state that the imposition of a “society of castes” that prevented many people from being
     part of economic activities was also a factor for the conflict. Candidates may challenge the
     question considering other factors as more significant like the claim to access to high political
     positions made by local elites and wealthy families of criollos. They may also refer to the need to
     modernize the administration, education and culture in America, a requirement that was not
     successfully addressed by some monarchies (like in the case of the Bourbon reforms). Other
     relevant factors may be addressed like the impact in America of European wars that debilitated
     monarchies, and/or the introduction of new ideas by the Enlightenment. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –7–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   Compare and contrast the role of Franciscans and Dominicans in the New World.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the role of Franciscans and Dominicans in the New World. Candidates may refer to the first
     Franciscan missionaries that arrived at New Spain in 1523 following Cortes’ expeditions in Mexico,
     and established missions across the continent. In contrast, Dominicans concentrated in the
     Caribbean and Mexico. Candidates may compare that both orders looked for the conversion to
     Christianity of indigenous societies and for the elimination of local rituals and may contrast their
     different approaches to conversion and results. Candidates may also compare their study of native
     languages and customs (like the study of Maya language by the Dominicans and the study of
     Nahuatl by the Franciscans). Candidates may also compare and contrast the activities carried out
     by Franciscans and Dominicans to educate indigenous societies in reading and writing, and/or the
     teaching of music, carpentry, ceramics, and other creative skills. They may also compare and
     contrast their role in protecting indigenous populations like in the cases of Bartolomé de las Casas
     and Pedro de Gante. Candidates may also compare and contrast the relationship between both
     orders and civil authorities in America and the monarchy. Both similarities and differences must be
     clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


8.   “Considerable religious intolerance existed in British North America.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that there
     was considerable religious intolerance in British North America. Candidates may consider the clash
     among different groups of Europeans and their competition to control the territory such as the case
     of the encounter between the Huguenot colony and Spaniards in 1564 at Fort Caroline that
     brought episodes of religious intolerance. Candidates may also refer to the arrival of Puritan
     communities and their rejection to coexist with opposing religious views. They may also refer to the
     antipathy toward Catholics (especially French and Spanish Catholics) reflected in the sermons and
     in statutes that discriminated against Catholics in matters of property and voting. Candidates may
     consider that religious intolerance was also present in early independent America since there were
     state laws regarding religion that still included signs of intolerance, especially against Catholics and
     Jews. Candidates may also consider the Great Awakening and the divisions the movement caused
     among those who supported it and those who rejected it. Candidates might refer to British
     colonists’ intolerance of indigenous religions. Those who disagree with the premise, might refer to
     the Rhode Island Charter of 1663, the Maryland Toleration Act of 1649 and the Pennsylvania
     Charter of Privileges of 1701, all of which granted religious toleration. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Compare and contrast the role of two colonial powers in the establishment of slavery in the
      Americas.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      two colonial powers in the establishment of slavery in the Americas. Candidates may compare the
      advances in nautical technology, especially the invention of the caravel that facilitated the
      connection between Europe and the West African coast and later the New World, transporting
      different commodities and also many African slaves. Candidates may also compare the
      organization of plantations established in different regions of America that required slave labour,
      like in areas under Portuguese, British and/or Dutch rule. Candidates may also compare and
      contrast the different treatment slavery received from monarchies and religious institutions and the
      attempts to abolish it, like in the case of Spain and Britain. Candidates may also compare the role
      played by companies that sustained slavery and their close relations with civil powers. Candidates
      may also contrast the different laws regarding slavery introduced by the different governments in
      order to set boundaries among African slaves, indigenous communities and Europeans in the
      Americas. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be
      an equal number of each.


10.   Discuss the reasons for, and effects of, abolitionist ideas in British America up to 1800.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and effects of, abolitionist ideas in British America up to 1800. As reasons, candidates may discuss
      that opposition to slavery started as a moral and religious movement based on the belief that
      everyone was equal in the eyes of God. This impacted among Mennonites, Quakers,
      Presbyterians, Baptists, Amish, and other practitioners of Protestant denominations. Candidates
      may also discuss the impact of the Great Awakening movements that led to the idea that all men
      were created equal in the eyes of God. Candidates may also discuss that abolitionists saw slavery
      as an abomination and an affliction. As effects, candidates may discuss that abolitionists sent
      petitions to Congress, ran for political office, produced anti-slavery literature, and founded
      antislavery societies like the Society for the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage
      (Pennsylvania Abolition Society), among others. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   Evaluate the impact of military campaigns/battles on the outcome of one independence movement
      in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of military campaigns and
      battles on the outcome of one independence movement in the Americas between 1763 and 1830.
      Candidates may choose the US independence movement and evaluate the impact of early battles
      such as Trenton and Princeton in 1776, which gave a tremendous morale boost to the Americans
      after earlier defeats; the American victory at Saratoga in 1777, which brought much needed foreign
      aid, especially from the French; the later Carolinas campaign in 1780–81 which helped to wear
      down Cornwallis and the battle at Yorktown in 1781, which signalled the end of the war. Latin
      American independence movements could be evaluated such as those led by Jose de San Martin,
      Simon Bolivar, or any of the Mexican independence leaders. For San Martin and his Army of the
      Andes, two key battles for Chilean Independence were Chacabuco in 1817, which led to the
      liberation of Santiago, and Maipu in 1818, which ended Spanish control. For Bolivar, the Battle of
      Boyaca in 1819 secured independence for New Granada, Carabobo in 1821 for Venezuela, and
      Ayacucho in 1824 for Peru. If Mexico is chosen, candidates should be able to identify key victories
      by different leaders and their impact on the outcome of the movement. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “Independence had a significant impact on the establishment of new trading relations.” Discuss
      with reference to two countries in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that independence had a significant impact on the establishment of new trading relations.
      Candidates may support the statement considering that many independence movements looked
      for the end of the monopoly imposed by governments. Candidates may also discuss that
      independence facilitated the establishment of new diplomatic relations with other countries that
      usually were accompanied by trade treaties. Independence also impacted in the reorganization of
      the territory, establishing new ports, customs houses, and routes in order to sponsor new trade
      relations. Independence was also the starting point of the creation of a new currency and the
      establishment of banks to facilitate trade. Also, new constitutions usually granted equal rights and
      every citizen was allowed to trade. Candidates may challenge the statement by discussing that for
      a long time after independence long-distance trade was still in the hands of Europeans. They can
      also refer to other events as more significant for the new trading relations like the Industrial
      Revolution, and/or the development of new financial activities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   To what extent were major compromises necessary for the 1787 US Constitution to be written?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that major
      compromises were necessary for the US Constitution to be written. Candidates may refer to the
      desire to modify the Articles of Confederation but indicate that there was very little agreement as to
      how to do that. Each state had its own ideas and was interested in protecting its standing. The first
      compromise, known as The Great Compromise, resolved the issue of representation for the states
      by creating a bicameral legislature, one house based on population and the other on equal
      representation. Counting of slaves for determining representation, or taxation required the three-
      fifths compromise, while the desire for a strong central government, but fear that it would be too
      strong required the checks and balances compromises. Candidates may refer to other stumbling
      blocks of tariffs and trade that required compromises to achieve agreement and the necessity of
      adding the first ten amendments to get the Constitution ratified. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Evaluate the effects of the Mexican-American War (1846–1848) on the region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effects of the Mexican-American
      War (1846–1848) on the region. Candidates may evaluate the changes in territory caused by the
      war. By the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848) Mexico accepted the Rio Grande as its boundary,
      leaving to the US the provinces of California and New Mexico. Candidates may also evaluate the
      economic effects on the region. Soon after the war the US initiated industrial and agricultural
      development on an unprecedented scale resulting in a widespread environmental change in part of
      the region under dispute. Candidates may also evaluate the social effects of the war on the region,
      especially on the population of Texas that suffered discrimination during and after the conflict.
      Candidates may also evaluate the effects of the war in the other countries of the region, the
      ratification of the US as a power in the continent, and its new relations with American nations.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the effects of the war in domestic policy, or
      its influence in the abolitionist debate in the US. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   Evaluate the impact of the abolitionist movement on the United States.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the abolitionist
      movement on the United States. Candidates may evaluate the work of the early abolitionists,
      especially the Quakers, and those influenced by the Great Awakening and their limited impact.
      They may evaluate individuals like William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass and their
      respective newspapers. Initially, the abolitionist movement had little impact, and many northerners
      disagreed with the movement. For the most part, until the mid-1850s, political parties ignored the
      issue of slavery. However, the abolitionist movement did continue to keep attention on the issue of
      slavery and worry the southern states about northern motives, increasing sectional divide.
      Southern states banned the distribution of all abolitionist literature. The writing of Uncle Tom’s
      Cabin, support of the Underground Railroad, passage of personal liberty laws and John Brown’s
      uprising further infuriated southern states. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the abolitionist
      movement on the emergence of the Republican Party, which advocated for ending the expansion
      of slavery. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


16.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the terms of the Compromise of 1850.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the terms of the Compromise of 1850,
      weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the terms of the
      Compromise or they may prioritize areas for their evaluation. The Compromise included five
      different provisions aimed at decreasing sectional differences over slavery, which were very high at
      the time. Candidates may refer to the admission of California as a free state, and the creation of
      the new territories of New Mexico and Utah, which would be admitted using popular sovereignty.
      For the most part, this was acceptable to both sides. Candidates may refer to the new, stronger
      Fugitive Slave Act and the abolition of the slave trade in Washington, DC as examples of
      compromise. The southern states got the Fugitive Slave Act, while the northern states got the
      abolition of the slave trade. Both sides hated what the other side achieved. Candidates might
      argue that the compromise did ease tensions and derailed secessionist ideas in 1850. Others
      might argue that it merely delayed secession as sectional differences increased in the next ten
      years and future cooperation and compromise became increasingly unlikely. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Discuss the economic effects of urbanization in two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
      effects of urbanization in two countries of the Americas. Candidates may discuss economic effects
      such as the new commercial, financial, and artisan activities. They may also discuss the
      organization of banks, commercial offices, and large infrastructure projects. Candidates may also
      discuss the migration from the hinterland to the cities as an effect of urbanization and its impact on
      employment rates, and consumption. Urbanization also had economic effects, creating a division of
      economic activities among different towns and rural regions. Candidates may also discuss the
      expansion of transportation and those cases where more effective systems to transport people,
      commodities and services produced a series of economic booms. The radial networks of avenues
      and streets also facilitated this. The growth of cities and the rise in the population also had an
      effect on rural activities since the growing demand of food and raw materials triggered an increase
      in the production, and also sponsored the rise of new local industries to supply the demand of
      manufactures. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the emergence of an urban
      bourgeoisie that promoted the growth of outdoor spaces for leisure and consumption such as
      promenades and public parks (like in the cases of Buenos Aires, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro).
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


18.   To what extent did the economic and legal conditions of African Americans improve between 1865
      and 1929?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      economic and legal conditions of African Americans improved between 1865 and 1929. Regarding
      the legal conditions, candidates may refer to the effects of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth
      Amendment that guaranteed, among others, their right to vote. Yet African Americans were often
      ignored, particularly in the South where Black codes were enacted. They may also consider that
      during Reconstruction, a number of African Americans leaders were speakers and members of the
      US Congress showing a certain improvement in legal terms, while others were allowed to serve as
      lieutenant governors, state’s acting governors, secretaries of state and superintendents of
      education. However, there was a rebirth of white supremacy in the South, accompanied by the
      growth of enforced “racial” separation. Regarding the economic conditions, candidates may argue
      that after the Civil War, many African Americans had limited resources and were forced to move in
      search of work, besides the help of a number of philanthropic agencies. Candidates may also
      consider that in the post-Reconstruction years, they only received a small share of the increasing
      number of industrial jobs, especially in Southern cities. Candidates may consider the differences
      between North and South and that even when African Americans were also segregated in the
      North, their economic and educational opportunities were greater. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of two US presidents in the affairs of Latin America.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the foreign policies of two US presidents in the affairs of Latin America. Most likely choices could
      be McKinley, T Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson and Coolidge. Candidates may compare similar policies of
      expansionism and domination in the area by McKinley, Roosevelt, and Taft, though in varying
      degrees. Wilson’s “moral” diplomacy implied more altruistic motives but proved to be very similar to
      those of his predecessors. All presidents used the Monroe Doctrine to justify U.S. involvement,
      whether it was McKinley’s Spanish American War, the use of the Roosevelt Corollary or military
      interventions by Taft and Wilson. The greatest contrast is with Coolidge, who ended US
      intervention in the Dominican Republic, recognized the Mexican government and began better
      relations with many Latin American countries. Other possible comparisons could be economic
      reasons for intervention, desires to set up friendly governments, manifest destiny and white
      supremacy. Possible contrasts could be reasons for military intervention, whether humanitarian or
      nationalistic, geopolitical reasons, and type of intervention, whether financial, political or military.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each


20.   Discuss the reasons for, and the nature of, the involvement of one country of the Americas (except
      the US) in the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for,
      and the nature of, involvement of one country of the Americas, excluding the US, in the First World
      War. Canada may be the most likely choice but accept any Latin American country that
      participated in the war. For Canadian reasons, candidates may discuss an obligation as part of the
      British Empire, a desire to help Britain, and to protect Canadian trade interests. Latin American
      reasons could be German encroachment, pressure from the US and a desire to be part of the
      League of Nations. Canadian participation was both military and economic. Canadian forces fought
      on the western front throughout the war. Their participation was especially significant at Somme,
      Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and in the final offensive in late 1918. Canadian participation included
      economic aid through massive exports of agricultural and industrial goods. Brazil declared war in
      October 1917 in response to German U-boat attacks. The Brazilian Navy patrolled the South
      Atlantic and a small force went to Europe. Cuba sent doctors and nurses to the Western front and
      was preparing to send soldiers as the war ended. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 14 –              N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Compare and contrast the aims of Zapata and Carranza during the Mexican Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the aims of Zapata and Carranza during the Mexican Revolution. Zapata’s aims can be seen in his
      Plan of Ayala, which called for land reform, social reform and democratic reform. Carranza’s aims
      can be seen in his Plan of Guadalupe, which called for the removal of Huerta and constitutional
      government. Both supported a constitutional government and political reform, but to different
      degrees. Their differences lie in the amount of reform. Carranza wanted minimal reform with
      government run by the elites and no agrarian or social reform. Zapata was a revolutionary who
      fought against Diaz, later Madero and then Huerta, while Carranza, a reformer, supported Madero,
      and then fought against Huerta, and later Zapata and Villa. Both opposed Diaz and supported
      Madero, at least initially for Zapata, and both opposed Huerta. Both similarities and differences
      must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


22.   “Foreign powers had a limited impact on the outbreak and development of the Mexican
      Revolution.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that foreign powers had a limited impact on the outbreak and development of the Mexican
      Revolution. Candidates may discuss that some foreign powers had a greater impact than others.
      They most likely will discuss Germany, Great Britain and the United States as having some impact.
      Regarding outbreak, candidates might refer to favourable treatment of American and British
      interests, which adversely affected Mexican workers, peasants and landholders creating
      discontent. US support of Diaz ended and shifted to Madero with Taft placing US troops along the
      border. Regarding development, US support shifted again, away from Madero and towards Huerta,
      who also had support from Britain, Spain and Germany. Within a year, the US withdrew support
      from Huerta, called for his resignation and backed Carranza. Germany continued to back Huerta,
      even shipping weapons to him, which resulted in the US occupation of Veracruz. Germany’s last
      attempt was the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   Discuss the causes and impact of the Great Depression in one country in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and
      impact of the Great Depression in one country in the Americas. Candidates may choose any
      country in the Americas. Causes and impact will vary depending on the country chosen, though
      there may be similarities. For Latin American countries, there were pre-existing economic
      inequities that helped bring about the Great Depression, but all of these were exacerbated by the
      US and global depression. For many Latin American countries, they lost their valuable export
      markets in Europe and the US, resulting in widespread unemployment and a capital crisis
      decreasing their ability to buy needed imports. Tariff wars compounded the crises. ISI was
      implemented. For the US, causes could be the government’s laissez-faire approach to the
      economy, stock market speculation and its crash in October 1929, overproduction,
      underconsumption and income inequality. Widespread unemployment, bank failures,
      homelessness and migration, industrial and agricultural decline, and a move towards substantial
      government economic intervention were characteristics of the Depression in the United States.
      Like Latin America, Canada was adversely affected by its close ties to the U.S. economy and by
      the loss of global markets. Characteristics of the depression in Canada were similar to the U.S.
      and Latin America. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


24.   Examine the impact of the Great Depression on the arts and culture in one country of the
      Americas.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Great Depression
      and the arts and culture in one country of the Americas. Candidates may examine the impact of the
      crisis in popular culture, imposing an emphasis in simplicity and frugality. Inexpensive amusements
      like backyard games, puzzles, card games, sports, libraries and board games became more
      popular. Candidates may also examine the role played by radio and films as they became a more
      common entertainment and were used in some cases to pass political and social messages.
      Candidates may also consider the Great Depression’s impact on music where many lyrics
      expressed a loss of faith, and the increase in the publication of literature and magazines. While
      many novels reflected the reality of the deprived population, a number of magazines glorified lives
      and pictures of certain aspects of society. In the comics superheroes emerged. Candidates may
      also examine the developments of two photographic trends during the crisis: the so-called engaged
      social photography, and the artistic, studio photography. In the field of pictorial art there were also
      representations of the critical social context, although the avant-garde movements also played a
      significant role in renewing painting. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 16 –              N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   “Diplomatic tensions were the main reason for involvement in the Second World War.” Discuss with
      reference to two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that diplomatic tensions were the main reason for the involvement of two countries of the Americas
      in the Second World War. Candidates may discuss other reasons for involvement, but they must
      address diplomatic tensions. For the US, there were diplomatic tensions between the US and
      Japan from the late 1930s onward as the US was attempting to stop Japanese expansion.
      Candidates may discuss that the bombing of Pearl Harbor was the main reason for US
      involvement. Tensions with Germany were less diplomatic and more military as Germany sank
      American ships. Canadian participation began shortly after Great Britain declared war on
      Germany. Canada entered to help defend Great Britain and the British Empire. For the most part,
      Latin American nations joined in response to direct German aggression or to protect the
      hemisphere. Candidates might refer to diplomatic tensions with the US as causing some Latin
      American nations to join. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   Evaluate the social impact of the Second World War on women and minorities up to 1945.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the social impact of the Second World
      War on women and minorities up to 1945. Responses will vary depending on the countries chosen
      to give examples. In nearly all countries, economic opportunities for women and minorities
      increased. Nevertheless, discrimination still existed resulting in lower pay and fewer opportunities
      than white counterparts. In many countries, the war presented greater opportunities for women and
      minorities in the military, with members in both groups gaining respect for their contributions. In
      some countries, the war led to internal migration from rural areas to urban centres or from one
      region to another. There may also have been increased immigration to fill vacant jobs. In a few
      countries, some minorities, especially those of Japanese origin were isolated to internment camps.
      Internment meant the loss of civil liberties, property losses as well as post-war stigma. In many
      countries, increased economic and social mobility fostered thoughts of racial and gender equality.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   “The economic policies of populist leaders had limited success.” Discuss with reference to two
      Latin American countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the economic policies of populist leaders had limited success. Candidates may support the
      statement by discussing that populist leaders had limited interest in the economy, focusing on
      political and social policies. Candidates may discuss that the economic plans of many populist
      leaders were narrow and/or inadequate, and only ensured a limited economic success during a few
      years. Candidates may also discuss that populist leaders were not successful in changing the
      traditional economic patterns of their countries, usually predominantly rural and with limited
      industrialization. They may also discuss populist leaders’ foreign relations as an obstacle. Since
      some leaders did not have close relations with financial organizations they were not accredited
      with loans and/or beneficial treaties. Candidates may challenge the statement considering that
      some countries experienced a modernization and a certain industrialization under the rule of
      populist leaders. They may also discuss that under populist leaders many citizens entered the
      middle class, improving their standard of living. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Evaluate the impact of guerrilla movements in one Latin American country.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of guerrilla movements in
      one Latin American country. Candidates may evaluate the impact of successful guerrilla
      movements like in the case of Cuba where the movement was able to establish a new state under
      different principles. They may also consider the response of Latin American establishments. Many
      governments (both democratic and dictatorships) strengthened their armed forces and joined US
      policies to counter guerrilla operations, like in the case of Brazil, Argentina, and Chile. Candidates
      may also consider the possible disagreements among parties and politicians regarding the
      treatment of guerrilla. Candidates may also evaluate the psychological impact of the acts
      performed by guerrillas. While part of the population could have actively or passively supported the
      guerrilla, in other cases their criminal acts alienated many citizens. Candidates may also evaluate
      that some guerrilla movements shifted from rural to urban guerrilla warfare with an emphasis on
      the use of collective terrorism, like in the case of Shining Path in Peru. Other relevant factors may
      be addressed, for example the economic distress caused by the guerrillas’ attacks. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                    – 18 –               N22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Evaluate the effectiveness of President Johnson’s Great Society policies.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of President Johnson’s Great Society
      policies, weighing up their strengths and limitations. Johnson’s Great Society was implemented
      through a Democratic controlled Congress and attempted to improve the lives of Americans by
      raising the standard of living and promoting racial equality. Candidates may evaluate the
      effectiveness of legislation such as Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start, Job Core or many other
      projects. These programs resulted in a significant decline in the rate of poverty, greater access to
      health care for the elderly and low-income citizens and improved education. Candidates may
      evaluate the effectiveness of laws dealing with racial equality such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
      the Voting Rights Act, the 24th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. This legislation
      banned discrimination in public places, eliminated several voting restrictions on people of color and
      promoted fair hiring and housing practices. Candidates may argue that these policies were all
      stymied by the cost of Vietnam. They may also argue that Johnson’s policies created a large
      federal deficit and a large bureaucracy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “Carter’s domestic policies were a complete failure.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Carter’s domestic policies were a complete failure. Carter is often seen as a failed president due to
      high unemployment, inflation, a recession, the energy crisis and failure to be re-elected. For
      candidates who support or partially support the statement, they are likely to refer to the many
      economic problems. They might also reference his inability to get legislation through a Democratic
      controlled Congress, resulting in vetoes and having vetoes overridden. Candidates who disagree
      or partially disagree may refer to his formation of the departments of Energy and Education,
      creation of a national energy policy which promoted alternative energy and decreased dependence
      on foreign oil, and de-regulation of the airlines, trains and trucking industry. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   To what extent can US participation in the Korean War be considered successful?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that US
      participation in the Korean War could be considered successful. In order to address this issue,
      candidates might consider the aims of US participation and determine whether they were met.
      Candidates may refer to the US desire to contain communism, to protect South Korea, and to show
      the strength of the United Nations against aggression. The US got UN Security Council approval
      for military action and had the help of 16 other nations. When the war ended, South Korea still
      existed, and communism had been contained to North Korea. Some might see this as successful.
      Others might see it as a failure as the US had appeared headed to a sweeping victory with
      unification of Korea a real possibility. Candidates might refer to China’s entry and the possibility of
      nuclear war. Candidates might refer to battlefield successes such as the landing at Inchon, driving
      North Korean forces out of the South and advancing far into North Korea. They might also refer to
      defeats in the field and the rapid retreat from the North. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Examine the response of Canada and Latin America to US involvement in Vietnam.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the response of
      Canada and Latin America to US involvement in Vietnam. Candidates may examine the lack of
      support from Canada for US participation. Canada did not participate militarily or publicly support
      US action in Vietnam and most Canadians opposed the war. However, Canadian business profited
      nicely from the war by selling needed materials to the Pentagon, and thousands of Canadians
      volunteered in the US to fight in the war. Because of its neutrality, Canada was a safe haven for
      thousands of US draft resisters and deserters. Anti-war protests were common in Canada. In
      general, Latin American countries did not support US efforts in Vietnam. Some, like Cuba, saw it
      as another example of American imperialism and denounced US participation. Cuba sent doctors
      and medical supplies to North Vietnam. Anti-war protests occurred in Cuba, Chile and Mexico.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   “The civil rights movement was largely successful in ending segregation in the South between
      1955 and 1980.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the civil rights movement was largely successful in ending segregation in the South between
      1955 and 1980. In answering this, candidates are expected to identify important events and laws of
      the civil rights movement and determine the extent to which they successfully ended segregation in
      the South during the time period stipulated. Candidates may discuss the Brown vs Board of
      Education, Central High in Little Rock, Freedom Riders, sit-ins, especially in Greensboro, the
      March on Washington and Selma, as well as the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, the Voting
      Rights Act of 1965 and the 24th Amendment. Candidates might argue that much was achieved on
      paper, but discrimination and segregation still existed. Many Southern governors, mayors and law
      enforcement officials resisted the federal government’s efforts. The Ku Klux Klan became more
      active and violent to prevent integration. Others might argue that despite opposition, federal laws
      and Supreme Court decisions were enforced, even if it required the force of the federal
      government. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


34.   “The impact of feminist movements in the Americas was limited.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      impact of feminist movements in the Americas was limited. The impact of feminist movements may
      vary throughout the region, and it may be true that the impact was meaningful in some countries
      and almost non-existent in others. Candidates might argue that feminist movements were most
      successful in the US, Canada, and Argentina, and indicate the many accomplishments in those
      countries, such as political involvement, higher education, professional careers and equality under
      the law. Cuba also made great strides in women's equality, but it was more government driven
      than the result of a feminist movement. Candidates might identify many Central American countries
      and poorer South American countries where feminist movements have had little impact.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Examine the continuities and changes in US foreign policy towards Latin America up to 2005.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between continuities and
      changes in US foreign policy towards Latin America up to 2005. Candidates should be able to see
      some continuity through the presidencies of Carter, Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton and GW Bush,
      and yet note some distinct changes. Candidates may examine continuities as a belief in the
      Monroe Doctrine, at least for Central America; military intervention; covert operations; support of
      anti-communist dictators; the isolation of Cuba and tying US foreign aid to a country’s behaviour.
      Overt military intervention occurred in Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989 and Haiti in 1994 and
      again in 2004. Covert operations took place in Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Haiti
      throughout the 80s and 90s, as well as Paraguay in the late 80s and Venezuela during Chavez’s
      rule. Candidates may examine changes between Carter and Reagan from supporting the
      Sandinistas in Nicaragua to supporting the contras trying to overthrow them. Also, Carter tied
      foreign aid to human rights which other presidents ignored. Another change could be US-Cuba
      relations which eased slightly through the period, and a greater willingness to allow socialist
      governments in Latin America. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   “The economy and debt were the most significant challenges faced after the transition to
      democracy.” Discuss with reference to two Latin American countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the economy and debt were the most significant challenges faced after the transition to
      democracy. Candidates may support the statement by discussing that the amount of debt blocked
      the economic plans of many new democratic governments since its payment was a requirement to
      attract foreign investments, and to be able to sign new financial and commercial treaties. The debt
      and its payment were also a challenge since many politicians from different parties did not agree
      on how to deal with it. Candidates may also discuss that many national economies suffered the
      destruction of their national industry, concentration of wealth, unemployment, etc. Candidates may
      challenge the statement discussing that the political reconstruction was the most significant
      problem since many parties and democratic institutions were banned or dismantled during previous
      authoritarian governments. Candidates may also consider that the judgement of the criminal acts
      committed by the previous dictatorships and their social impact were much more significant.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
