Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR
on the script where you are rewarding this.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to 2
dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only be
penalized ONCE for each type of error across all subparts of (b) questions.

(b)   (i)    Using information from Text A, paragraph 2 and Table 1, calculate the
             income elasticity of demand (YED) for agricultural goods in Tanzania
             considering the change in income between 2008 and 2018.                          [3]

        A student who shows only the YED calculation (21/35) correctly, with a correct answer
        can be awarded full marks.

        [2] only can be awarded for an answer without any working.

        OFR applies if a student makes a calculation error in the percentage change in income,
        [2] can be awarded

        If a student makes a calculation error in the final YED figure, [2] only can be awarded.

(ii)    Sketch a Lorenz curve diagram to show the change in Tanzania’s Gini
        coefficient from 2008 to 2018 (Table 2).                                              [2]

          For sketching a correctly labelled Lorenz curve showing an
          outward shift away from line of perfect/absolute equality.

        Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [1].
        For the vertical axis, the label may be (cumulative) percentage of income or
        percentage of income (GDP and GNI are valid alternatives to income but
        wealth is not acceptable). For the horizontal axis, the label may be
        (cumulative) percentage of population/people/households or percentage of
        population/people/households. A title is not necessary.

      1       There is a correct diagram OR an accurate written response.           1–2
              For a correct AD/AS diagram with appropriate labelling showing
              a shift in the AD curve to the left and a decrease in the average
              price level.
              OR
              For an explanation that the government increases demand for
              loans/money (and):
              • which increases interest rate/cost of borrowing [1]
              • lowering investment/consumption, decreasing AD, and
                  lowering inflationary pressure [1].
      2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.          3–4
              For a correct AD/AS diagram with appropriate labelling showing
              a shift in the AD curve to the left and a decrease in the average
              price level.
              AND
              For an explanation that the government increases demand for
              loans/money (and):
              • which increases interest rate/cost of borrowing [1]
              • lowering investment/consumption, decreasing AD, and
                  lowering inflationary pressure [1].

      Alternative approach:

      Increased government expenditure/borrowing may crowd out resources/reduce funds
      available to private investors which increases interest rates/cost of borrowing [1], lowering
      investment, decreasing AD and lowering inflationary pressure [1].

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For an AD/AS diagram, the vertical axis may be Average (General) Price Level, or Price
      Level. The horizontal axis may be real output, real national output, real income, real
      national income, real GDP or real Y. Any abbreviation of the previous terms is acceptable.
      A title is not necessary.

              right), resulting in more domestic output at the world price.
              OR
              For an explanation that a subsidy lowers costs of production for
              Tanzanian farmers [1], increasing the amount supplied by the
              domestic producers (allowing domestic producers to compete
              with imports) [1].

              For an explanation that as foreign firms invest in Tanzania they
              will demand more of Tanzania's currency/shilling [1] which
              increases the price/value of the currency / appreciation [1].

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Definitions may include:
Economic growth
Economic development
Interventionist supply-side policies

Economic models to support analysis may include:
• Lorenz diagram
• ADAS diagram
• Poverty cycle
• PPC

Possible barriers to economic growth and/or economic development in Tanzania
may include a discussion on some of the following:

Increasing absolute poverty
● Absolute poverty means that people do not have access to basic needs,
   trapping them in the poverty cycle and limited possibilities for economic growth
   and development. (Text A, paragraph 1, table 2)
● But relative poverty has fallen possibly explained by the divide between urban
   and rural areas (Text A, paragraph 1, Table 2)
● Although HDI has improved, the HDI country ranking is lower, meaning that
   Tanzania’s economic development has not improved as much compared to
   other countries (Table 2).

Rising inequality:
● Gini coefficient has increased from 2000-2018 (table 2), may lead to problems
   with social unrest (Text A, paragraph 4).
● Persistent inequality has not allowed for all people to benefit from the
   economic growth (Text A, paragraph 1)
● Rural – urban inequalities (Text A, paragraph 1, Table 2 data)
   ○ growth has not reached rural areas due to the focus on manufacturing and service
      industries (Text A, paragraph 1)
   ○ Most of the population is employed in agriculture (Text A, paragraph 2), limited
      opportunity for higher skilled jobs, which leads to higher incomes, better human capital,
      supporting further economic growth and development.
   ○ Rural areas have less access to electricity (Table 2), less economic development, also
      may inhibit new businesses and investment needed in rural areas (Text A, paragraph
      3).
   ○ Urban middle class accessing more resources (Text A, paragraph 4), resources may
      not be used in areas of need hindering economic development and economic growth.
   ○ Higher youth unemployment (Table 1), youth may be less skilled/experienced and
      therefore may find it more difficult to find jobs leading to lower growth and
      development.

Limited infrastructure:
● Insufficient infrastructure is significant as it supports the functioning of an
  economy and the ability for the population to conduct economic activity
  hindering economic growth. (Text B, paragraph 1).
● Inappropriate provision of infrastructure - urban rather than rural (Text A,
  paragraph 4), leading to less opportunities for economic growth and
  development.
● Farmers complaining that they cannot reach markets or suppliers due to lack
  of infrastructure (Text B, paragraph 1)
● Insufficient infrastructure may slow down potential land development, which is
  currently only using 30% (Text A, paragraph 2) limiting economic growth and
  access to increased income opportunities in the rural areas.

Low levels of human capital:
● Rural sector only involved in unskilled work, so population not developing
  human capital (text A, paragraph 2), limiting opportunities for economic
  development.
● Economic growth focussed on capital intensive manufacturing/services (text
  A, paragraph 1), limiting opportunities for developing human capital and
  economic development.
● Education spending has decreased (Table 2).
● Numbers of students completing secondary school has fallen (Table 2).
● Currently not exploiting opportunities EAC may offer the low-income earners
  as human capital needs improving (text B, paragraph 4)
● Less significant over time if aid programmes are successful (Text B,
  paragraph 2).

Access to healthcare
● Improvements in healthcare struggle to keep up with population growth (Text B,
  paragraph 1).
● Government spending on healthcare has decreased (Table 2).
● Leads to poor human capital - traps people in the poverty cycle.

Rural sector barriers/Reliance on primary sector:
● Poor productivity in the rural sector (Text A, paragraph 3).
● Lack of investment (Text A, paragraph 3).
● Low YED (Text A, paragraph 2) leads to limited growth - economic growth
  needed for economic development.
● However, a new oil pipeline might bring in FDI, fund infrastructure and create
  new jobs. (Text C, paragraph 1)
● Aid and government programmes could encourage new business
  development (Text B, paragraph 2)
● Lack of tradable crops and land resources not fully utilised to fully capacity
  (Text A, paragraph 2).

Level of external and government (national) debt:
● Financing repayments could take funds away from development initiatives
  (Table 1, Text 1 paragraph 5)
● Significant at the moment with the depreciating currency (Text A, paragraph
  5), but may be less of an issue if there is increased FDI (ECA and oil pipeline)
  inflows which may increase the demand of the currency and therefore the
  value. (Text B, paragraph 4, Text C, paragraph 1).

Informal Sector:
● Number of migrating youths are employed in the urban informal sector\ where
   working conditions are poor and unlikely to develop human capital (Text A
   paragraph 3).

Access to credit:
• Economists advised government to improve access to credit. If farmers cannot
  access credit, it is difficult for them to access capital needed to diversify. (Text
  B, paragraph 2).

Property rights:
• Lack of property rights has historically disincentivized farmers to invest in
  production, leading to low skills/productivity. Less significant now as the
  government has begun to introduce clear property rights. (Text B, paragraph 3).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.

A maximum of [9] should be awarded if only economic growth or economic
development is discussed.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Definitions may include:
• Economic growth
• Economic development

Economic models to support analysis may include:
● PPC
● Lorenz curve
● ADAS diagram
● Poverty cycle
● Exchange rate diagram

Discussion may include some of the following proposed IMF conditions:

Procedures and processes established to ensure good governance, including
enforcement of anti-corruption laws:
• High levels of corruption (table 4) have led to misallocation of funds (text D,
   paragraph 1). Growth has not occurred because funds are not given to areas of
   need. Anti-Corruption will prevent this, resources allocated more efficiently
   leading to increases in AD/AS leads to higher econ growth leading to higher
   levels of output and employment.
• Good governance and accountability (text F, paragraph 2) is needed for
   confidence to attract investment (domestic and foreign) which would support
   growth.
• Good governance and accountability (text F, paragraph 2) needed for aid to
   provide support which is aimed at rebuilding infrastructure and small/medium
   size business growth. This may help with growth, but also development.
• High levels of corruption are often associated with low growth and instability,
   growing poverty.
• Decrease tax evasion and improve tax collection to support problems with
   growing budget deficit, debt and provide funds needed to support growth.

Financial sector reforms implemented to build confidence in the banking system
and laws to control capital flight:
• Build confidence in banking sector to encourage remittances to come back
   into the country - increases AD, supporting economic growth and may help
   with the relative poverty growth (table 4)
• Will help control capital flight (text D, paragraph 1), and the resulting
   downward pressure this place on the currency, this may help with cost push
   inflation (text E, paragraph 3).
                                       – 24 –              N22/3/ECONO/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Government spending reduced and revenue increased through higher corporate,
wealth and personal income taxes for high-income earners. Introduction of a tax
on imported luxury goods and an increase of indirect taxes:
• Budget deficit will be helped (Table 3)
• Fiscal measures may result in decreased AD and hardship for some groups,
   may lead to further reduction in AD, further negative growth, loss of output,
   increased unemployment, lower economic development.
• If reduced spending is on removal of subsidies on basic needs hinders
   economic development (Text E, paragraph 1)
• Increased tax revenue could be used to fund inadequate infrastructure (text D,
   paragraph 2), and development of the manufacturing sector. (Text F,
   paragraph 2)
• Progressive tax system to redistribute income helps to decrease
   poverty/income inequality (text D, paragraph 1). Improving income equality
   leads to economic development. May help with the relative poverty (table 4)
• Increase government revenue through indirect taxes - helps with meeting debt
   repayments therefore improving credit ratings and access to loans (text D,
   paragraph 3)
• Indirect tax increases, decrease AS - cause cost push inflation is already
   problematic (text E, paragraph 1, Table 3).

Partially privatizing the electricity and telecommunications sectors to increase
efficiency and encourage the exploration of new energy sources.
• Efficient electricity and telecommunications that are essential for business
    activity to lead to economic development.
• Private partnership will encourage more efficiency, average costs may
    decrease, reduce need for government subsidies, and less pressure on the
    budget deficit (Text E, paragraph 2)
• Private sector may have conflicting objectives.
• New energy projects will be initiated to improve supply of electricity, improving
    quality and quantity of resources through better infrastructure (Text D,
    paragraph 2).

Transitioning from a managed to a floating exchange rate system.
• May initially be another depreciation - higher cost push inflation, however
   exports (luxury tourism) will become cheaper and more competitive - help with
   the persistent current account deficit (Text D, paragraph 3).
• Less reserve assets needed to maintain the managed rate. (Text E,
   paragraph 3).
• Floating rate is more likely to be self-correcting and therefore interest rate can
   be used for other objectives instead of attracting financial inflows to cover the
   current account deficit. (Text D, paragraph 3).
• Managed rates may have more certainly compared to floating.

If Lebanon meets the conditions, then this leads to:
• Government debt restructuring (Text F, paragraph 1, table 3):
    o Creating a sustainable repayment plan may ease debt repayments so the
      government can spend in other areas of need.
    o Will restructure debt to avoid future defaults (text D, paragraph 3), so will
      improve credit rating for future borrowing for further investment.
• Funds for infrastructure will be obtained (Text F, paragraph 1).

However,
• Unknown level of interference (Text F, paragraph 3)
• Any conditional lending may go against other government objectives. Poverty
  may increase further (Text F, paragraph 3).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.

A maximum of [9] should be awarded if only economic growth or economic
development is discussed.
