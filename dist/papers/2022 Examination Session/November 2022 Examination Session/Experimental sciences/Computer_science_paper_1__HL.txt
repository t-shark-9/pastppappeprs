Answer all questions.

10.   A company has a local area network (LAN). Ethernet (a wired network) and WiFi
      (a wireless network) are the two ways to enable LAN connections.

      The LAN is accessible to all employees through their personal accounts. At the office,
      employees can use either desktop computers for wired access to the LAN or personal
      laptops to connect wirelessly.

11.   An international organization is moving its offices from Africa to Europe. All of its data will
      need to be moved to a new system.

      (a)   (i)	Define the term data migration.[1]

            (ii)   Outline two issues that could arise concerning data migration.                              [4]

      (b)   Outline two aspects of change management that need to be considered, other than
            data migration.                                                                                    [4]

12.   A company is planning to transform its office building into a smart building. Among other
      things, a smart building can control the opening and closing of its doors.

      (a)   Outline two other operations that can be controlled by a smart building.                     [4]

      They play an important role in the collection and management of data.

      (b)   Explain how a smart building can control the opening and closing of all its doors.
            You should refer to sensors, processors and output transducers.                              [4]

                   a hardware device needs attention.                                                    [2]

      (d)   Explain why transforming the building into a smart building will be beneficial for
            the company.                                                                                 [3]

13.   A list of students’ names and test scores are written in a teacher’s notebook in alphabetical
      order. The teacher uses an application that allows her to input all of the names and scores
      in the order they appear in her notebook. The application orders the scores from highest to
      lowest and then outputs all the names and scores (see Figure 1).

                    Figure 1: An example of the input and output of the application

                                          Input:             Output:

                                          Anna 56            Zara 90
                                          Ava 47             Emma 87
                                          Baker 24           Nolan 63
                                          Emma 87            Anna 56
                                          Nolan 63           Ava 47
                                          Zara 90            Baker 24

      The application:
      y inputs the names and scores
      y stores the input data in two arrays: NAMES and SCORES (see Figure 2)

                                 Figure 2: The NAMES and SCORES arrays

                    NAMES       Anna       Ava       Baker     Emma     Nolan     Zara
                                 [0]       [1]       [2]          [3]   [4]       [5]

                    SCORES        56        47        24          87     63        90

      For example, NAMES[3] holds the student’s name (Emma), and her score (87) can be found
      in SCORES[3].

      The application also:
      y sorts the input data in order of scores from the highest to the lowest by using a bubble sort
        algorithm.
      y outputs the sorted data.

      (a)   (i)	Describe the steps in the bubble sort algorithm that sorts the input data stored in
                 the SCORES and NAMES arrays in order of scores.                                        [5]

            (ii)   Identify one alternative sorting algorithm.                                          [1]

      A decision has been made to create a new application. It will use a binary tree as an
      alternative to the two arrays.

      (b)   Identify the components of a node in a binary tree.                                         [3]

      The input data will be inserted into the binary tree so that an inorder traversal of the
      binary tree would output all the students’ names and scores, sorted from the highest
      to the lowest score.

      (c)   Describe the steps in this insertion process.                                               [6]

14.   An integer divisor of an integer, N(N>0), is an integer greater than zero that divides N without
      leaving a remainder. The proper divisors of N are divisors of N other than N itself.

      For example:
      y The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5 and 10.
      y The proper divisors of 10 are 1, 2 and 5.

      X(X>0) and Y(Y>0) are two integers.

      (a)   Construct a logic expression that evaluates to True if X is a proper divisor of Y and to
            False otherwise.                                                                               [2]

      The subprogram sumPD(N) accepts an integer, N(N>1), and returns the sum of all proper
      divisors of N. For example, sumPD(16) returns 15 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15).

      (b)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for the subprogram sumPD(N).[3]

      Every number can be classified as abundant, deficient, or perfect according to the
      following definitions:

      A number is an abundant number if it is less than the sum of its proper divisors.
      For example, 12 is an abundant number because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, and 16 > 12.

      A number is a deficient number if it is greater than the sum of its proper divisors.
      For example, 9 is a deficient number because 1 + 3 = 4, and 4 < 9.

      A number is a perfect number if it is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. For example,
      28 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, and 28 = 28.

      Assume that the two-dimensional array MAT holds positive integers.

      An algorithm should be written that creates three one-dimensional arrays, named ABUNDANT,
      DEFICIENT and PERFECT, so that
      y the array ABUNDANT holds all the abundant numbers of the two-dimensional array MAT
      y the array DEFICIENT holds all the deficient numbers of the two-dimensional array MAT
      y the array PERFECT holds all the perfect numbers of the two-dimensional array MAT.

(Question 14 continued)

     For example, if the 4 × 6 two-dimensional array MAT holds 24 positive integers, as follows:

                                      [0]        [1]       [2]        [3]       [4]        [5]
                              [0]      6         12        20         42         3         48
                              [1]     78         28        70         80         2         16
                              [2]     60         72        10         56         9         54

     then the three arrays should be:

                 [0]    [1]
      PERFECT     6      28
                 [0]    [1]     [2]        [3]     [4]          [5]     [6]          [7]     [8]     [9]   [10]   [11]

     (c)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode to create the three one-dimensional arrays,
           ABUNDANT, DEFICIENT and PERFECT, as described.

           You may assume that the two-dimensional array MAT is inputted and three
           one‑dimensional arrays of sufficient size are initialized.

           You should call the sumPD() subprogram in your algorithm.                                                    [10]
