Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  N22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Use Figures 1(a) and 1(b) to identify Species B and Species C.                                 [2]

           Species B: Nuttall’s cottontail/(Sylvilagus nuttallii);
           Species C: black-tailed jackrabbit/(Lepus californicus);

     (b)   The sagebrush ecosystem provides a habitat for pygmy rabbits. Suggest one reason
           why there might be a greater number of pygmy rabbits in the ecosystem shown in
           Figure 1(c) than in the ecosystem shown in Figure 1(d).                          [1 max]

           a.   wider variety of food/increased amount of food sources;
           b.   more cover from predators;
           c.   easier to dig down because of root systems/less compaction;


     (c)   Describe one method to determine the impact of invasive cheatgrass on sagebrush
           density.                                                                        [3 max]

           a.     (choice of study area): compare sagebrush habitat with invasive cheatgrass to one
           without it/carry out survey before and after introduction of invasive species (control);
           b.     (sample sites within each study area): randomly/systematically select sampling
           points/sites;
           c.     (method of estimation): use quadrat sampling/aerial photos to…;
           d.     (estimate densities): …determine number/biomass/percentage cover of sagebrush
           (and cheatgrass) in each sampling point;
           e.     (increase reliability of statistics): take a large enough number of samples/estimate
           mean densities of plants;
           f.     (statistical analysis) identify trends/patterns of density difference through t-test/
           negative correlation through Pearson's r/or other valid test;

     (d)   Distinguish between the biodiversity of the sagebrush ecosystems in Figures 1(c)
           and 1(d).                                                                               [2 max]

           a.   greater overall biodiversity without cheatgrass/in Fig 1c;
           b.   greater habitat/species/genetic diversity without cheatgrass/Fig 1c
           c.   greater richness of species without cheatgrass/in Fig 1c;
           d.   greater evenness of species without cheatgrass/in Fig 1c;

           Note: Accept in the converse
                                                   –6–                N22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Identify one transformation shown in Figure 2(a).                                            [1]

           evapotranspiration;

           Note: Do not credit evaporation or transpiration alone.



     (b)   Calculate the difference in water infiltration between the forest and urban environments.    [1]

           (50% – 15%) = 35% ;

           Note: Only [1] so working not required / credit final answer but only if it includes ‘%’ sign
           Credit can be given if both shallow and deep infiltration are calculated separately (i.e. 15% +
           20% respectively)

     (c)   Outline how one storage in the hydrological cycle decreases with urbanization.          [1 max]

           a.   groundwater/aquifers/soil water will decrease due to less infiltration/more
                runoff;
           b.   atmospheric storage/humidity will decrease because of reduction in
                evapotranspiration;
           c.   biomass storage will decrease because of loss of trees;

           Credit any aspect of urbanisation that will diminish any valid water storage.

     (d)   Calculate the percentage of water projected to be used for agriculture in 2025,
           shown in Figure 2(b).                                                                        [1]
           2500
                x 100 = 58.8% / 59% ;
           4250

     (e)   Suggest one reason for the projected decrease in the demand for water in
           agriculture between 2014 and 2025, shown in Figure 2(b).                                [1 max]

           a.   improvements in irrigation techniques that use less water;
           b.   increase in use of crop varieties that use less water/are drought-resistant;
           c.   cultural shift away from eating meat / thirsty/water-intensive crops;

           Credit can be awarded for any factors that reduce water consumption / increase
               efficiency of use.

     (f)   Outline two reasons why water demand shown in Figure 2(b) is projected to
           increase globally from 2014–2040.                                                       [2 max]

           a.    increased population increases demands for drinking/food production ;
           b.    greater demand for meat/water-intensive food items would increase irrigation;
           c.    drier climate (due to climate change) would increase water requirements for
                 irrigation/watering lawns/drinking;
           d.    increased urbanization usually entails increased water demand (street
                 cleaning, watering parks and artificial green areas, losses due to water
                 transfer);
           e.    rising standard of living increases per capita water usage (bathing, pools,
                 washing machines, watering lawns, cleaning paved surfaces);
                                                    –7–                 N22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Note: Do not accept reasons resulting in increased water usage for industries and energy generation,
as these sections remain stable in figure; only credit reasons that, at least implicitly, link to increased
domestic or agricultural water usage.

      (g)   Outline two strategies to meet an increasing demand for domestic water.                   [2 max]

            a.   fix leaking pipes to stop water loss;
            b.   improve water efficiency of appliances/shower heads/toilets to make more
                 available for other needs;
            c.   provide education/campaign to encourage people to use less / increase prices
                 to decrease demand/introduce legal rationing of water;
            d.   artificial recharge of aquifers for domestic withdrawal;
            e.   use grey water so more freshwater is available for use;
            f.   rainwater capture can increase the amount available, if it would have otherwise
                 been lost to the locality;
            g.   desalination can increase the amount of fresh water available for domestic use;
            h.   building of dams/reservoirs to store water;

            Only credit factors that refer to domestic/general water use (not
                agricultural/industrial).
                                                  –8–                  N22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Identify one region shown in Figure 3 that has an ecological footprint less than its
           biocapacity.                                                                                 [1]

           South America / Non-EU Europe;

     (b)   Outline one reason why a region whose ecological footprint is greater than its
           biocapacity is considered unsustainable.                                                 [1 max]

           a.   creating more waste than can be absorbed by the land / causing degradation of the
                environment;
           b.   using more resources than the land/sea can replace / overexploitation of resources;
           c.   society would not survive in this region without net import of resources;

     (c)   Outline one way in which a region can exceed its carrying capacity.                      [1 max]

           a.   importing resources from other regions;
           b.   exporting its waste products to other regions;
           c.   increasing range of resources used/technological development, e.g. desalination;
           d.   switching/substitution of resources/discovery of new reserves;
           e.   adopting more sustainable lifestyles;

           Note Strictly speaking, c,d and e increase carrying capacity, but allow credit for these.

     (d)   Productivity contributes to the biocapacity of land. Outline one climatic factor that
           limits the primary productivity of a region.                                             [1 max]

           a.   low precipitation/drought conditions means less water for
                plants/photosynthesis;
           b.   low temperatures decrease photosynthetic rates/frozen water is unavailable to plants;
           c.   low insolation means little light for photosynthesis;
           d.   very high temperatures at which rate of photosynthesis decreases/less water
                available through increased evaporation;

           Do not credit naming the factor alone (e.g. low precipitation) ...it must be linked to
           productivity as in eg’s above.
                                                  –9–                N22/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Evaluate the use of the ecological footprint as a model.                                 [4 max]

           Strengths/advantages: [2 max]
           a. a useful snapshot of the sustainability of a population’s lifestyle/simple
               quantitative index of sustainability;
           b. a tangible tool for individuals/governments/countries to measure/compare their
               environmental impact / to identify necessary changes in lifestyle;
           c. iconic symbol/image for raising awareness of environmental issues;
           d. widely accepted and understood by general public;

           Limitations/disadvantages: [2 max]
           e. does not include all information on the environmental impacts of human activities;
           f. only a model so simplified/not precise;
           g. approximation of actual figures which cannot be accurately calculated/based on
                doubtful assumptions;
           h. does not show types of resources used / shows only total resources;
           i. negative in approach so could be perceived as de-motivating;
           j. considers land as productive/valuable only if it is directly useful to humans;

           Appraisal that is substantiated [1 max];

Example: Although the EF as a model isn’t precise, it can provide useful information to help
reduce an individual’s environmental impact.

                                               Section B
4.   (a)   Distinguish between point and non-point sources of pollution with reference to
           named examples.                                                                             [4 max]

           a.   point source comes from a single source whereas non-point source comes from
                multiple/dispersed sources;
           b.   point sources more easily identifiable (than non-point source);
           c.   point sources are more easily managed (than non-point source);
           d.   e.g. point source such as a sewage pipe/factory smokestack/drainage ditch;
           e.   e.g. non-point source such as runoff of fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural
                land/soil erosion from improperly managed construction sites/oil and toxic
                chemicals from urban runoff/vehicle-exhaust emissions;

           Note: Award 3 max if no examples are given

     (b)   For a named water pollutant, evaluate two management strategies to maintain the
           sustainability of water sources.                                                            [7 max]

           Strategy:
           a. reducing human activities that produce pollutants / use alternatives to fertilizers
               and detergents that reduce nitrate and phosphate input/slow-release fertilizers
               /reduce fossil fuel use to reduce acid preciptitaion;
           Advantage:
           b. stops pollution of resource at source;
           c. can save money spent on e.g. fertilizers;
           Disadvantage:
           d. can impact livelihoods/food resource productivity;
           e. difficulty in changing people’s behaviour/lifestyle;

           Strategy:
           f. reducing release of pollution into the environment/treatment to remove
               nitrates/phosphates/pollutants from emisssions/effluent/planting of buffer
               zones;
           Advantage:
           g. planting of buffer zones creates a new habitat;
           h. prevents eutrophication/impact on ecosystem;
           Disadvantage:
            I. cost of treatment;
            j. requires enforcement;

           Strategy:
           k. removing pollutants from the environment/removal of mud from eutrophic lakes/
               restoration of ecosystems/reintroduction of plant and fish species/liming of
               acidified lakes;
           Advantage:
           l. community/biodiversity is restored;
           m. will encourage further pollution management to sustain system;
           Disadvantage:
           n. high cost of restorative strategies;
           o. full restoration is uncertain/takes time;

           Note: Award [4] max for each strategy (1max for named strategy, 2 max for
           advantage 2 max for disadvantage. Award 4 max if no water pollutant named.
           Accept any other relevant example/strategies to those given. If two strategies from
           the same MP are addressed then just give credit for highest scoring one.

    (c) Human activities have improved global air quality during the past 50 years. With reference to
examples, discuss this statement.   [9 max]

           The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
           offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
           markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with “understanding
           concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
           seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
           deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

6.   (a)   Outline the role of the greenhouse effect in regulating the temperature on Earth.          [4 max]

           a.     the principal greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide/CO2, methane/CH4, water vapour,
           nitrous oxide/N2O; (no credit for anthropogenic GHGs, like tropospheric ozone, CFCs, HFCs)
           b.     …and are found in the troposphere;
           c.     sun light (visible/short wavelengths) pass through GHGs/reach the Earth and warm its
           surface;
           d.     fwarm Earth surface is re-radiating energy outward as infra-red radiation/heat; (no
           credit for “reflection” of light/heat)
           e.     GHGs are opaque to/absorb outgoing IR/long wavelength radiation;
           f.     much of the heat energy is therefore retained/raising the average temperature of the
           Earth surface (to 15°C);

           Credit any waste disposal strategy that reduces CO2 in atmosphere (mitigation) and is
               clearly linked to domestic waste

           Strategy:
           a. increased reusing/recycling/reduction of resource use;
           Advantage:
           b. recycling/reducing/reusing prevents release of GHGs through landfill/incineration;
           c.    recycling/reducing/reusing prevents release of GHGs in production of further
           materials;
           Disadvantage:
           d.    involves sorting and transportation costs;
           e     requires challenging behavioural changes;

           Strategy:
           f. incineration / use for energy production / combustion/oxidation of methane;
           Advantage:
           g. waste can be used to produce heat or electricity / this could replace the energy
               produced using coal or other fuels;
           i.    CO2 produced has lower greenhouse equivalent than methane;
           Disadvantage:

           Strategy:
           l. collection of methane from landfills;
           Advantage:
           m. Can be burnt as fuel (CO2 has lower greenhouse equivalent);
           Disadvantage:
           n. requires sophisticated equipment not accessible to LEDCs;
           o. would promote further use of landfills instead of decommissioning;

           Strategy:
           p. composting;
           Advantage:
           q. replacing production of inorganic/artificial fertilizers which contributes to climate
               change;
           Disadvantage:
           r. sorting costs;
           s. produces methane;

            Natural selection occurs through the following mechanism:

            a.   natural selection acts on the genetic variation of a population;
            b.   formed by mutations in previous generations;
            c.   (when environmental conditions change), some individuals will be fitter/more
            advantageous than others;
            d.   thus will survive and reproduce at higher rates;
            e.   inheriting these advantageous traits to their offspring;
            f.   hence the frequency of that advantageous character will increase in the population;

      Above points may be credited through an example

      (b)   Explain the link between soil fertility, primary productivity and human activity.          [7 max]

            a.      soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to support plant growth/primary productivity;
            b       This will depend upon the nutrient availability in soils;
            c …and appropriate availability/retention/drainage of water in soils;
            d. ...and appropriate soil pH/low salinity to allow for plant growth;
            e. It will also depend upon appropriate soil texture/aeration/malleability;
            f …and also the community of soil organisms that maintain its nutrient content/condition;
            g. human activities may deplete nutrient content through over irrigation/
            overcropping/monoculture/overgrazing;
            h. human activities may increase salinity through over-irrigation;
            i. human activities may increase soil erosion/compaction through
            tilling/overgrazing/overcropping/land clearance
            j. human activities may lower pH through emissions of NOx/SOx/acid precipitation;
            k. human activities may reduce soil water through evaporation due to anthropogenic global
            warming;
            l. human activities may improve nutrient content through fertilization/polyculture;
            m. human activities may reduce erosion through drip irrigation/terracing/ wind breaks/contour
            ploughing;
            n. human activities may improve soil texture through conditioners/organic fertilizer;
