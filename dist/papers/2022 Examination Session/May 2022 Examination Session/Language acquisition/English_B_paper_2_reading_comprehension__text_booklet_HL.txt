               Useful diet tips on the road to recovery




         In a healthy-eating workshop session at a patient support centre in Hong Kong, about
         20 people listen attentively as a dietitian explains the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle.
         The participants, many of whom have recovered from cancer, are also given tips on how
         to get all the nutrients they need if they adopt a meat-free approach.

   5     The gathering is one of the highlights of a wellness programme set up by Maggie’s
         Cancer Caring Centre. Helen Lui, who runs the charity, said it was important to
         make sure patients got enough nutrients during and after their treatment. Under the
         theme “Eating Well”, an array of activities have been staged at the organisation’s
         specially-designed centre, all aimed at helping patients better equip themselves for
  10     the challenges of their illnesses. “As well as talks on nutrition, since body conditions
         among patients vary, we also carry out diet assessment for individuals and make specific
         recommendations to them,” Lui said.

         Dietitian Sally Poon, who hosted the healthy-eating workshop, said demand for one-on-
         one diet assessment was huge. When designing personal diet plans for patients, Poon
  15     sometimes had to address their concerns about widely-believed food myths, which
         prompted many to avoid certain ingredients. “I explain to them whether these food myths
         are substantiated by scientific evidence,” she said. “It’s important for patients to eat
         enough calories. We don’t normally encourage them to quit any particular type of food.”

         Mok Chun-keung, 66, sought advice from the diet expert to deal with his digestive
  20     problems. The retiree stopped eating meat after being diagnosed with cancer about two
         years ago. “I just ate vegetables,” Mok said. He is thankful that Poon has helped him to
         balance his diet.

         The centre was founded by Maggie Jencks, who had first-hand experience of living with
         cancer. She used this to create a blueprint for a new type of care. The philanthropist saw
  25     the need for a welcoming place away from a hospital, where patients, their families and
         friends could go for support.

         The first Maggie’s Centre opened in Edinburgh in 1996, a year after her death. In 2008,
         the charity opened a temporary centre in Hong Kong, which was relocated five years later
         to its present address, in a building designed by architect Frank Gehry.

         How to Help Students Avoid Heritage Language* Loss
        For students who have immigrated to the United States or who come from families who do not
         speak English as the primary language at home, learning to speak English fluently is one way to
         ensure proper communication and education in the classroom. Over time, however, as children
         assimilate more into the English-dominated world, both in the classroom and with their peers,
         they may begin to lose some of their heritage language due to lack of practice outside the
         home. This may even result in English becoming the primary language at home, at least among
         the children in the family, and cause potential communication issues and barriers if students do
         experience this language loss.

        Since strong student-parent communication is vital for a student’s success in school, we’ve
         compiled a few ways your school can aid students and parents with limited English proficiency
         when it comes to language loss.

           1. [ – 21 – ] If the school system has the ability to offer dual-language courses for these
            students, it will help encourage the use of their primary language outside of the home.
            Where older students are able to choose elective type classes, guide them in their choice of
            language class. It would be beneficial for them to focus on preserving the language skills
            they already have rather than learning a new language from scratch.

           2. [ – 22 – ] Inform them about the potential of language loss and ways they can encourage
            the use of the primary language both at home and in the community. Parents may assume
            that using English in the home will benefit the child by speeding up the process of learning
            English in general. However, this can increase the loss of their heritage language, as the child
            will no longer have an outlet for using this language if it is not spoken on a regular basis
            at home.

           3. [ – 23 – ] Research language groups and activities in the community that may afford
            the child an opportunity to use his/her heritage language outside of school or the home
            and compile a list of these options in the parents’ language on a professionally-translated
            handout.

           4. [ – 24 – ] This can make a big difference in helping parents feel comfortable discussing
            any issues, or celebrating their child’s accomplishments, with you. It also allows students to
            see their heritage language being used in a setting outside the home.

        If these students see that your school places a level of importance on their heritage language,
         it increases the likelihood that they will want to continue speaking it both inside and outside the
         home. This not only allows students to see the value of their heritage language in a range of
         settings, but such extra measures also showcase its importance to the school.




* Heritage Language: a non-dominant language in a society (for example in the US context,
  Spanish, Korean or Hawaiian), which may be spoken in the home or community

         An extract from Journey On A Perfect Little Train
         For seven hours on the way to the small north
         Punjabi town of Palumpur we wiggled our way
         across ancient bridges and one very new one on
         a steep gradient towards the great snowy ridge.
    5    After three hours, that ridge began to tower into
         the middle distance like a foam-crested tidal wave.
         In the trough below, our little train fussed through
         an amazingly English-looking landscape, through
         groves of English-looking trees and English-
  10     looking grasses and ferns. Oranges and pale blue flowers brushed our carriage door and small
         moths flew in and out of it. There were frequent stops. Mr Gosain, the driver, yanked on the
         steam brake and we clattered lightly into a minute station, with a minute platform and a minute
         old-fashioned waiting-room and ticket-office combined. At each stop, as railwaymen used to
         do in Britain, Mr Gosain handed the token pouch on its football-size ring to a station porter.
  15     Mr Mehta and his assistant threw open the guard’s van doors and porters languidly off-loaded
         bundles, sacks, bicycles and other cargo.

                                                         ***
         At Jawalamukhi Road station a notice said: “No roof riding is permitted due to fixed structure
         ahead” – anyone on the roof would have been swept off and deposited into the thick, deep
         grass over which the butterflies danced at the trackside. But we had no one on the roof. The
  20     passengers were content to open the carriage doors and stand laughing on the running board
         outside the stately moving train or hang out of the windows waving to people in the fields, or
         bullock cart drivers at small level crossings, or at each other as we negotiated one of the many
         sweeping bends.

         “Please join me on the footplate,” said Mr Gosain at one station. “Interesting curves ahead, sir,
  25     you would like to see them.”

         So I clambered up into the little engine cabin. Mr Gosain carefully put on his glasses, turned
         the driving lever to “High” and we slowly gathered speed. There was a red mark – probably for
         danger – on the speed gauge where it said 30 kilometres per hour. The needle sailed past the
         red mark. The little engine shook and rattled and headed at what seemed like enormous speed
  30     towards a viaduct over an abyss.

         Mr Gosain, ecstatically baring his twin tusks, shouted: “How do you like my driving? I am the
         speed champion!” We were approaching 45 kilometres an hour – not, you may say, something
         to break any records, but on this track it seemed enough for Mr Gosain, had he so wished, to
         have retracted the undercarriage, pulled back on the lever, and lifted gently off the ground.
  35     But, of course, all was well. Mr Gosain’s elderly co-driver, a small silent man in a corner of the
         cabin, motioned deferentially to the speed gauge. Mr Gosain casually flicked on the brake
         lever, and we racketed across the viaduct safely and in fine style.
