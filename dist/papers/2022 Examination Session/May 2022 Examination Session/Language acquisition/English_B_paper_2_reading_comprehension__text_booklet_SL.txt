         Teen inventor’s tips to make you creative
         When Ann Makosinski was growing up in Canada, she
         didn’t play video games and seldom watched television
         – only half an hour on weekends when her schoolwork
         was done. Instead, she listened to 19th century opera and
    5    classical Indian music, learned piano and violin, watched
         silent films at home and played with electronic gadgets.

         Now 19 years old, Makosinski has won several major
         prizes for her inventions. These include a flashlight that
         works with the heat of the human hand and a coffee cup
  10     that uses heat to charge a phone.

         Our news reporter talked with her to get some advice about how to be creative from an early
         age and how to turn a good idea into an invention. Here are some of her tips.

         Turn off your phone
         Unlike most of her friends, Makosinski did not have a cellphone at high school. She says she
  15     concentrated better on her studies without it. She suggests that creative people who want more
         time to invent go on a technology-free diet for a week or two. “In this way, they will have more
         spare time.”

         The appearance of an invention is important
         Makosinski chose to study English literature at university. She explains that it is important to
  20     develop an interest in both art and science. “If you make something but the invention does not
         look good to the customer, nobody is going to buy it.”

         Do not stop doing a project because it is difficult
         According to Makosinski, one of the hardest parts of creating something is not giving up even
         when the task is difficult and you are not good at it.

  25     When you are doing a project, do not go to parties
         Makosinski believes that you must concentrate on a project. “You should not listen to loud music
         or go to social get-togethers.”

         Accept that the project may not work at the beginning
         Makosinski says that when you start to create something you must not think about the goal
  30     or the dream but instead, accept you might not be successful. “The first time you try to make
         something, it probably won’t work but you learn more when you fix a mistake than when you get
         it right immediately.”
                     –3–                                         2222 – 2240

               Useful diet tips on the road to recovery




        In a healthy-eating workshop session at a patient support centre in Hong Kong, about
         20 people listen attentively as a dietitian explains the benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle.
         The participants, many of whom have recovered from cancer, are also given tips on how
         to get all the nutrients they need if they adopt a meat-free approach.

        The gathering is one of the highlights of a wellness programme set up by Maggie’s
         Cancer Caring Centre. Helen Lui, who runs the charity, said it was important to
         make sure patients got enough nutrients during and after their treatment. Under the
         theme “Eating Well”, an array of activities have been staged at the organisation’s
         specially-designed centre, all aimed at helping patients better equip themselves for
         the challenges of their illnesses. “As well as talks on nutrition, since body conditions
         among patients vary, we also carry out diet assessment for individuals and make specific
         recommendations to them,” Lui said.

        Dietitian Sally Poon, who hosted the healthy-eating workshop, said demand for one-on-
         one diet assessment was huge. When designing personal diet plans for patients, Poon
         sometimes had to address their concerns about widely-believed food myths, which
         prompted many to avoid certain ingredients. “I explain to them whether these food myths
         are substantiated by scientific evidence,” she said. “It’s important for patients to eat
         enough calories. We don’t normally encourage them to quit any particular type of food.”

        Mok Chun-keung, 66, sought advice from the diet expert to deal with his digestive
         problems. The retiree stopped eating meat after being diagnosed with cancer about two
         years ago. “I just ate vegetables,” Mok said. He is thankful that Poon has helped him to
         balance his diet.

        The centre was founded by Maggie Jencks, who had first-hand experience of living with
         cancer. She used this to create a blueprint for a new type of care. The philanthropist saw
         the need for a welcoming place away from a hospital, where patients, their families and
         friends could go for support.

        The first Maggie’s Centre opened in Edinburgh in 1996, a year after her death. In 2008,
         the charity opened a temporary centre in Hong Kong, which was relocated five years later
         to its present address, in a building designed by architect Frank Gehry.
