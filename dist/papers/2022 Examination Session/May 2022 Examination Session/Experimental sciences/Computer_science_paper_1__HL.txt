      Some cars have adaptive cruise control. This uses RADAR technology and a processor to
      ensure the car stays the same distance away from the car in front.

            feedback loop ensure the car stays the same distance away from the car in front.            [6]

14.   The flowchart on page 6 represents an algorithm that allows a user to enter the number
      of sides, length of side and apothem (see diagram below) for a regular polygon. It then
      calculates and outputs the area and perimeter of this shape.

      Worked example: a regular hexagon

      Number of sides = 6

      Length of side = 10 cm

      Apothem = 8.66 cm

      Perimeter = Number of sides × Length of side

                 = 6 × 10

                 = 60 cm

(Question 14 continued)

     (a)   From the flowchart on page 6, pseudocode is to be created that will include
           sub‑programs to calculate and return the perimeter and area of the shape.

           (i)     Construct pseudocode for the body of the following sub-program to calculate
                   and return the perimeter of the shape.

                   SUB_PERIMETER(NUM_SIDES, LENGTH_SIDE)
                       // Pseudocode to be added

           (ii)    Construct a similar sub-program to the one in part (i) to calculate and return the
                   area of the shape.

                   You must use an appropriate name for the sub-program and appropriate names
                   for the parameters.                                                                    [4]

           (iii)   Construct pseudocode based on the flowchart on page 6 to collect input from the
                   user, call the sub-programs created in parts (i) and (ii), and output the results.     [5]

     (b)   Without using pseudocode, explain how your algorithms could be altered to also find
           the area and circumference of a circle.

           Note:

           Area of circle = πr 2

           Circumference of circle = 2πr [4]




                                                                                                  Turn over

15.   Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a method used to represent mathematical expressions
      so they can be evaluated without the need for parentheses.

      An expression written in this form is known as postfix notation, whereas an expression
      written the traditional way is known as infix notation.

      For example:
                                        Infix notation: (8 – 5) * 7
                                     Postfix notation: 8 5 – 7 *

      Both the infix and postfix expressions have the same result: 21

      RPN expressions are evaluated from left to right as follows:
      y Each character is checked,
        ◦ if it is a digit, it is pushed onto a stack.
        ◦ if it is a mathematical operator, the last two digits are popped from the stack and evaluated
          as though the current operator was between them. The result of this operation is then
          pushed back onto the stack.
      y The process is repeated until all the characters in the RPN expression have been used.
      y The value left in the stack is the result of the expression.

      A collection named RPN already stores an expression formatted in Reverse Polish notation.
      The algorithm reads the values from the collection and, using a stack data structure, evaluates it.

      RPN.resetNext()
      loop while RPN.hasNext()
          VALUE = RPN.getNext()
          loop while not (VALUE = "+" or VALUE = "-" or VALUE = "*" or VALUE = "/")
               stack.push(VALUE)
               VALUE = RPN.getNext()
          end loop
          OPERAND2 = stack.pop()
          OPERAND1 = stack.pop()
          if VALUE = "+" then
            NEW_VAL = OPERAND1 + OPERAND2
            stack.push(NEW_VAL)
          end if
          if VALUE = "-" then
            NEW_VAL = OPERAND1 - OPERAND2
            stack.push(NEW_VAL)
          end if
          if VALUE = "*" then
            NEW_VAL = OPERAND1 * OPERAND2
            stack.push(NEW_VAL)
          end if
          if VALUE = "/" then
            NEW_VAL = OPERAND1 / OPERAND2
            stack.push(NEW_VAL)
          end if
      end loop
      RESULT = stack.pop()
      output "The result is: ", RESULT

      (a)     Copy and complete the trace table for the algorithm using the RPN collection data:             [6]

                                            5 2 + 25 16 - * 3 /


              VALUE            OPERAND2            OPERAND1            NEW_VAL             Output

                 5



      (b)     Explain why a stack is used in the process of evaluating the expression in the algorithm. [3]

      An alternative data structure in which the expression used in part (a) may be stored is a
      binary tree. If the tree is traversed using postorder tree traversal, the output is formatted
      in RPN.

      (c)     Outline the steps involved in traversing the given tree using postorder tree traversal.        [4]

      (d)     State the output from the given tree using inorder tree traversal.                             [2]
