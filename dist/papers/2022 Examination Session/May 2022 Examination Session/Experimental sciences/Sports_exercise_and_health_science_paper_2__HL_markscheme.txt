         rotating objects have angular motion, moment of inertia and angular velocity work
         inversely to conserve angular momentum once an object is in motion;
         the moment of inertia of a rotating object can be changed by redistributing the mass of
         the object about the axis of rotation <enabling the gymnast to perform a somersault>;                            4 max
         at the start of the flight phase, the gymnast begins flexes their hips to reduce their
         moment of inertia;
         the reduction in moment of inertia increases angular velocity, this allows the
         somersault to be executed;
         prior to landing they extend their hips to increase moment of inertia;
         increasing moment of inertia reduces rotation / slows the gymnast for landing;

5.   c   when a force is applied by the skater to attempt to move from stationary to skating /
         overcome inertia, this is considered the coefficient of static friction;
         at some point, the force applied is sufficient to overcome the inertia / static friction and
         the skater will begin to move;                                                                                   2 max
         once the skater is in motion, sufficient force is applied to overcome static friction, this is

        this can be minimized by changing the surface to reduce the interaction between
        surface and fluid;
        example: the use of shark-skin suits in swimming or shaving the swimmer’s body to
        make it smooth;
        Form drag:
        as a body pushes against a fluid, the fluid pushes back;
        by streamlining the body and minimizing the surface area facing the direction of the

        example: adopting a low-profile position during diving into the water, during the
        strokes and tumble turns;
        Wave drag:
        when a body moves along the surface of a fluid some fluid is displaced to form a
        wave;
        these waves cause additional forces that oppose motion;
        wave drag can be reduced by avoiding motion at the interface between air and
        water;

        of waveless swimming pools;

        regular heavy training loads performed by elite athletes can lead to a rise in cortisol
