26.   The light micrograph shows two blood vessels, an artery and a vein, in transverse section.




      What explains the different shapes of these blood vessels?

      A.   Arteries do not have valves.

      B.   Muscle cells are found only in the walls of veins.

      C.   Arteries have a larger lumen-to-wall thickness ratio.

27.   Pressure changes inside the thorax cause the movement of air in and out of the lung alveoli
      during ventilation. Alveolar pressure correlates to thoracic pressure. The diagram shows pressure
      changes in lung alveoli during ventilation in relation to normal atmospheric pressure. What causes
      forced movement of air out of the lungs at T?

      A.   It is pumped into the postsynaptic neuron.

      B.   It diffuses into the presynaptic neuron.

      C.   It is broken down in the synaptic cleft.

      D.   It binds to another receptor in the postsynaptic neuron.


29.   What is an example of negative feedback in the menstrual cycle?

      A.   High levels of estrogen inhibit FSH secretion.

      B.   High levels of LH stop progesterone secretion.

      C.   High levels of FSH delay ovulation.
