General marking Instructions

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
     comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
     additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

4.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an
     answer to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part
     question, enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

6.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or
     section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor will only award the highest mark or
     marks in line with the rubric.

7.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that
     you stamp “seen” on any page that contains no other annotation.

8.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should
     not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect
     using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [35].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
      otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through
      marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward)
      on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically
      referred to in the markscheme.

           Note: Accept where there is a dot or dash above the last ‘6’ in 66.6/66.66 as
           this shows that the ‘6’ is recurring.
           Do not accept only ‘66.6’ or other incorrect rounding of the answer.


     (b)   reduction in births due to greater use of contraception/improved family planning/sex
           education;
           reduction in births due to women having children later/access to education/access to
           employment/improved status /increase in affluence (more personal choice);
           growth in urbanization leading to fewer children required to work in agriculture to
           support parents / reduction in births because of increasing cost of bringing up
           children;
           reduction in children/births due to improvements in welfare system/pensions
           reducing reliance on children to support parents;
           increase in more elderly population/longer life expectancy/reduction in death rate
           due to improvement in health care/sanitation;
           reduction in infant mortality, so parents can expect most members of a family will
           survive to adulthood;
           reduction in child mortality due to improved nutrition/access to
           healthcare/immunizations;
           government policy/legislation that encourages a reduction in birth rates;           [3 max]

           Note: For credit both change observed and associated cause must be given, eg do
           not accept only ‘decrease in birth rate / increase in life expectancy’ or only ‘use of
           contraception / improved health care’.
           Do not accept ‘increase in life expectancy due to better living conditions/better
           quality of life’.
           Do not accept ‘increase in working age people due to migration’.
           Do not accept only ‘decrease in birth rates due to education’, for credit needs to also

           Note: Do not accept ‘due to migration/high biodiversity/present in protected areas’

     (b)   protected areas may prohibit human activities which damage the habitat/threaten
           species (eg urban development/hunting) / protected areas provide a safe
           place/habitat for species to live;
           increase in size/number/coverage of protected areas may lead to:
                 more habitats protected/covered / more species are conserved;
                 better support for higher trophic levels/top carnivores;
                 increased distance from human activities/impacts / reduced edge effects;
                 more genetic mixing/formation of corridors / increased chance of connecting
                 corridors between the protected areas;
                 (more people living close to protected areas leading to) greater engagement in
                 conservation efforts / more local communities being involved in conservation /
                 greater community involvement through education/raising awareness/greater
                 familiarity;

                 conservation/financial investment into conservation;
                 more financial support for conservation;                                    [3 max]

           Note: Do not credit ‘increasing habitat size for species could reduce limiting factors’.

4.   (a)   population size / number of mature individuals;

           Note: Do not accept descriptions of just predators eg ‘controls population of
           primary consumers / eats organisms below it in the food web’.
           Do not accept ‘top of food chain / balances the food chain’.

(c)   cost of acquiring/managing large areas;
      the large areas covered by wildlife corridors can make it difficult to manage;
      policing against poaching / greater vulnerability to poaching / corridors are narrow and
      more affected by edge effect / corridors may pass near or over roads resulting in some
      roadkill;
      displacement of human settlement/industry / may create conflict with people’s use of
      land eg for agriculture;
      difficult to determine where to site wildlife corridors / land which is suitable must be
      available;
      challenges of international collaboration;
      spread of disease/invasive species from one region to another;                        [2 max]

5.   (a)   initial decrease/deforestation due to: [1 max]
           land clearance for agriculture (growth of cash crops eg coffee/sugar/palm oil
           or for cattle);
           logging for timber / demand for wood;
           urban development / industrialization;

           Note: Do not accept ‘fire caused deforestation / deforestation occurred
           because areas were not protected / lack of education’.
           Do not accept only ‘need for land/resources’.

           later increase/reforestation due to: [1 max]
           forest was allowed to regenerate naturally;
           plantations for timber production;
           promotion of tree planting by PES;
           ban on deforestation in 1996;
           increase in reserve/protected areas;
           carbon off-set schemes;
           increased environmental awareness on importance of forested areas;                          [2]

           Note: Do not accept only deforestation/reforestation without reasons.

     (b)   trees/plants absorb carbon dioxide / forest acts as a carbon sink/store;                    [1]


6.   (a)   (i)    intensive agriculture/monoculture results in soil nutrient
                  depletion/reduction in organic matter;
                  deforestation for plantations leaves the soil bare contributing to soil erosion;
                  tillage/ploughing can leave soil prone to erosion;
                  excessive use of pesticides leading to soil toxification;
                  use of fertilizers increases soil productivity;                                  [1 max]

           (ii)   use of fertilizers/leaching of nutrients can lead to eutrophication/algal
                  blooms;
                  use of pesticides can lead to contamination of aquatic systems/death of
                  non-target organisms/bioaccumulation;
                  over-abstraction of water for agriculture use may lead to low water levels (in
                  rivers/lakes adversely affecting fish/aquatic species);
                  soil erosion into lakes/rivers could increase sedimentation/reduce water
                  clarity;                                                                       [1 max]

7.   increased tourism generates more income to invest back into conservation efforts;
     biodiversity/wildlife may be considered as an asset to look after to maintain/increase
     tourism, thereby increasing conservation efforts;
     increase in tourism can conflict with conservation efforts by increasing competition
     for resources / puts greater demand on water resources competing with wildlife /
     increase demand for infrastructure/hotels/roads/facilities that can destroy habitats;
     tourism could adversely affect conservation efforts eg disturbing species during the
     breeding season could reduce successful mating or producing litter that threatens
     wildlife when consumed;                                                                  [1 max]

           increasing demand due to growing population                                        [1 max]

           Note: Do not accept ‘wind power is renewable/unlimited/more sustainable/a
           green energy source/more viable over the long term/produces less pollution’.
           Do not accept 'changes in wind current’.
           Do not accept only ‘greater investment/funds available for wind
           power/renewables’.

(c) greater use of public transport that reduces individual car use (and therefore overall
    use of oil);
    use of electric/biofuel/hybrid/hydrogen vehicles/cars (instead of oil-fuelled vehicles) /
    subsidize electric vehicles / higher tax on petrol cars;
    adopting car sharing/pooling that reduces individual use of cars/vehicles;
    use of congestion charges;
    adopting policy that limits the number of cars a family/household can have;
    reducing use of oil-fuelled vehicles by promoting walking/use of bicycles;
    use more efficient forms of transport for goods eg boats rather than planes;
    promotion of ‘km0 initiative’ (local production and consumption) which reduces need
    for transportation;
    use of carbon tax on oil/petrol (to deter its use) / capping/regulating amount of oil
    sold;
    use of quotas/permits within industry to reduce overall oil consumption;
    residents/industry/ agriculture encouraged to use renewable/solar/wind energy (to
    replace use of oil) / government incentives/subsidizes to use renewable sources of
    energy;
    use energy efficient machinery that requires less oil;
    encourage more on-line/home working so people can stay at home (reducing need for
    travel);                                                                                  [2]

9.   EF must be lower than biocapacity to be sustainable / if EF is above biocapacity, it is
     not sustainable / overall sustainability declined overtime as EF increased and
     biocapacity declined;
     until around 1990/1991 Costa Rica was sustainable as EF was lower than the
     biocapacity;
     after 1990/1991, EF was greater than biocapacity and therefore Costa Rica was
     less/no longer sustainable;                                                               [2 max]

10.    Evidence for [4 max]:
         (i) carbon off-setting has increased afforestation/reforestation/tree planting /
             forestation has increased carbon sinks / forestation has contributed to mitigating
             climate change/reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels;
        (ii) afforestation/reforestation/increase in protected area has increased
             biodiversity/natural habitat for wildlife;
       (iii) afforestation/reforestation has increased natural capital/goods and services;
      (iv) most electricity comes from renewable sources of energy rather than non-
             renewable sources (can be used up / exhaustible) / most electricity comes from
             renewable sources rather than fossil fuels hence produces less carbon dioxide
             emissions/has a lower EF;
        (v) use of electric/hybrid/biofuel/hydrogen vehicles limits carbon dioxide emissions /
             increase use of renewables/electric transport could improve air quality in urban
             areas;
      (vi) use of public transport limits individual car use and reduces overall carbon
             dioxide emissions/could improve urban air quality/has a lower EF;
      (vii) certified carbon neutral coffee farming may mitigate impacts of intensive (cash
             crops) agriculture / certified carbon neutral coffee farming may support
             businesses which have a smaller carbon footprint;

      Note: Do not credit only ‘PES results in more tree planting’.

       Evidence against [4 max]:
       (viii) there are emissions of other greenhouse gases from farming (eg methane
              from cattle/beef production / nitrous oxide from using fertilizers or manure);
         (ix) increase in land area used for intensive agriculture (pineapples) reduces
              biodiversity;
          (x) there is high use of fossil fuel / transport sector depends on fossil fuels / the
              transportation of importing fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide;
         (xi) ecological footprint (EF) is beyond the carrying capacity / EF is greater than
              biocapacity;
        (xii) despite increased forestation the biocapacity has continued to decline which is
              not sustainable / biocapacity still appears to be declining which is not
              sustainable;
       (xiii) large tourism numbers may cause damage to the environment eg roads may
              fragment habitats / building development for tourism may lead to habitat
              destruction;
       (xiv) tourists that travel to Costa Rica can produce high levels of greenhouse
              gases/carbon dioxide emissions through plane travel;
        (xv) growth in agriculture leads to deforesation / there is still some loss of mature
              forest to agriculture / difficult to enforce ban on deforestation;
       (xvi) in future, the country will eventually run out of space for carbon off-setting by
              planting trees and therefore this is not a sustainable practice;
       (xvii) hydropower has a detrimental effect on the environment eg blocks migratory
              routes for fish, causes siltation behind the dam wall and reduces flow of
              nutrients/sediments downstream contributing to coastal erosion/lower
              diversity;
      (xviii) (despite carbon zero policy/efforts to reduce CO2 levels) the levels of CO2
              emissions for Costa Rica are above the regional average;

Conclusion/opinion [1 max]
For example: Although Costa Rica produces most of its electricity from renewable
sources, non-renewable resources are still used eg oil which is a finite resource and
is not sustainable for the future;
Despite reducing loss of forest/increasing sinks for carbon, the biocapacity
continues to decline and hence overall Costa Rica is not sustainable;
While Costa Rica still has some issues relating to emissions of GHGs through
agriculture/transport, it is moving in the right direction towards environmental
sustainability with its tree planting campaigns/increase in protected areas and
cleaner air due to renewable energy sources;

A valid conclusion should be credited if it is explicit, balanced (addresses both sides
of the argument) and supported by evidence. Do not credit the conclusion if only one
side of the argument has been considered within the overall response.

Accept other reasonable responses supported by the information in the resource booklet.
