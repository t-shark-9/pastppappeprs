Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
   correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
   slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
   with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

3.   Award [2 max]
     WAN covers a much larger area (national/international), LANs usually cover a smaller area
     (such as a single site);
     Nodes connected to WANs often make use of connections through public networks (such as
     the telephone system), nodes connected to LANs are usually connected through private
     infrastructure;
     LANs are more secure than WANs (due to how WANs transmit the data /how far the data would
     need to travel);
     A higher bandwidth is available for transmission in a LAN than a WAN/ LANs can have a
     higher data transfer rate than a WAN;
     LAN is typically cheaper than WAN to implement/ maintain (as the equipment required for LAN is
     less expensive);
     WAN includes a large number of devices connected together, LAN includes less;
     WANs are typically slower than LANs due to the distance data must travel;
     WAN requires hardware to connect different networks, such as a router, LAN can be simple and
     does not need to connect to other networks;

                                                                                                         [2]

4.   Award [2 max]
     The reason for compression when transmitting data is to save on transfer times;
     As it reduces the number of bits needed to represent data (when compared with the original data);

     Compressing data involves modifying/restructuring files, so that they take up less space;
     And this results in cost savings in cloud storage;

     To take up less bandwidth;
     Because data compression reduces the size of files to be transmitted over a network;

     Note to examiners: Award [1] for a reason (for example, to save data usage for sending files over
     the internet, to save storage capacity, to speed up file transfer, to decrease costs for network
     bandwidth, etc.), and award [1] for an expansion.

                                                                                                     [2]

5.   Award [2 max]
     (The program written in HLL must be translated into machine code) so that the computer can
     execute the program;
     as the computer only understands machine language / as code written in HLL can only be
     understood by humans and cannot be interpreted by the computers (which work in binary);
                                                                                                     [2]

      Parallel running;
      The old and new systems run together, so if a problem is found with the new system, it can
      be repaired/the old system can take over;
      This is expensive as duplicate systems and staff are needed;
      Pilot running;
      The new system is only implemented in one branch of the organization so disruption is kept
      to a minimum;
      It can take a long time for the new system to be fully implemented / two systems are still in
      operation within the organization, leading to duplication and possible errors;
      Direct changeover;
      The new system is implemented overnight so the changes happen very quickly;
      If the new system fails, the company has no working system to fall back on;
      Phased conversion;
      Only one area/department/part of the system is updated at a time, so the disruption is kept to
      a minimum;
      Multiple systems which may not be compatible with each other will be running at the same
      time;

(c)   Award [2 max]
      Three arrays are parallel/ they have the same number of elements/ the same length;
      the same array index can be used to represent name, grade and mark of the same student/
      the array index makes sure that data from the three arrays lines up;

                                                                                                [2]

(e)   Award [5 max]

      Award [3 max] for sequential search
      The algorithm searches through every element in the array starting at the beginning
      and working through one after the other;
      …until the required item is found;
      This method is potentially slow if the data set is large and the required element is
      towards the end of the list;
      The data does not need to be in any particular order;

      Award [3 max] for binary search
      The data must be sorted before it is stored;
      After comparing the data set with the target data, half of the data can be discounted
      using a simple condition;
      …enabling the target to be more quickly located;

      Note to examiners: Big O notation is not on the syllabus so answers with reference
      to this are not expected, however, if this type of answer is seen, please allow, for example:

      Sequential: main disadvantage is O(N) so inefficient;
      advantage is that it works with an unsorted array;
      Binary search: main advantage is that it’s efficient as it’s O(log n);
      disadvantage is that the array must be sorted (and so must be sortable – not all data
      has a defined sort order);
      Binary search cannot be performed on a linked list but a sequential search can;
                                                                                                      [5]
