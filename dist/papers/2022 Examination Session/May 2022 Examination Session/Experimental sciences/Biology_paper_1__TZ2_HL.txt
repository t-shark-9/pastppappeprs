      How would regions P–Q and R–S change when the muscle relaxes?


                  P–Q                R–S

      A.          wider            narrower

      B.        narrower             wider

      C.          wider           no change

      D.       no change             wider

39.   The micrograph shows a glomerulus and Bowman’s capsule, where ultrafiltration takes place in
      the kidney.




      What facilitates the formation of glomerular filtrate?

      A.    Many fenestrations in walls of capillaries in the glomerulus

      B.    High pressure in the Bowman’s capsule

      C.    ADH secreted by the pituitary gland

      D.    Osmosis caused by a high concentration of urea in the blood


40.   Hormones maintain the thickness of the endometrium during pregnancy. However, insufficient
      levels of hormones in early pregnancy may cause the breakdown of the endometrium, which leads
      to miscarriage. What could be a cause of miscarriage in early pregnancy?

      A.    The embryo does not produce enough HCG.

      B.    The pituitary gland does not produce enough FSH.

      C.    The endometrium does not produce enough progesterone.

      D.    The ovarian follicle does not produce enough estrogen.
