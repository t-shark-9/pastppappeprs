                                                                                                     factor.
         OR
         e.g. sprint finish which will cause a switch from aerobic to anerobic;                      Max [3] for stating the
                                                                                                     factors with no relevant
         duration of activity;                                                                       example/explanation.
         e.g. 100m will be dominated by ATP–PC, 800m anaerobic glycolysis, marathon
         aerobic;
         availability of fuel sources;
                                                                                                                                 5 max
         e.g. not having sufficient ATP–PC drives energy system to anaerobic glycolysis
         OR
         e.g. previous interval training loads will deplete muscle glycogen which will reduce the
         use of anerobic/aerobic glycolysis and cause switch to fat oxidation;
         the amount of recovery time available;
         e.g. submaximal activity / passive rest to replenish PC
         OR
         e.g. sufficient time to rid the body of <negative by-products> hydrogen ions/lactate;
