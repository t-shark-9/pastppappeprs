Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Section A and two out of three questions in Section B. Maximum total = 72 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semicolon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside brackets ( ) in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

Extended response questions – quality mark

        Extended response questions for HLP2 each carry a mark total of [16]. Of these marks, [15] are awarded for content and [1] for the quality
         of the answer.

        [1] for quality is to be awarded when:
             the candidate’s answers are clear enough to be understood without re-reading.
             the candidate has answered the question succinctly with little or no repetition or irrelevant material.
