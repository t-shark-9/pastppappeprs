Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
in the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
“FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of               eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses        descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the           explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions        This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                   explanation etc.

     Language differences / lexical differences present across datasets to be merged;
     Data representation differences / different data structures (e.g., date format, incompatible file
     formats);

3.   Award [2 max]
     WAN covers a much larger area (national/international), LANs usually cover a smaller area
     (such as a single site);
     Nodes connected to WANs often make use of connections through public networks (such as
     the telephone system), nodes connected to LANs are usually connected through private
     infrastructure;
     LANs are more secure than WANs (due to how WANs transmit the data /how far the data would
     need to travel);
     A higher bandwidth is available for transmission in a LAN than a WAN/ LANs can have a
     higher data transfer rate than a WAN;
     LAN is typically cheaper than WAN to implement/ maintain (as the equipment required for LAN is
     less expensive);
     WAN includes a large number of devices connected together, LAN includes less;
     WANs are typically slower than LANs due to the distance data must travel;
     WAN requires hardware to connect different networks, such as a router, LAN can be simple and
     does not need to connect to other networks;

                                                                                                         [2]

4.   Award [2 max]
     The reason for compression when transmitting data is to save on transfer times;
     As it reduces the number of bits needed to represent data (when compared with the original data);

     Compressing data involves modifying/restructuring files, so that they take up less space;
     And this results in cost savings in cloud storage;

     To take up less bandwidth;
     Because data compression reduces the size of files to be transmitted over a network;

     Note to examiners: Award [1] for a reason (for example, to save data usage for sending files over
     the internet, to save storage capacity, to speed up file transfer, to decrease costs for network
     bandwidth, etc.), and award [1] for an expansion.

                                                                                                     [2]

5.   Award [2 max]
     (The program written in HLL must be translated into machine code) so that the computer can
     execute the program;
     as the computer only understands machine language / as code written in HLL can only be
     understood by humans and cannot be interpreted by the computers (which work in binary);
                                                                                                     [2]

(d)   Award [6 max]
      Award [1] for method, award [1] for benefit and award [1] for drawback.

      Parallel running;
      The old and new systems run together, so if a problem is found with the new system, it can
      be repaired/the old system can take over;
      This is expensive as duplicate systems and staff are needed;
      Pilot running;
      The new system is only implemented in one branch of the organization so disruption is kept
      to a minimum;
      It can take a long time for the new system to be fully implemented / two systems are still in
      operation within the organization, leading to duplication and possible errors;
      Direct changeover;
      The new system is implemented overnight so the changes happen very quickly;
      If the new system fails, the company has no working system to fall back on;
      Phased conversion;
      Only one area/department/part of the system is updated at a time, so the disruption is kept to
      a minimum;
      Multiple systems which may not be compatible with each other will be running at the same
      time;

            Processor has access to pre-set data (minimum distance required between the two cars);
            Processor compares the input data against stored/pre-set data;
            If the vehicle is too close, the processor sends a signal to an actuator to apply the brakes/ an
            output signal (for example, warning light on the dashboard/ audible warning) to the driver to
            apply break;
            If the car has fallen back from the car in front, the processor sends a
            signal to an actuator to apply acceleration/ an output signal to the driver to apply
            acceleration;

      (c)   Award [5 max]
            Award [2 max] for centralised processing
            Centralized processing would allow the different features of the car to be controlled by a
            single processor;
            … this means that different features of the car are less likely to impact on the operation
            of other features, as the central processor can coordinate them;

            Award [2 max] for decentralised / distributed processing
            Decentralized processing allows each of the car’s features to have its own processor;
            … enabling each feature to function independently/more quickly;

            Award [1 max] for concluding statement
            Centralized processing is more complex for the manufacturer to program, but is
            possibly safer as the different components coordinate;
            Centralised processing is more expensive to achieve as the whole system needs to be
            coordinated in real time;
            Decentralised processing has a faster response (time due to the use of multiple smaller
            PLCs);
            Decentralised processing is simpler/cheaper for the car manufacturer as they can use
            standard parts that are already programmed, but it is more difficult to get them to coordinate
            with each other;
            Decentralised processing allows scalability, the subsystems can be easily customised;
            A crash in a centralized system would result in failure of the whole system / a critical system
            failure so would have far greater consequences than in a decentralized system where the
            system may be able to partially function hence are riskier than decentralized ones;
                                                                                                          [5]

      Autonomous vehicles can be seen as more dangerous to pedestrians/cyclists;
      …as they have to be programmed to react to avoid unpredictable movements from them;
      The ethical consideration is how might the processor decide whether to avoid the cyclist
      to hit a pedestrian instead (trolley problem);

      When autonomous vehicle control systems are perfected;
      … they should be safer than human drivers;
      … it may then be an ethical consideration as to whether a human who cannot drive should
      be the responsible person in the autonomous vehicle?;

      An autonomous driving system could collect detailed information about the movements of the
      car;
      … this information could reveal where individuals go, and raise privacy concerns;
      … which could be exploited for commercial gain/ be considered as a form of surveillance (an
      ethical consideration);

      There may be times when an accident is unavoidable (the trolley problem);
      The autonomous vehicle has to make a ‘decision’ about who to hit;
      In this case is the driver, the manufacturer, the software engineer or the third party
      accountable?;

                the calculation using formula (as given in the question paper 2*PI * RADIUS)
      Award [1] for calling both subprograms / outputting both values
      Award [1] if after the alteration of the algorithm, it should still be able to calculate the area
      and the perimeter of the polygon as well as the area and the circumference of the circle

      Example answer 1 (with existing subprograms, after inputting the three values:
      NUM_SIDES, LENGTH_SIDE, APOTHEM):
      check if the inputted value for the NUM_SIDES is 1 or 0 (then the shape is a circle);
      then inputted value for LENGTH_SIDE is to be used as radius;
      2*3.14 should be set as NUM_SIDES and LENGTH_SIDE as APOTHEM;
      call already written sub-programs(SUB_AREA and SUB_PERIMETER) so that algorithm
      calculates/finds correct area of circle and circumference;
      if the shape is not a circle then code (as in Part(a)) for the polygon ( no other changes
      needed);

      Example answer 2 (with new subprograms for area and circumference created):
      construct two new sub-programs (for example, getCircleArea and getCircumference) ;
      (in the main program) ask the user if the shape is a polygon or a circle;
      if it is a polygon then code is as written in part a (no changes);
      if it is a circle then ask the user to input the radius;
      call both new subprograms to output area and circumference/ call the getCircleArea(radius)
      to find area and getCircumference(radius) sub-program to find circumference;

      Example answer 3 (with simple if statement and formulas given in the question paper):
      ask user to input if the shape is circle and use if statement to check this input value;
      if not circle then code for the polygon (as written in part a);
      otherwise (it is circle!) input radius;
      calculate area;
      and circumference using formulas given in the question;

            A stack is a last in first out (LIFO) / first in last out (FILO) data structure;
            …which means data is popped off the stack in the reverse order to which it was pushed;
            In the expression, it is important to evaluate some of the values in a certain order
            (to obtain the correct result);
            For example, 25 – 16 would give the wrong value if it was evaluated as 16 – 25;

            Pushing items onto a stack and then popping them off reverses the order;
            To evaluate e.g. “10 2 /” we must treat it as “do the operation on the operands 10 and
            2”/ i.e. we have to access the operator before we can apply it to the operands;
            A stack achieves the reversing of the order of the operators and their operands as a
            group (but it also reverses the operands which must be fixed);
