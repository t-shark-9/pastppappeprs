Answer one question from this section.

1.   AXL

     AXL has two factories, in which it manufactures aluminium cans for the soft drinks industry.
     AXL has a maximum production capacity of 80 million cans per year.

     AXL plans to close its two factories and move production to a new, larger factory to obtain
     economies of scale.

     In the first six months of 2022, increased competition led to a fall in AXL’s sales. For the final
     two months of 2022, AXL plans to increase the trade credit period it offers to customers from
     30 to 60 days.


     (a)   Define the term economies of scale.[2]

     (b)   Using Table 1, calculate:

           (i)    the contribution per unit (show all your working);[2]

           (ii)   the break-even level of output (no working required).[1]

     (c)   If AXL produces 75 million cans in 2023, using Table 1, calculate:

           (i)    the margin of safety (no working required);[1]

           (ii)   the profit (show all your working).[2]

     (d)   Explain the potential impact on AXL if it implements its planned increase in trade
           credit period.                                                                                 [2]

2.   Ritev Enterprises (RE)

     Ritev Enterprises (RE) is a public limited company that owns a chain of 20 gas (petrol)
     stations. Next year, RE plans to modernize its gas stations by installing self-service pumps.

     Table 2 provides selected financial data for RE from:
     y the profit and loss account for year ending 31 May 2021

                                              Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Hums Athletics (HA)

     Hums Athletics (HA) manufactures running shorts, sweat shirts, and sports bras. Operating
     only in the secondary sector, HA has a head office and three manufacturing facilities, one for
     each product. These are located in its home country in Europe. Labour costs are high. The
     quality of labour is excellent.

     HA produces goods under its own HA brand, which it sells to wholesalers. HA also
     manufactures for other sportswear companies. HA puts the other sportswear companies’
     logos on the running shorts, sweat shirts, and sports bras. Sales to other sportswear
     companies are an important revenue stream for HA.

     HA has many levels of hierarchy. Managers at each level have a narrow span of control,
     and the company is organized by product. HA’s management believe that these features of
     organizational structure ensure product quality, which they view as essential for brand loyalty.

     The sportswear manufacturing industry is becoming more competitive. Some foreign
     manufacturers have begun using penetration pricing to gain market share. For three years,
     none of HA’s revenue streams have increased, despite increasing unit sales. HA’s gross and
     net profit margins have declined. However, its sales have increased for the last three years.
     HA has had to raise additional external finance to increase production.

     In response to the increasing competition, HA is considering two options:
     y Option 1: Outsourcing some of its manufacturing overseas.
     y Option 2: Entering the rapidly growing online business-to-consumer (B2C) retail market.

     Market research has shown that consumers increasingly expect to buy online.


     (a)   State two ways in which market share can be measured.                                         [2]

     (b)   Draw an organization chart for HA.[4]

     (c)   Explain:

           (i)    the impact of price changes by foreign competition on HA’s break-even point;           [2]

           (ii)   why HA had to raise additional external finance to increase production.                [2]

     (d)   Recommend whether HA should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]
                                                   –5–                                           2222 – 5014


4.   Red Squirrel Apple Juice (RS)

     Red Squirrel Apple Juice (RS) is a cooperative of apple farmers. RS
     was named after the red squirrel, whose population is declining because
     of growing numbers of grey squirrels. Originally from North America,
     grey squirrels are aggressive and take over red squirrels’ habitats. RS’s
     founders thought that the red squirrel would be a good symbol to reverse the
     declining popularity of traditional apple juice due to consumer preference for
     high-sugar American-style beverages. With the symbol, RS aimed to appeal
     to environmentally aware and health-conscious consumers.

     Originally, RS only sold apple juice in bulk to beverage companies. These companies bottle
     the juice and sell it under their own labels. RS requires these companies to place RS’s
     logo of a red squirrel on their labels. Although RS only sells to a small number of beverage
     companies, its logo is on juice bottles in stores across the country.

     Awareness of the RS brand grew. The cooperative’s managers recently opened another
     channel of distribution: direct sales of bottled juice to consumers at the cooperative’s
     processing plant. RS charges lower prices than stores. The new channel of distribution
     required capital expenditure for bottling equipment and additional revenue expenditure. RS
     experienced increased labour and promotion costs, which some farmers complained about.

     In recent decades, RS’s home country has experienced rising anti-immigrant sentiment.
     Some politically motivated organizations have begun to use images of red squirrels to
     symbolize this sentiment, so some beverage companies no longer want to use RS’s logo on
     their labels.

     Some of RS’s stakeholders are concerned.


     (a)   State two features of a cooperative.                                                         [2]

     (b)   With reference to RS, explain the importance of branding.                                    [4]

     (c)   With reference to RS, explain the difference between capital expenditure and
           revenue expenditure.                                                                         [4]

     (d)   Discuss two possible areas of conflict between the interests of RS’s stakeholders.         [10]




                                                                                                 Turn over

5.    Frez PLC (FR)

      Frez PLC (FR) has 6000 employees in its 100 supermarkets and 250 in its head office. FR
      operates a 360-degree feedback appraisal system for head office employees. FR’s directors
      believe that this system has improved retention and morale of head office employees.
      This year, to reduce head office costs, FR offered head office employees the option of
      teleworking, which 60 % accepted. They will work at the head office only one day per month.

      Each FR supermarket has 10 departments. Departmental managers have concerns about
      their workload caused by their large span of control. Labour turnover at FR supermarkets is
      increasing each year because departmental managers are leaving. In January, FR increased
      its supermarket opening hours and hired an additional 1000 part-time employees. FR is
      considering extending its 360-degree feedback appraisal system to all supermarket employees.

      Recently, demand from supermarket shoppers for a home delivery service increased,
      although industry experts disagree on whether this demand will continue. FR’s main
      competitors already provide delivery services.

      FR has decided to launch a home delivery service. It will require 500 vans, which would be
      replaced every five years. FR is considering two options:
      y Option 1: purchase the vans at a unit cost of $34 000 each, financed by a five-year bank loan
         at 3 % interest.
      y Option 2: Lease the vans at a unit cost of $13 000 per year per van. The minimum term for the
         lease will be 24 months.

      FR already borrowed $50 million in 2019 to finance the modernization of its supermarkets.


      (a)     State two features of a public limited company.                                           [2]

      (b)     (i)	Explain, with reference to Maslow’s motivation theory, how teleworking may
                   damage employee motivation at FR’s head office.                                      [2]

              (ii)   Explain one disadvantage for FR, other than the impact on employee motivation,
                     of introducing teleworking.                                                        [2]

      (c)     Explain two disadvantages for FR if it extends its 360-degree feedback appraisal
              system to its supermarket employees.                                                      [4]

      (d)     Recommend whether FR should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]
