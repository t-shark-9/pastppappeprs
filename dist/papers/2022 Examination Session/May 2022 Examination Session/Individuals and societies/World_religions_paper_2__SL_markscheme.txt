Paper 2 markbands

  Marks   Level descriptor

    0     The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

          The response demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding in relation to the
          demands of the question. There is little use of relevant terminology.
   1–3
          The response is descriptive in nature. Any conclusions presented are superficial,
          anecdotal or common-sense.

          The response demonstrates some relevant knowledge and understanding of the
          beliefs/ concepts/ practices/teachings of the specified religion in relation to the
          demands of the question. There is some use of relevant terminology.
   4–6    The argument is limited and the analysis is only partially consistent with the
          knowledge and understanding demonstrated. There is some use of examples, but
          these are generally vague and do not support the argument. There is a limited
          conclusion(s), but this is not supported by the evidence presented or examples.

          The response demonstrates mostly relevant and appropriate knowledge and
          understanding of the beliefs/concepts/practices/teachings of the specified religion in
          relation to the demands of the question. There is use of relevant terminology, but
          this is not always consistent.
   7–9    There is an argument, which is generally supported by the analysis; connections
          between beliefs/concepts/practices/teachings are identified but not developed. The
          argument at times lacks clarity and coherence but this does not hinder
          understanding. There is a conclusion(s) but this is only partially supported by the
          evidence presented and the examples used.

          The response demonstrates relevant and appropriate knowledge and understanding
          of the beliefs/concepts/practices/teachings of the specified religion, and this is
          demonstrated throughout the essay. There is consistent use of relevant terminology.
  10–12   The argument is structured and coherent and supported by the analysis;
          connections between beliefs/concepts/practices/teachings are identified and
          developed. There is a conclusion(s) supported by the evidence presented, with
          relevant examples. There is a partially developed evaluation.

          The response demonstrates detailed, relevant and appropriate knowledge and
          understanding of the beliefs/concepts/practices/teachings of the specified religion,
          and this is demonstrated throughout the essay. There is consistent use of relevant
          terminology.
          A reasoned argument(s) is well-structured and coherent and supported by the
  13–15
          analysis with connections between beliefs/concepts/practices/teachings clearly
          identified and effectively developed. There is a conclusion(s) supported by the
          evidence presented, and effective use of examples. There is a developed
          evaluation; any minor inconsistencies do not detract from the strength of the overall
          argument.

Hinduism

1.   Examine the place of conversion in Hinduism.

     • Hinduism is a diverse system of beliefs and there is no central authority to define the
       place of conversion.
     • Historically, many seeking spiritual meaning looked to the ways which eventually
       became referred to as Hinduism. The process of looking for liberation might involve
       taking on the practices of one of many schools of Hinduism, and in that sense
       converting, though not converting in the sense of responding to missionary teaching
       unlike some monotheistic religions.
     • Some Hindus reject the need for conversion, claiming that it is a western concept
       alien to Hinduism which does not proselytise. Many recognise other faiths as
       alternative spiritual paths.
     • However, some in the twentieth century regarded conversion as more important. As
       Hinduism spread further in South East Asia and the West, some, such as the
       International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) as well as the Arya
       Samaj, sought converts.
     • Different sects in Hinduism have their own conversion routines. Some give
       importance to taking on a Hindu name and learning about spiritual practices from
       ancient texts. This has become important in cases of mixed marriages to preserve a
       Hindu identity.
     • When a person is initiated, they may undergo a fire ritual with singing of Sanskrit
       hymns, led by a Hindu priest. This can be a public way of marking the conversion
       and welcoming the convert into the religious community of Hindus.
     • Some converts may join monastic communities to learn about their faith under the
       guidance of a guru, learn about the Sanskrit language and ancient texts, and
       become involved in festivals such as Divali. For those who wish to follow meditation
       and a yogic path, conversion may be helpful.
     • It might be argued that conversion is un-necessary for some, but necessary for
       others, dependent upon their chosen spiritual path.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   “Caste (jati) has no place for Hindus in today’s world.” Discuss.

     • Caste is a means to divide society into different groups, which is associated with
       Hinduism and is ancient in origin.
     • Caste was abolished according to the India Constitution in 1950. Modern laws of
       equality make it inappropriate and, in many cases, unlawful to divide people
       according to their caste.
     • Many Hindus have emigrated to western countries where laws exist to prohibit caste
       discrimination. It could be argued that caste, then, should have no place in Hinduism
       today and is unnecessary in any case since meditation, worship and so on can be
       performed without caste division.
     • However, caste is referred to in ancient Hindu texts, which mention a system of
       Varnas with society divided into four main groups: Brahmin priests; Kshatriya
       warriors; Vaishya farmers and business people, and Shudra workers. Therefore, it
       could be argued that some form of caste tradition is justified.
     • The Brahmin priesthood played an important role in maintaining religious traditions.
       It could be argued that caste is not necessary but sometimes helpful in preserving
       spiritual knowledge in passing down religious teachings.
     • Historically, caste may have been a practical division of society rather than a way to
       discriminate against, and may not have always been so formalised.
     • Despite the abolition of caste, many families still arrange marriages within their own
       caste group, showing that social attitudes are slow to change. Some might argue
       that they are doing so out of their own free choice.
     • Social mobility has been aided by awareness of caste and quotas to take on more
       employees from ‘lower’ caste backgrounds for some government jobs in India.
     • Many might argue that discrimination on the basis of caste is wrong but awareness
       of the lasting effect of caste on society is to recognise reality and help to address it
       in the modern world.

     • Caste might be embedded in cultural practice rather than as explicit religious
       practice

     • Caste is associated with last names and so embedded in culture

Buddhism

3.   Examine the role of The Five Precepts for ethics and moral conduct in Buddhism.

     Candidates should demonstrate understanding of the Five Precepts and their key role in
     guiding Buddhist practice.

     • The Five Precepts are all rooted in the core value of ahimsa, non-violence/harming.
       The precepts are commitments made to refrain from killing any living beings,
       stealing, conducting sexual misconduct, telling lies and becoming intoxicated. They
       are referred to in the Pali scriptures and other Buddhist texts.
     • In terms of morality and ethics, the Five Precepts may be related to many important
       issues. As a result of the Five Precepts, many Buddhists oppose capital
       punishment, suicide, abortion and euthanasia, and are in favour of vegetarianism
       and treating animals without cruelty.
     • The Five Precepts have a major impact on an individual’s karma and hence are an
       essential foundation to their path to enlightenment. Therefore, it is important that the
       Precepts are voluntarily undertaken.
     • In many schools of Buddhism, the Five Precepts are different from the rules of
       discipline (Vinaya) that Buddhist monastics follow. The Vinaya contains rules that all
       those who receive higher ordination must follow.
     • Lay Buddhists can take on some of the additional monastic precepts for a specified
       time during a spiritual retreat. This brings benefits of refreshing and strengthen their
       spiritual progress.
     • The precepts also embody and help both lay and ordained Buddhists practice the
       core value of compassion (karuna).

     Candidates may also be rewarded for mentioning the impact of the Precepts on attitudes
     to war and conflict, including examples of different interpretations (e.g. the development
     of martial arts as a means to minimise use of violence in self-defence; pacifism; use of
     violence in Thailand and Tibet).

     Accept any other relevant answer.

4.   Discuss the status and role of women in Buddhism.

     • Traditionally in ancient India women were given inferior status and treatment
       compared to men and usually denied equality of opportunities in education,
       employment, social status and religious roles and rituals.
     • The Buddha reformed the caste system, but little was originally said about women.
     • Early Buddhist communities and writings sometimes portrayed women as inferior
       but opened the possibility that women could gain enlightenment.
     • Women could also be seen as a dangerous distraction to men.
     • The Buddha at first denied women the chance to become ordained and live the
       monastic life.
     • However, the Buddha’s step-mother/aunt persuaded him to allow her to take vows
       and become the first bhikkhunis (nuns). This was seen as a radical and progressive
       step.
     • Most Buddhist schools have traditions of women achieving enlightenment even
       during the lifetime of the Buddha.
     • The Pali scriptures relate a story in which a King told the Buddha that he is
       disappointed that his Queen gave birth to a daughter rather than a son. The Buddha
       replied that some women are better than men. Another text within the Pali Canon
       demonstrates that women in the Buddha’s time were recognised to have gained
       enlightenment.
     • Theravada Buddhist communities have a more conservative approach to the role of
       women. In Theravada Buddhism, traditionally bhikkhus (male monks) are superior to
       bhikkhunis (nuns).
     • Bhikkhunis (nuns) were required to take additional vows to those taken by bhikkhus
       (male monks), which included subordination to monks.
     • Mahayana Buddhism has allowed women to be part of the monastic sangha for a
       long time. The (Mahayana) Lotus Sutra is evidence of a Buddhist scripture which
       implies that women have an equal path to enlightenment.
     • In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattvas can be females. Humans are seen as
       exemplifying both feminine and masculine principles so are given identical meditation
       exercises.
     • Females have an essential role in Tibetan tantric rituals, which leads to liberation
       (union of wisdom and compassion).
     • However, there are variations. In most Buddhist schools, women have been
       excluded from the senior roles of priests and dharma teachers.
     • This has changed in recent times with Buddhism’s engagement with and spread to
       the West, with women being appointed as senior dharma teachers, priests and
       monks particularly in the Zen and Tibetan sanghas.

     • High scoring responses will normally examine examples of women having high and
       low status in Buddhism in order to show understanding of diverse opinions.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

Sikhism

5.   Examine the origins of doctrines in Sikhism.

     • Sikh doctrines are summarized in the prayer, the Mool Mantra, which is recited at
       the beginning of prayers and is a summary of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book
       of Sikhism.
     • The Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism and the teachings of the ten Gurus, beginning
       with the founder of the religion Guru Nanak, are taken to form the main doctrines.
     • Guru Nanak was a person who sought spiritual guidance and was influenced by the
       Sant tradition of Hinduism in northern India.
     • Guru Nanak taught that the nam or literally name of God encompassed creation.
       Spiritual enlightenment could be achieved through meditation on God’s name, nam
       japna, and personality, nam simran. Eventually the soul may be liberated from the
       cycle of rebirth and reach sach khand, the realm of truth.
     • He visited sites of pilgrimage across India as well as Makkah, the holy site of Islam.
       Guru Nanak’s experiences helped to form the doctrines of Sikhism. On one
       occasion in Makkah, the Guru was challenged for sitting with his feet pointed
       towards the Ka’ba. Miraculously, the mihrab of prayer appeared to move. Guru
       Nanak interpreted this to mean God is everywhere, one of the main doctrines of
       Sikhism.
     • Guru Nanak’s mystical experiences and Sikh acceptance of reincarnation show the
       influence of Eastern philosophies; his teaching of God as the formless One show the
       influence of monotheistic traditions.
     • Guru Nanak was the first of ten Gurus. Guru Arjan helped to collect together the
       hymns of Guru Nanak into the Adi Granth which then formed the Guru Granth Sahib
       together with further material, the main source of reference for Sikh doctrine.
     • Guru Gobind Singh introduced the doctrine of the order of the Khalsa. At the time of
       Vaisakhi, he gathered his followers and demanded complete loyalty of the Panj
       Piare (beloved ones). From this came the doctrine of professing commitment in the
       Amrit sanskar ceremony.

     This question is about the origins of doctrines in Sikhism. Whilst Hinduism and Islam
     influenced the founder, Guru Nanak, the focus of responses should be specifically on
     Sikh doctrines.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

6.   “Sikh religious experiences are as important in daily worship as they are in special
     ceremonies.” Discuss.

     • Daily worship is an important part of Sikh religious practice. Every day a Sikh will
       perform nam simran, to meditate upon the name of God, and nam japna, repeating
       the divine name. This brings them closer to achieving liberation from the cycle of
       rebirth. This is fundamental to the teachings of Sikhism and helps a Sikh focus on
       the spiritual throughout the day.
     • There are three daily prayers in Sikhism: Nitnem, Raihraas and Sohelaa – before
       sunrise, evening and night time, often said in the home. This daily experience helps
       Sikhs to keep their faith forefront in their mind.
     • Reading the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book, all the way through in the special
       Akhand Path service in the gurdwara, helps Sikhs become one with the teachings of
       their faith. It is usually not a daily ritual but is read at special times during the year,
       and the process of bringing out the book with traditions of respect might be
       considered an important act of worship and in other ways ceremonial.
     • Special ceremonies include the Amrit sanskar ceremony in which Sikhs give their
       commitment to join the Khalsa and promise to adhere to its requirements, including
       keeping the five Ks. This is a once in a lifetime experience which is deeply
       meaningful for many Sikhs.
     • This is commemorated annually with the Vaisakhi festival which is a major
       experience for many Sikhs, helping to inspire them to become more committed to
       their faith.
     • If a Khalsa Sikh breaks an important rule (kurahit), they attend a special ceremony
       to agree to give penance for past sins and make a fresh commitment to their faith.
       For individuals this can be a powerful way of putting misdemeanours behind them
       and making a fresh start.
     • Ceremonies for marriage and death are part of the Sikh faith and provide ways to
       mark important times.

Open-ended question

7.   With reference to one religion—Hinduism or Buddhism or Sikhism—discuss beliefs
     about eschatology.


     Hinduism
     • Hindus believe that humans have an atman (self or soul).
     • They believe that the atman is reborn in samsara (the cycle of life, death and
       reincarnation).
     • Samsara is maya (the illusory forms of the created world). This means the atman is
       ignorant of its true, spiritual nature when it is in samsara.
     • Hindus believe that the atman is reborn in samsara due to karma.
     • Karma is action that generates an effect. Good actions generate good effects within
       the individual and society. Bad actions generate bad effects. The actions (karma) of
       an individual cause (influence) the type of embodiment or rebirth.
     • Hindus believe that it is possible to escape samsara and attain moksha (liberation
       from samsara).
     • Different philosophical schools of Hinduism have different teachings about the
       nature of moksha.

     Buddhism
     • Buddhists believe that samsara (the cycle of life) is the perpetual cycle of life, death
       and rebirth.
     • Buddhists believe that rebirth in samsara is caused by a person’s actions
       (kamma/karma), when these are driven by craving and desire (tanha/trishna).
     • Buddhists believe that what humans call ”body” and ”mind” is an aggregate of five
       khandas/skandhas. This is the doctrine of anatta/anatman (lack of permanent self).
     • Bodily rebirth and existence in samsara is believed to be suffering / dissatisfaction
       (dukkha/duhkha).
     • In Theravada Buddhism someone who achieves enlightenment is called an
       arahant/arahat. Buddhists believe that release from samsara is possible; this is the
       state of nibbana/nirvana (enlightenment).
     • They believe that nirvana is attained when craving (tanha/trishna) fed by ignorance
       or illusion/delusion is extinguished.
     • Belief in a creator god does not form part of Buddhist doctrine.
     • Some Buddhists including Mahayana include the doctrine of bodhisattva. This is
       attainment of nirvana (Buddhahood) not for oneself but for the sake of others. Many
       Mahayana Buddhists take what is called the bodhisattva vow, when they vow to gain
       enlightenment for the sake of others.
     • Examples of bodhisattvas include Avalokiteshvara, Amitabha, Manjushri and the
       Taras.

Sikhism
• Sikhs believe that humans have a jot (divine spark).
• They believe that unless they achieve mukti (liberation from samsara), their jot will
   pass into other living beings.
• They believe in five khands (stages of spiritual development). The final khand is
   sach khand (realm of truth), where God is present. This is mukti.
• Sikhs believe that they have a responsibility to practice nam japna, kirat karni and
   vand kakko, and be gurmukh (God-centred). This is to help them conquer haumai
   (ego-centredness) and maya (illusion).
• They believe that while they have a responsibility for the religious practice described
   above, everything, including a Sikh achieving mukti, is according to God’s will
   (hukam).
• They believe that it is possible to progress to the third khand, but only with
   gurprasad (God’s grace) that someone may achieve sach khand.
• Sikhs believe that sach khand may be achieved during life or after death.

Judaism

8.   Discuss the importance of the Torah for Jews.

     The Torah is the first five books of the Jewish scriptures and is considered the most
     important part of the Tenakh and the most important sacred text for Jews. There are
     differences in opinion regarding literal and non-literal interpretations of the Torah.
     Candidates might demonstrate this with reference to different traditions e.g. Progressive;
     Charedi, Liberal which are indicative of the country they are answering from.

     • It is important as a source of history. It contains accounts of how God created the
       world and the history of the Jewish people. The Torah is referred to at times of
       festivals such as Pesach to remember how Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt.
     • Most Jews believe that the Torah was given directly by God to Moses and therefore
       is divinely inspired. Within the five books there are the commandments/mitzvot and
       ethical ideals that Jews should live by. It is therefore important as a guide to living
       out the duties required by God.
     • Although the Torah is considered the most important source of authority for Jews
       there are differences between how Orthodox and non-Orthodox observe the
       teachings of the Torah. Many Orthodox Jews will try to follow all the teachings of the
       Torah such as how to keep kashrut and observances of Shabbat. Non-Orthodox
       Jews will often interpret the teachings of the Torah for life in the twenty-first century.
     • The Torah is important in worship. Each week a portion from the Torah is read in
       synagogue services (the parashah or section). It is considered an honour to read
       this section. During the year the whole Torah will have been read aloud in Hebrew. It
       is a common practice in Judaism for passages from the Torah to be discussed by
       Rabbis and scholars to make sense of daily life and practices.
     • Although the teachings of the Torah are considered important even for the most
       observant Jew the majority are not as important as upholding Pikuach Nefesh
       (saving a life). Virtually all the teachings of the Torah can be disobeyed if a life
       would be saved. For example, answering a telephone call on Shabbat to save a life.
     • Relevant references to the oral Torah should be credited.

     • The importance of the Torah is demonstrated through its treatment as a physical
       artefact. Dressed in ornate covers; kept in the ark with constant light lit; only
       touched with yad (not with hands); the congregation keep their focus on the Torah
       scrolls as they are processed during the service.

     • Simchat Torah signifies the beginning and end of Jewish liturgical year.

9.   “Shabbat is the most important festival [celebration] for Jews today.” Discuss.

     • Strong answers will give some focus to Shabbat today. For example, through
       discussion of how Jewish communities interpret and manage contemporary
       challenges to observing Shabbat; and how technology might be used to keep
       Shabbat law (if not its spirit).
     • Shabbat is one of the mitzvot or duties found in the Torah - the most important
       Jewish scripture.
     • In the Ten Commandments given by God to Moses Jews are commanded to
       remember and keep Shabbat. The only other festival that is a mitzvot is Sukkot.
     • In Deuteronomy 5:14 it is described as a day of rest from physical toil. Shabbat is a
       time each week for Jews to refresh themselves and concentrate on what is most
       spiritually important including reading the Torah.
     • Shabbat replicates how God rested after creating the heaven and earth.
     • Shabbat distinguishes a holy time from the rest of the week. This is shown by the
       Havdalah or separation ceremony which takes place at the end of Shabbat.
     • Shabbat shows the importance of the home for worship. On Friday night the
       Shabbat Queen is welcomed into the household creating a peace and calm.
       Shabbat is also a time for re-establishing with the wider Jewish community through
       attending synagogue services.
     • As Shabbat happens each week it can’t be so important as those festivals that
       happen only once a year.
     • There are other festivals that are more important for different reasons, e.g.
           o Rosh Hashanah is important as it is the start of a New Year and begins the
              holiest time of the Ten Days of Repentance. It is the time when God decides
              on everyone’s fate. It is the only festival observed over two days in Israel.
           o Pesach is an important festival as it is a time when Jews remember how they
              were led out of Egypt by Moses and the importance of freedom.
     • All festivals are important as they represent an important teaching in Judaism and
       reinforce a Jewish identity personally and as a community.

Christianity

10.   Examine the focus on poverty in Christianity.

      • Christian teachings that equate love of God and love for humanity may be
        interpreted as Christians having responsibility.
      • Christian teachings could include agape (the love of God for humanity) with
        reference to aspects of social justice.
      • Agape with reference to social justice is exemplified through Christian stories of
        charity, such as The Good Samaritan.
      • Agape with reference to social justice is also exemplified through Jesus’ teachings,
        such as the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12); Matthew 19:21 “If you want to be perfect,
        go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
        Then come, follow me”; Matthew 19:24 [rich man, camel, needle]; Matthew 22:39
        [love your neighbour as yourself].
      • Acts of kindness to other people might be interpreted as God’s presence through the
        Holy Spirit.
      • Christians may be inspired by Jesus’ example to live simply and share resources
        equally.
      • Some Christians refer to involuntary and voluntary poverty: involuntary poverty is a
        form of suffering criticised in the bible which Christians aim to alleviate; monks, nuns
        and Christians who adopt a frugal lifestyle take on voluntary forms of poverty as a
        spiritual discipline.
      • Candidates might discuss church groups, or other Christian communities/charities,
        who work to alleviate poverty.
      • Equally, candidates might discuss examples of corruption in Christian communities
        relating to false claims of helping the poor; e.g. bogus tele-evangelists
      • Freewill and sin might be interpreted as reasons why Christians cannot always have
        a responsibility towards people in poverty. People need to take responsibility for
        themselves.

11.   “The four Gospels are the most important sacred texts for Christians.” Discuss.

      • High scoring responses will defend or challenge that the Gospels are most
        important, rather than just defending their general importance.
      • The four Gospels are not the only sacred texts for Christians; other sources will
        include the remaining books of the New Testament and the Old Testament.
      • The Gospels provide the main sources of Jesus’ life, teachings, death and
        resurrection.
      • The four Gospels are often the focus of public worship and private devotion.
      • The four Gospels are considered to be divinely inspired.
      • For some Christians, other texts might be considered sacred such as papal
        encyclicals.
      • Some Christians would argue that there is no one most important sacred text, all are
        equal, including the Apocrypha.
      • For some Christians, the Ten Commandments are perceived as a revelation. Some
        churches and individuals may place more emphasis on the Ten Commandments in
        their daily life and worship.
      • Later books of the New Testament deal with the life of the Early Church (e.g. Acts of
        the Apostles, letters of Paul and others) so could be seen as more important than
        the gospels as sources of guidance.
      • Later books of the New Testament deal with important events that Christianity
        teaches about, and so are as important, or more important, than the gospels as
        sources of Christian teachings; e.g. Pentecost in Acts of the Apostles, and the end
        times in the Book of Revelation.

      Candidates might justify their arguments with reference to particular denominational
      beliefs and they should be credited if they answer the question.

Islam

12.     “Rituals are equally important for Muslim women and Muslim men.” Discuss.

        • When Muhammad gave his final sermon, he referred to prayer and the Five Pillars
          in the context of obligations upon believing men and women, equally.
        • Rituals include praying five times per day, fasting in Ramadan, paying Zakat, and
          performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah once in a lifetime. They may also include
          ceremonies at the time of birth and death.
        • However, the importance could be debated when considered from the perspectives
          of the individual and the community. Whilst men and women have an individual
          obligation to pray, men are expected to attend mosques to pray in congregation
          whenever they can and especially for jum’a (Friday prayers).
        • Some Mosques have areas for women and others do not. Very few operate mixed
          prayers or have women Imams to lead them. Some do not have facilities for women.
          This suggests that public rituals for communities are less important for women.
        • However, Muslim women complete Hajj together with men, and are required to fast
          and pay alms tax. This suggests the rituals are equally important.
        • Women are exempt from some rituals such as fasting during their monthly menses.
          This is usually seen as a sign that Islam is meant to be practical and not
          burdensome, rather than an indication of any difference in importance for the ritual
          between men and women.
        • On an individual level, rituals are performed to gain reward on the Day of
          Judgement. Men and women will be judged individually for what they have done, the
          rituals they have completed and their intentions behind their actions.
        • Birth ceremonies are performed for babies. There are some differences between the
          genders, in that boys are circumcised and men often lead these rituals. At death, the
          body is washed by relatives of the same gender.
        • Overall, a distinction might be drawn between traditional separation of genders
          found in some Muslim societies, and interpretations about the importance of ritual.

        • If discussing religious teachings or religious dress, candidates need to make the
          case for these having ritual elements to make discussion of examples relevant to the
          question.

13.   Examine the traditional account of the collation of the Qur'an.

      Response may choose to focus on lifetimes of either the Prophet Muhammad or Khalifh
      ‘Uthman.

      • The Qur’an was revealed to Muhammad on various occasions over 23 years. His
        personality helped people to learn about it and remember it off by heart as an oral
        tradition.
      • People who learned the Qur’an were known as the Huffaz. It was only when many of
        them passed away that the Qur’an was written down under ‘Uthman.
      • Under Muhammad, some people wrote parts of the Qur’an on fragments of various
        materials they had, such as palm leaves and bones, which were collected and used
        to form ‘Uthman’s collection.
      • Scribes were said to note down revelations as they were given to Muhammad, in the
        order they came down. This order was different from the final written collation which
        was said to have been decided by further messages to Muhammad.
      • Khalifah ‘Uthman gave the order to make an authorised version of the Qur’an and
        have it written down as a single text, which some considered controversial at the
        time.
      • ‘Uthman commissioned Zayd ibn Thabit to gather earlier records, including a
        collection held by Hafsa, and produce an approved version in the dialect of the
        Quraysh, the Prophet’s tribe.
      • It is said that ‘Uthman’s committee agreed the final order and omitted two chapters
        which were not confirmed as authentic.
      • ‘Uthman ordered the destruction of other, unauthorised versions. Without him,
        different versions might have survived.
      • It could be argued that other people had important roles in the collation of the
        Qur’an, such as Zayd who did much of the work in checking the collections. Khalifah
        ‘Ali was also said to have possessed a compilation.
      • There is disagreement between different Muslims and academics about some
        aspects of the compilation of the Qur’an.

      • What counts as ‘traditional’ can be contested within Islam and also by academic
        accounts of Islamic history.

Open-ended question

14.   With reference to one religion—Judaism or Christianity or Islam—discuss the role of
      individual religious experiences.

      Judaism
      • Individual or personal prayers are an important Jewish practice as they build a
        relationship with God. Jews are expected to prayer three times a day (morning,
        afternoon and evening) but throughout the day they will often offer prayers or
        communicate with God e.g. when seeing a natural wonder such as a rainbow.
      • There are few formal statements of belief in Judaism as the emphasis is on
        individual obedience to the Torah.
      • Meditation is very important in Judaism and has been a part of Jewish history.
      • During the Ten Days of Repentance between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur
        Jews adopt individual practices for repentance.
      • Within Judaism there is a history of individual study of the Torah. In a Yeshivah
        Jews make personal studies of the Torah and Talmud.
      • Individual experiences act as a personal rite of passage to a community of believers
        e.g. b’rit milah; Bar Mitzvah, Bat Mitzvah.
      • Personal articles of faith such as religious dress, kippah, tallit, wigs for Orthodox
        married women.
      • Prayer, such as Shema, Teffilin, Mikveh.
      • At Yom Kippur many Jews will uphold a personal fast for twenty-five hours.
      • Some Jews would emphasize the importance of individuals belonging to a holy
        people set apart by the obligations of the covenant.

      References to important group experiences in contrast to personal experiences should
      be credited.

      Christianity
      • Some Christians choose to make a personal commitment through vocation to the
        church such as taking on the role of a priest or nun.
      • Individual or personal prayers are an important Christian practice as they build a
        relationship with God. Prayer can be silent or said out loud. It can use set words, or
        a person's own words, sometimes using a rosary.
      • Individual devotions reflect the teachings and practices of Jesus. He sought solitary
        places to pray in Mark 1:35 and advised the disciples to pray in secret in Matthew
        6.6.
      • For many Christians an important act of personal religious experience is through the
        action of evangelism. This might be the result of personal prayer.
      • Individual study of the Bible is an important practice for many Christians. Often
        Christians will read a set passage from the Bible each day of the week. Some
        Christians may attend religious retreats.
      • Fasting has been a part of Christianity from a very early time. It is a voluntary act of
        sacrifice which helps develop self-discipline and personal spirituality.
      • Individual experiences act as a personal rite of passage to a community of believers
        e.g. baptism; Confirmation.
      • Christian meditation is a form of individual prayer in which a personal relationship is
        established with God. A structured attempt is made to become aware of and reflect
        upon the revelations of God.
      • Individuals can have personal revelations through experience of God in the Bible,
        history, nature, people, the Church and Jesus, and adult baptism.

      References to important group experiences in contrast to personal experiences should
      be credited.

Islam
• The importance of du’a –individual verbal prayers of supplication. Aside from the
   daily prayers, Muslims are encouraged to call upon Allah for forgiveness, guidance,
   and strength throughout the day. Muslims can make these personal supplications or
   prayers (du'a) in their own words, in any language.
• Hajj is a personal experience as Muslims decide when to make the journey and
   carry out a number of individual rituals.
• For some Muslims, such as Sufis, individual meditation is an important part of
   religious experience.
• Shi’ah Muslims may experience sorrow and suffering at the time of the re-enactment
   of the martyrdom of Imam ul-Husayn at Karbala.
• Individual experiences as a rite of passage e.g. the khitan (circumcision).
• Individual visits to shrines and tombs as exercised by some Muslims e.g. Sunni
   Muslims visit to Muhammad’s descendants.
• Individual study and reading of the Quran. Through the study of the Quran some
   Muslims can memorise the whole of the Quran and earn the title hafiz.
• Individuals choosing Islam as their faith go through a reversion experience involving
   reciting the shahadah (testimony/declaration of faith).

• Fasting during Ramadan, or at other important times.

References to important group experiences in contrast to personal experiences should
be credited.
