Answer one question.

1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Overview of Vietnam

     1   Economic reforms in Vietnam during the past 30 years have led to rapid economic growth,
         which has transformed a poor nation into a lower middle-income economy. The percentage of
         the population with an income of less than US$1.90 a day declined from 38 % in 2002 to below
         2 % in 2018.

     2   Vietnam used to be a food-insecure nation, in which many people sometimes lacked access
         to affordable food, but it is now a leading exporter of basic food commodities. It also aims
         to become an exporter of high quality and processed food products. However, agricultural
         production only accounts for 18 % of gross domestic product (GDP), although it uses 40 % of
         the land and employs 43 % of the labour force. Due to the growing rural population, land is
         often divided up between a greater number of farmers, causing some farms to become smaller.
         These farms have fewer opportunities to benefit from economies of scale and lower average
         costs of production.

     3   Vietnam’s rapid growth and industrialization, focused on export-oriented manufacturing, have
         had a harmful impact on the environment. Electricity consumption has tripled since 2010,
         growing faster than GDP. Electricity generation, which mainly uses fossil fuels, accounts for
         approximately 60 % of Vietnam’s carbon emissions. Demand for water continues to increase.
         Unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, such as land, fisheries, and timber, could
         negatively affect prospects for long-term growth. In addition, Vietnam’s primary sector is highly
         vulnerable to the climate and is therefore subject to supply shocks.

     4   Vietnam has signed several free trade agreements (FTAs). Its first FTA was a partnership with
         Japan in 2008. Both Vietnam and Japan are members of the Comprehensive and Progressive
         Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which took effect at the beginning of
         2019. These FTAs also promote inward foreign direct investment (FDI). In addition, Vietnam
         has introduced policies to attract foreign investment, such as tax incentives and spending
         on infrastructure.

     5   Japan is the biggest provider of foreign aid to Vietnam and the largest source of FDI. Japanese
         firms and aid agencies are jointly financing large-scale projects, including port infrastructure
         and a high-speed railway, which will reduce the Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh journey time from about
         35 hours to under six hours. Other Japanese-funded aid projects are in the areas of health care,
         education, and the environment.


Text B — Trade and investment flows between Vietnam and Japan

     1   Japan imports seafood and consumer products such as textiles, leather shoes and processed
         foods from Vietnam, because Vietnam has a comparative advantage in such items. Conversely,
         Vietnam imports machinery, technology, and raw materials for production from Japan. Gradually
         barriers to trade are being removed. In 2020, Vietnam began exporting lychees (a luxury
         fruit) to Japan after five years of negotiations on quality standards. The improved access to
         the Japanese market has increased the number of consumers and the revenue earned by
         Vietnamese lychee farmers.

(Question 1 continued)

   2    Japanese firms invest in Vietnam, particularly in urban areas, because wages are low and they
        can export from Vietnam to other CPTPP members and to China and Indonesia. Panasonic,
        a Japanese multinational company (MNC), relocated a major factory, which manufactures
        refrigerators and washing machines, from Thailand to Vietnam in 2020. The construction of
        a coal-fired power plant is mainly funded by Japanese firms. The Japanese government is
        promoting further investment by subsidizing over 30 firms that are relocating from China to
        Vietnam. Most of these firms are food processors or producers of manufactured goods (for
        example, medical equipment).


Text C — Roles of the central bank in Vietnam

   1    The central bank in Vietnam has been lowering interest rates since mid-2019. However, it has
        kept the minimum reserve requirement at 3 % of commercial bank deposits, despite suggestions
        that this requirement could be lowered.

   2    The central bank also regulates the exchange rate of the dong (Vietnam’s currency). It actively
        intervenes in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rate when necessary. In April 2020,
        there was downward pressure on the dong due to the lower interest rates and fewer foreign
        tourists. However, the central bank has a large amount of reserve assets, which were used to
        prevent the dong from depreciating.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Malawi

     1   Malawi is a landlocked country in southern Africa. Its development plans contain 169 targets,
         based on the Sustainable Development Goals. Ineffective institutions and inequalities, however,
         make it difficult to reach every target. Although poverty in urban areas has declined, the level
         of absolute poverty has been increasing in rural areas where 85 % of the population lives.
         Causes of poverty include land degradation (80 % of the land is eroded or lacks nutrients),
         poor healthcare and rapid population growth. There is also a lack of human capital, which is
         often due to the difficulties that households have in obtaining loans for education or training.
         Approximately 75 % of households do not have access to formal banking services.

     2   Aid agencies are providing assistance. The World Bank’s Human Capital Project will increase
         investment and encourage reforms, such as promoting the education of teenage girls. In 2020,
         the World Bank also approved US$157 million (50 % as a loan and 50 % as a grant) for a
         government project. This project aims to increase sustainable land management practices and
         build water-related infrastructure, such as small dams and irrigation schemes.

     3   The government has encouraged the establishment of microfinance groups that act as rural
         banks. They provide some finance and guidance for programmes that introduce new types of
         crops and techniques in order to improve agricultural efficiency.

     4   Although 2019 was a difficult year due to drought, insect infestations, and a tropical cyclone,
         Malawi’s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.5 %. There is a large budget deficit and
         the amount of government debt (at approximately 60 % of GDP) is considered to be too high.
         Therefore, the government has announced plans to reduce its spending. Inflation had been
         forecast to increase to 14 % in 2020. Due to the planned contractionary fiscal policies, however,
         inflation may fall below 10 % from 2021 onwards.

     5   Export revenues account for over 30 % of GDP. Malawi aims to increase its exports of cotton,
         nuts, tea and sugar. Rising exports and lower fuel import prices could reduce the current
         account deficit. Despite the persistent trade deficit, Malawi is resisting calls for further trade
         protection. It has signed bilateral trade agreements with both South Africa and Zimbabwe.
         Tariffs are gradually being reduced, while other indirect and direct taxes are being raised.


Text E — Agricultural Production

     1   Approximately 80 % of the labour force is employed in agriculture, with few job opportunities
         available in manufacturing and services. Agricultural productivity is low for many reasons. The
         government promotes manufacturing industries and cultivation of crops for export by large-scale
         farms. However, small-scale and subsistence farmers have received little support in the past.
         Farmers use less fertilizer and irrigation than is typical in other countries. Only 3 % of cultivated
         land is irrigated, compared to the global average of 21 %. Other challenges are the inadequate
         road and rail links to markets and the limited availability of electricity and fuel.

     2   Maize is the most important staple food in Malawi. The government uses price controls
         when trying to ensure that maize is available at affordable prices for low-income households.
         However, the maximum price set by the government is often too low to persuade farmers to
         supply the maize or to provide them with sufficient revenue. In 2020, the maximum price was
         raised from 250 to 310 kwacha per kilogram. Even at the higher price, shortages remain.

(This question continues on the following page)
                                                   –7–                                               2222 – 5104


(Question 2 continued)

   3    The government is planning to invest in commercial agriculture to improve productivity and
        promote diversification. The 2020 budget includes subsidies on fertilizer for 4.3 million small-scale
        farmers, which could possibly double maize output but may also pollute waterways. The support
        given to farmers will improve the nutrition of Malawians and stimulate the rural economy.


Text F — Tobacco Exports

        Tobacco is Malawi’s major export, providing over 50 % of foreign currency earnings. Due to
        lower global demand and the purchasing policies of multinational tobacco firms, prices paid
        to farmers in Malawi are low and falling. To reduce costs, farmers resort to using child labour.
        Following allegations of labour exploitation, the United States has restricted tobacco imports
        from Malawi. There is concern that other importing countries might also impose restrictions.
