How to use the Diploma Programme Philosophy markscheme

The assessment markbands constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment markbands examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the assessment markbands listed on page 6 for the core theme.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed
to emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills referred to in the various
assessment markbands published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement with philosophical
activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing responses, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme:

• The Diploma Programme Philosophy course is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy
  in the candidates. These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment markbands in the
  subject guide
• The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct answer
• The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
• The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list but rather an indicative list where they might appear in the answer
• If there are names of philosophers and references to their work incorporated into the markscheme,
  this should help to give context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such
  philosophers and references should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development.
• Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
• Examiners should be aware of the command terms for Philosophy as published on page 54 of the
  Philosophy subject guide when assessing responses
• In Paper 1, examiners must be aware that a variety of types of answers and approaches, as well as a
  freedom to choose a variety of themes, is expected. Thus, examiners should not penalize different
  styles of answers or different selections of content when candidates develop their response to the
  questions. The markscheme should not imply that a uniform response is expected
• In markschemes for the core theme questions in Paper 1 the bullet points suggest possible routes of
  response to the stimulus, but it is critical for examiners to understand that the selection of the
  philosophical issue raised by the stimulus is entirely at the choice of the candidate so it is possible for
  material to gain credit from the examiner even if none of the material features in the markscheme.


Note to examiners

Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question on the core theme.

           Philosophical vocabulary is not used, or is consistently used inappropriately.
         • The essay is descriptive and lacking in analysis.

       • The response is well structured, focused and effectively organized.
       • The philosophical issue raised by the stimulus material is explicitly identified. There is a
         well-developed justification of how the issue relates to the stimulus material and to the
         question of what it is to be human.
 21–25 • The response contains relevant, accurate and detailed knowledge. There is a
         well-developed explanation of the issue. There is appropriate use of philosophical
         vocabulary throughout the response.

Core Theme: Being human

1.   Interview excerpt

     With explicit reference to the stimulus and your own knowledge, discuss a
     philosophical issue related to the question of what it means to be human.                        [25]

     The following paragraphs provide only a framework to help examiners in their assessment of
     responses to this question. Examiners should be responsive to a variety of philosophical
     perspectives and approaches. Examiners should be aware that candidates might respond to
     this passage in a variety of ways including ones not mentioned in the summary below.

     This stimulus raises the issue of intention and awareness in conscious humans, and how much
     these brain faculties contribute to the humans who possess them being considered persons. The
     corollary of this view is that it might not be possible to consider a being, who is unaware or unable
     to demonstrate intentionality, as being a person and, thus, not fully or even properly human. In this
     extract, it is clear that families encountered by the doctor being interviewed see an ability to show
     intention as “a part of being human” or a “part of them as persons”. Some thinkers would reject the
     idea of intentionality being some kind of package that can be added to a body to make that body
     a person. Much of this relates to the Cartesian issue of the person as a thinking thing, in
     combination with being a physical thing, with thinking being treated as a substance, like the body
     is, in Descartes’s dualism. In more recent work on consciousness and AI, the issue of intentionality
     is famously raised by John Searle in his Chinese Room Argument, where he regards intentionality
     as a specifically human attribute unable to be replicated in AI. In this way, Searle argues that
     persons are distinctive ontologically. Machines cannot attain the independence of a person
     because the formal programming that dictates their function does not allow for intentionality.

     Some answers might make reference to ethical issues that arise over end-of-life decisions. These
     might discuss the role of consciousness and awareness in deciding upon the quality of human life.
     Singer would claim that a particular (very serious) lack of brain functionality disqualifies the human
     being from being understood as a person and being afforded protection in law in medical ethical
     decision-making. Hence, Singer reflects the functionality approach to human meaning, linked to
     Skinner’s behaviourism and more recent philosophical work on AI.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Cartesian dualism – the mind-body problem, the problem of other minds and consciousness
     • More recent accounts of the interaction between mind and body that does not entail a belief in
        them being separate substances – what, if any – are the relationships between mind and body?
        Why do we believe that other people have minds like ours?
     • Functionalism
     • Behaviourism
     • Sacred views of the meaning of human life and what constitutes a person
     • Different traditions treat human life’s essence as being located in the heart (see Jewish end of
        life positions) not the brain
     • Artificial intelligence
     • Modern neuroscience – what do recent advances in neuroscience tell us about how the human
        mind works?
     • Intentionality as a distinctively human faculty – Searle’s Chinese Room Argument
     • What makes me a person? What makes me the same person as I was 10 years ago?
     • Could animals or machines be considered persons?
     • The spectrum of awareness/consciousness-unconsciousness: different vegetative states and
        our understanding of them
     • Bioethical issues, eg: “do not resuscitate” orders, living wills, advance healthcare directives, a
        person’s life in data after death
     • End of life issues, eg: euthanasia, mind-uploading, the possibility of excessive medical
        treatment.

2.   Image

     With explicit reference to the stimulus and your own knowledge, discuss a
     philosophical issue related to the question of what it means to be human.                      [25]

     The following paragraphs provide only a framework to help examiners in their assessment of
     responses to this question. Examiners should be responsive to a variety of philosophical
     perspectives and approaches. Examiners should be aware that candidates might respond to
     this passage in a variety of ways including ones not mentioned in the summary below.

     The image raises questions about culture and what separates and binds groups of people.
     How much can the families understand of each other given the divergent customs and cultures
     they have experienced since birth? How much of an influence of nature and nurture might be
     gleaned from this image? How much of the identity of the families involved is shaped by their
     culture? Are there key modes of understanding, like time, that are transmitted by culture and
     language, as opposed to inherent intellectual faculties?

     What is inter-subjectivity? How much can/do we change our understanding of ourselves through
     interaction with others? See the issue of language and how it is understood to function by different
     thinkers, eg: Wittgenstein. In the face of the forces of the new habitat and the life of the new
     neighbours, how much agency do members of any family have given the imprint bestowed by birth
     and upbringing? How much is the identity of persons wrapped up with attributes they gain from
     people and cultural understanding around them? What is universal about human life, what is
     individual? What are the areas of life over which an individual can claim responsibility and
     authenticity? The candidates might consider whether the image delivers or fosters cognitive bias
     (prejudices) in terms of cultural, sexual, religious or economic differences, or opens up to an
     inclusive analysis of differences as a ground for mutual cultural and personal development.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
     • Individuality and universality
     • The nature versus nurture debate – do humans have common characteristics that are
        independent of culture? If so, what are these characteristics and what causes them?
     • Social conditioning – how fixed/malleable is human nature?
     • How much is our identity shaped by membership of the groups to which we belong?
     • Does discrimination stem from diversity?
     • The influence of material possessions and the environment in which you live
     • Personal identity
     • Identity over time
     • Social and cultural identity
     • Self-consciousness
     • Agency
     • Responsibility and authenticity
     • Language
     • Inter-subjectivity
     • The role of media (including social media) in shaping understanding of ourselves
     • Globalization and the increasing ease for people to travel to different countries/cultures
     • Tourism and the possibility of exploitation
     • The issue of “cultural industry”, eg: the Frankfurt School.
