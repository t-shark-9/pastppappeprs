                                           Section A

1.   (a)   Define the term economies of scale.                                         [2]

           Economies of scale are the reductions in unit/average costs that
           result from an increase in output / increase in scale.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as
           above.

           Do not reward examples of economies of scale e.g. purchasing
           economies.

           To be awarded [2] candidates must include references to both
           reductions in costs and the scale of output.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

     (b)   Using Table 1, calculate:

           (i)    the contribution per unit (show all your working);                   [2]

                  Unit contribution = selling price – variable costs.

                  Selling price = $0.15

                  Variable costs = $0.05

                  Answer = $0.10

                  Award [2] for a correct answer with working.

                  Award [1] for correct answer without working.

                  Award [1] for correct method with an error in the calculation.

           (ii)   the break-even level of output (no working required).                [1]

                  Correct answer = 50m

                  Award [1] for correct answer without working.

                  Candidates that omit the million or m sign award [0].

(c)   If AXL produces 75 million cans in 2023, using Table 1, calculate:

      (i)    the margin of safety (no working required);                         [1]

             MOS = current output – break even

             = 75m – 50m = 25m

             Award [1] for correct answer without working.

             Candidates that omit the million or m sign award [0].

             If candidates have a dollar sign ($) by the figure, award [0]
             (for example, the candidate writes $25m).

             Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR). A mark can be awarded if
             an error made in b(ii) is carried through to (c)(i).

      (ii)   the profit (show all your working).                                [2]

             Output = 75 million cans

             TFC = $5m

             TVC = $3.75m (75m x 0.05)

             TC = $8.75m

             TR = 11.25m

             Profit = $2.5m

             Award [1] for the correct working and [1] for the correct
             answer.

             Award [1] for the correct answer without working.

             Answers that omit the m or millions cannot be awarded full
             marks – a correct answer without the m or millions can be
             awarded [1] if the method / working is correct.
                                      –6–                 M22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(d)   Explain the potential impact on AXL if it implements its planned increase in
      trade credit period.                                                           [2]

      Trade credit is an agreement between businesses that allows the
      buyer of goods or services to pay the seller at a later date.

      Candidates need to show an understanding of trade credit for [1] and
      make use of the stimulus for [2].

      For example, this change may reverse the decline in sales that
      occurred in the first half of 2022, as now customers have longer to
      pay, which makes the business more competitive in an increasingly
      competitive market.

      However, a comment such as “It may lead to an increase in sales but
      a reduction in cash inflows as AXL’s existing customers can now delay
      payment for an additional 30 days” has only nominal application, as
      the comment applies to almost all non-retail companies. In this
      instance, award [1].

      Award [1] for only a partial/unclear explanation of the impact on AXL.

      Award [2] for a clear explanation of the impact on AXL that makes use
      of the stimulus provided.

2.   (a)   State two appropriate external sources of finance that RE could use to
           modernize its gas stations.                                                [2]

           Award [1] for each appropriate source of finance up to a maximum of [2].

           Appropriate external sources include:
           • share (capital)
           • loan (capital) / bank loans
           • retained profit
           • debentures
           • venture capital
           • leasing
           • equity finance

           Do not award inappropriate sources such as:
           • trade credit
           • overdrafts
           • grants
           • subsidies
           • debt factoring
           • hire purchase
           • business angels

(b)   (i)   Construct a fully labelled balance sheet for RE as of 31 December 2021.[5]

                           Balance sheet for RE as of 31st December 2021

            N.B. if the candidate does not follow the IB prescribed format
            award a maximum of [3].

            N.B. candidates should not be penalized for: omitting the row
            “Long-term liabilities (debt)”, or for writing “retained profit”
            omitting the word “accumulated”.

            Award [1] if the candidate conveys some idea of what a
            balance sheet is.

            Award [2] if the candidate constructs a largely recognizable
            balance sheet, but it does not balance, or it has two major
            problems of classification.
                                         –9–                  M22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

             Award [3] for a largely accurate balance sheet that correctly
             balances. (There could be one misclassification.)

             Award [4] if the candidate constructs an accurate balance
             sheet (that balances) according to the IB prescribed format.

             Award [5] if the candidate constructs an accurate balance
             sheet (that balances) according to the IB prescribed format and
             the balance sheet is dated.

(b)   (ii)   Calculate RE’s gross profit margin (no working required).                 [1]

             $100 000m – 80 000m = $20 000m

             $20 000m = 20 %
             $100 000m

             Correct answer = 20 % or .2

             If a candidate does not express the gross profit margin (GPM) as a
             percentage or as a decimal, the answer is incorrect.

             Award [1] for the correct answer (no working required).

(c)   Explain the potential impact of the increasing popularity of electric cars on RE’s
      costs and revenues.                                                             [2]

      Award [1] for only a partial/unclear explanation of the potential
      impact of the increasing popularity of electric cars on RE’s costs and
      revenues.

      Award [2] for a clear explanation of the potential impact of the
      increasing popularity of electric cars on RE’s costs and revenues.

      To achieve [2] candidates must make it explicit that:
      • increase in popularity of electric cars is likely to lead to a fall in
        demand for gas and therefore revenues are likely to fall.
      • with declining sales, RE will have to purchase less gas. Thus,
        total variable costs will fall. OR costs would increase if the
        business decided to install electric charging points.

      Answers that make no explicit reference to costs and why they might
      not change or might change can earn a maximum of [1].

                                          Section B
3.   (a)   State two ways in which market share can be measured.                           [2]

           The term market share refers to the percentage of a sales that one
           company has within a particular market, such as athletic gear.

           Ways that market share can be measured include:
           • by revenue (value), in terms of currency ($, €, ¥, etc.).
           • by unit sales (volume).

           N.B. candidates are not being asked how to calculate market share, and, thus,
           they are not expected to provide a definition. For [2], they have to convey the
           idea that two ways exists to measure it.

           Award [1] for each correct way of measuring market share up to [2].
           Maximum award: [2].

     (b)   Draw an organization chart for HA.                                               [4]



                                            HA Head
                                             office


               Running                      Sweat                        Sports
                shorts                      shirts                        bras




           The chart does not have to be drawn exactly as above.

           Award [1] for drawing an organizational chart and additional [1] for each of:
           • information that conveys some understanding of “by product”
           • information that conveys some understanding of hierarchy (must
             have at least four levels)
           • information that conveys some understanding of a narrow span of
             control (two or three reporting units per manager).

           Maximum award: [4].

           N.B. to convey the idea of organized by product, candidates may use the
           actual products (running shorts, sweat shirts, and sports bras) or generic
           products (product A, product B, product C) as long as they have exactly
           three products.
                                        – 11 –              M22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

(c)   Explain:

      (i)    the impact of price changes by foreign competition on HA’s break-even
             point;                                                                [2]

             HA is selling more units of product, but sales revenue has not
             been rising as foreign competitors, using penetration pricing,
             have driven prices down. Thus, the average sales price per unit
             is falling. Further, the gross profit margin has been declining,
             which means that HA has not been able to reduce per unit cost
             as much as sales price per unit. With a declining contribution
             per unit, HA has seen its break-even point move to the right on
             the X-axis.

             Award [1] for stating that the break-even point moves to the
             right, and an additional [1] for an explanation with application to
             the stimulus.

      (ii)   why HA had to raise additional external finance to increase production. [2]

             Candidates may answer this question in one of three ways:

             1. One way puts emphasis on the word external in the
             question. If a candidate chose this emphasis, they need to say
             something like “Because foreign competitors have used
             penetration pricing to gain market share, HA has had to lower
             its prices, which is why gross and net profit margins have
             declined. As a result, HA has not been able to generate
             sufficient internal finance to support increased production and
             has had to turn to external finance.”

             Both of the other ways candidates can answer this question
             emphasize the increase in production:

             2. Candidates may believe that HA needs more working capital
             to support increased trading activity. HA has had increased unit
             sales volume, which means that it has been manufacturing and
             selling more product, even if at lower margins. For most
             companies, increased trading means increased inventory and
             accounts receivable. The asset accounts must be financed.
             Increased accounts payable will fund some of that increased
             trading activity, but probably not all of it. With margins
             declining, HA probably cannot fund this need internally and,
             thus, has had to turn to external sources of finance.
             3. Candidates may believe that HA needs property, plant, and
             equipment to support increased production. However, because
             of contracting margins, in the past few years, HA probably has
             generated insufficient funds internally to finance long-term
             assets. Thus, they have obtained finance externally.

             Award [1] for some understanding of one of the three issues
             above and an additional [1] for application to the stimulus. Up to
             a maximum of [2].
                                        – 12 –              M22/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


            N.B. In all three cases, the key is for candidates to link
            contracting margins or lower prices (which is why HA’s margins
            are lower) to external finance (rather than internal) or to
            increased production (increased working capital requirements or
            more property, plant, and equipment).

(d)   Recommend whether HA should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                           [10]

      Reasons for outsourcing include:
      • Lower costs, which is usually why companies outsource overseas.
      • Lower investment in fixed assets: no need to expand current
        manufacturing facilities and some possibility of selling off existing
        facilities.
      • Lower fixed costs, which can be an advantage were sales to fall in
        the highly competitive market.

      Reasons against outsourcing include:
      • HA relies on high-quality manufacturing, which overseas
        manufacturers may not be able to deliver.
      • HA exposes itself to additional risks, such as political risk of the
        home countries where the new manufacturers are located.
      • Depending on where most of HA’s sales occur, it may lose the
        advantage of saying manufactured in the home country or in
        Europe.
      • Outsourcing, if to developing countries, may raise ethical and
        environmental concerns.

      Accept any other relevant reason for or against outsourcing.

      Reasons for setting up online business-to-consumer (B2C) retail stores include:
      • The online retail market is rapidly growing.
      • Consumers have increasing expectations that goods will be
        available online.
      • B2C eliminates links in the downstream supply chain that erode
        profit margins.

      Reasons against setting up online retail stores include:
      • HA has only operated in the secondary sector and has no
        experience in retail.
      • Though capital outlays will be less than if HA started to build brick-
        and-mortar stores, setting up on online presence will require
        capital outlays at a time when the business is having to turn to
        external finance just to fund manufacturing operations.
      • The online market is no less competitive than traditional
        approaches.

      Accept any other relevant reason for or against setting up online retail stores.

4.   (a)   State two features of a cooperative.                                      [2]

           The main features of a cooperative include:
           • An aim is to serve the members of the cooperative/members with a common
             interest.
           • A cooperative is a type of corporation.
           • A cooperative has a board of directors or trustees.
           • Members of the cooperative have limited liability.
           • Cooperatives have democratic or democratically spirited management.
           • Legal existence is separate from the members themselves.
           • Membership is usually open.
           • Surpluses/profit are distributed except when needed for finance.
           • The organization will not end if a member dies or withdraws.
           • All owners have equal voting rights.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each relevant feature identified up to [2].

(b)   With reference to RS, explain the importance of branding.                   [4]

      Branding is a way for a company to distinguish itself from other
      organizations. Ideally, it succinctly delivers a message about your
      product, as RS hoped with the symbol of the red squirrel would
      symbolize environmental friendliness by reminding consumers of the
      dangers of invasive species and would symbolize health
      consciousness, as RS was promoting traditional juice, which has less
      sugar (and preservatives) than American-style beverages. In this
      way, RS hoped to build credibility with consumers – any beverage
      with the RS symbol would be healthy and would remind consumers
      of the environment. With these features, RS hoped to build goodwill.

      Brands, and their symbols, run the risk of taking on a life of their own.
      Sometimes a famous brand, like McDonald’s, enjoys decades of
      positive psychological associations but then, as culture and
      consumer trends change, the brand starts to generate negative
      associations. Such was partially the case with RS. Originally, the
      image of the red squirrel was at worst innocuous and at best heart-
      warming. As anti-immigrant groups co-opted the red squirrel for its
      own purposes, however, the cooperative faced risks of being
      associated with anti-immigrant sentiment. Some consumers may now
      be turned off by the brand as to them a red squirrel may symbolize a
      political position that they disagree with.

      Award [1] if the candidate demonstrates some understanding of
      branding. Award up to [2] if the candidate demonstrates a clear
      understanding of the importance of branding but makes no
      meaningfully reference to the stimulus.

      Award up to [3] if the candidate demonstrates a clear understanding
      of the importance of branding and makes meaningfully reference to
      the stimulus, but the explanation is one-sided. Award up to [4] if the
      candidate demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of
      branding, makes meaningfully reference to the stimulus, and points
      out both a benefit of branding and some risks inherent with it.

      Maximum award: [4]

      N.B. For application, just mentioning red squirrel is not enough.
      Candidates must link the response to the stimulus (for example,
      "appeal to environmentally aware and health-conscious consumers.")

(c)   With reference to RS, explain the difference between capital expenditure and
      revenue expenditure.                                                      [4]

      Capital expenditure is the purchase of assets whose life exceeds one
      year. Revenue expenditure is made up of expenses related to the
      trading cycle: purchasing raw material, processing, inventory, making
      payroll, etc. With respect to RS, capital expenditure refers to the
      bottling equipment needed to produce bottled apple juice to sell
      directly to consumers. RS experienced an increase in revenue
      expenditures when it started selling bottled apple juice, as it had
      increased labour costs (presumably to operate the bottling
      equipment) and increased costs for promotion.

      Award [1] for a theoretical understanding of capital expenditure and
      an additional [1] for reference to the bottling equipment.

      Award [1] for a theoretical understanding of revenue expenditure and
      an additional [1] for reference to increases in labour expenses or
      increased costs in promotion.

      Mark as [2] + [2]. Maximum award: [4]

(d)   Discuss two possible areas of conflict between the interests of RS’s
      stakeholders.                                                              [10]

      Possible areas of conflict between the interests of RS’ stakeholders include:
      • Between RS farmers and anti-immigrant political groups. The
        farmers in RS presumably were in some agreement with the
        cooperative’s founders that the name and symbol of the red
        squirrel was to promote the environment and healthy beverages.
        With anti-immigrant groups’ co-option of the symbol, “red squirrel”
        came to mean something else. This situation puts the
        cooperative’s members against the anti-immigrant groups.
      • Between RS farmers and the managers of the cooperative. The
        decision to open a second channel of distribution meant that RS
        had to increase fixed costs (for the bottling equipment) and add
        additional expenses, for labour and promotion. Whether this
        generates surpluses in the long run is unclear. In the short run,
        these capital and revenue expenditures almost certainly mean
        smaller surpluses and lower probability to have distributions to
        member farmers.
      • Between RS management and beverage producers. When RS
        decided to open a new distribution channel, it started to compete
        with its customers, some of whom might object to two facts: (1)
        RS would have lower costs for apple juice than they would and (2)
        the RS symbol on their (the beverage producers’) labels might be
        considered a form of free advertising for RS.
      • Between beverage companies and the anti-immigrant political
        groups. Beverage companies saw an advantage of putting the red
        squirrel symbol on their bottles initially, as it conveyed positive
        associations about the environment and health. Now, the squirrel
        conveys some negative associations, at least to some residents of
        the country, with which the beverage companies may not want to
        be associated.

      A further possibility exists that the disagreement could emerge within
      the essentially important stakeholder group, the farmer members. As
      the red squirrel symbol became politicized, some farmers may have
      supported that development (that is, been anti-immigrant
      themselves), while others may have been of a different political view
      and disapproved of the development.

      Candidates may talk about two different conflicts between the same
      two stakeholder groups provided that the issues (behind the conflict)
      are different.

N.B. Accept the disagreement within the farmer members of the
politics of the red squirrel symbol as a disagreement between two
stakeholder groups.

N.B. Some types of cooperatives being a member is the same thing
as being an employee. In other types of cooperatives, members are
not employees but rather the cooperative hires employees who are
not members.

5.   (a)   State two features of a public limited company.                               [2]

           The main features of a public limited company, some of which may apply to a
           private limited company, include:
           • Government rules, laws, and regulations strictly govern public
              limited companies.
           • Shareholders do not participate in the day-to-day management of
              the business of a company.
           • Shareholders’ liability is limited to their investment in the company.
           • The board of directors has decision-making power, most of which
              it delegates to the chief executive officer. The board, nonetheless,
              makes policy and strategic decision by majority rule.
           • The company has separate legal existence from its owners
              (shareholders).
           • The company raises capital by selling shares.
           • The shares of a company are freely transferable and do not
              require consent of other shareholders.
           • Shares can be bought-sold only via a stock exchange.
           • Anyone can purchase shares.
           • Financial statements/accounts are made public and are easily
              accessible.
           • Legal continuity.

           Accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1] for each relevant feature stated up to [2]. Maximum award: [2].

(b)   (i)   Explain, with reference to Maslow’s motivation theory, how teleworking
            may damage employee motivation at FR’s head office.                   [2]

            Maslow’ 3rd level, social needs / teamworking, will not be met
            as employees that choose teleworking will be working from
            home for all but one day per month and therefore will have little
            opportunities to meet with colleagues, to work as part of a face
            to face team.

            Maslow’s 4th level may also not be met due to the typical lack of
            a formal workplace among teleworkers. It may be difficult for
            remote workers to experience formal recognition of their
            accomplishments. In addition, the virtual nature of their jobs
            reduces direct / face to face input that signifies goal
            achievement and personal development, which affect
            employees’ esteem. This may be further exacerbated by the
            fact that 40% of workers who chose not to telework will
            continue to enjoy these benefits. This may cause resentment
            among teleworkers leading to problems with teamworking (3rd
            level).

            Award [1] for demonstrating an understanding of Maslow’s
            motivation theory and a further [1] for a development with
            respect to FR. Award a maximum of [2].

            [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation
            and / or application.

            For example:

            For an identification or a description of one of Maslow’s
            hierarchy of needs with or without application [1].

            hierarchy of needs with no application award [1].

            For an identification or a description of one of Maslow’s
            hierarchy of needs and application award [2].

            N.B. For application, candidates do not have to say "only one
            day per month" but they do need to convey the idea that
            teleworking employees are not coming to the office often.

(ii)   Explain one disadvantage for FR, other than the impact on employee
       motivation, of introducing teleworking.                          [2]

        Other disadvantages include:
        • It will be more difficult for the business to complete 360-
          degree feedback appraisals, which have been a factor in
          improving staff morale and retention.
        • It will be more difficult for line managers to assess the
          performance of their employees as they will not see them on
          a day-to-day basis as some employees are working from
          home for all but one day per month.
        • Teleworking may introduce inefficiencies. For example, with
          40% of workers still at head office and 60% working from
          home, communication may be more difficult.
       • Communication issues may arise if teleworking employees
          have poor IT facilities at home. Informal communication will
          be more difficult as 40% of workers are still in head office.
       • The business may need to provide teleworking employees
          with improved IT facilities at home which will increase the
          business costs. This would reduce cost savings made by
          head office from introducing teleworking.

       Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

       Award [1] for identifying or describing the disadvantage to FR
       and a further [1] for a development with respect to FR. Award a
       maximum of [2].

       [2] cannot be awarded if the response lacks either explanation
       or application.

       For example: For an identification or a description of the
       disadvantage without application, such as “productivity may

(c)   Explain two disadvantages for FR if it extends its 360-degree feedback
      appraisal system to its supermarket employees.                           [4]

      Disadvantages with potential for application include:
      • It will increase the business costs as collecting data and
         performing the appraisals for all employees will mean additional
         paper work and possibly hiring more managers and/or paying
         overtime for the extra work. Department managers are already
         complaining about their workload and this will make it worse. This
         is particularly relevant as there are far more supermarket
         employees (6000) than head office employees (250).
      • It will increase workload on department managers particularly as
         the business has hired an additional 1000 part-time staff.
         Department managers already have concerns about workload and
         doing 360-degree feedback appraisals on all employees will
         increase workload even more.
      • The whole process is time-consuming for everyone involved and
         could reduce the efficiency of FR’'s core activity, running
         supermarkets. (For application, candidates must refer to the
         number of employees).

      Disadvantage where opportunity for application is limited include:
      Employees may select “raters” that are “fans”. This can lead to
      skewed results and department managers may disagree with an
      employee’s choice of raters, which may further increase staff
      turnover of departmental managers.

      Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Award [1] for identifying or describing the disadvantage for FR and a
      further [1] for a development with respect to FR. Award a maximum
      of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation or application.

      For example: For an identification or a description of a disadvantage
      without application award [1]. For an explanation of a disadvantage
      with no application award [1].

      For explanation of a disadvantage and application [2].

      Mark as [2] + [2]. Maximum award: [4]

      N.B. the disadvantage has to be specific to a 360-degree feedback
      appraisal system, not to appraisal in general.

(d)   Recommend whether FR should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                    [10]

      There is no “correct answer”. Answers could include:

      Option 1

      Pros

      This option is less expensive in the long-term. The business will need
      to raise $17m (500 x $34 000). Currently interest rates are very low
      and therefore the interest charges will only raise the business costs
      by a relatively small amount. E.g. 3 % per annum ($510 000 in year
      1).

      At the end of the five-year period the business intends to replace the
      vans – as it owns them it can sell them to raise some finance towards
      their replacement.

      As FR already has a $50m bank loan it might be assumed they have
      a good relationship with their bank and further borrowing would not
      be a problem.

      Cons

      The business will need to negotiate an additional loan from its bank
      and may need to provide the bank with additional financial
      documents and possibly collateral. Should the business fail to repay
      the loan then the collateral would be seized by the bank.

      It is not a cost-free option even when interest rates are low, as a
      $17m loan would incur interest charges of 3 % per annum ($510 000
      in year 1). If using simple interest this totals $19.55m over five years.

      If the trend to buying online is not maintained and shoppers gradually
      return to shopping face-to-face, then FR may have a large number of
      vans that it no longer needs but is paying for over five years. Whilst
      these could be re-sold there would be a significant loss made as
      second-hand prices will be a lot lower than the $34 000 purchase
      price.

      FR would be liable for the maintenance and repair of vans.

Option 2

Pros

Leasing is more flexible. The business will need to lease the vans for
at least 24 months. At that point if it finds that consumer trends have
changed then it can either not renew the leases on 500 vans or lease
a much smaller number, say 200. This will save the business money
in the long run e.g. leasing just 200 vans will cost only $2.6m per
year.

If after 24 months demand is not seen to be there then the business
could end the lease and purchase vans, saving money in the long
run.

One of the tax advantages to leasing a van could include claiming up
to 100 % sales tax back on the monthly payments. Also, leasing
payments are expenses and, thus, lower pre-tax profits and income
tax expense.

In addition, lessors are usually liable for maintenance and servicing
of the vans on a regular basis.

N.B. Terms and conditions of fleet leasing vary. In some instances,
lessors are not responsible for maintenance or service. In other
cases, fleet lessors are responsible for service and maintenance,
though they often contract out the management of the service and
maintenance to a third company for a monthly fee.

Given the limited experience of our candidates, which could well
inform their knowledge about vehicle leases, candidates can argue
that FR will not be responsible for maintenance and servicing (a pro
of leasing) or that FR might still be responsible for maintenance and
servicing (a con of leasing).

Cons

This may have higher long-term costs. A lease of 500 vans will cost
the business $6.5m annually (500 x $13 000). Over five years this
would be $32.5m which is almost twice the cost of the option A. This
is a significant difference in terms of costs.

At the end of each lease period the business does not own the vans
and has to negotiate a new leasing agreement.

The business will pay penalties at the end of the lease agreement if
the leased vans are damaged in any way.
