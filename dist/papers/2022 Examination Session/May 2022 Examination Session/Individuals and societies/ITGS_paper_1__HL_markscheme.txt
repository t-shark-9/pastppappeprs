Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up
Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

(b)   (i)    The team developing the smartwatch app followed the project development
             life cycle (PDLC).

             Explain why end-users should be involved in the development of products
             such as the smartwatch app.                                                   [3]

             Answers may include:
             • End-users are able to provide an insight into how a product may function
             • … which may not be possible to obtain from in-house testing (alpha
               testing)
             • … as this may not expose the product to the range of situations it may
               be expected to function in
             • … and could be considered to be beta testing
             • … will make end-product more marketable / desirable to the end-user.

             • End-user testing can take place in the customer's environment.
             • … allowing them to use the program under normal conditions
             • … which may allow them to find ‘bugs’ / features which need improving /
               discover new features and suggest these to the developers
             • … which may lead to making the end-users more likely to use the
               finished product as they are involved in its development.

             Award [1] for identifying a reason why end-users should be involved in the
             development of products such as the smartwatch app and [1] for each
             subsequent development of that reason up to [3].

             Note to examiners: the development of one idea with two additional points
             that develop it.


      (ii)   Explain why a feasibility study would be used in the development of
             products such as the smartwatch app.                                          [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Feasibility studies can provide the parameters for the development of a
               product.
             • This may provide / set constraints that the developers can work within.
             • … and may prevent the development going in directions that may prove
               to be unsustainable.
             • Determine the technical viability.
             • Determine the economic viability.
             • Determine how much time the project may take.

             Award [1] for identifying a reason why a feasibility study would be used in
             the development of products such as the smartwatch app and [1] for each
             subsequent development of that reason up to [3].

             Note to examiners: the development of one idea with two additional points
             that develop it.

(c)   Many people use smartwatches to monitor their vital signs and manage their
      health.

      To what extent should an individual use a smartwatch to manage their health?         [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages:
      • Patients will be able to keep abreast of their vital signs / medical condition
        24/7.
      • This can lead to them having less need to go to the doctors or to use valuable
        health resources if the condition is not serious.
      • All the historical data may be captured.
      • The data will be more comprehensive than if it is only collected in a
        consultation with a doctor.
      • Which may mean it is easier to spot trends / abnormalities.
      • Might allow users to better manage illnesses which can be controlled, like
        diabetes and high blood pressure.
      • Allows users to maintain a healthy lifestyle as their vital signs can show the
        benefits of healthy activity e.g., exercise, good sleep, eating well etc.

      Disadvantages:
      • The app might suggest treatments which are not appropriate if the user’s
         symptoms do not match the ‘average’ symptoms for a particular condition.
      • Users of the smartwatch may become fixated by it, which could have negative
         effects (white coat syndrome).
      • May be unreliable - may be lost or damaged or experience software bugs
         which make them unreliable.
      • Technology in a smart watch may not provide accurate enough readings for
         medical use.
      • The user may not want to use the watch because they are worried about what
         might happen to the data which the watch generates i.e. could be sold to or
         shared with third parties / used against them by insurance companies or
         potential employers etc.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

      Please see generic markband on page 23.

           (i)     Identify two sensors that may be used to detect data about the weather
                   conditions.                                                                     [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • (Atmospheric) pressure
                   • Temperature
                   • Wind (speed/direction)
                   • Humidity
                   • Rain / precipitation / water level (BOD)
                   • Sunlight

                   Award [1] for identifying each sensor that may be used to detect data about
                   weather conditions up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    State the primary key in the Ship table in Figure 3.                            [1]

                   Ship_ID

           (iii)   State the relationship between the Ship table and Accident table in Figure 3.   [1]

                   One – many

           (iv)    Outline one advantage of using a relational database rather than a flat-file
                   database.                                                                       [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Any item of data is only entered once.
                   • … which eliminates redundant data.

                   • Removing redundant data
                   • … reduces the amount of storage space needed for the database.
                   • … reduces the chance of an error occurring.

                   • Normalization
                   • … reduces the chance of anomalies (eg update / deletion / insertion).

                   • Improves security of the data
                   • … as different permissions can be added to different tables.

                   Award [1] for identifying an advantage of a relational database rather than
                   a flat-file database and [1] for a development of that reason up to [2].

(b)   (i)    Distinguish between data validation and data verification.                            [2]

             Answers may include:
             • Data validation is the process of ensuring the data entered is valid
               (clean, correct and useful) using computer based rules (e.g. presence
               check, length check, type check, range check etc).
             • Data verification is the process of checking what has been entered is
               correct compared to the original (integrity) or by entering the data twice
               and comparing the instances of the data entry.

             Award [1] for a definition of data validation.
             Award [1] for a definition of data verification.

      (ii)   The MADAS system uses data visualization.

             Explain why data visualization is used by the MADAS system.                           [4]

             Answers may include:
             • Visualization is story telling with images, graphs and charts.
             • It uses mathematical operations to model events.
             • This enables complex data to be presented in a way that can be easily
               understood.
             • This allows the easy identification of trends
             • … to make connections between operations and results
             • … to identify future problems which may arise / predict accidents.

(c)   To what extent can the use of simulations like the MADAS system help prevent
      future accidents?                                                                      [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages:
      • There is a lot of data and if this is put together usefully then the causes of the
        accident can be better understood.
      • Understanding the accident will mean that mitigation strategies can be
        developed.
      • If the simulation was part of a training program then the simulations could be
        used to teach future boat pilots how to avoid the same kind of accidents.
      • Cheaper to run a situation through a simulation to see what will happen than
        to wait for it to happen in real life.
      • The information from the model and simulation may allow the authorities to
        make changes to the regulations.
      • “What if” simulation can be easily run to observe the effects of changes in
        behaviour or conditions.

      Disadvantages:
      • Simulations are only as accurate as the data which is given to them. GIGO.
      • Simulations might be biased because they have been created by a particular
         organisation / company.
      • Simulations are not the real thing so even if a person has trained on a
         simulation, there is no guarantee that this will mean they will know what to do
         if facing a possible accident.
      • Too many variables to account for and it is unclear which of these might have
         made the accident worse or better.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

           (ii)   If the schools in Hesse can no longer use cloud computing software
                  applications, they will need to store their data on a local file server and
                  access it through a local area network (LAN).

                  Identify two ways in which data could be secured if the school stored it
                  locally.                                                                         [2]

(c)   A new school has opened in Switzerland and its IT Manager is considering two
      options:
      • Option 1: Using a local client–server network.
      • Option 2: Using a cloud-based service.

      Evaluate the implications of these two options for the IT Manager.                   [8]

      Answers may include:
      Option 1:
      Advantages
      • The management of the client-server network can be carried out in-house
        which will mean the way in which the network is set up can be tailored to the
        school’s needs.
      • There will be fewer costs to external agencies for the upkeep of the network
        i.e. there is no monthly fee / subscription fees etc. Which will need to be
        managed by the IT Manager.
      • The IT Manager will have complete knowledge about where their data is held.
      • A client-server network allows in-house control of backup and security (this
        could be argued from both sides depending on the competency of the IT staff).

      Disadvantages
      • The hardware costs for network infrastructure as well as software licencing
         costs will need to be paid by the school and managed by the IT manager.
      • IT manager will need to employ staff who can manage the network and
         maintain the hardware or arrange for this to be outsourced.


      Option 2:
      Advantages
      • The management of the client-server network can be carried out remotely by
        the cloud service provider which will mean that IT Manager will not have to
        carry out a number of tasks linked to the maintenance of the network.
      • The cloud-based provider will provide backing up facilities as part of the
        service so the IT Manager will not have to address this issue.
      • The cloud-based provider will be able to provide up to date versions of
        software and services more efficiently than the IT Manager who may have to
        buy them in after carrying out due diligence.

      Disadvantages
      • Increasing the storage capacity of the network would be easily done by
         requesting this from the cloud service provider. No addition hardware or
         infrastructure will be required.
      • There will still be a need to have some hardware and software on site (for
         example print servers) which will need to be purchased and maintained by the
         IT manager.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

     Note to examiners:
       • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
       • Part (b) and Part (c) questions are marked using a markband. Use annotations
           and text comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not
           use ticks.

     (a)   (i)    Identify the steps used by the facial recognition software to identify an
                  individual student.                                                             [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • The image of the student is captured, i.e., with a camera.
                  • The system transforms analog information into a set of digital
                    information based on the person's facial features.
                  • The image is stored in a database.
                  • In the classroom, the facial recognition software scans its range of vision
                    until it detects a face.
                  • During the lesson, the software measures key features of the face
                    (distance between the eyes, width of the nose, etc).
                  • 3D facial recognition can use features of the face, such as curves of the
                    nose and chin.
                  • The software matches the student’s face with the one stored in the
                    database.

                  Award [1] for each step used by the facial recognition software to identify
                  an individual student identified up to [4] max.

           (ii)   A data flow diagram was used in the development of the facial recognition
                  software.

                  Identify two characteristics of a data flow diagram.                             [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • Graphic representation of the flow of data through a system.
                  • That includes inputs and outputs.
                  • States the processes used in the system.
                  • Uses specific symbols to represent inputs, processes, outputs etc.
                  • Can be used to analyse a system or create a model for a new system.

                  Award [1] for each characteristic of a data flow diagram identified up to [2]
                  max.

(b)   The school’s IT manager has received a report of several IT-related incidents that
      occurred in the last week.

      • Incident 1: Students installed and played a video game during a history
        lesson.
      • Incident 2: The facial recognition software detected that students appeared to
        be talking a lot in a French class.
      • Incident 3: There was an unreliable internet connection during the streaming
        of a video as part of a biology lesson.
      • Incident 4: Internet connection was lost just as final-year geography students
        were about to begin online examinations.

      Explain how the IT manager could determine the order of priority for these four
      incidents.                                                                                  [6]


      Answers may include:
      • The extent to which the incident affects student learning, the more students
        affected will mean the incident would be assigned a higher priority.
      • Any incident that is a potential threat to the security of the school network
        would be assigned a higher priority
      • If the incident could have a negative effect on the image/reputation of the
        school, it would be assigned a higher priority
      • If the incident is frequent, it may be assigned a higher priority unless it does
        not have a direct impact on student learning.
      • If the incident is intermittent, its effects on student learning will need to be
        assessed. Depending on this, it may be assigned a high priority.
      • Priority may be assigned based on who is affected,
         o loss of internet access in a year 1 class would be a lower priority than in a
             year 12 class
         o loss of internet access during lunchtime computer club would be a lower
             priority than loss of access during an online exam.

(c)   Discuss whether Flynn School should introduce a facial recognition system that
      uses machine learning to analyse each student’s behaviour and give them a
      score that is automatically emailed to their parents.                               [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of implementing the facial recognition system:
      • May provide reassurance to students and parents about their safety while at
        school.
      • May provide useful information to the school that could be used to feedback
        into possible teaching and learning strategies
      • May provide additional supporting evidence if there is a difference of opinions
      • May reduce the need for teachers to have to register students at the start of
        lessons or the beginning/end of each day, ie freeing up staff time
      • May be able to create attendance/lateness reports if necessary.
      • May motivate students to work harder, participate frequently.


      Disadvantages of implementing the facial recognition system:
      • May be seen as intrusive by students and teachers.
      • May be used as part of the management of teachers
      • May not pick up the nuances in student and teacher interaction, for example,
         the context of the behaviour may be important, and this will not be picked up
         by the facial recognition system
      • Will teachers and students “game” the system, so the teaching and learning
         experience may be geared to satisfy the algorithms used in the facial
         recognition software.
      • Cost of implementation – hardware, software.

                   • First testing of new software but done toward the end of the
                     development process.
                   • Main goal is to refine the quality of the product by fixing bugs/problems
                     before they affect the final product.
                   • Generally done in house, ie not by users who don’t work for the
                     company.
                   • Usually done by a group that is not part of the design team.

(b)   (i)    The surgical robot uses machine learning software that utilizes neural
             networks.

             Explain why neural networks are utilized in the machine learning process.    [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Neural networks are adept at analysing images so the movements in
               multiple surgical procedures can be analysed.
             • Neural networks can rearrange the connections between “neurons”, so
               they can change and learn.
             • Neural networks require training before they become useful; the data
               collected during the surgery can be used.
             • Neural networks learn by trial and error, so it can respond to new
               situations and therefore improve practice over time.
             • Machine learning requires the software to learn from experience.

             Award [1] for each statement that explains why neural networks are used in
             the machine learning process up to [3].


      (ii)   Explain why an agile project management methodology would be used in
             the development of the software for a surgical robot.                        [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Changes in software development in this field occur very rapidly.
             • This means that the nature / scope/ direction of the project may change
               quickly.

             • The project management methodology used must be sufficiently
               adaptable to be able to cope with the changes.
             • So the Waterfall project management methodology will not be
               appropriate as there is not allowance.

             • The project is broken down into small tasks
             • This allows teams to work independently and deliver the product faster.

             Award [1] for each statement that explains why an agile project
             management methodology would be used in the development of the
             software for a surgical robot up to [3].

(c)   In 2020, a patient died while undergoing a surgical procedure in which a surgical
      robot was used. A court case followed to determine who was accountable.

      Discuss whether the surgeon, the manufacturer of the surgical robot, or the
      hospital manager should be held accountable.                                         [8]

      Answers may include:

      The surgeon is accountable if:
      • it can be proved that they did not use the robotic tools appropriately
      • they conducted the operation without having completed the required training
        courses
      • they didn’t have enough experience with the robotic equipment.

      The manufacturer of the surgical robot is accountable if:
      • it can be proved that the robot has failed (ie, been unable to complete the task
        that the manufacturer has claimed it is able to do)
      • the robot has been sold to the hospital with claims that it is able to carry out
        tasks it cannot perform
      • parts in the robot have not functioned properly
      • there are errors in the software that created the problem
      • a component of the robot was deemed defective but was not recalled
      • the robot itself has caused an injury, eg unintended cauterizing burns from the
        robot’s cauterizing tool.

      The hospital manager is accountable if:
      • the surgeon has not been given sufficient training to be able to competently
        use the robot
      • the robot has been purchased and used in the hospital without due diligence
      • the system has not been properly maintained
      • something that was critical to the system was not in the patient’s medical
        record at the hospital.

                   • Inference engine
                   • Knowledge base
                   • User interface

                   Award [1] for each component of an expert system up to [2].

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why a prototype of the East Side Vets expert system
                   would have been developed before its release.                                     [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Allows the developers to see potential strengths and weaknesses.
                   • Allows the developers to make changes based on real user interactions.
                   • Allows the developers see failures before it is released.

                   Award [1] for each reason why a prototype was developed up to [2].

           (iii)   The vets have found that many pets have multiple conditions, and they are
                   considering upgrading the expert system to one that uses fuzzy logic.

                   Identify two reasons why the East Side Vets expert system should use
                   fuzzy logic.                                                                      [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Pet’s symptoms are often rather vague and cannot be described as true
                     or false.
                   • Fuzzy logic measures the degree to which a PET OWNERS statement
                     can be correct.
                   • Fuzzy logic can deal with uncertainty.
                   • Mimics how a person would make a decision.

                   Award [1] for each reason why should be used up to [2].

     (b)   (i)                                                                                  .    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Forward chaining starts with the data and uses inference rules to
                     arrive at a goal.
                   • The final goal has not been determined.
                   • This is typical of a pet owner trying to determine whether the pet
                     needs to visit the vet.

                   Award [1] for each distinct part of an explanation of why forward chaining
                   would be used in the expert system up to [2].

(c)   To what extent does the use of the expert system by East Side Vets provide
      benefits for both the vets and their customers?                                        [8]

      Answers may include:


      •   The range of animals seen at the vets is small, so the expert system should
          save staff wasting time by answering the same questions.
      •   Reduces the number of appointments that may need to be made, so saving
          time that will allow office staff to deal with other issues.
      •   Provides initial information so vet can prepare for the visit.
      •   Allows the vet to prioritize treatment of animals based on the information
          provided by the expert system.


      •   Buying the software may be an unnecessary expense, especially if the vet
          practice is small.
      •   May need to invest in training for staff and troubleshooting if the expert
          system provides inaccurate information.
      •   Is the expert system necessary?
      •   May be seen by pet owners as having a less human approach.


      •   Provides an instant response.
      •   Saves time and money if the pet does not need to see the vet.
      •   If the pet needs treatment, it should get it faster, as the expert system will
          have already prioritized the case.


      •   May not trust the expert system, or may still want to see the vet after the
          output suggests otherwise.
      •   Removes the option of asking questions of the vet or the assistant.
      •   If the system is incorrect, their pet could suffer.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
