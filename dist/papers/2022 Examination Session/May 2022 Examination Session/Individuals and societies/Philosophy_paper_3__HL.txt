Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

Compare and contrast the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the text below, with your
own experience and understanding of what is involved in doing philosophy [25 marks].

          The type of critical conceptual enquiry with which we are familiar in traditional philosophy is
          not confined to “academic” philosophy. It can be directed to “existential” questions – questions
          concerned with life in its personal dimension. Here philosophy requires some of the qualities
          and experiences which enable a novelist or poet to have something to say, and its work can
     5    contribute to our understanding of just those matters on which they speak.

          Philosophical reflection can bring one new insight in connection with certain questions about
          life and this may overlap with what one learns from works in literature. However, there is still a
          difference between what one learns from philosophy and literature, that is from meeting them
          in the course of one’s engagements, so that they challenge one’s very being. What makes a
    10    difference to one’s thinking may often fail to make an impact on one’s mode of being.

          In reading philosophy and literature, one is removed from what challenges one’s being directly.
          Despite this, however, it is still possible for philosophy to clear up certain confusions and
          misconceptions and so leave one freer to face certain things in life differently. A student doing
          philosophy told me that the thought that selfishness is inescapable in one’s actions had
    15    troubled her personally and held her back from taking an active interest in other people’s needs.
          She apparently found relief and release in coming to see the mistaken belief in her thinking.
          Certainly, philosophy can make a person receptive to ideas they have rejected and these ideas
          may in time come to change their life. But when they do, they do so by changing the character
          of their engagements.

    20    Perhaps more importantly, however, one needs to make a distinction between what one may
          gain from the pursuit of particular philosophical questions and what one gains from the pursuit
          of truth in philosophy. Although, this can only be pursued through the discussion of particular
          philosophical questions. As far as any particular philosophical question goes, what one gains
          from its pursuit is by and large confined to one’s understanding – except in so far as coming
    25    to a new understanding involves the giving up of cherished positions. But the transformation
          that comes from a serious dedication to philosophy, given the character of its questions, may
          amount to a spiritual reorientation – as Socrates tells us it did for him. Such transformation is
          more than a change in the philosopher’s understanding, confined to his thinking; it is a change
          in him, in his mode of existence and, therefore in his very being.

    30    We must remember, however, that such dedication to the pursuit of philosophy is itself a form of
          engagement. I mean an engagement of the person as a whole, not merely of his intellect. To put
          it differently, an engagement with life as opposed to with objects of thought. One can compare
          it with dedicating one’s life to the service of others. In this sense philosophy is, if you wish, a
          form of marriage, and so it should not be surprising if it changes the life and perspective of the
    35    person who takes it seriously, including his perspective on his own personal problems. And this,
          indeed, would constitute a change in these problems themselves and thus a change in the person
          who takes philosophy seriously.
