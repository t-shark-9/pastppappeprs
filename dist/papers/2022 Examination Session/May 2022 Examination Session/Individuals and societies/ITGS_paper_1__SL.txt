Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Medical data shared in online apps

     Many people use smartwatches to monitor their vital signs and manage their health.
     Information such as heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature can be obtained from
     an app* like yourHealth on a smartwatch.

     Some users of the smartwatch app are concerned that their privacy might be invaded.



* app: small specialized program run on mobile devices, the internet, a computer or
  other electronic device

     (a)   (i)     Define the term privacy.                                                             [2]

           (ii)    Identify two ways the smartwatch and cellphone (mobile phone) could use to
                   communicate with each other.                                                         [2]

           The uniform resource locator (URL) for the smartwatch app in Figure 1 is
           https://www.yourhealthwatch.com/2020/03/export-data-yourhealth-watch-health-app.html.

           (iii)   State the domain name.                                                               [1]

           (iv)    State the protocol used in the URL.                                                  [1]

(Question 1 continued)

     (b)   (i)	The team developing the smartwatch app followed the project development life
                cycle (PDLC).

                  Explain why end-users should be involved in the development of products such
                  as the smartwatch app.                                                                [3]

           (ii)   Explain why a feasibility study would be used in the development of products
                  such as the smartwatch app.                                                           [3]

     (c)   Many people use smartwatches to monitor their vital signs and manage their health.

           To what extent should an individual use a smartwatch to manage their health?                 [8]




                                                                                                 Turn over

2.      Investigation of ocean disasters
        A system called the Marine Accident Data Analysis Suite (MADAS) uses data collected from
        marine accidents to create a simulation to help understand what has happened (see Figure 2).

        Cruise ships are required to carry a voyage data recorder (VDR), which uses sensors to
        monitor the conditions in the ship at all times. The data from the sensors is collected and
        input into a relational database (see Figure 3) that is a part of the MADAS system (see Figure 4).

           (ii)    State the primary key in the Ship table in Figure 3.[1]

           (iii)   State the relationship between the Ship table and Accident table in Figure 3.[1]

           (ii)    The MADAS system uses data visualization.

                   Explain why data visualization is used by the MADAS system.                      [4]

     (c)   To what extent can the use of simulations like the MADAS system help prevent
           future accidents?                                                                        [8]

3.   Schools told not to use cloud computing software applications

     Schools in the German state of Hesse will no longer be able to use cloud computing services
     and software applications, such as G Suite and Office 365, due to new data protection rules.
     This has led to the risk of schools’ data being accessed by governments from other countries.

     In contrast, many schools in other parts of the world use cloud computing services and
     software applications. These applications allow students to access software that was
     previously only installed on their computers.

     (a)   (i)	Identify two types of cloud computing software applications that students might
                use at school.                                                                             [2]

           (ii)    If the schools in Hesse can no longer use cloud computing software applications,
                   they will need to store their data on a local file server and access it through a
                   local area network (LAN).

                   Identify two ways in which data could be secured if the school stored it locally.       [2]

           (iii)   The change from cloud computing software applications may require the school
                   to change the type of licence they need to purchase.

                   Identify two types of licence that the school could purchase to allow them to
                   install and run software applications on their local area network (LAN).                [2]

     (b)   The European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs
           data protection and privacy in the EU. Its regulations give users certain rights in terms
           of their data.

           Explain three principles that should be included in data protection regulations such
           as GDPR.                                                                                        [6]

     (c)   A new school has opened in Switzerland and its IT Manager is considering two options:

           Option 1: Using a local client–server network.

           Option 2: Using a cloud-based service.

           Evaluate the implications of these two options for the IT Manager.                              [8]

4.   China’s social credit scheme

     The Chinese government is proposing a social credit scheme that will reward its citizens with
     points for what it considers to be good behaviour. This can be done by monitoring citizens’
     social media connections, purchasing history and location data.

     CCTV cameras are widely used in China and there are concerns that facial recognition
     technology is already being utilized by the government to detect “good” and “bad” behaviours
     of its citizens. The facial recognition system requires high-resolution images.

     (a)   (i)     Define the term resolution.[2]

           (ii)    Identify two types of image file.                                                   [2]

           (iii)   Distinguish between authentication and authorization.                               [2]

     (b)   (i)	Other governments are considering setting up similar systems that will use facial
                recognition to gather information about the behaviour of its citizens.

                   Explain why the development of a requirements specification is important in the
                   development of a new facial recognition system.                                     [3]

           (ii)    Explain why using high-resolution images could be a challenge to the
