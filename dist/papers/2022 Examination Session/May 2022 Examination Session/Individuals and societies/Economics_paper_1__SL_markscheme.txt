Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Governments intervene in markets to support firms and to promote equity.
             Explain one policy that could be used to support firms and one policy that could
             be used to promote equity.                                                               [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: government intervention, market, equity
             • Explanation: of any one policy to support firms, such as a subsidy, a minimum
               price (price floor) or trade protection and any one policy to promote equity,
               such as a maximum price (price ceiling), direct government provision of
               services or subsidy, progressive taxation (labour market)
             • Diagram: any relevant diagram illustrating the particular policy being
               explained.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one policy/objective is addressed.

      imposing an indirect tax on a particular good.                                       [15]

      Answers may include:

        government and society as a whole

        allocation and allocative efficiency, whether the tax is specific or ad valorem,

      • Examples: use of real-world examples to show instances of indirect taxes
        being imposed on goods.

2.     (a)   Explain how the use of supply-side policies might encourage greater domestic
             competition and improve the international competitiveness of a country.                  [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: supply-side policies, international competitiveness, competition
             • Explanation: of how the use of market-based supply-side policies such as
               privatization, deregulation, trade liberalization and anti-monopoly legislation
               and interventionist supply-side policies such as government spending on
               education and training, R&D and infrastructure might encourage greater
               competition; an explanation that international competitiveness may be
               improved as a result of the LRAS increasing and lowering the rate of
               inflation/the price level, hence making exports relatively cheaper
             • Diagram: an AD/AS diagram showing a rightward shift of LRAS.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only one of the two goals in the question
             item is addressed.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the view that the use of interventionist
      supply-side policies is the most effective way of reducing a country’s rate of
      unemployment.                                                                      [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: interventionist supply-side policies, unemployment
      • Explanation: of the view in terms of the successful implementation of
        interventionist supply-side policies increasing the productive capacity of the
        economy, increasing the demand for labour in the long run and thus lowering
        the level of unemployment; such policies are also likely to increase AD
      • Diagram: an AD/AS diagram to show LRAS being shifted to the right and/or
        AD shifting right
      • Synthesis (evaluate): the supply-side policy applied depends on the type of
        unemployment, the limitations of using interventionist supply-side policy in
        reducing unemployment; interventionist policies compared with market-based
        supply-side policies; the potential benefits of alternative policies such as
        monetary and fiscal policies; consideration of “most effective”; overall
        assessment
      • Examples: real-world examples of where governments have attempted to
        reduce unemployment using interventionist supply-side policies and/or other
        policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

      As the question requires an evaluation of the “most effective way”, a maximum of
      [12] should be awarded where no other policies are considered, as the question
      wouldn’t be fully addressed. For [13] or more the synthesis and evaluation must
      be effective and balanced and there must at least be some mention of alternative
      policies.

      country’s economic growth and economic development.                                [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: economic barriers, economic growth, economic development
      • Explanation: of how economic barriers such as increasing economic
        inequality, lack of access to infrastructure and appropriate technology, low
        levels of human capital, overdependence on primary sector, lack of access to
        international markets, informal economy, capital flight, indebtedness,

        a barrier to growth and development; the relative importance of economic
        barriers as compared to political/social barriers; overall assessment
      • Examples: real-world examples of countries that have experienced economic
        barriers to growth and development.

      Examiners should be flexible in the interpretation of the difference between

   1–3     • The response indicates little understanding of the specific demands of the question.
           • Economic theory is stated but it is not relevant
           • Economic terms are stated but they are not relevant.
           • The response contains no evidence of synthesis or evaluation.
           • A real-world example(s) is identified but it is irrelevant.

   4–6     • The response indicates some understanding of the specific demands of the question.
           • Relevant economic theory is described.
           • Some relevant economic terms are included.
           • The response contains evidence of superficial synthesis or evaluation.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified.

   7–9     • The response indicates understanding of the specific demands of the question,
             but these demands are only partially addressed.
           • Relevant economic theory is partly explained.
           • Some relevant economic terms are used appropriately.
           • Where appropriate, relevant diagram(s) are included.
           • The response contains evidence of appropriate synthesis or evaluation but
             lacks balance.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified and partly developed in the context of

           • Relevant economic theory is explained.
           • Relevant economic terms are used mostly appropriately.
           • Where appropriate, relevant diagram(s) are included and explained.

           • The response contains evidence of effective and balanced synthesis or evaluation.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified and fully developed to support
             the argument.
