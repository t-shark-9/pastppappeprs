The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of
responses we may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible
answers should be appropriately rewarded if relevant.

1.       Define the term ethnocentrism and describe how it is understood and applied in the
         context of the passage.                                                                      [4]

         This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and
         understanding of the term “ethnocentrism” and apply it in relation to the text.
         Candidates may write in terms of any of the following guidelines, but other definitions or
         applications will also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the passage.

         Possible ways of defining the term:
         • The tendency to view the world only from the perspective of one’s own culture; the
           inability to understand cultures different from one’s own.
         • A cultural bias.
         • As a perception, a judgment or an interpretation linked to socialization.

         Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

         Possible examples of description and application:
         • Analysis of the quote by the Syrian man.
         • No recognition of the asylum seekers’ cultural identity.
         • The need for the asylum seekers to demonstrate their moral worth.
         • The Swiss hosts’ expectation that refugees must behave as submissive and humble
           guests.
         • Grouping as a form of hierarchical categorization based on the host nation’s
           perspective and interests.

         Other appropriate applications should be credited.

     1–2     The response demonstrates a basic knowledge and understanding of the concept.

             There is a partial application of the concept in relation to the text.

     3–4     The response demonstrates sound knowledge and understanding of the concept; the
             concept is described in detail.

             The concept is clearly applied in relation to the text.
                                                     –4–                 M22/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.       Analyse the ethnographic data presented in the passage using the concept of identity.        [6]

         This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
         ethnographic text using the key concept of identity to help make sense of the
         ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
         understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the
         context of the passage, developing an analysis with reference to the ethnographic data
         of the extract.

         Possible ways of defining the key concept:
         • The individual’s private and personal view of the self
         • How an individual is viewed from the perspective of a social group
         • With reference to group identity (religious, ethnic, national, etc).

         Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

         Possible examples and ways of analysing:
         • The stigmatized identity implicit in the quote from the Syrian man.
         • The ambiguous identity of the people who remain in a liminal state.
         • The state power to classify and create social identities within hierarchical
           categorizations.
         • The processes of degradation of personal, professional and religious/ethnic identity.
         • The reconfiguration of personal and social identity.
         • Refugees seen as a threat to national identity.
         • Essentialized views of identity as political strategy of the nation-state.

         Other appropriate examples and ways of analyzing should be credited.

 Marks Level descriptor

     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


     1–2     The response offers a common-sense or superficial understanding of the key concept.

             There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some ethnographic
             examples are presented but these are only partially relevant.

     3–4     The response demonstrates an understanding of the key concept and establishes its
             relevance to the text.

             There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are some
             inconsistencies.

             Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the analysis.

     5–6     The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept, discussing this
             in the context of the text.

             There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a detailed
             interpretation of the ethnographic data.

             Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.
                                                 –5–                M22/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Compare and contrast the ways in which the key concept of change or symbolism is
     evident in this passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you
     have studied.                                                                             [10]

     Candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other
     contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must
     demonstrate an understanding of how either the key concept of change or symbolism
     relates to this ethnographic context. Either of the key concepts on which such
     comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any
     anthropological issues raised by the text.

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates
     should be able to establish a relevant comparison with any other group or society
     based on either of these concepts. The response should be structured as a
     comparison, highlighting similarities and differences. Candidates must situate the
     comparative case in terms of place, author and fieldwork context.

     For change, possible ways of defining the key concept include:
     • The alteration or modification of cultural or social elements in a society.
     • Change may be due to internal dynamics within a society, or the result of contact
       with another culture, or a consequence of globalization.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples from the text about change may include:
     • Society and structures as dynamic.
     • Rite as integral to an understanding of the dynamics of the social transformations.
     • A focus on a global and national crisis.
     • Changes in personal and social statuses and experiences, or reconfiguration of
       personal and social identities.
     • The relevance of ritual to understand other processes integral to human life not
       recognized as ritual.
     • The notion of the liminal as a complex process of contradictory and internally
       negating properties, outside space and time.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

     For symbolism, possible ways of defining the key concept include:
     • The study of cultural symbols and their meanings.
     • How social actors construct webs of meanings by which they understand social
       reality.
     • The significance that people attach to objects, actions, etc.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

         Possible examples from the text about symbolism may include:
         • The asylum seekers’ social experiences and status as liminal.
         • Time and waiting as an aspect of liminality.
         • The centre as a liminal space.
         • The jobs of asylum seekers.
         • The distinction refugee/economic immigrant.
         • Forms of degradation as part of the reconfiguration of their new identity as refugees.
         • Classifications, hierarchization and dichotomization.

         Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

4.       Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in
         this passage to the approaches to research used by one other anthropologist you have
         studied. Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.                 [10]

         Here, candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis
         on the methodological perspectives of the ethnographer as the focus on which such
         comparisons should be established.

         By “approaches to research” the question essentially refers to the research methods
         used by the anthropologist to gather data.

         Possible comparative examples regarding approaches may include:
         • Participant observation: the description of the refugee processing centre.
         • Informal/ethnographic interview: quotes from the informants’ narratives.
         • Interviews with employees (NGOs, etc).
         • Secondary sources: statistics, official documents, etc.
         • Other relevant methodological terms and discussions. For example: qualitative
           methods; life-history; insider/outsider; local categories/analytical categories;
           positionality; representation.
         • The ethnographer’s process-oriented approach in which the structuring of social
           relations and personal positioning are subject to shifts.

         Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

Identification of ethnographic material includes: fieldwork location(s), fieldwork
context(s)*, group(s) studied, and ethnographer(s).

*fieldwork context refers to when the fieldwork was carried out regardless of the publication
date of the material.

  3–4    Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented and although this is in limited
         detail, its relevance is established.

         The response is structured as a compare and contrast, but this is not balanced and
         lacks detail.

         The identification of ethnographic material is partially complete.

  5–6    Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is established and
         explained.

         The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast; however, either comparison
         (similarities) or contrasts (differences) are explained in detail, but not both.

         The identification of ethnographic material is mostly complete.

  7–8    Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is clearly
         established and explained in detail.

         The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast with comparisons
         (similarities) and contrasts (differences) being discussed in detail, although this is not
         balanced.

         The response demonstrates anthropological understanding.

         The identification of ethnographic material is mostly complete.

Capped If fieldwork location(s), fieldwork context, group(s) studied and ethnographer(s) have
 marks not been fully identified, no more than 8 marks will be awarded.

 9–10    Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is clearly
         established and discussed in detail.

         The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast with comparisons
         (similarities) and contrasts (differences) discussed critically.

         The response demonstrates anthropological understanding.

         The identification of ethnographic material is complete.
