 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   “Changes in travel and transportation had little impact.” Discuss, with reference to two societies.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that changes in travel and transportation had little impact. The two societies may or may not come
     from the same region. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised by the question. Candidates may offer equal treatment of travel and transportation, or
     they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
     question. There may be discussion of the impact of increasing European river transport which
     helped to link growing urban centres; the increasing use of junks in the Far East, and the
     sophisticated maritime culture of the Chinchas in Peru, all of which boosted trade; the increasing
     exploitation of camels’ endurance opened up trans-Saharan markets. It may be argued that limited
     technological change restricted impact, which was less than in subsequent eras. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the reasons for the spread of religion in two societies, each chosen from a different
     region.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationships between the various reasons
     for the spread of religion in two societies, which must be from different regions. Reasons may
     predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. There
     may be an examination of the roles of various rulers, for example Byzantine Emperor Michael III, in
     building on the work of earlier missionaries to Serbia and Bulgaria; or of the roles of Viking kings,
     such as Harald Bluetooth in Scandinavia. There may be an examination of the role of bad harvests
     and natural disasters in promoting the spread of religion in, for example, Mochica society. The
     spread of Islam in the ‘Abbasid kingdoms as a result of the intellectual flowering of the Islamic
     Golden Age may be examined, while trade played a vital role in spreading Islam to East Africa.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                 –5–                 M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   Evaluate the significance of leaders to the outcomes of two wars in the period 750–1500, each
     chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of leaders to the
     outcome of two wars in the period 750–1500, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two
     wars must be from different regions, but the leaders may or may not be from the same region.
     Candidates may evaluate the leader’s personal characteristics and how these contributed in a
     positive or negative manner to the outcome of the war, for example Henry V’s courage and
     decisiveness in battle. Candidates may make an appraisal of the ability of the leaders to recognize
     able generals and follow their military advice, as done by Genghis Khan with Subutai and Jebe.
     Conversely, candidates may evaluate their willingness to follow ill-fated counsel such as Zhu
     Qizhen’s readiness to enact Wang Zhen’s advice before the Battle of Tumu, which resulted in his
     capture. Candidates may also evaluate tactical decisions made by leaders to gain an advantage
     over their enemies, for example Saladin’s selection of battlefields for the battle of Hattin. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example technological advances or alliances, but with a
     focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   With reference to two wars in the period 750–1500, to what extent was economic change the most
     significant effect of war?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     economic change was the most significant effect of war. The two wars may or may not be from the
     same region. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may choose to focus on the negative economic effects of
     wars. They may consider the direct or indirect financial costs involved in waging a war. Similarly,
     they may discuss the impact of population decline or damage to resources, as caused by
     Tamerlane in Georgia. Conversely, candidates may focus on the economic benefits to victors.
     These may include control of conquered territories and their resources. Other appropriate
     examples may include access to tributes, such as yizia imposed by Harun al-Rashid, or ransom
     such as the one paid by King John II of France. Candidates may also choose to discuss the
     benefits of an increase in trade. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example social,
     religious and cultural changes, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Compare and contrast the methods used by two rulers to maintain their rule.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two rulers in terms of the methods used to maintain their rule, referring to both throughout. There
     does not need to be an equal number of each. The two rulers may or may not be from the same
     region. Candidates may refer to the steps taken by rulers to achieve a unified empire by
     establishing a common legal system, as done by Mongol use of the Yassa code; or by establishing
     an efficient bureaucratic system as done by the Song dynasty. Other appropriate examples may
     include steps taken to address economic or social distress via monetary reforms, as done by
     Charlemagne via the introduction of livre carolienne and price controls. Additional factors may
     include the creation of a loyal army and their role in the subjugation of rebellious groups, as in the
     case of Abd al-Rahman who had to contend with challenges by the Muwallads or the insurgency
     of Umar ibn Hafsun.


6.   “Effective government depended on the nobility and the elite.” Discuss with reference to two rulers,
     each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that effective government depended on the nobility and the elite. The statement must be discussed
     with reference to two rulers from different regions. Candidates may discuss the significance of
     nobility and the elite, and consider whether they performed essential administrative tasks, served
     as figureheads, or were separate from the system altogether. Candidates may point out that in
     kingdoms that lacked a centralized government the nobility and elite served an important role as
     administrators, whose power derived from the ruler, as done by the Farbas in the Mali Kingdom.
     Similarly, feudal lords upheld the law in manor courts and fulfilled a role in the defence of the
     kingdom through the obligation to provide soldiers or financial resources in case of need.
     Candidates may also discuss the changing role of the nobility and the elite. They may provide
     examples where cooperation turned to challenge, as in the case of the Kamakura Shogunate in
     Japan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –7–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Examine the impact of merchants and travellers on developments in trade during the period 1400–
     1700.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between merchants and
     travellers and the developments in trade. The examples chosen may or may not come from the
     same region and the impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may examine the expansion of trade in the Spanish or
     Portuguese Empires resulting from the voyages of Christopher Columbus and Vasco da Gama.
     Alternatively, the impact of Christian missionaries and Dutch merchants on trade with the
     Japanese Shogunate may be examined. The voyages of Admiral Zheng may be examined with the
     proviso that their long-term impact was limited when the Hongxi Emperor decided to restrict
     external trading links. Candidates may examine the interrelationship between merchants and
     travellers and the state that may have sponsored their journeys and may or may not have
     responded positively to new trading opportunities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   "Religious discrimination and persecution were the main cause of religious change.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that religious discrimination and persecution were the main cause of religious change. The
     examples chosen may or may not be from a different region and the causes outlined may predate
     or extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may discuss discrimination against and persecution of Jews during the Reconquista
     period in Spain. Although, initially, this led to the conversion of many to Christianity, persecution
     continued limiting change. Similarly, the persecution of native populations in the Spanish Empire
     may be argued to have led to religious change. Other appropriate examples may include the
     spread of Islam in India during the Mughal Empire and the conversion, as well as persecution, of
     Christians in Shogunate Japan. Other relevant factors may be addressed, such as the spread of
     literacy and the availability of printed texts as well as wars, which may have brought religious
     change in their wake. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    “Rulers rarely achieved their ambitions.” Discuss, with reference to two rulers, each chosen from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that rulers rarely achieved their ambitions. The two rulers must be from different regions. The
      period of rule may predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but the discussion must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. The failure of George III of England to retain the 13
      colonies may be discussed as an example of thwarted ambition. It may be argued that the
      achievements of Suleiman the Magnificent did equal his ambitions although he died before
      reaching the gates of Vienna. It may be argued that the achievements of Elizabeth I of England
      kept pace with her ambition to retain control over the throne and to secure the Tudor legacy.
      Despite the cost of his military campaigns, the expansion of territory under the control of the
      Kiangsi Emperor of the Ming dynasty in China may also be used to refute the statement.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


10.   “Issues of succession were the main cause of internal conflict.” With reference to two states, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that issues
      of succession were the main cause of internal conflict. The two states may or may not be from the
      same region. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may discuss problems arising from the succession of minors
      and the role of regents, for example in the Togukawa Shogunate, or Philip Duke of Orleans’s
      regency in France. Succession might have been combined with religious conflict, for example
      between Shah Jahan’s sons in the Mughal Empire, or in late 17th century England. Conversely
      there may be discussion of states where laws and traditions enabled succession without
      confrontation, such as Portugal or the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, tensions between modernizers and conservatives in Russia, or between
      Cuzco elite families in the Inca Empire. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Examine the impact of technological developments on the practice of war.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between technological
      developments and the practice of war. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Although specific wars may be discussed, this is
      not a requirement and candidates may refer more broadly to technological developments.
      Candidates may examine the impact of gunpowder, which rendered cavalry and other troops
      vulnerable to muskets and light cannon. New firearms technology was decisive in wars against the
      Delhi sultanate and the Sur dynasty, in the Ethiopian–Adal War and in wars between the Ottomans
      and the Mamluks and Hungarians. Because firing flintlock muskets required little skill, huge
      firearms formations were enabled which needed massive logistical support. Siege warfare became
      more common in, for example, the Thirty Years’ War, the Dutch Revolt and Ireland. Fortifications,
      with low, sloping walls, were developed. Candidates may examine naval warfare where, after initial
      broadsides from modern cannon, hand-to-hand combat still prevailed. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Discuss the successes and failures of peacemaking after two wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the successes
      and failures of peacemaking. The two wars may or may not be from the same region. Successes
      and failures may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised
      in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of successes and failures, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Successes could include the establishment of pe,aceful relations between native American tribes
      and the French by the Great Peace of Montreal (1701) and the lasting peace between Russia and
      China achieved by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689). In contrast, the unequal Burmese–Siamese
      Treaty (1549) proved to be only a temporary halt to hostilities, which lasted intermittently for 300
      years. There may be discussion of the great European treaties of the period, Cateau-Cambresis
      (1559) and Utrecht (1713), whose successes and failures could, perhaps, best be judged through
      the eyes of the protagonists. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                     – 10 –                M22/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   To what extent was political stability the main factor which enabled industrialization in two
      countries?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      political stability was the main factor which enabled industrialization in two countries. The two
      countries may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may consider the extent by which
      political stability facilitated industrialization by providing capitalists with a reasonable certainty that
      resources invested were safe from the risk of political upheaval. An appropriate example may
      include England after the Glorious Revolution, where funds were injected into an increasingly
      sophisticated finance system, enabling investment in industrialization. Additionally, political stability
      may have provided the opportunity to design and implement long-term programmes that support
      industrialization, such as Witte's reforms in Russia in the 1890s or Park’s export-led model in
      Korea in the 1960s. Candidates may also wish to consider how politically stable countries may
      become attractive to foreign investors and benefit from the insertion of foreign capital, for instance
      the introduction of Maquiladoras in Mexico. Other relevant factors that enabled industrialization
      may be addressed, for example the availability of human and natural resources and infrastructure,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   “Developments in transportation were key to industrialization.” Discuss with reference to two
      countries, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that developments in transportation were key to industrialization. The two countries must be from
      different regions. Candidates may discuss the contribution of improved road surface to
      transportation. “Macadam” roads or the Turnpike Trust provide appropriate examples of
      development that made the movement of goods safer and more reliable. Candidates may also
      wish to review the contribution of cheaper forms of transport, such as steamship or steam
      locomotive, to lowering the price of goods, thereby increasing demand and sustaining
      industrialization. Similarly, candidates may wish to discuss the role of railway developments in
      allowing settlements and factories to develop in new areas, further increasing the movement of
      goods and people. The role of key developments in long-distance transportation may also provide
      material for discussion. Global trade facilitated the movement of raw material, gave access to
      cheaper labour in less developed countries such as Mexico or India, and aided expansion into
      foreign markets after the saturation of local ones. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Discuss the importance of race to the origins and rise of independence movements in two states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      race to the origins and rise of independence movements. The two states may or may not be from a
      different region. Candidates may discuss causes that predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss
      Zimbabwe/Rhodesia and the spur given to independence by the imposition of the Unilateral
      Declaration of Independence (UDI) that served to entrench racial discrimination in the form of
      apartheid. Similarly, candidates may discuss the emergence of the independence movement in
      India and the impact of events such as the Jallianwala Bagh (Amritsar) massacre, which
      highlighted a disregard for the population, and which may have been racially inspired. Haiti, where
      racial issues were central, is also appropriate, as although the revolution predated the timeframe, it
      achieved independence in 1804. Other relevant factors to be discussed may include the imposition
      of sanctions or the use of force by either the supporters or opponents of independence, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Discuss the responses to challenges faced in the first ten years of one independent state.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the responses to
      challenges faced in the first ten years of one independent state. Responses to be discussed may
      predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may discuss the outbreak of civil war as a response to ethnic divisions in
      post-independent Nigeria. In Indonesia, Sukarno’s use of religious identity to garner support may
      be evaluated, along with the use of force and the imposition of “guided democracy”. The response
      of Dom Pedro I to regional opposition in Brazil may be discussed including, for example, his
      attempts to prevent secession. A discussion of the responses to challenges facing the newly
      independent Czechoslovakia or other Secessionist states post-1918 would also be relevant, as
      would responses within the post-USSR states in Europe or Central Asia. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Examine the significance of leaders in the emergence of two democratic states, each chosen from
      a different region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the significance of
      leaders and the emergence of democratic states. The two states must be from different regions.
      The focus is likely to be on the significance of leaders in terms of ideology, strategy (violent or non-
      violent methods) and political acumen. More than one leader in each of the states may be studied.
      There may be examination of the significance of Cavour and Victor Emmanuel in extending
      democracy from Piedmont into an emerging independent Italy; in Ghana Nkrumah, the spearhead
      of the independence campaign, worked with the British to implement a plan for independence. The
      significance of Gandhi (who transformed the independence struggle into a mass movement) and
      Nehru (who established the principles underpinning the new Indian state and worked with the
      British leading up to independence) in India may be examined. Candidates may examine the
      ideological inspiration and martyrdom of Marti in Cuba. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Examine the impact of democracy on the culture of two democratic states.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between democracy and
      culture in two democratic states. The two states may or may not be from the same region.
      Candidates may examine the culture of Weimar Germany and the coinciding of a period of radical
      experimentation in the arts with the introduction of a fully democratic state. In Japan, the expansion
      of democratic institutions during the 1920s led to an increased openness to Western fashions and
      culture. Candidates may argue that during the early years of Nasser’s presidency in Egypt there
      was a flourishing film industry that reflected changes to the role of women. Other interrelationships
      may be considered, such as the reduction of the voting age in some states impacting media
      content or the perceived need to educate the newly enfranchised impacting, for example, the
      policies of the BBC during the 1930s. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   “Weak political systems were the most significant factor in the emergence of authoritarian states.”
      Discuss with reference to two states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that weak political systems were the most significant factor in the emergence of authoritarian
      states. Candidates may identify weak political systems as those that lacked political stability and
      resulted in continuous changes. They may discuss governments that failed to reach consensus
      and gain permanency, thus preventing the implementation of policies. This scenario may have
      driven politicians to focus on negotiating alliances instead of addressing social or economic
      problems, causing further discontent. Appropriate examples may include Liberal Italy, the Second
      Republic in Spain, and Weimar Germany. Weak political systems may also be identified as those
      manipulated to preserve a corrupt government in place. Candidates may discuss governments that
      exhibited widespread corruption, such as Batista’s or Farouk’s, and whether this may have resulted
      in the emergence of contenders for power. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      economic factors, social division, and the impact of war, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the impact of social policies in two authoritarian states.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of social policies, weighing up their
      strengths and limitations/importance or otherwise. Candidates may wish to discuss what is meant
      by impact. In this respect, they may choose to focus on overall results, or the extent to which policy
      aims were achieved. Candidates may evaluate policies that were widely implemented, such as
      healthcare in Cuba where infant mortality rate decreased from 87/1000 in 1960 to 18.5/1000 by
      1981. Conversely, candidates may wish to discuss social reforms with partial impact. For example,
      China’s 1954 constitution recognized men and women as equal, and reforms proved successful in
      inserting women into the labour force. However, women had to shoulder domestic chores, and
      failed to gain equal political representation. Candidates may also comment on the difficulty of
      assessing the impact of social policies, such as the promotion of state atheism, where sectors of
      the population may have conformed rather than commit to the ideology. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   Compare and contrast the long-term causes of two wars.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the long-term causes of two wars, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal
      number of each. The two wars may or may not be chosen from the same region. Causes may
      predate or extend beyond the timeframe, but must be clearly linked to twentieth century war. It
      should be noted that different theatres of war in either the First World War or the Second World
      War may not be considered as two separate wars. Even so, both world wars will be popular
      choices and candidates may compare and contrast factors such as nationalism, expansionist
      policies and ideologies that may have caused one or both wars. Other relevant examples would be
      the Korean War with long-term causes dating back to the end of the Second World War or the
      Algerian War of Independence with long-term causes dating back beyond the First World War. A
      comparison of the long-term causes of the Spanish Civil War or the Chinese Civil War would also
      be appropriate.


22.   Examine the impact of foreign powers on the outcome of two civil wars.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the impact of foreign
      powers and the outcome of two civil wars. The wars may or may not be chosen from different
      regions. The outcome of one or both wars may extend beyond the timeframe, but must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the involvement of Italy,
      Germany and the USSR in the Spanish Civil War and evaluate how far this impacted the outcome.
      The involvement of the UN forces and China during the Korean War and their impact on the
      outcome may be examined. An examination of the impact of the UN and of neighbouring states
      such as Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the outcome of the Rwandan Civil
      War would be appropriate, as would an examination of the impact of NATO, Serbia and Croatia on
      the outcome of the Bosnian War. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “Fear, rather than aggression, was the main cause of superpower rivalry between 1943 and 1949.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that fear,
      rather than aggression, was the main cause of superpower rivalry between 1943 and 1949.
      Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. There may be discussion of Stalin’s fear of a reunited, revived Germany, as being partly
      responsible for the Berlin Blockade. Russian fears of US expansion into Europe were also
      heightened by the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. US fears may have been stoked by
      Kennan’s Long Telegram, which greatly influenced American diplomacy. Russian actions in
      Eastern Europe, which were arguably in contravention of promises made at Yalta, were regarded
      by the US as aggressive; however, the USSR was shattered by war, and arguably more motivated
      by fear. There may be discussion of the impact of the US lead in nuclear weaponry and the failure
      of the Baruch Plan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


24.   Examine the economic impact of the Cold War on two countries, each chosen from a different
      region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Cold War and the
      economies of two countries. The two countries must be from different regions. Candidates may
      refer to economies before the timeframe, but only in order to place change during the Cold War in
      context. There may be examination of the impact of defence spending in the US, which brought
      economic boom to some states, and a rise in the budget deficit in the 1980s. Examination of the
      impact on the Russian economy may focus on the arms race, which may have partly caused the
      USSR’s collapse. Cold War fears may have influenced the American economic reconstruction of
      Japan, and the trade embargo on Cuba, which, turned to the USSR for subsidies. Cold War
      tensions may have prompted Russian investment in the developing world, for example in India and
      Egypt, and policy towards the economies of the Soviet bloc. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
