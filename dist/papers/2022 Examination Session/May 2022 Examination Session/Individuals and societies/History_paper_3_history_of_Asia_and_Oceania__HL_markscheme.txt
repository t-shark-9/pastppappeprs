Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   “The Mongol Empire was the main reason for the increase in trade along the Silk Road.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the Mongol Empire was the main reason for the increase in trade along the Silk Road.
     Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may discuss the expansion of the Mongol Empire from Asia into Europe,
     thereby creating a single political entity which made communication and trade easier. In addition,
     the relative peace of the Pax Mongolica improved the safety of travellers and traders, while the
     building and maintenance of infrastructure – like roads and forts for garrisons – also facilitated
     increased trade. The establishment of Samarkand as Tamerlane’s capital, with his focus upon the
     arts and exchange, was a further factor. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
     push from European city-states like Genoa and Venice (the expedition of Marco Polo, most
     famously), but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   To what extent was cultural interaction and exchange the most important consequence of the Silk
     Road?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     cultural interaction and exchange was the most important consequence of the Silk Road.
     Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of cultural interaction and exchange
     and another relevant consequence (for example, economic), or they may prioritize their
     assessment of one or the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may refer to examples of exchange that occurred. For art, examples could include the
     adoption of Persian styles and Indian ikat by Tang weavers, or the Chinese influence on Iraqi
     miniaturists. For religion, candidates may discuss the example of Islam, which used the Silk Road
     as a conduit for its beliefs and practitioners, or Buddhism, which spread both its doctrine and
     religious art along the route. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
     transportation of disease (the Black Death, most infamously) along the Silk Road, but with a focus
     on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Examine the causes and the consequences of the Gempei War (1180–1185).

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the causes and
     consequences of the Gempei War. Causes and consequences may predate and extend beyond
     the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     offer equal coverage of causes and consequences, or they may prioritize their examination of one
     over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may examine
     the long-term rivalry of the Taira and Minamoto clans over dominance of the imperial court,
     contributing to the outbreak of war. In addition, candidates may examine the coup d’état conducted
     by the Taira. Regarding consequences, the victorious Minamoto no Yoritomo established the
     Kamakura Shogunate. Prior to the Gempei War, power had rested in the hands of the emperor;
     now power rested with a military dictatorship. Yoritomo’s taking of the title Shogun established the
     Shogunate as the chief power in Japan until the Meiji restoration. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “The samurai had a significant impact on Japanese society and culture.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the samurai had a significant impact on Japanese society and culture. Consequences may
     extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may discuss the establishment of the feudal relationship between “lord” and “servant”
     as the samurai became the ruling class of Japan. Samurai practices became part of Japanese
     cultural practice, based upon the concept of bushido, which was only codified in the 17th century.
     Candidates may discuss the cruelty in war which is well attested in this period, despite later
     depictions of samurai honour. As samurai developed into the lords of the new feudal system, more
     leisure time was available for the development of scholarly pursuits, but the extent to which these
     practices trickled down to other sections of Japanese society is debatable. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –6–                 M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Evaluate the impact on Japan of contact with Europeans.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact on Japan of contact with
     Europeans, weighing up its importance or otherwise. Consequences may extend beyond the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     evaluate a range of cultural and technological impacts. These include the introduction of
     arquebuses and steel cuirasses by the Portuguese, which contributed to the unification of the
     country under Hideyoshi and Ieyasu. The development of Japanese “red seal ships”, incorporating
     elements of European galleon design, helped the growth of Japanese trade with South-East Asia.
     There may be evaluation of the introduction of aspects of European cuisine (e.g. tempura by the
     Portuguese) which became staples of Japanese cuisine. In addition, the introduction of Christianity
     to the islands of Japan led to the conversion of a significant number. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Compare and contrast the reasons for expeditions to South-East Asia by two European countries.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the reasons for expeditions to South-East Asia by two European countries, referring to both
     throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Reasons may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the shared competition in the spice trade, which drove the Portuguese and the Dutch to seek a
     monopoly in this commodity. To do so, the Portuguese seized strategic locations on the route to
     the “Spice Islands” (e.g. Malacca). In contrast, the Dutch focused on the creation of a trade-based
     empire, usually without the desire to seize significant amounts of territory. It might be noted that the
     Portuguese Magellan, who visited the future Philippines, was in the service of the Spanish Crown
     and Spain’s initial motivation was for participation in the spice trade. In addition, Catholic Christian
     missionaries (for example, Jesuits) accompanied Portuguese trade missions in order to convert the
     natives of the region. In contrast, Dutch (Protestant) missionaries were generally more interested in
     preaching to Dutch inhabitants, rather than conversion. Alternatively, Spanish missionaries were
     motivated by proselytising and managed to convert most of the population of the Philippines.

Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   Examine the impact of religious cooperation and conflict in the Mughal Empire up to the end of
     Shah Jahan I’s rule.

     Candidates will consider the interrelationship between religious cooperation and conflict and its
     impact on the Mughal Empire up to the end of Shan Jahan I’s rule. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of impacts of religious conflict and religious cooperation, or they may prioritize their
     examination of either of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may refer to how religious conflict, mostly to subdue the largely Hindu population and to establish
     Muslim rule, helped consolidate power for both Babur and Humayun. Candidates may also
     examine the policies of religious cooperation such as power sharing with the local ruling elites, as
     well as the incorporation of diverse religious practices into court and social life that contributed to
     the stability and cultural dominance of the Mughal Empire. Other relevant interrelationships may be
     examined, for example how the religious cooperation allowed for the creation of a unique Mughal
     culture, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the social and cultural achievements of the government of Aurangzeb.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the social and cultural achievements of Aurangzeb, weighing
     up its strengths and limitations. The achievements may extend beyond the timeframe but they
     must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
     social and cultural successes, or they may prioritize their evaluation of either of them. However,
     both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to Aurangzeb’s order for 500
     experts in the field to compile the authoritative Hanafi legal judgments into the Fatawi-I Alamgiri,
     which became the Islamic code of law for the late Mughal Empire. Candidates may also refer to
     Aurangzeb’s other social achievements, such as the creation of a just and fair society based on
     Islamic traditions and values. Other relevant achievements may be considered, for example his
     promotion of Islamic calligraphy, the production of complicated textiles such as brocade and his
     building of monuments, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    “French colonial rule was the main reason for the beginnings of nationalism in Indo-China.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that French colonial rule was the main reason for the beginnings of nationalism in Indo-China.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may discuss the tendency for French colonial rule to be repressive, and in
      some instances corrupt, which contributed to a rise in anti-French sentiment amongst the local
      population. French reluctance to allow self-representation drove moderate political parties to the
      “left”; a key element of each party’s platform was (anti-French inspired) nationalism. Protests
      against elements of French rule (for example, poor peasants against taxation in 1908) often took
      on nationalist (and anti-French) rhetoric. Candidates may discuss reasons for the relative strength
      of nationalist feeling in Vietnam compared with the rest of Indo-China. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Compare and contrast the colonial rule of Spain and the United States in the Philippines.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the colonial rule of Spain and the United States in the Philippines, referring to both throughout.
      There does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the generally
      autocratic and exploitative nature of Spanish colonial rule, illustrated by the abuses by members of
      the government/military/clergy (and exposed by Ilustrados). In addition, many of the positions of
      power in the colony were held by peninsulares (Spaniards born in Spain), who had taken them
      from criollos (Spaniards born in the Philippines). In contrast to the Spaniards, the Americans
      provided Filipinos with political representation, ostensibly to prepare for independence. While the
      Spanish focused more upon obtaining tribute from the Philippines, the US looked to promote
      economic growth in their new territory, although this was also, as a comparison, designed to
      benefit American companies. A further point of comparison might be the tension between colonial
      authorities and Filipino nationalists, which characterized the rule of both powers. Finally, under
      Spanish rule, the Catholic Church wielded significant influence, but this was lost as a result of the
      separation of church and state by US authorities and the redistribution of Church lands.

Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the development of the Indian National Congress and All
      India Muslim League up to 1918.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the reasons for the development of the Indian National Congress (INC) and the All India Muslim
      League up to 1918, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of
      each. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the similarities seen in the establishment of the two
      organizations. The INC was founded upon the initiative of Hume, with the initial purpose of
      establishing a body to represent Indian interests and to create a platform for dialogue between
      educated Indians and the British Raj. Similarly, the Muslim League was founded in 1906 to protect
      the rights of Indian Muslims. The British remained resistant to many of the INC’s desires, however,
      which led the organization to take more radical positions (e.g. pushing for Indian independence). In
      contrast to their view of the INC, the British at first encouraged the All India Muslim League, who in
      turn were generally favourable to British rule; however, like the INC, the League adopted the goal
      of Indian self-government in 1913.


12.   To what extent was “The Great Game” responsible for the outbreak of the First and Second Anglo-
      Afghan Wars?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that “The
      Great Game” was responsible for the outbreak of the First and Second Anglo-Afghan Wars.
      Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to aspects of “The Great Game”, including the Russian fear of
      British encroachment, both commercial and military, into Central Asia; or the British fear of Russian
      encroachment on their imperial territory in India, suspicions which led to increasing distrust
      between the two powers; the second war was triggered by the Russians sending an uninvited
      mission to Kabul, and the Amir’s subsequent refusal to receive the British. In support, candidates
      may refer to the First Anglo-Afghan War, which was fought on behalf of the East India Company’s
      commercial interests in Central Asia. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
      attempt by the British to install an Afghan king, Shuja Shah, whom they hoped would faithfully
      pursue their interests, an appointment which led to the outbreak of conflict, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   “The main cause of the White Lotus Rebellion was the nature of imperial rule under the Qing
      dynasty.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the main cause of the White Lotus Rebellion was the nature of imperial rule under the Qing
      dynasty. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the impoverishment of many peasants in central China,
      which contributed to the outbreak of the rebellion. This was, at least in part, due to the tax burden
      placed upon the peasantry by the Qing government, as well as increasing corruption on the part of
      Qing officials. Reform, which might have helped alleviate some of these problems, was difficult as
      Confucian bureaucratic principles adopted by the Qing dynasty contributed to a great reluctance
      (or inability) to reform. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the White Lotus
      movement’s desire to remove the “alien” Manchu (Qing) dynasty from power, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   To what extent was Western intrusion the main reason for discontent during the Tokugawa
      Shogunate?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Western intrusion was the main reason for discontent during the Tokugawa Shogunate. Reasons
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the rise of anti-Western sentiment following the arrival of Matthew Perry in
      the 1850s, the results of which included unequal trade treaties with Western powers. This
      discontent was manifested in the ideology of sonnō jōi (“revere the king, expel the barbarians”),
      and would eventually lead to the Boshin War. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example, discontent amongst the nobility which was a result of their expulsion from power since
      the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate, as well as the increasing influence of supporters of
      the emperor (known as ishin shishi). Candidates may also refer to the inflexible and outdated
      nature of the Tokugawa regime, which led to further discontent, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Compare and contrast the impact of tensions between indigenous people and settlers in Australia
      and New Zealand up to the end of the 19th century.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      Australia and New Zealand in terms of the impact of tensions between indigenous people and
      settlers up to the end of the 19th century, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be
      an equal number of each. Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Similarities may include the outbreak of conflict between
      indigenous people and settlers over access to grazing/pastureland. Similarly, open warfare broke
      out in both countries, with the Black War in Tasmania leading to the virtual extermination of the
      island’s indigenous population. There were also numerous unlawful killings of Aboriginal people,
      collectively characterized as “massacres”. The New Zealand Wars (Māori Wars) (1845–1872) were
      the ultimate expression of tensions in this country. Contrasts may include the fact that, while the
      New Zealand Wars ended with Māori land being confiscated under the New Zealand Settlements
      Act, some progress was made in the aftermath of the conflict – for example, a small number of
      Māori were elected to Parliament in 1868, and Māori adult males were given the vote. In contrast,
      the equivalent would not occur in Australia until the 20th century. A further contrast could be the
      signing of the Treaty of Waitangi (even though its status was later disputed), where no equivalent
      treaty was signed in Australia.


16.   To what extent was the federation movement the main reason for the growth of national identity in
      Australia up to 1901?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      federation movement was the main reason for the growth of national identity in Australia up to
      1901. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to role of Sir Henry Parkes, the so-called “father of federation”,
      including his famous Tenterfield Oration, in which he called for the federation of the colonies. The
      efforts of Parkes and others led to a federation conference in 1890 and a Constitutional Convention
      in 1891, events which led to an upsurge in Australian nationalism. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, including the development of transport and communication (e.g. the telegraph) which
      engendered a more powerful sense of Australian identity, or examples of federation overseas (e.g.
      Canada) which had an influence on the Australian public, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   Discuss the reasons for the failure of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the 1911 Xinhai Revolution failed. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss the confused nature of the
      revolt, which consisted of numerous local uprisings. Sun Yixian was out of the country when the
      revolt erupted, and his Tongmenghui, or United League, only took the lead in three provinces in the
      early stages. Candidates may discuss the role of the former Qing general Yuan Shikai, who played
      a central role in reviving the imperial army, and in the political manoeuvres which subverted the
      revolution. Chronic instability within the country undermined the quest for democratic reform as
      Sun concluded that he needed Yuan’s military strength to cement the overthrow of the Qing. While
      a National Assembly was created, after the resignation of Sun Yixian, political power was
      increasingly monopolized by Yuan (which included a short-lived attempt at becoming emperor).
      Candidates could validly challenge the premise behind the question by pointing out that, as the
      Qing were overthrown, the revolution was partly successful. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Examine the impact of Japan’s victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) on the region.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between Japan’s victory in the
      Russo-Japanese War and its impact on the region. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may examine the
      territorial changes that resulted from the war, including the Kwantung Leased Territory and South
      Sakhalin both being ceded to the Japanese by Russia. As a result of the war, the balance of power
      in East Asia shifted significantly, with the rise of Japan and the decline of Russia made clear.
      Candidates may examine the evacuation of Manchuria by the Russians and its return to the
      Chinese, and the recognition of Japanese interests in Korea and then annexation in 1910.
      Candidates may examine the impact in East Asia more broadly, with the defeat of a major
      European power contributing to a surge in nationalism across the region, while a number of
      political movements in a number of countries, dispensing with more moderate reformism, grew
      more radical in outlook. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 13 –              M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   To what extent was the Amritsar Massacre the most significant factor in the
      development of Indian nationalism between 1919 and 1935?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Amritsar Massacre was the most significant factor in the development of Indian nationalism
      between 1919 and 1935. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may consider the extent to which the Amritsar Massacre
      and the British responses that followed caused widespread anger, leading many moderate Indians
      to abandon their loyalty to the British and embrace Indian nationalism. They may argue that this
      resulted in Gandhi’s full commitment to achieving independence from Britain, culminating in the
      Non-cooperation movement of 1920–22. Other relevant factors may be considered, for example
      the impacts of the First World War, the Government Act of India (1919), the Simon Commission
      (1928), as well as the contributions of the Round Table Conferences (1930–1932), but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the effectiveness of Nehru’s domestic policies in post-independence India.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of Nehru’s domestic policies in post-
      independence India, weighing up the strengths and limitations of these policies. The evaluation
      may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may evaluate the effectiveness of Nehru’s first three Five-Year Plans,
      especially successes such as an increase in national income after the first plan and the trebling of
      industrial output by 1965. Candidates may also examine the failures of the Nehru’s agricultural
      policies that led to a fall in food production and the subsequent need to import food from other
      countries. Other relevant impacts may be addressed, such as his effective promotion of secularism
      and republicanism in politics as well as the challenges he faced in raising women’s status,
      especially in rural areas. Candidates may also evaluate his educational policies that contributed to
      the expansion of higher education and increasing literacy but was less successful in providing
      universal primary school education. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   “Economic factors were the main reason for the rise of militarism in Japan.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that economic factors were the
      main reason for the rise of militarism in Japan. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the economic
      problems Japan faced in the 1920s due to the Kanto earthquake and the subsequent economic
      stagnation, exacerbated by the Great Depression. This allowed the military to gain prominence
      through their expansionist policies as solutions to Japan’s economic woes. Other relevant reasons
      may be considered, for example, Japan’s belief in its destiny as Asia’s leader, as evidenced by
      Japan’s success in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. This belief, along with the aspiration to
      make Japan a leading Far Eastern nation with the power and prestige associated with foreign
      territorial possession, necessitated a strong military and a more aggressive foreign policy. In
      addition, the fragility of democratic institutions in Japan and the political instability in China may be
      considered. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


22.   “The US occupation (1945–1952) had a positive impact on Japanese politics and society.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the US occupation
      had a positive impact on Japanese politics and society. Impacts discussed may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the questions. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of political and social impact, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of
      them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      successful democratization of Japan by widening the suffrage, changing the status of the Emperor,
      and establishing civil liberties such as freedom of speech. Social policies such as education
      policies and labour laws may also be discussed. Other relevant impacts may be addressed, for
      example the curtailing of certain democratic freedoms under the reverse course, brought on by the
      onset of the Cold War. In addition, candidates may discuss the attendant consequences of the
      occupation, namely prostitution and economic liberalization. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 15 –              M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Examine the contribution of the New Culture Movement and the effects of warlordism to the rise of
      national identity in China.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between the effects of warlordism and the New
      Culture Movement on the rise of national identity in China. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      the effects of warlordism and the New Culture Movement, or they may prioritize their examination
      of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss
      how the death of Yuan Shikai left a power vacuum, marking the start of the warlord era. This
      resulted in chaos and anarchy which led to the unchecked development of nationalist feelings in
      China in response to the disunity and disorder. Some progressive warlords also disseminated
      nationalistic and patriotic ideas, furthering the emergence of a Chinese national identity. The New
      Culture Movement also arose from the failure of the 1912 Republic and the later humiliation of
      Versailles. The movement challenged elements of Chinese tradition such as Confucianism,
      patriarchy and classical literature, while promoting democracy and liberalism. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   “The successful suppression of opposition was the most important reason for the establishment of
      Jiang Jieshi’s rule in Taiwan between 1947 and 1950.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the successful
      suppression of opposition was the most important reason for the establishment of Jiang’s rule in
      Taiwan in the timeframe. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to Chen Yi’s massacre of thousands of civilians
      following the 228 Incident in 1947 and the subsequent imposition of martial law in 1949. This
      “White Terror” was characterized by the imprisonment and executions of alleged opponents to the
      regime. The imposition of a one-party state and strict censorship laws also contributed to the
      suppression of the opposition. Other relevant reasons may be discussed, for example, support for
      Jiang from the US and many ethnic Chinese who welcomed the end of Japanese rule and the
      prospect of economic stability. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 16 –               M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

25.   To what extent was military superiority the main reason for initial Japanese victories in South-East
      Asia (1940–1942)?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that military superiority was the
      main reason for initial Japanese victories in South-East Asia. Reasons may predate the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the fact
      that the superior Japanese navy was the third largest after the British and US fleets, as well as the
      fact that both the navy and army were battle-hardened by previous battle. In contrast, the British,
      French, American and Dutch military forces in the region were limited and most lacking in combat
      experience. Other relevant causes may be addressed, for example, candidates may argue that the
      colonial governments were pre-occupied by the war in Europe and underestimated the Japanese,
      hence leading to the defeat of their colonies. In addition, they may highlight the strategic planning
      of the Japanese and their sound choice of tactics that allowed them to occupy French Indochina
      and British Malaya with little interference. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the growth of nationalism in the Dutch East Indies and
      Indochina.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the reasons for the
      growth of nationalism in the Dutch East Indies and Indochina, referring to both throughout.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to how both the Dutch East Indies and Indochina suffered under
      colonial rule, leading to the emergence of nationalism. Similarly, candidates may refer to how the
      defeat of the Dutch lowered the prestige of European powers and provided opportunities for
      nationalists to assert their claims for independence. Candidates may argue that Indonesian
      nationalism was inspired by an educational policy that produced a generation of Indonesian elite
      exposed to Western notions of democracy and freedom. In contrast, nationalist movements in
      Indochina were more diverse, looking to the West, China and Japan for inspiration. The differences
      of Japanese rule also contributed differently to the growth of nationalism in these two colonies.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.
                                                 – 17 –               M22/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   To what extent did China’s First Five-Year Plan succeed in meeting its objectives?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that China’s First Five-Year Plan
      succeeded in meeting its objectives. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. The objectives of the Five-Year Plan included
      increasing economic growth with an emphasis on industrial development and the socialization of
      the economy. Assisted by the Soviets, these measures led to a rapid growth in industrial
      production and national income. Candidates may also refer to the agricultural initiatives such as
      the Agricultural Producer’s Cooperatives and their impact on grain production, as well as on the
      pace and extent of collectivization. Other relevant impacts may be addressed, for example the
      expansion of state ownership that was part of the socialization process, as well as the fact that
      agriculture production did not keep pace with industrial production. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Discuss the reasons for changes in Sino-American relations between 1949 and 1976.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the changes in Sino-
      American relations between 1949 and 1976. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the souring of Sino-
      American relations in 1949 as a result of the US support for the Nationalists during the Chinese
      Civil War and the US refusal to acknowledge the People’s Republic of China as a legitimate state.
      Hostility was heightened in the 1950s and 1960s by a series of proxy wars. The thawing of
      relations between the PRC and the US after 1969 was largely due to changing geopolitics. The US
      was seeking to bring an end to the war in Vietnam and hoped for China’s help, while the Sino-
      Soviet split motivated China to look for rapprochement with the US. Candidates may discuss the
      1969 Sino-Soviet border conflict and Nixon’s election as president. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Evaluate the economic and political impact of the Korean War on the Korean peninsula.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic and political impact of the Korean War on the
      peninsula, weighing up its importance or otherwise. Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of economic and political impact, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to immediate
      negative impacts of the war on both North and South Korea and evaluate the long-term economic
      policies both governments put in place to deal with the devastation of war. Other relevant impacts
      may be evaluated, for example, how the war allowed Kim Il Sung to purge his political rivals and
      consolidate his power and heightened political indoctrination as form of control and mobilization in
      the North. For South Korea, the war led to the emergence of the military as a dominant political
      force and the use of anti-Communist sentiments as justification for political repression. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   Discuss the reasons for, and impact of, the civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992).

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and the impact of, the
      civil war in Afghanistan from 1989–1992. Reasons may predate the timeframe and impacts may
      extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may discuss the mujahideen’s rejection of the Soviet-backed Najibullah and the
      subsequent in-fighting amongst the mujahideen as reasons for the civil war. Other reasons include
      the failure of the incumbent Afghan government to end the conflict, as well as the lack of an
      acceptable UN-led transitional process. For impacts, candidates may refer to the expansion of the
      civil war over Afghanistan that led to large number of casualties, destruction of infrastructure and
      disruption of daily life. Candidates may also refer to the eventual establishment of Taliban rule in
      the country which ushered in an era of brutality, repression and poor living conditions. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947.

31.   Evaluate the economic and political developments in India under Indira Gandhi.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic and political developments in India under Indira
      Gandhi, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Developments may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of economic and political developments, or they may prioritize one of them.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the positive
      economic changes that took place under Indira Gandhi such as the reduction in poverty, increase
      in food production, as well as agricultural growth. Candidates may also discuss the successes and
      failures of her nationalization programmes. Politically, candidates may refer to her victory over
      Pakistan by the consolidation of Indian power over Kashmir in 1971, as well as the creation of
      Bangladesh. Other relevant developments may be addressed, for example, her rule by decree for
      two years following her conviction of dishonest election practices. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   To what extent did Bangladesh overcome the social and political challenges it faced after 1971?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Bangladesh has overcome
      the social and political challenges it faced after 1971. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      social and political challenges, or they may prioritize their assessment of one of them. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may consider how, socially, Bangladesh
      failed to address the gap between the Western-educated ruling elite and the rural, uneducated
      masses which led to movements against the authoritarian regime of General Ershad. In addition,
      the social challenges of widespread poverty, poor infrastructure and corruption were not overcome,
      in part, due to poor governance. Candidates may consider how, in its infancy, democracy in
      Bangladesh was weakened by its founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and was followed by two
      military regimes. Other challenges may be addressed, for example, nation-wide unrests due to the
      political rivalry between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League which
      necessitated caretaker governments in 1996 and in 2006. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   Compare and contrast the impact of immigration to Australia and New Zealand after the Second
      World War.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of immigration to Australia and New Zealand after the Second World War, referring to
      both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Consequences may extend
      beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. For
      similarities, candidates may refer to the significant amount of immigration to both countries from
      the United Kingdom in the immediate post-war period, motivated in large part by the effects of the
      Second World War. These “Ten Pound Poms” would help shape both societies in many ways,
      including politically and economically. Immigration from non-Anglophone European countries
      increased rapidly from the 1950s onwards, which led to significant changes in areas like language,
      religion, and cuisine in both countries. For differences, candidates may refer to immigration from
      the Pacific Islands to New Zealand, or Asian migration to Australia, particularly from Vietnam in the
      aftermath of the Second Indochina War. Both countries would emerge as multicultural nations by
      the beginning of the twenty-first century.


34.   “The rise of Asian economies was the most important reason for the economic realignment of
      Australia and New Zealand.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the rise of Asian economies was the most important reason for the economic realignment of
      Australia and New Zealand. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss Japan’s booming post-war economy,
      particularly from the 1960s onwards, which led Australia and New Zealand to increase trade with
      their Asian neighbour. By 1960, for example, Japan had replaced the United Kingdom as
      Australia’s principal market for wool. As Japan’s economy stagnated in the 1990s, China became
      an increasingly important trade partner for both Australia and New Zealand, with a particular desire
      for raw materials like iron ore. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the United
      Kingdom joining the European Economic Union (1 January 1973), which adversely affected trade
      with Australia and New Zealand, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan
and India) (1980–2005)

35.   “The environment has been a key social issue.” Discuss with reference to two Asian countries
      (excluding China, Japan and India).

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the environment has
      been a key social issue for two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India). Candidates
      may refer to the dwindling supply of resources to support the needs of an increasing urbanized
      population and the growing challenge for governments to deal successfully with multiple
      environmental issues. Candidates may also discuss the large welfare cost of environmental
      damage, especially on low-income groups, particularly in rural areas, as they are least equipped to
      deal with pollution. Specifically, candidates may discuss the effects of deforestation, loss of
      habitats, pollution and the dramatic increase in solid waste production, which may include health
      issues, natural disasters and loss of livelihoods. Other relevant aspects may be addressed, for
      example the extent and success of government action taken to mitigate environmental problems,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   Discuss the nature and role of the media in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and
      India) up to 2005.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the nature and the role of the media in
      two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India) up to 2005. Candidates may discuss the
      different types of media available including print media such as newspapers, magazines and
      books; broadcast media such as television and radio; and new media such as YouTube, social
      media platforms, podcasts etc. Candidates may discuss the extent of influence these types of
      media exerted on society. Candidates may also refer to how these forms of media shaped modern
      culture through perceptions of beauty and societal norms, as well as through the advocacy of
      commercial, political and social concerns. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      the extent of government control over media forms and how it affects its roles, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.
