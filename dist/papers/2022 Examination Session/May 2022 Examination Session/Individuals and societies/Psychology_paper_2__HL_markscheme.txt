 Paper 2 assessment criteria

 Criterion A — Focus on the question                                                              [2]

 To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
 being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
 question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
 problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

Marks       Level descriptor

 0          Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

 1          Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

 2          Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.



 Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding                                                        [6]

 This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
 specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
 that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

Marks       Level descriptor

  0         Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
1 to 2
            Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

            The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
3 to 4
            Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

            The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
5 to 6
            Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–                M22/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer                                               [6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of
research to support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces
of research are appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the
research selected is relevant and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research
that makes the points relevant to the answer is better than several pieces that repeat the
same point over and over.

Marks      Level descriptor

0          Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

           Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
1 to 2
           Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

           Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
3 to 4     partly explained.
           Research selected partially develops the argument.

           Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
5 to 6     thoroughly explained.
           Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                    –5–                 M22/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D — Critical thinking                                                                   [6]

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate
critical thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the
research used to support that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking
are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition,
students could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a
well-developed evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic
judgement of their achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

Marks       Level descriptor

0           Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
1 to 2
            Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

            The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
3 to 4
            Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

            The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
5 to 6
            Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.



Criterion E — Clarity and organization                                                            [2]

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner.
A good response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of
thought underpinning the argument.

Marks       Level descriptor

0           Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
1
            throughout the response.

2           The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

Abnormal psychology

1.   Evaluate one or more studies investigating the validity and/or reliability of diagnosis.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more studies
     investigating the validity and/or reliability of diagnosis by weighing up the strengths and limitations
     of the selected study/studies. The focus of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies, not on
     the validity and/or reliability of diagnosis. Studies related to diagnosis of any disorders (eg OCD,
     anorexia, depression) are acceptable and can achieve maximum marks as long as the focus is on
     reliability and/or diagnosis of those disorders. Responses may use studies referring to gender and
     cultural bias of diagnosis and can be awarded marks for these as long as the bias explicitly relates
     to issues of validity and/or reliability of diagnosis. Although a discussion of both strengths and
     limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Relevant studies include, but are not limited to:
     • Nicholls et al.’s (2000) studies of inter-rater reliability
     • Wakefield et al.’s (2007) study on the validity of diagnosis
     • Silverman et al.’s (2001) study on test-retest of anxiety symptoms and diagnosis
     • Rosenhan’s studies of diagnostic validity
     • Kleinman’s (1982) study of differences in interpretation of somatic symptoms in Chinese culture
       and the United States
     • Lipton and Simon’s (1985) study on reliability of diagnosis of randomly selected 131 patients in
       a hospital in New York
     • Lobbestael, Leurgans and Arntz’s (2011) study of reliability of diagnosis using the DSM IV
     • Bolton’s (2002) cross-cultural validity of the western key concept of PTSD
     • Li-Repac’s (1980) study on the effect of cultural stereotyping on diagnosis.

     Evaluation of the selected studies may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • the applications of the empirical findings
     • how the findings of the research have been interpreted
     • implications of the findings.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the best fit approach.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, in criterion A we assess to what extent is the
     response focused on the question. Responses that are generic, lack a focus on the specific
     question and seem as pre-prepared essays of relevance to the general topic (but not to evaluation
     of one or more studies) should be awarded [0]. If the response identifies which studies will be
     evaluated but there is also extra information that is not relevant or necessary for the specific
     question then [1] should be awarded. Responses that are clearly focused on evaluating one or
     more studies should gain [2].

     Marks awarded for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts relating to
     research studies. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more specifically
     knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen studies

     Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a study/studies and
                                             –7–                 M22/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this doesn't
have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
study/studies.
                                                   –8–                 M22/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Evaluate one or more studies investigating prevalence rates of one or more psychological
     disorders.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires the candidate to make an appraisal of one or more studies
     investigating prevalence rates of one or more psychological disorders by weighing up the strengths
     and limitations of the selected study or studies. The focus of the evaluation should be upon the
     study/studies, not on the prevalence rates of psychological disorders. Although a discussion of
     both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high
     marks.

     The disorder(s) chosen is/are likely to come from the list in the guide:
     • anxiety disorders
     • depressive disorders
     • obsessive compulsive disorders
     • trauma and stress related disorders
     • eating disorders.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Brown and Harris’s (1977) study of gender vulnerability to depression
     • Makino et al.’s (2004) study regarding the prevalence of eating disorders in Western and
       non-Western countries
     • Weisman et al.’s (1995) study regarding the cross-cultural variation in data on depression rates
     • Garrison et al. (1995) investigating the incidence of PTSD in adolescents after Hurricane
       Andrew
     • Dutton’s (2009) study of cultural variation in the prevalence of major depression
     • Nolen-Hoeksema’s (2001) study of gender rates in depression
     • Piccinelli and Wilkinson’s (2000) study of gender differences in depression.

     Evaluation of the selected study/studies may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • the applications of the empirical findings
     • how findings have been interpreted
     • implications of the findings.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the best fit approach.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, in criterion A we assess to what extent is the
     response focused on the question. Responses that are generic, lack a focus on the specific
     question and seem as pre-prepared essays of relevance to the general topic (but not to evaluation
     of one or more studies) should be awarded [0]. If the response identifies which studies will be
     evaluated but there is also extra information that is not relevant or necessary for the specific
     question then [1] should be awarded. Responses that are clearly focused on evaluating one or
     more studies should gain [2].

     Marks awarded for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts relating to
     research studies. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more specifically
     knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen studies.

     Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and

assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question - this doesn't
have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
study/studies.

3.   Discuss one biological treatment and one psychological treatment for one or more psychological
     disorders.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one biological
     and one psychological treatment for one or more psychological disorders.

     The disorder(s) chosen is/are likely to come from the list in the guide:
     • anxiety disorders
     • depressive disorders
     • obsessive compulsive disorders
     • trauma and stress related disorders
     • eating disorders.

     Biological treatment could include, but is not limited to:

     • Exposure and Systematic desensitization
     • Virtual Reality Therapy (VRT)
     • Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)
     • Group therapy.

     Responses may refer to an interactionist approach or a biopsychosocial approach to treatment.
     These responses might refer to the interactionist approach as one treatment or argue that two
     treatments are used for helping patients with a disorder. Both approaches are equally acceptable
     and can be credited up to full marks.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Mason and Hargreaves’s (2011) qualitative investigation into the effectiveness of MBCT
     • Butler et al.’s (2006) review of meta-analysis related to CBT efficacy
     • Hodges and Oei’s (2007) discussion of the applicability of CBT to Chinese culture
     • MacNamara et al.’s (2016) studying the effectiveness of SSRIs for PTSD
     • Parsons and Rizzo’s (2008) meta-analysis of studies into the effectiveness of virtual reality
       therapy for PTSD.
     • McLay et al.’s (2011) assessment of the effectiveness of VRT for post-traumatic stress disorder.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • the effectiveness of the chosen treatment(s)
     • the assumptions about etiology upon which the treatment is based with regard to the chosen
        disorder
     • culture, gender, ethical, and/or practical considerations related to the use of treatment of the
        chosen disorder
     • advantages and disadvantages of the treatment.

     If a candidate discusses more than one biological treatment or more than one psychological
     treatment, credit should be given only to the first treatment.

4.   Discuss one or more theories of brain development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term "discuss" requires candidates to offer a considered review of one or more
     theories of brain development.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • theory of neuroplasticity
     • maturational theory of brain development.

     Responses to this question may also use Piaget’s and Vygotsky’s theory. For these responses
     marks should be awarded depending on how effectively responses link these to brain
     development.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Waber's (2007); Gogtay et al.'s (2004) longitudinal studies of brain development using MRI

       2.5 and later made substantial neuro-linguistic recovery
     • Takatsuru et al. on how the brain compensates for damage caused by trauma.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into brain development
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • alternative theories/explanations.

     Marks for criterion A will be awarded for focus on theoretical explanations of brain development.
     Marks for criterion B will reflect the quality of the knowledge and understanding of the chosen
     theories. Marks for criterion C reflect how studies are presented and used in the response.
     Criterion D should assess critical thinking related to theories and/or studies.
                                                – 12 –              M22/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Evaluate one or more studies investigating influences on cognitive and/or social development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more studies
     investigating influences on cognitive and/or social development by weighing up the strengths and
     limitations of the selected study/studies. The focus of the evaluation should be upon the
     study/studies, not the influences of cognitive and/or social development. Although a discussion of
     both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high
     marks.

     Candidates may evaluate one or more studies investigating specific aspects of cognitive and/or
     social development (for example memory, intelligence, gender development, peer relationship) or
     evaluate one or more studies investigating cognitive and/or social development in general. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.

     The term “influence” may include, but is not limited to:
     • genetic influence
     • maturation of the nervous system
     • trauma/deprivation
     • resilience
     • peers
     • poverty
     • nutrition
     • educational programmes/support from parents/educators.

     Responses to this question may also use Piaget’s and Vygotsky’s theory. In these responses
     marks should be awarded depending on how effectively responses target and explain influences
     on cognitive and/or social development.

     Relevant research studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Waber's (2007); Giedd's (2004); Chugani et al.'s (2001) studies on the effects of maturation of
       the nervous system on cognitive development
     • Deary et al.'s (2006); Bouchard et al.'s (1990) studies on genetic inheritance in intelligence
     • Cowell et al.'s (2006); Corky's (1997) studies on brain damage and memory deficits
     • Fagot's (1978); Condry and Condry's (1976) studies on the role of society in gender
       development
     • Carly and Eagly's (1999); Eagly and Johnson's (1990); Maccoby and Jacklin's (1980) meta-
       analysis considering the influence of gender on group relations
     • studies relating to Vygotsky addressing peer mentoring or the relevance of zone of proximal
       development.

     Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • application of the empirical findings
     • how the findings of the research have been interpreted
     • implications of the findings.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the best fit approach.

Health psychology

7.   Discuss the effectiveness of one or more health promotion programmes.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the effectiveness
     of one or more health promotion programmes.
     Health promotion programmes may include, but are not limited to:
     • TRUTH campaign, anti-smoking campaign (Sly et al., 2002; Schum and Gold, 2007)

8.   Evaluate one or more studies related to prevalence rates of health problems.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up strengths
     and limitations of one or more studies related to the prevalence rates of health problems. The focus
     of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies, not on prevalence rates of health problems.
     Although both strengths and limitations should be addressed, it does not have to be evenly balanced
     to gain high marks.

     Health problems are likely to come from the list in the guide:
     • stress
     • addiction
     • obesity
     • chronic pain
     • sexual health.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Rhani, Bonu, Jha, Nyguen and Jamjoum’s (2003) study in tobacco use prevalence rates in India
     • Thoits’s (1995) study of gender prevalence in giving and receiving social support
     • Parker et al.’s (2005) study of prevalence rates from 1992 and 2002 showing increasing health
       problems among Swedish elderly population
     • Makino et al.’s (2004) study of prevalence rates in eating disorders in Western and non-Western
       countries
     • Weinberger et al.’s (2019) study on increasing prevalence rates of smoking in US adults with
       mental health and substance use problems
     • Zheng et al.’s (2018) study of prevalence rates of smoking and knowledge of health hazards
       among internal migrants in China
     • Agha et al.’s (2017) study related to rising prevalence rates of obesity and related effects on
       public health.

     Evaluation of the selected studies may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory findings
     • the applications of the empirical findings
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted
     • implications of the findings.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the best fit approach.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, in criterion A we assess to what extent is the
     response focused on the question. Responses that are generic, lack a focus on the specific
     question and seem as pre-prepared essays of relevance to the general topic (but not to evaluation
     of one or more studies) should be awarded [0]. If the response identifies which studies will be
     evaluated but there is also extra information that is not relevant or necessary for the specific
     question then [1] should be awarded. Responses that are clearly focused on evaluating one or
     more studies should gain [2].

     Marks awarded for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts relating to
     research studies. Overall this could include some knowledge of topic but more specifically
     knowledge and understanding related to research methods and ethics of chosen studies

Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and
assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this doesn't
have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
study/studies.

9.   Evaluate the biopsychosocial model of health and well-being.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up strengths
     and limitations of the biopsychosocial model of health and well-being. Although a discussion of
     both strengths and limitations should be addressed, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain
     high marks.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Engel’s (1977) biopsychosocial model of health
     • Buckner, Heimberg, Ecker, and Vinci’s (2012) study in the use of the biopsychosocial model to
       treat addiction

     • Jack’s (2013) biopsychosocial factors affecting female metabolism in type 1 diabetes
     • Cohen et al.’s (2003) treatment of nicotine dependence: biopsychosocial perspective.

     Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
     • the importance of considering a holistic approach to health
     • advantages and disadvantages of the model
     • methodological considerations related to the research into the biopsychosocial model of health
       and well-being
     • cultural factors and gender considerations
     • supporting and/or contradictory empirical evidence
     • alternative explanations
     • accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • practical applications.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the best fit approach.

      • Fincham et al.’s (2000) and Graham and Conoley (2006) study on the relationship between
        attributions and marital satisfaction.

      Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • examining underlying assumptions and biases of relationships
      • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
      • methodological and/or ethical considerations related to research into the explanations for why

12.   Evaluate one or more studies investigating prosocial behaviour.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term "evaluate" requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations of one or more studies related to prosocial behaviour. The focus of the
      evaluation should be on the study/studies, not on prosocial behaviour.
      Although both strengths and limitations should be addressed, it does not have to be evenly
      balanced to gain high marks.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Piliavin et al.’s (1969), field experiment on factors involved in helping behaviour
