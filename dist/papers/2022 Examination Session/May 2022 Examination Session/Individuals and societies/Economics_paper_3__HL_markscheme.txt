Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should
   be given.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to
   2 dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only
   be penalized ONCE per script (not per part) for each type of error.


1.   (a)   (i)   Using the information provided in Table 1, calculate the rate of
                 unemployment for Burundi in 2019.                                              [2]

                 Any valid working should be rewarded with [1].

                 = 1.5%

                 An answer of 1.5 or 1.5% without working is sufficient for [1].

                 NB An answer of 1.52 arises because of incorrect working and so should be
                 awarded [0].

(ii)    Explain why dependence on primary sector production may be considered
        a barrier to economic development.                                                [4]

Level                                                                            Marks
0         The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors         0
          below.
1         The written response is limited.                                       1–2
          For an explanation that, as a result of the low PED of agricultural
          products / the volatility of supply (weather; disease), prices and
          thus farmers’ incomes fluctuate from year to year.

          Any reasonable approach that focuses on issues related to
          primary sector production/incomes should be rewarded.
2         The written response is accurate.                                      3–4
          For an explanation that, as a result of the low PED of
          agricultural products / the volatility of supply (weather; disease),
          prices and thus farmers’ incomes fluctuate from year to year
          AND for an explanation that this volatility prevents farmers from
          saving and investing in physical capital, human capital and other
          pro-development objectives (poverty-cycle can be used).

          Alternatively, candidates can explain that:
          - dependence on the primary (agricultural) sector may prevent
             these countries from diversifying into the higher value-added
             manufacturing sector restricting their opportunities for
             economic development ie investing in human capital and
             other pro-development objectives
          - primary agricultural products are characterised by low YED
             which restricts the opportunity for export-led growth and thus
             for investments in pro-development objectives. ie investing in
             human capital and other pro-development objectives

          Any other valid response.

        NB A response that links only to growth can be awarded a maximum of [3].
        Similarly, if development is merely stated, but not linked, then a maximum
        of [3] is awarded.

(iii)   Using the information in Figure 1, calculate the price elasticity of demand for
        gold in Burundi when price increases from $1500 per oz to $1800 per oz.           [2]

                                       %∆𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄=        −20

                                                  = 20
        Any valid working (correct %Δ Qd or %Δ P, provided the formula is not
        inverted) is sufficient for [1]

        = –1 or 1

        An answer of –1 or 1 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

        NB A response in which the formula is inverted should be awarded [0].

(iv)   Using the information in Figure 1, calculate the change in the value of
       Burundi’s gold exports resulting from the increase in the price of gold from
       $1500 per oz to $1800 per oz.                                                     [2]

       Initial value = 1000 (70 – 25) × 1500 = 67 500 000

       New value = 1000 (85 – 20) × 1800 = 117 000 000

       Any valid working (initial or final value) is sufficient for [1].

       Change in value = US$117 million – US$67.5 million

       = US$49.5 million or US$49 500 000

       An answer of 49.5 or 49.5 million or $49.5 million without any valid working
       is sufficient for [1].

       NB For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working
       and include correct units.

(v)    Define the term progressive tax.                                                  [2]

   Level                                                                     Marks

             For the idea that it is a tax for which higher income earners
             pay more.
   2         Accurate definition                                             2
             A clear understanding that it is a tax system where those
             on higher incomes pay a higher percentage / pay
             proportionally more of their income as tax

             OR a tax system where a person’s marginal tax rate is
             higher than their average rate / the average tax rate
             increases as income increases

             OR where the fraction of income paid as tax increases as
             income increases.

(vi)   Calculate the amount of VAT which was paid on the purchase of this
       equipment.                                                                        [2]

       (32 000/1.2) × 0.2

       Any valid working should be rewarded with [1].

       = Fbu 5333.33

       An answer of 5333 without workings is sufficient for [1].

(vii) Sketch an AD/AS diagram to illustrate the possible effect on the Burundian
      economy in the long run if the government reduces the rate of corporate
      income tax from 30% to 26%.                                                        [2]

               For an AD/AS diagram showing a shift of LRAS to the
               right.
      2        The response is accurate                                      2
               For a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift of
               the LRAS curve to the right and a new higher level of
               (potential) output (a shift of AD and/or SRAS to the right
               are optional).

     For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be Average (General) Price Level, or Price
     Level. The horizontal axis may be real output, real national output, real income,
     real national income, real GDP or real Y. Any abbreviation of the previous terms
     is acceptable. A title is not necessary.

     NB A Keynesian diagram with AS shifting to the right and showing a higher (full
     employment/potential) output level is also acceptable.

     A diagram which is not fully labelled may be awarded a maximum of [1].

(viii) With reference to the data in Table 3, explain two ways in which gender
       inequality might act as a barrier to economic development in Burundi.         [4]

Level                                                                        Marks

        For a limited explanation of one reason, award a maximum of
        [1].

        For an accurate explanation of one reason (refer to L2) OR a
        limited explanation of two reasons, award a maximum of [2].

        Limited explanations may include:
        • High child mortality/poor maternal health
        • Low opportunities for females to be educated OR high birth
           rates
        • Low access to credit for women
        • Low opportunities for paid employment.
        Any other valid response.
2       The written response is accurate.                                    3–4
        For an accurate explanation of one reason AND a limited
        explanation of one other reason, award a maximum of [3].

        For an accurate explanation of two reasons, award a maximum
        of [4].

        A response that does not refer explicitly to the data
        in Table 3 should be awarded a maximum of [3].

        Accurate explanations may include:
           • Lack of healthcare for women may lead to low levels of
               health for women and their children
           • Low education levels for females may lead to high birth
               rates and restrict their income earning potential, thus
               leading to poverty / will limit the availability of skilled
               labour and enterprise in the economy
           • Lack of access to credit will restrict the ability of women
               to borrow and invest in education/ enterprise, limiting
               potential output
           • Lack of opportunities for women in tertiary education (eg
               engineering) will restrict them from earning income and
               from supporting their children.
        Any other valid response.

(b)   Using the text/data provided and your knowledge of economics, recommend a
      policy which could be introduced by the government of Burundi to reduce income
      inequality in Burundi.                                                                [10]

      Possible policies may include (but are not restricted to):
      • a more progressive tax system
      • investment in human capital (education or health)
      • policies to promote women’s empowerment
      • transfer payments
      • wider tax base (more effective tax collection/reducing tax avoidance)
      • policies to reduce inequalities of opportunity
      • transfer payments
      • targeted spending on goods and services, including merit goods
      • policies to reduce discrimination
      • minimum wage legislation
      • any other valid policy.
      NB If more than one policy is recommended, only the best policy should be rewarded, unless
      the policies are shown to be complementary or if they are compared/contrasted with the
      student’s one chosen policy.

(iii)   Using Figure 2, calculate the revenue (in rupees per day) collected from
        the indirect taxes on petrol in New Delhi.                                         [2]

        Any valid working should be rewarded with [1]

        = (RPs) 25 billion (or 25 000 million or 25 000 000 000)

        NB as rupees is stated in the question, it is not necessary to include it in
        the response.

        An answer of 25 billion (or 25 000 million or 25 000 000 000) without
        workings is sufficient for [1]

        OFR applies provided the S curve is drawn below the S + t curve (ie the
        vertical distance between the curves may be incorrect).

        NB the symbol        may be used for the Indian rupee.

        For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and

(iv)    Using Figure 2 and your answer to part (a)(ii), calculate the loss in
        consumer surplus which results from the imposition of indirect taxes on

        NB If a student finds the y intercept (of the demand curve, which is 270)
        and calculates the difference between two triangles, the working should be
        as follows:

        0.5 (240 × 600) – 0.5 (200 × 500) = 72 000 – 50 000

          curve showing PES<1 OR an explanation that any straight line
          supply curve which intersects the horizontal axis must show
          price inelastic supply.

          NB There are several calculations which could legitimately be
          used, depending on the initial price and quantity selected. One
          example is that, at the original equilibrium,
          PES = (1/6)/(10/30) = 0.5

          Another along the length of the S curve with P falling to P = 0 is:
          PES = (600/900)/(60/60) = 2/3 = 0.67

          Examiners will need to check carefully the accuracy of such
          calculations.

      • Investment in public transport
      • Investment in transport infrastructure
      • Subsidized ride-sharing services

      • Legislation
      • A congestion charge
      • Any other valid policy.

      NB If more than one policy is recommended, only the best policy should be rewarded, unless
      the policies are shown to be complementary or if they are compared/contrasted with the
      student’s one chosen policy.
