                                               Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   Roscas

     Roscas produces and sells sugar donuts. Monthly fixed costs are $15 000, monthly
     sales revenue is $70 000, and total variable costs per month are $25 000. To increase
     its productivity rate, Roscas wants to buy a new high-efficiency machine that produces
     chocolate-filled donuts. The finance manager has forecasted the following information.

           Table 1: Forecasted information for the production of chocolate-filled donuts

                              Price per unit                          $5

                              Variable costs per unit                 $2

                              Sales revenue per month            $100 000

                              Fixed costs per month                $1000

                         Table 2: Forecasted cash flow for the new machine

                                 Year           Net cash flows ($000s)

                                   0                    –2000

                                   1                       600

                                   3                       670

                                   4                       700

                                   5                       710

2.   Les Légumes Contentes (LLC)

     Les Légumes Contentes (LLC) is a cooperative of farmers that sells organic produce. LLC’s
     starting capital is $5000. It needs a bank loan to buy refrigerators for its store. The bank has
     requested a cash-flow forecast. The forecasted figures are shown in Table 3.

                                              Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Carol’s Designs (CD)

     Carol Rodríguez is passionate about design. She runs Carol’s Designs (CD) with two
     assistants, making and selling party dresses directly to consumers through her website.
     Customers provide their style preferences and measurements. Then, Carol emails a
     computer-designed drawing for the customer’s approval. CD uses job/customized production.

     An emerging talent in dress design, Carol decided to use e-commerce because she could not
     afford the fixed costs of an expensive physical location and traditional promotional techniques.
     Through her website, she promotes and sells her designs to a large audience and collects
     valuable information and opinions from her customers. The business-to-consumer (B2C)
     approach, essential for her business growth, requires regular website updates.

     E-commerce sales have steadily increased worldwide, and Carol’s dress orders have
     increased too. However, CD regularly misses delivery deadlines and is often short of cash.
     Carol’s bank suggested that she find a partner. She approached Juan Pérez, an engineer
     and business angel, about becoming a 50 % partner in CD. Juan thinks Carol needs to
     delegate design and focus on the operation of the business.

     CD uses social media marketing. Alexia Bros, a famous actress, ordered a dress for this
     season’s cinema festival, and Carol uploaded pictures of Alexia wearing her newly designed
     dress. Recently, however, some negative comments, including customer complaints about
     delays in delivery times, have appeared on social media. Carol did not have time to reply to
     these complaints. She is planning to hire a social media marketing manager.


     (a)   Define the term fixed cost.[2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CD of using a job/customized
           production method.                                                                           [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CD of forming a partnership.                  [4]

     (d)   Discuss Carol’s decision to use e-commerce.                                                 [10]

4.   Bandit & Max

     Bandit & Max (BM) is a partnership between Dr. Jones and Dr. Morris that produces
     specialist food for dogs with health problems. BM’s unique selling point/proposition (USP)
     is food for dogs with diabetes and digestive or kidney problems. BM’s mission statement is,
     “To help strengthen the bond between people and their dogs.”

     BM uses a cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy; however, the costs of raw materials are
     rising. BM has an excellent brand image and sells its products only through veterinarians and
     large pet shops that provide advice to customers. Veterinarians recommend BM’s dog food
     because of its high quality and nutritional value. However, potential customers in some areas
     lack access to BM’s food. BM’s sales are not growing.

     Dr. Morris wants to diversify into specialist cat food, as more people are buying or adopting
     cats. BM has experience in developing new products. In the past, BM outsourced its
     research and development. Now, Dr. Morris wants BM to build its own research facilities, but
     building costs are high. BM’s warehouse will need refurbishing to stock more food. BM could
     become a private limited company to raise the necessary finance.

     Dr. Jones disagrees. He believes BM should not diversify. BM’s current distribution costs are
     high. He has suggested introducing a new distribution channel for the dog food that includes
     a large supermarket chain, a wholesaler, and many small pet shops.


     (a)   Describe one feature of a mission statement.                                               [2]

     (b)   Explain two advantages of BM’s unique selling point/proposition (USP).                     [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for BM of using a cost-plus (mark-up)
           pricing strategy.                                                                          [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether BM should diversify into specialist cat food or introduce a new
           distribution channel for dog food.                                                       [10]




                                                                                              Turn over
                                                    –6–                                          2222 – 5012


5.    Frez PLC (FR)

      Frez PLC (FR) has 6000 employees in its 100 supermarkets and 250 in its head office. FR
      operates a 360-degree feedback appraisal system for head office employees. FR’s directors
      believe that this system has improved retention and morale of head office employees.
      This year, to reduce head office costs, FR offered head office employees the option of
      teleworking, which 60 % accepted. They will work at the head office only one day per month.

      Each FR supermarket has 10 departments. Departmental managers have concerns about
      their workload caused by their large span of control. Labour turnover at FR supermarkets is
      increasing each year because departmental managers are leaving. In January, FR increased
      its supermarket opening hours and hired an additional 1000 part-time employees. FR is
      considering extending its 360-degree feedback appraisal system to all supermarket employees.

      Recently, demand from supermarket shoppers for a home delivery service increased,
      although industry experts disagree on whether this demand will continue. FR’s main
      competitors already provide delivery services.

      FR has decided to launch a home delivery service. It will require 500 vans, which would be
      replaced every five years. FR is considering two options:
      y Option 1: purchase the vans at a unit cost of $34 000 each, financed by a five-year bank loan
         at 3 % interest.
      y Option 2: Lease the vans at a unit cost of $13 000 per year per van. The minimum term for the
         lease will be 24 months.

      FR already borrowed $50 million in 2019 to finance the modernization of its supermarkets.


      (a)     State two features of a public limited company.                                           [2]

      (b)     (i)	Explain, with reference to Maslow’s motivation theory, how teleworking at FR may
                   damage motivation amongst head office staff.                                         [2]

              (ii)   Explain one disadvantage for FR, other than the impact on employee motivation,
                     of introducing teleworking.                                                        [2]

      (c)     Explain two disadvantages for FR if it extends its 360-degree feedback appraisal
              system to its supermarket employees.                                                      [4]

      (d)     Recommend whether FR should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]
