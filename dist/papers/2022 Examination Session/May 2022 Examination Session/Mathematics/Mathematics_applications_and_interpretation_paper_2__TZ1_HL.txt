Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

1.   [Maximum mark: 16]

     The scores of the eight highest scoring countries in the 2019 Eurovision song contest are
     shown in the following table.

                                                       Eurovision score

(Question 1 continued)

     Chester is investigating the relationship between the highest-scoring countries’ Eurovision
     score and their population size to determine whether population size can reasonably be
     used to predict a country’s score.

     The populations of the countries, to the nearest million, are shown in the table.

                                    Population (x) (millions)      Eurovision score (y)

     Chester finds that, for this data, the Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient
     is  ​r = 0.249​  .

     (c)   State whether it would be appropriate for Chester to use the equation of a regression
           line for y on x to predict a country’s Eurovision score. Justify your answer.              [2]

     Chester then decides to find the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient for this data,
     and creates a table of ranks.

     A Principal would like to compare the students in his school with a national standard.
     He decides to give a test to eight students made up of four boys and four girls. One of
     the teachers offers to find the volunteers from his class.

     (a)   Name the type of sampling that best describes the method used by the Principal.               [1]

     The marks out of 40, for the students who took the test, are:

                                    25, 29, 38, 37, 12, 18, 27, 31.

     (b)   For the eight students find

           (i)    the mean mark.

           (ii)   the standard deviation of the marks.                                                   [3]

     The national standard mark is 25.2 out of 40.

     (c)   Perform an appropriate test at the 5 % significance level to see if the mean marks
           achieved by the students in the school are higher than the national standard. It can
           be assumed that the marks come from a normal population.                                      [5]

     Two additional students take the test at a later date and the mean mark for all ten students
     is 28.1 and the standard deviation is 8.4.

     For further analysis, a standardized score out of 100 for the ten students is obtained by
     multiplying the scores by 2 and adding 20.

     (e)   For the ten students, find

           (i)    their mean standardized score.

           (ii)   the standard deviation of their standardized score.                                    [3]

     The aircraft for a particular flight has 72 seats. The airline’s records show that historically
     for this flight only 90 % of the people who purchase a ticket arrive to board the flight.
     They assume this trend will continue and decide to sell extra tickets and hope that no
     more than 72 passengers will arrive.

     The number of passengers that arrive to board this flight is assumed to follow a binomial
     distribution with a probability of 0.9.

     (a)   The airline sells 74 tickets for this flight. Find the probability that more than 72
           passengers arrive to board the flight.                                                             [3]

                flight if 72 tickets are sold.                                                                [2]

           (ii)   Find the maximum number of tickets that could be sold if the expected number
                  of passengers who arrive to board the flight must be less than or equal to 72.[2]

     Each passenger pays $150 for a ticket. If too many passengers arrive, then the airline will
     give $300 in compensation to each passenger that cannot board.

     (c)   Find, to the nearest integer, the expected increase or decrease in the money made
           by the airline if they decide to sell 74 tickets rather than 72.[8]
