     This question is about modelling the spread of a computer virus to predict the number
     of computers in a city which will be infected by the virus.

     A systems analyst defines the following variables in a model:

     y t is the number of days since the first computer was infected by the virus.
     y ​Q(t ) ​is the total number of computers that have been infected up to and
        including day t .

     The following data were collected:

             t             10           15           20           25        30        35            40
           ​Q(t )​         20           90          403         1806      8070     32 667       120 146

     (a)   (i)	Find the equation of the regression line of  ​Q(t )​ on t .                                      [2]

           (ii)      Write down the value of r , Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient.               [1]

           (iii)     Explain why it would not be appropriate to conduct a hypothesis test on the
                     value of r found in (a)(ii).                                                                [1]

     A model for the early stage of the spread of the computer virus suggests that

                                                    ​Q′​(t ) = βNQ(t )​

     where N is the total number of computers in a city and  ​β​ is a measure of how easily the
     virus is spreading between computers. Both N and  ​β​ are assumed to be constant.

     (b)   (i)	Find the general solution of the differential equation  ​Q′​(t ) = βNQ(t )​.                     [4]

           (ii)      Using the data in the table write down the equation for an appropriate
                     non-linear regression model.                                                                [2]

           (iii)     Write down the value of  ​R​2​  for this model.                                             [1]

           (iv)      Hence comment on the suitability of the model from (b)(ii) in comparison with the
                     linear model found in part (a).                                                             [2]

           (v)       By considering large values of t write down one criticism of the model found in
                     (b)(ii).[1]

(Question 1 continued)

     (c)      Use your answer from part (b)(ii) to estimate the time taken for the number of infected
              computers to double.                                                                                    [2]

     The data above are taken from city X which is estimated to have 2.6 million computers.
     The analyst looks at data for another city, Y. These data indicate a value of  ​β = 9.64 × ​10​−8​  .

     (d)      Find in which city, X or Y, the computer virus is spreading more easily. Justify your
              answer using your results from part (b).                                                                [3]

     An estimate for  ​Q′​(t ) , t ≥ 5​, can be found by using the formula:
                                                       Q(t + 5) − Q(t − 5)
                                             ​Q′​(t ) ≈ ​ ________________
                                                                    ​​ .
                                                               10
     The following table shows estimates of  ​Q′​(t )​ for city X at different values of t .

              t            10           15           20                25           30      35            40
           ​Q(t )​         20           90          403              1806          8070   32 667     120 146
           ​Q′​(t )​                    a          171.6             766.7          b     11 207.6

     (e)      Determine the value of a and of b . Give your answers correct to one decimal place.                     [2]

     An improved model for  ​Q(t )​ , which is valid for large values of t , is the logistic
     differential equation

                                               ​Q′​(t ) = k Q(t )​(1 − ​  ____

                                                                          Q(t )
                                                                              ​​
                                               ​
     where k and L are constants.
                                                                   ​Q′​(t )
     Based on this differential equation, the graph of  ​​ ____ ​  against  ​Q(t )​  is predicted to be
                                                           Q(t )
     a straight line.

     (f)      (i)	Use linear regression to estimate the value of k and of L .                                        [5]

              (ii)     The solution to the differential equation is given by
                                                                   L

                       where C is a constant.

                       Using your answer to part (f)(i), estimate the percentage of computers in city X
                       that are expected to have been infected by the virus over a long period of time.               [2]

2.   [Maximum mark: 27]

     This question is about a metropolitan area council planning a new town and the
     location of a new toxic waste dump.

     A metropolitan area in a country is modelled as a square. The area has four towns, located
     at the corners of the square. All units are in kilometres with the x-coordinate representing the
     distance east and the y-coordinate representing the distance north from the origin at ​(0 ,   0)​.

     y     Edison is modelled as being positioned at ​E(0 ,   40)​.
     y     Fermitown is modelled as being positioned at ​F(40 ,   40)​.
     y     Gaussville is modelled as being positioned at ​G(40 ,   0)​.
     y     Hamilton is modelled as being positioned at ​H(0 ,   0)​.

     (a)      The model assumes that each town is positioned at a single point. Describe possible
              circumstances in which this modelling assumption is reasonable.                                  [1]

     (b)      Sketch a Voronoi diagram showing the regions within the metropolitan area that are
              closest to each town.                                                                            [1]

     The metropolitan area council decides to build a new town called Isaacopolis located
     at I​ (30 , 20)​.

     A new Voronoi diagram is to be created to include Isaacopolis. The equation of the
                                               3 ​ x + ​ ___
     perpendicular bisector of [IE] is  ​y = ​ __        15 ​  .
                                                    2       2
     (c)      (i)	Find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of [IF].[4]

              (ii)    Given that the coordinates of one vertex of the new Voronoi diagram are ​(20 ,  37.5)​,
                      find the coordinates of the other two vertices within the metropolitan area.             [4]

              (iii)   Sketch this new Voronoi diagram showing the regions within the metropolitan
                      area which are closest to each town.                                                     [2]

     The metropolitan area is divided into districts based on the Voronoi regions found
     in part (c).

     (d)      A car departs from a point due north of Hamilton. It travels due east at constant speed
              to a destination point due North of Gaussville. It passes through the Edison, Isaacopolis
              and Fermitown districts. The car spends 30 % of the travel time in the Isaacopolis district.

              Find the distance between Gaussville and the car’s destination point.                            [4]

(This question continues on the following page)
                                                       –5–                                             2222 – 7208


(Question 2 continued)

      A toxic waste dump needs to be located within the metropolitan area. The council wants to
      locate it as far as possible from the nearest town.

      (e)     (i)	Find the location of the toxic waste dump, given that this location is not on the
                   edge of the metropolitan area.                                                             [4]

              (ii)    Make one possible criticism of the council’s choice of location.                         [1]

      (f)     The toxic waste dump, T, is connected to the towns via a system of sewers.

              The connections are represented in the following matrix, M , where the order of rows




                                                  ⎜                   ⎟
              and columns is (E, F, G, H, I, T).

                                                ⎛1 0 1 1 0 0⎞
                                                    0 1 0 0 0 1
                                            ​ = ​ 1​  
                                            M        ​ 0​ 1​ 0​ 1​ 0​
                                                    1 0 0 1 0 1
                                                    0 0 1 0 1 0
                                                ⎝0 1 0 1 0 1⎠

              A leak occurs from the toxic waste dump and travels through the sewers. The pollution
              takes one day to travel between locations that are directly connected.

              The digit 1 in M represents a direct connection. The values of 1 in the leading diagonal
              of M mean that once a location is polluted it will stay polluted.

              (i)     Find which town is last to be polluted. Justify your answer.                             [3]

              (ii)    Write down the number of days it takes for the pollution to reach the last town.         [1]

              (iii)   A sewer inspector needs to plan the shortest possible route through each of the
                      connections between different locations. Determine an appropriate start point and
                      an appropriate end point of the inspection route.

                      Note that the fact that each location is connected to itself does not correspond to
                      a sewer that needs to be inspected.                                                      [2]
