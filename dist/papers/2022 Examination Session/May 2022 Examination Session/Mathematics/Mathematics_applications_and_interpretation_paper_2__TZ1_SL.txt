Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Boris recorded the number of daylight hours on the first day of each month in a northern
     hemisphere town.

     This data was plotted onto a scatter diagram. The points were then joined by a smooth curve,
     with minimum point (0 ,  8) and maximum point (6 ,  16) as shown in the following diagram.

     Let the curve in the diagram be  ​y = f (t)​ , where t is the time, measured in months,
     since Boris first recorded these values.

     Boris thinks that ​ f (t)​  might be modelled by a quadratic function.

     (a)   Write down one reason why a quadratic function would not be a good model for
           the number of hours of daylight per day, across a number of years.                              [1]

     Paula thinks that a better model is ​ f (t) = a cos (bt) + d​ ,  ​t ≥ 0​ , for specific values of
     a , b and d .

     (b)   For Paula’s model, use the diagram to write down

           (i)     the amplitude.

           (ii)    the period.

           (iii)   the equation of the principal axis.                                                          [4]

     (c)   Hence or otherwise find the equation of this model in the form:                                      [3]

                                                ​f (t) = a cos (bt) + d​

     (d)   For the first year of the model, find the length of time when there are more than
           10 hours and 30 minutes of daylight per day.                                                         [4]

     The true maximum number of daylight hours was 16 hours and 14 minutes.

           recorded in the diagram.                                                                             [3]

        Eddie decides to construct a path across his rectangular grass lawn using pairs of tiles.

        Each tile is 10 cm wide and 20 cm long. The following diagrams show the path after Eddie
        has laid one pair and three pairs of tiles. This pattern continues until Eddie reaches the other
        side of his lawn. When n pairs of tiles are laid, the path has a width of wn centimetres and a
        length ln centimetres.

        The following diagrams show this pattern for one pair of tiles and for three pairs of tiles,
        where the white space around each diagram represents Eddie’s lawn.

                                                                                  diagram not to scale

(Question 3 continued)

     Chester is investigating the relationship between the highest-scoring countries’ Eurovision
     score and their population size to determine whether population size can reasonably be
     used to predict a country’s score.

     The populations of the countries, to the nearest million, are shown in the table.

     Chester finds that, for this data, the Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient
     is  ​r = 0.249​  .

           line for y on x to predict a country’s Eurovision score. Justify your answer.              [2]

     goat can reach all parts of the field up to 4.5 m from the post.

      The aircraft for a particular flight has 72 seats. The airline’s records show that historically
      for this flight only 90 % of the people who purchase a ticket arrive to board the flight.
      They assume this trend will continue and decide to sell extra tickets and hope that no
      more than 72 passengers will arrive.

      The number of passengers that arrive to board this flight is assumed to follow a binomial
      distribution with a probability of 0.9.

      (a)     The airline sells 74 tickets for this flight. Find the probability that more than 72
              passengers arrive to board the flight.                                                                [3]

      (b)     (i)	Write down the expected number of passengers who will arrive to board the
                   flight if 72 tickets are sold.                                                                  [2]

              (ii)   Find the maximum number of tickets that could be sold if the expected number
                     of passengers who arrive to board the flight must be less than or equal to 72.[2]

      Each passenger pays $150 for a ticket. If too many passengers arrive, then the airline will
      give $300 in compensation to each passenger that cannot board.

      (c)     Find, to the nearest integer, the expected increase or decrease in the money made
              by the airline if they decide to sell 74 tickets rather than 72.                                      [8]
