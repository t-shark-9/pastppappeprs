Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page. Full
marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported
by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part
of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided
this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Mackenzie conducted an experiment on the reaction times of teenagers. The results of the
     experiment are displayed in the following cumulative frequency graph.

     (a)   Use the graph to estimate the

     (c)   Determine the 90th percentile of the reaction times from the cumulative frequency graph. [2]

(Question 1 continued)

     Mackenzie created the cumulative frequency graph using the following grouped frequency table.

                                    Reaction time, t (s)     Frequency

                                         ​0 < t ≤ 0.2​             3

     (d)   Write down the value of

           (i)    a;

           (ii)   b .                                                                                          [2]

     (f)   Use your graphic display calculator to find an estimate of the mean reaction time.                  [2]

     Upon completion of the experiment, Mackenzie realized that some values were grouped
     incorrectly in the frequency table. Some reaction times recorded in the interval  ​0 < t ≤ 0.2​ 
     should have been recorded in the interval  ​0.2 < t ≤ 0.4​  .

     (g)   Suggest how, if at all, the estimated mean and estimated median reaction times will
           change if the errors are corrected. Justify your response.                                          [4]

     Scott purchases food for his dog in large bags and feeds the dog the same amount of
     dog food each day. The amount of dog food left in the bag at the end of each day can be
     modelled by an arithmetic sequence.

     On a particular day, Scott opened a new bag of dog food and fed his dog. By the end of the
     third day there were 115.5 cups of dog food remaining in the bag and at the end of the eighth
     day there were 108 cups of dog food remaining in the bag.

     (a)   Find the number of cups of dog food

           (i)    fed to the dog per day;

           (ii)   remaining in the bag at the end of the first day.                                   [4]

     (b)   Calculate the number of days that Scott can feed his dog with one bag of food.             [2]

     In 2021, Scott spent $625 on dog food. Scott expects that the amount he spends on dog food
     will increase at an annual rate of 6.4 %.

     The Texas Star is a Ferris wheel at the state fair in Dallas. The Ferris wheel has a diameter
     of 61.8 m. To begin the ride, a passenger gets into a chair at the lowest point on the wheel,
     which is 2.7 m above the ground, as shown in the following diagram. A ride consists of
     multiple revolutions, and the Ferris wheel makes 1.5 revolutions per minute.

                                                                                  diagram not to scale

     The height of a chair above the ground, h , measured in metres, during a ride on the Ferris
     wheel can be modelled by the function  ​h(t) = −a cos (bt) + d​ , where t is the time, in seconds,
     since a passenger began their ride.

      (c)     (i)	Find the value of k .

              (ii)   Use the model to find how much coffee the cafe should make each morning to
                     maximize its profit.                                                                               [3]

      (d)     Sketch the graph of C against x , labelling the maximum point and the x-intercepts
              with their coordinates.                                                                                   [3]

      The manager of the cafe wishes to serve as many customers as possible.

      (e)     Determine the maximum amount of coffee the cafe can make that will not result in a
              loss of money for the morning.                                                                            [2]
