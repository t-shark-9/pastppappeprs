Notes for examiners:

1. Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the maximum
marks as indicated.

2. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR on
the script where you are rewarding this.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to 2
decimal places or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may
only be penalized ONCE for each type of error across all subparts of (b) questions.

(b)   (i)     Using information from Table 1, calculate the change in Uruguay’s current
              account balance between 2018 and 2019.                                                       [2]

              Current account in 2018:
              (18.72 – 19.15) – 3.66 + 0.10 = -3.99

              Current account in 2019:
              (18.52 – 17.88) – 3.05 + 0.19 = -2.22

              Change in the current account balance:
              (-2.22) – (-3.99) = (US)$ billion 1.77

              OR

              (1.77/3.99) × 100% = 44.36%

              Any valid working is sufficient for [1] (eg correct calculation of either initial or final
              current account balance or if the units are missing).

      (ii)    Using information from Table 1, state whether Uruguay is facing a deficit or
              a surplus in its balance of trade in goods and services in 2019.                             [1]

              the balance of trade is in surplus

      (iii)   Using information from Table 2, sketch the change in Uruguay’s Lorenz curve
              from 2010 to 2015.                                                                           [2]

               the right, with an increase in price, quantity and revenue OR an
               explanation that greater demand from China has led to (higher
               price and quantity and hence) greater (total) revenue since
               revenue = PxQ.
       2       There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.      3–4
               For a demand and supply diagram showing a shift of demand to

               revenue = PxQ.

      Candidates who label diagrams incorrectly can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram. A title
      is not necessary.

               curve to the left and a fall in the value of the peso OR an
               explanation that a fall in exports (revenue) implies that
               foreigners would need to purchase less peso to pay for the
               country’s exports, decreasing the demand for the peso and
               leading to fall in the exchange rate (depreciation).

                shifting to the left and a reduction in the number of
                workers OR for explaining that the (permanent) loss in demand
                for workers with specific skills (manufacturing sector) leading to
                workers losing their jobs (due to a lack of demand for their
                skills).
       2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.         3–4

                workers losing their jobs (due to a lack of demand for their
                skills).

      Candidates may draw a labour market diagram that assumes the wage rate is fixed
      (sticky) and state that the difference between the number of workers demanded and
      supplied illustrates the structurally unemployed. This approach, if properly explained,
      may be awarded full level 2.

      NB Candidates may provide an alternative explanation, which should be fully rewarded.
      They may draw a supply and demand (or international trade) diagram showing a
      decrease in the demand (or domestic production) for machinery (or any other good
      imported from the EU) and state that the decrease in the demand for machinery
      would lead to a decrease in the workers who are employed in the industry and whose
      skills may not be transferable to other industries.

      Candidates who label diagrams incorrectly can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      The vertical axis may be labelled real wage, real wage rate, wage or price of labour and
      the horizontal axis labelled quantity of labour or number of workers or just labour.

               output OR for explaining that reducing the common external
               tariff would increase efficiency (productivity) by increasing
               competition (between firms) (and/or increase the quantity/quality
               of resources) and hence lead to an increase in potential (long-

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be Average (General) Price Level, or Price Level. The
      horizontal axis may be real output, real national output, real income, real national
      income, real GDP or real Y. Any abbreviation of the previous terms is acceptable.
      Alternatively, a Keynesian AS may be drawn with the vertical portion shifting to the
      right. A title is not necessary.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
• a definition of economic integration
• a definition of a common market
• a definition of a free-trade agreement
• diagrams (eg AD/AS, tariff, quota).

 • The advantages of membership of the MERCOSUR common market and EU-
   MERCOSUR free trade agreement:
   o Greater access to a market of 290 million consumers through the MERCOSUR
      common market and possibility to access the markets of the 27 members of the
      EU; offer potential for economies of scale for Uruguayan producers who would
      otherwise be limited to the small size of the domestic market (Text A, paragraph
      1 and Text B, paragraph 1).
   o Increase in export revenue has contributed to economic growth and higher real
      GNI per capita (Text A, paragraphs 2 and 3, Table 2) and poverty reduction
      (Text A, paragraph 5; Table 2). Although the country benefitted significantly
      from exports to China, which is not a member of either trade bloc (Text A,
      paragraph 2).
   o Membership to the EU-MERCOSUR free trade agreement may lead to greater
      exports to the EU (Text B, paragraphs 1 and 2) and may help restore Uruguay’s
      growth rate (Text A, paragraph 3). This could be contrasted with the
      negative/low balance of trade (table 1). But quotas, which cause inefficiencies
      and higher prices, remain for some items (Text B, paragraph 2).
   o With freedom of movement of labour within MERCOSUR, there are greater
      employment opportunities. However, the freedom of movement might have
      contributed to the unemployment rate (Text A, paragraph 5).
   o Uruguay’s tariff-free access to MERCOSUR and the EU makes it an attractive
      destination for foreign investors (Text A, paragraph 6 and Text B, paragraph 4).
   o A high common external tariff protects Uruguayan producers from cheap
      imports from China (Text C, paragraph 1).
   o Membership in a trading bloc may allow for stronger bargaining power in
      multilateral negotiations such as the EU-MERCOSUR free trade agreement.
   o Greater political stability and cooperation.
• The disadvantages of membership of the MERCOSUR common market and free
   trade agreement:
   o Uruguay is susceptible to external shocks (Text A, paragraph 3). As Uruguay is
      over reliant on trade of primary products and is not diversifying its exports (Text
      A, paragraph 4), this may explain why the Gini index and real GNI per capita
      have only narrowly improved since the end of the commodity boom (Table 2).
   o Increased production of meat, paper and wood for exports represent a threat to
      sustainability (Text B, paragraphs 1 and 4).
   o Lowered protectionist measures may lead to more structural unemployment
      (Text B, paragraph 3) once tariffs are removed/reduced as part of the EU-
      MERCOSUR free trade agreement.
   o Uruguay has suffered from a loss of sovereignty, which prevents the country
      from entering bilateral trade agreement(s) and reducing its tariffs (Text C,
      paragraphs 1 and 2).
   o Challenge to multilateral trading negotiations.

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for an international trade diagram. World
      supply may also be labelled S(EU) or S(UK) or S(EU+UK) or just P(W) or (P(UK) or
      P(EU) or (P(EU+UK). The domestic demand and supply curves can just be labelled D
      and S. A title is not necessary.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
• a definition of economic development
• a definition of government intervention/interventionist policies
• a definition of market-oriented policies
• diagrams (eg AD/AS, poverty cycle).

Intervention which may lead to development
• Military intervention to bring stability to regions experiencing conflicts (Text D,
   paragraph 2).
• The high interest rates help maintain the fixed exchange rate which brings stability
   (Text D, paragraph 6).
• The policies under the Growth and Employment Strategy would help increase
   human capital and increase productivity, which may help many break the poverty
   cycle and increase LRAS and export revenues (which could result in higher
   incomes) (Text E, paragraphs 1, 3 and 4).
• Better infrastructure would bring in FDI/increased investment (Text E, paragraph
   1).
• The higher minimum wage helps increase workers’ well-being but comes with the
   possibility of unemployment and may make it difficult for the authorities to reduce
   the size of the informal sector (Text E, paragraph 3).
• Subsidies help to keep electricity, food and fuel prices low and accessible (Text D,
   paragraph 4; Text E, paragraph 4).

Limitations of intervention
• Fiscal deficits and government debt may increase (Text D, paragraphs 2 and 3).
• Some forms of intervention are too short-term such as subsidies (Text D,
  paragraph 4) or may not be sustainable in the long-term (Text D, paragraph 2).
• There is an opportunity cost to intervention (Text D, paragraph 4).
• Subsidies for fuel can increase external costs (Text D, paragraph 4).
• Intervention through higher interest rates to support the overvalued currency (Text
  D, paragraph 6) will have a contractionary impact on the economy and this could
  limit the impact of expansionary fiscal policy (Text D, paragraph 3).
• High interest rates also mean that entrepreneurs have more difficulty in obtaining
  loans (Table 3).
• The fixed (over-valued) exchange rate raises export prices, which hampers trade
  (but does contribute to lower prices of fertilizers etc) (Text D, paragraph 6).
• Military intervention may reduce freedoms and development (Text D, paragraph 2).

Market-oriented policies which may lead to development
• Deregulation/decrease in bureaucracy may lead to an increase in investment (Text
  D, paragraph 5). This may help promote local entrepreneurship.
• Membership in free trade groups allows for higher export revenue which would
  lead to economic growth. The EU and UK currently account for almost half of trade
  with Cameroon (Table 3).
• The removal of tariffs on fertilizers (Text F) would help decrease farmers’ costs
  and lead to more competitive exports (Text E, paragraph 2). This could also help
  decrease the need for subsidies in the long-term (Text E, paragraph 3).
• Removal of tariffs on capital goods (Text F) may lead to higher productivity and/or
  reduce costs for firms.

Limitations of market-oriented policies
• Membership of free trade groups may worsen/not reduce Cameroon’s persistent
  trade deficit if imports increase more than exports (Text D, paragraph 6).
• Without adequate provision of infrastructure and provision of education, the
  country will continue to lack diversification of economic activities. Economic growth
  may not be sustained due to the volatility of commodity prices (Text D, paragraph
  2).
• Some policies such as tax incentives and subsidies may not benefit those working
  in the informal sector. Such policies would thus have limited effectiveness in
  reducing poverty due to the size of the informal economy (Text D, paragraph 3)
  and level of poverty (Text D, paragraph 4).
• Relative poverty may continue to increase due to disparities in benefits from
  export-led growth (Text D, paragraph 4).

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
if appropriate, should be rewarded.
