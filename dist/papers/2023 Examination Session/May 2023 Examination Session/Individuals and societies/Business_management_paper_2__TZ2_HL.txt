     Call it Magic (CIM) is an online jewellery store that sells silver earrings. It has completed its
     first year of trading, during which it sold 1000 pairs of earrings. CIM’s selling prices are low
     compared to those of other jewellery stores. The average unit cost per pair of earrings is $5,
     and overhead costs are already at a minimum level.

2.   Urban Express (UE)

           Urban Express Ltd. (UE), a private limited company, owns and operates city buses
           in an economically unstable country. Interest rates are forecasted to increase in the
           next few years. The government of the country has approached UE to set up a public-
           private partnership (PPP) to purchase electric buses. UE has forecasted the following
           annual net cash flows for UE’s first purchase of electric buses.

                                             Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Dean West Tutoring (DWT)

     Dean West was an International Baccalaureate (IB) business management teacher in
     a developing country (country X). He also offered private tuition to students in need of
     additional support. Five years ago, he decided to leave teaching and set up Dean West
     Tutoring (DWT).

     DWT has grown in the last five years and now employs ten tutors offering face-to-face tuition
     in a range of IB subjects. The tutors work part-time. DWT takes a percentage of the fees that
     students pay for the tutoring. To establish positive branding for DWT, Dean expects all tutors
     to follow a strict code of conduct. He also reviews each tutor’s performance and student
     feedback every week. Some tutors are feeling demotivated.

     With the worldwide growth of online learning in the last few years, Dean saw an opportunity
     to expand DWT. He discovered a large market in Asia, particularly in China. Online one-to-
     one tuition in Asia is charged at an hourly rate that is three times higher than that usually
     charged in country X. DWT would need to hire agents in Asia to find potential students who
     want to learn online.

     As the new school year is starting soon in China, Dean will need to act quickly. He is
     considering drawing up a Gantt chart to assist his planning.

     However, DWT’s existing tutors are concerned about the expansion due to their lack of
     experience and equipment for online tutoring.

     Dean is now considering two options to ensure that DWT has enough suitable tutors for
     expansion to online tuition:
     y Option 1: Offer training and support to the existing tutors.
     y Option 2: Recruit new tutors from anywhere in the world with online teaching experience.

     (a)   Define the term branding.[2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for DWT of expanding into online tuition
           in Asia.                                                                                    [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Dean of drawing a Gantt chart to
           assist his planning for the expansion to online tuition.                                    [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether Dean should choose Option 1 or Option 2 to ensure that he has
           enough tutors for the expansion to online tuition.                                        [10]

4.   Les Amis PLC (LA)

     Les Amis PLC (LA) is a public limited company that sells casual clothes for men. Its target
     market is high-income professionals who value a personalized sales service. LA has
     developed brand awareness and operates 42 shops around the country. It owns 10 of these
     shops and leases the remaining 32. LA employs 950 people, who receive a higher wage
     than the industry average. LA also pays commission to sales staff working in the shops. LA’s
     organizational culture values the wellbeing and needs of its employees. Labour turnover is
     very low.

     Recently, LA launched an online shop. Since then, online sales have increased considerably,
     while sales in LA’s physical shops have fallen. Shareholders want LA to close all its physical
     shops and sell online only. However, many of the employees will be made redundant if the
     physical shops are closed.

     LA’s current chief executive officer (CEO), Marie Brossard, has a democratic leadership
     style, and she regularly meets with employees and encourages feedback. LA’s managers
     and employee representatives have never had a conflict. Marie plans to discuss the
     shareholders’ desire to close LA’s physical shops with all the shop managers.

     Customer returns of clothing orders at LA have increased substantially. Most returns are from
     online customers unfamiliar with LA’s clothing sizes. Marie has consulted the e-commerce
     department on how to reduce the increasing cost of returns, and they have suggested
     investing in expensive software that will enable online customers to find their correct clothing size.

     (a)   Define the term target market.[2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of paying commission to sales
           staff working in its shops.                                                                   [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of Marie’s democratic
           leadership style.                                                                             [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether LA should close all its physical shops and sell only online.                [10]




                                                                                                 Turn over

5.     RUZMA Coffee Ltd. (RC)

       RUZMA Coffee Ltd. (RC), a private limited company, owns a national chain of coffee booths1.
       It is known for its process innovation and its excellent and consistent quality of coffee. As part
       of its corporate social responsibility (CSR) objectives, RC buys large quantities of fair trade2
       organic coffee from producers.

       Two years ago, RC began to replace employees with robots. RC’s long-term objective is
       to have booths served entirely by robots. Until this objective is met, RC has cut dividend
       payments to shareholders. RC uses a price-skimming strategy whenever it replaces an
       employee with a robot.

       Many consumers are excited about the novelty of RC’s robots. However, a recent economic
       downturn and increasing protests against businesses that replace employees with robots
       have affected RC’s reputation and sales. RC is thinking of boosting its ethical objectives.
       For every employee replaced by a robot, RC plans to offer enhanced redundancy
       (unemployment) payments and a $2000 grant towards future training.

       Other national coffee chains have started to use the same process innovation as RC.
       Although RC has a high gross profit margin and the market is expected to grow, some
       directors remain worried about future dividends.

       Recently, a worldwide coffee chain, Coffee Extra (CE), unexpectedly offered to buy RC and
       is willing to pay twice its value. CE is known for delivering coffee via drones. CE attracts bad
       publicity because of the low salaries paid to its employees and their poor working conditions.

       RC’s board of directors is not sure whether they should accept CE’s offer.

       (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for RC of using a price-skimming
             strategy for the coffee sold in booths served by robots.                                       [4]
