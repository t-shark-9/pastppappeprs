Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

 1. “Military weakness was responsible for the fall of the Umayyads.” To what extent do you agree with
    this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      military weakness was responsible for the fall of the Umayyads. Causes may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the growth of widespread armed opposition particularly in Iran where powerful armies
      were raised by Abu Muslim, tribal and sectarian opponents joined the revolt to produce an
      overwhelming force. Other relevant factors may be addressed: the lack of support from non-Arab
      Muslims, alienation caused by the centralized and elitist government, religious opposition which
      claimed the Umayyads were sinful and impious usurpers and an increasing unwillingness of
      many citizens to serve the state. A series of weak Caliphs after 740 was also a factor.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

 2. Examine the reasons for the development of the Golden Age of Islam.
      The question requires that candidates consider the inter-relationships between various causes
      and the development of the Golden Age of Islam Causes may predate the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the fact that secure
      trade and communication routes allowed knowledge to flow into Baghdad from a vast area from
      North Africa to India. The political and financial support of scholarship by powerful leaders such
      as Harun al-Rashid was crucial. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
      Islamic tradition of scholarship as well as the collection and preservation of knowledge from
      conquered territories provided extensive material for study, the wealth of the empire provided
      support for scholars, the Islamic traditions of religious tolerance encouraged scholars from other
      religions to participate in the intellectual advances. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –5–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

 3. To what extent were economic factors mainly responsible for the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      economic factors were mainly responsible for the foundation of the Fatimid dynasty. Causes may
      predate the time frame but must be clearly linked to issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to merchants who supported Fatimid ideals. They helped transport missionaries to expand
      Fatimid influence over a wide area and the income from trade supported the growth of the army
      and government. The wealth from the acquisition of Egypt expanded the army, built institutions of
      learning and expanded Fatimid missionary work. Candidates may also refer to the support of the
      Berber tribes which provided a powerful military force, the weakness and unpopularity of the
      Abbasids and Fatimid policies of religious toleration and ethnic diversity allowed them to attract
      talented individuals. Their interpretation of Islam and the concept of the Mahdi attracted many
      people with spiritual interests. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be clearly presented and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

 4. “The most important reason for the success of the Fatimid Empire was effective
    leadership.” Discuss with reference to two of the following: al-Mu’izz (953–975); al-Hakim (996–
    1021); al-Mustansir (1036–1094).


      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that the most
      important reason for the success of the Fatimid Empire was effective leadership. Candidates
      must refer to two of the leaders named in the question. Causes may predate the time frame but
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may prioritize their
      discussion of one leader, but both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      achievements of their chosen leaders in territorial and economic expansion, religious
      relationships, support of learning and the expansion of the Ismaili faith. Maintenance of power
      and control; of military and political factions and unrest may also be examined. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed such as Fatimid religious and ethnic relations, strength of their
      opponents, economic power, and the appeal of the Ismaili philosophy. Candidates’ opinions must
      be clearly presented and supported by religious evidence.
                                                 –6–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

 5. “Superior tactics were the main reason for the success of the First Crusade.” To what extent do you
    agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      superior tactics were the main reason for the success of the First Crusade. Causes may predate
      the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the fact that the members of the Crusading army were all professional soldiers with a high
      degree of training and equipment which gave them a tactical advantage. Crusaders were skilled
      in siege warfare which allowed them to capture Jerusalem and other cities. Their leaders were
      skilled in warfare and understood tactics. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example
      the political and military disunity of the Muslim forces, the religious zeal of the Crusaders
      maintained their morale and allowed them to overcome hardships, the logistical and strategic
      advice provided by the Byzantine Empire as well as the economic support provided by the Italian
      city-states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented clearly and supported with
      appropriate evidence.


 6. Evaluate the impact of the Crusades on the Byzantine Empire.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Crusades on the
      Byzantine Empire. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to positive impacts such as the success
      of the First Crusade which weakened the Muslims and added territory to the Byzantine Empire,
      the prospect of further assistance from the West raised Byzantine morale. Negative impacts may
      include the ongoing disputes with the Crusaders which destroyed the hope of co-operation and
      caused a loss of territory. The powerful Muslim response to the Crusades endangered the
      Byzantine Empire. The Fourth Crusade captured and looted Constantinople which crippled the
      Byzantine Empire. Byzantine territory was destroyed by Christian armies on their way to the
      Crusades. The collapse of the Crusading movement removed any hope for the Byzantine Empire
      in their struggle with the Muslims. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –7–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

 7. Evaluate the effects of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire on Europe.
      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effects on Europe of the
      foundation of the Ottoman Empire weighing up its importance or otherwise. Consequences may
      extend beyond the time frame but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the loss of territory by European powers in the Balkan region, The
      changed strategic situation as the Ottomans threatened Italy and the Eastern Mediterranean.
      The Ottoman capture of Constantinople was a severe physical and psychological blow to the
      Christian world. It also gave the Ottomans control of the trade routes to Asia which limited the
      power of Venice and others and may have inspired the search for new routes to Asia. Ottoman
      government attracted many immigrants from Europe which was a major loss of intellectual,
      artistic, and commercial talent, the refuge provided for minorities fleeing European persecution
      served to further strengthen the Ottomans. Ottoman diplomacy succeeded in making treaties with
      some European states which divided Europe and limited its ability to resist Ottoman and Islamic
      expansion. Candidates' opinion or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.



 8. Compare and contrast the contribution of two of the following to the power of the Ottoman
  Empire: Mehmet II (1451–1481); Selim I (1512–1520); Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566).

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two of the individuals named in the question in terms of their contribution to the power of the
     Ottoman Empire referring to both throughout. There does not have to be an equal number of each.
     Results may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may refer to their military records, their territorial acquisitions and conquests,
     their establishment and operation of government and legal systems, their relationships with subject
     peoples, their economic polices including trade, the nature, and results of their interactions with
     foreign powers. Candidates may also refer to their development of educational, intellectual, and
     cultural institutions and the impact of these on the power of the Empire. Candidates’ opinions and
     conclusions must be clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                –8–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

 9. To what extent was the Almoravid jihad the main reason for the decline of the Ghana Empire?
   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
   Almoravid jihad was the main reason for the decline of the Ghana Empire. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of the rise of the Ghana Empire as the richest state in West Africa since the 9th century and
   of Almoravids leadership as the main Muslim dynasty in Northern Africa between the 11th and the 12th
   centuries. They may also analyse the religious, political, and commercial relationship between the
   Ghana Empire and the Almoravids. Candidates may refer to the basis of Ghana Empire’s power
   related to gold and copper trade and to Almoravid’s conquests. Other relevant aspects may be
   considered, for example, the existence of competitive merchants and chiefs that rebelled against
   Ghana’s king, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
   be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

 10. Evaluate the impact of the Indian Ocean trade on the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili culture.
   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Indian Ocean trade on
   the emergence of a cosmopolitan Swahili culture, weighing up its strengths and limitations or
   otherwise. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
   the question. Candidates may refer to the emergence of city-states alongside the Eastern Africa coast
   because of the engagement of local people in the trade of goods like gold, crystal rock or ivory that
   were sold in the Indian Ocean network, mainly to Muslim Arabic and Persian merchants. Other relevant
   factors may be addressed, as the archeological evidence of mosques that shows the conversion of
   Eastern Africa city-states inhabitants to Islam and the rise of Swahili language as a result of the
   combination of Arabic and local African languages. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence
                                                  –9–                   M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

 11. Examine the importance of Usman Dan Fodio’s actions to the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate.

   The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between Usman Dan Fodio’s
   actions and the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate. Results may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must
   be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Dan Fodio was a Fulani preacher who criticized
   Hausa rulers of nowadays Northern Nigeria for their unorthodox Islamic practices and sumptuous
   lifestyle. He also questioned the exploitation of people of Fulani and Fulbe origins, as well as of Hausa
   peasants, who suffered the imposition of heavy taxes, while only an aristocratic elite enjoyed royal
   privileges and the access to communal lands. Candidates may refer to Dan Fodio’s army that he
   organized with the participation of dissatisfied peoples and to the war that led to the conquest of Hausa
   Kingdoms and the foundation of Sokoto Caliphate. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
   presented and clearly supported by appropriate evidence.

 12. “British intervention was the main reason for the emergence of the Madhist State in Sudan.” To
     what extent do you agree with this statement?
   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that British
   intervention was the main reason for the emergence of the Mahdi State in Sudan in 1881. During the
   19th century, Egypt controlled Sudan and exploited its natural resources and labor force. At the same
   time, Great Britain increased its influence in Egypt, mainly after the acquisition of Ismail Pasha’s share
   of the Suez Canal in 1875. British intervention included the designation of a governor in Sudan, George
   Charles Gordon, who sent Christian missionaries to the country. Considering this background,
   candidates will refer to the rise of Sudanese cleric Muhammad Ahmad, who organized military forces
   against the Egyptian government and besieged Khartoum, naming himself the Mahdi and creating a
   new state. Other relevant factors may be addressed, as the religious nature of the Mahdi, who attacked
   Egypt and Sudan’s British governor, claiming the right of restoring Islamic principles. Candidates’
   opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –                M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

 13. “Rivalry between African states was the main reason for the expansion of the Atlantic slave
     trade.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?
   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that rivalry
   between African states was the main reason for the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade. Many African
   states transformed their economies to make the slave trade their most important activity, ensuring a
   permanent provision through the organization of wars of capture that implied access to weapons
   distributed by Europeans. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the competition that emerged
   among African rulers for the access to weapons or they may prioritize the assessment of the
   Europeans’ actions aimed to create or awaken rivalries between them. Other relevant factors may be
   addressed, for example, that rivalry resulted in local rulers’ increased participation to prevent
   marginalization from the benefits of trade and loss of political power, or also to avoid their own people’s
   enslavement. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

 14. Examine the contribution of the rise of legitimate commerce to the decline of the Atlantic slave trade
     in the 19th century.
   The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the rise of legitimate
   commerce and the decline of Atlantic slave trade in the 19th century. This trade had enabled the
   provision of a labor force for the plantations of continental America and the Caribbean for more than
   three hundred years. Nevertheless, the capture of human beings as a central activity began to be
   replaced in Africa by the production of raw materials. This trade was named legitimate commerce
   because Great Britain had prohibited slave trade in 1807. Candidates may refer to the importance that
   these raw materials had to Western industrialized countries for manufacturing goods. Other relevant
   aspects may be considered, for example, that enslaved Africans transformed themselves in the most
   important workforce inside the continent, as main productors of raw materials for the industrialized
   world. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence.
                                                  – 11 –               M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

 15. Evaluate the significance of missionaries and explorers to the growth of European activity in Africa.
   Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of missionaries and explorers to the growth of
   European activity in Africa, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Results may extend beyond the
   timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. When Europeans began
   to expand in order to find new trade routes in the 15th century, they circumnavigated Africa settling
   factories and forts only on the coasts. They did not start exploring the continent inland until the 19th
   century, when Christian missionaries and explorers arrived. While the first wanted to convert local
   people, the others claimed scientific purposes, like the study of wildlife. However, they also looked for
   natural resources and the course of main rivers to facilitate penetration. Candidates may offer equal
   coverage of the activities developed by missionaries and explorers. Other relevant factors may be
   addressed, for example, the importance of their actions as preparatory to the colonization process.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

16. Compare and contrast the consequences of the activities of King Leopold II of Belgium and De
    Brazza in the Congo region.
   The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between the
   activities of King Leopold II and De Brazza in the Congo region, referring to both throughout. There
   does not need to be an equal number of each. King Leopold promoted the exploration of the area
   through the African International Association (AIA), and created the Congo Free State, while De Brazza
   was an explorer himself and his activities led to the formation of French Congo. Both signed treaties
   with local chiefs to obtain rights on the territory and exploited resources using local labour force.
   Nevertheless, Leopold’s activities became notorious for the extreme violence against Africans inflicted
   through concessionary companies. The consequences of exploration may extend beyond the
   timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may list and
   explain the kind of actions that Leopold and De Brazza developed in order to compare them.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17. “German military power was the main reason for the failure of the Herero and Nama resistance in
    Namibia.” Discuss.
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role played by
   German military power in the failure of the Herero and Nama resistance in Namibia. The territory had
   been colonized in the late 19th century by Germans, who appropriated the lands that belonged to local
   communities and distributed them among European settlers. As pastoralist people, the Herero and
   Nama were particularly affected because they lost access to water and land. Besides, they were
   transformed into enslaved workers. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the actions that both
   communities started to recover their lands and of German military strategies against them, including
   surprise attacks. Candidates may refer also to the imprisonment of local people in concentration
   camps, where they were subjected to forced labour. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
   example, the army arrested men, women, and children, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

18. Examine the reasons for the Asante resistance to British intervention in the 19th century.
   The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Asante resistance
   and British intervention in the 19th century. The abolition of slave trade by Great Britain in 1807 had
   affected the Asante economy because they were main providers in the traffic of human beings. The
   British began to patrol their territory in order to verify the effective end of slave trade and at the same
   time extended their influence to gain control of the Asante area. Candidates may refer to the extent of
   British territorial intervention that led to the 1873, 1896 and 1900 wars. Other relevant aspects may be
   considered, for example, that the objective of Asante resistance during the confrontations was to keep
   their sovereignty in the face of the colonialist expansion of Great Britain, which eventually established
   a protectorate along Asante territories and incorporated them into the Gold Coast colony in 1902.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

 19. “Economic and social developments in Kenya under British rule up to 1963 were mainly
     negative.” Discuss.
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   economic and social developments in Kenya under British rule up to 1963 were mainly negative.
   Colonialism in Kenya promoted agricultural production for international markets. European settlers
   were given large tracts of land from which the traditional owners were dispossessed. Their economic
   status was reduced to that of wage labour. Living conditions were poor and mobility was limited by
   pass laws. Homelessness increased and many were reduced to living in poverty in cities. These
   conditions fuelled the growth of the Mau Mau Rebellion. In addition, education and other social
   supports were limited. A system of racial discrimination limited the opportunities of native Kenyans.
   Other relevant factors may be addressed such as the availability of some higher education through
   missionary schools and the gradual emergence of a Kenyan middle class and a growing number of
   government officials. Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
   appropriate evidence.

20. Evaluate the impact of German and British rule in Tanganyika up to 1961.
   Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of German and British rule in Tanganyika up to 1961,
   weighing up their strength and limitations. After occupation, Germans organized a military regime and
   promoted a plantation economy. They also developed a relationship with local rulers in order to have
   access to the local labour force. After Germany was defeated in the First World War, the colony’s
   administration was assigned to Great Britain, as a mandate of the League of Nations that turned into
   a trusteeship in 1945. The British put into practice a centralized civil government, but they also
   appealed to the intervention of native chiefs at the local level and developed cash crops. Candidates
   may offer equal coverage of political and economic results of German and British governments, or they
   may prioritize their evaluation of social changes. Candidates may refer also to the level of power that
   both colonial rules granted to traditional chiefs. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
   clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21. Evaluate the impact of external factors on the liberation war in Angola.
   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of external factors on the
   liberation war in Angola, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two most relevant local
   movements that participated in the war were the Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA),
   related to the Third World interests, the Soviet Union and Cuba, and the National Union for the Total
   Independence of Angola (UNITA), initially allied with China, but supported subsequently by the United
   States and South Africa. In times of the Cold War, and as a consequence of Angola’s rich natural
   resources, the ideology of the triumphant movement became an international matter of interest, mainly
   when the leftist MPLA began to gain power. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the different
   countries that intervened in the war and of the interests they represented. Other important aspects
   may be addressed, such as Angola’s relevance to colonial Portuguese government and its international
   allies. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence

22. Examine the contribution of Nkrumah and the Convention People’s Party (CPP) to
    the achievement of independence in Ghana in 1957.
   The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the contribution of
   Nkrumah and the Convention People’s Party (CPP) and the achievement of independence in Ghana
   in 1957. After the Second World War, British colonial government began to grant political participation
   to local people in Gold Coast. As a result, the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) emerged.
   Although their members asked for self-government in the shortest time possible, it was a conservative
   party that mainly searched to protect local businessmen’s interests. Things changed with the return of
   Kwame Nkrumah from the United States and the United Kingdom, where he had been studying for ten
   years. Facing popular discontent with economic and political conditions, Nkrumah promoted the Accra
   riots and founded the CPP in 1949, launching the Positive Action campaign. Candidates may offer a
   coverage of the activities that Nkrumah and the CPP developed in the following years, examining their
   effectiveness to reach emancipation. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
   supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23. “Economic factors were the main reason for the Ottoman’s weak response to European challenges in
    the second half of the 19th century.” Discuss.
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   economic factors were the main reason for the Ottoman’s weak response to European challenges in
   the second half of the 19th century. Causes may predate the time frame but must be clearly linked to
   the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the lack of industrial development, the
   dependence on foreign countries for loans to maintain the government, the domination of trade by
   foreign merchants which limited development. The Ottoman taxation system was antiquated and
   could not support the expense of modernization. Other relevant factors may include, a weak military
   lacking modern weapons and training, a population divided by ethnicity and religion leading to
   internal revolts, opposition to modernization from the religious leaders and a succession of weak
   leaders who were unable to bring needed change. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions must be
   presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24. “Political repression was the main reason for the growth of the Committee of Union and Progress up
    to 1909.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?
   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that political
   repression was the main reason for the growth of the Committee of Union and Progress up to 1909.
   Reasons may predate the timeframe but must be linked to the issue raised in the question.
   Candidates may refer to the suspension of the Constitution of 1876 by Abdul Hamid and his
   repressive 30-year regime which angered the supporters of political change. Many citizens who had
   acquired a modern education and knowledge of the outside world were frustrated by the lack of
   political and social progress. The increasing control of the economy and industry by foreign powers
   and the military humiliations of the Empire, encouraged nationalists to support change. Many
   minority groups joined the CUP in the hopes of escaping the oppression they suffered under Abdul
   Hamid. The CUP program to develop social reforms and a more secular state attracted many
   supporters especially amongst the educated. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be clearly
   presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25. Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, the mandate system in Iraq and Transjordan.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and
   results of the establishment of the mandate system in Iraq and Transjordan. Candidates may refer to
   the creation of these mandates, which were the result of the Versailles Conference attempting to
   regulate the administration of the territory acquired by Britain in the Middle East, after the First World
   War. Britain acquired these mandates for strategic and economic reasons. When discussing Iraq,
   candidates may refer to the creation of the kingdom of Iraq with Feisal as king with an Iraqi
   parliament being created in 1924, although Britain retained influence. The discovery of oil gave a
   major boost to the economy and the infrastructure and boundary disputes with Turkey and Saudi
   Arabia were resolved. There were outbreaks of rebellion by nationalist groups which were
   suppressed, however anti-British agitation continued due to the presence of British bases and the
   domination of the oil industry by British interests. Britain declared Iraq an independent state in 1932.
   Transjordan was recognized as an independent state, separate from the Palestine mandate in 1923,
   with British control over the army and, after 1928, British guidance in foreign affairs and finance, with
   Britain subsidizing the state. By 1946 it was an independent state with Emir Abdullah as king. There
   was limited opposition to the British mandate due to the need for subsidies and the popularity of
   Abdullah.


26. Examine the political and economic developments up to 1945 in one of the following: Iran; Saudi
    Arabia; or a North African state.

   The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship of political and economic
   developments up to 1945 in one of the following: Iran; Saudi Arabia; a North African state.
   Candidates may offer equal coverage of each, or they may prioritize their examination of one of
   them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the nature
   and development of the political system including its structure, constitutional type, and individual
   rights. Economic developments may involve industrialization, development of resources, trade links,
   infrastructure, and changes in government economic policies as well as changing employment
   patterns and standards of living. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions must be clearly presented
   and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27. Evaluate the impact of the failure of the League of Nations to deal with Italian aggression in
    Abyssinia.
   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the failure of the League of
   Nations to deal with Italian aggression in Abyssinia, evaluating the impact of the League’s failure
   internationally. Italian invasion took place in 1935. The aggression was not a surprise for the League
   of Nations because their members knew that a military Italian garrison had been stationed near the
   Ethiopian border in November 1934. Nevertheless, the international organization did not take any
   action to prevent the aggression and after the invasion their members only applied economic sanctions
   that did not affect vital Italian resources. Candidates may refer to the discredit that the absence of
   intervention implied for the League of Nations. Other consequences may extend beyond the timeframe
   to include the approach of Italy to Germany prior to the Second World War. Candidates’ opinions or
   conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28. Evaluate the effectiveness of the policies of the Economic Community of West African
    States (ECOWAS).
   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the policies of the
   Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), weighing up its strengths and limitations or
   otherwise. This organization was created in 1975 with the aim of removing obstacles for the circulation
   of goods, capitals and people in Western Africa and promoting regional integration. Candidates may
   offer equal coverage of ECOWAS’ protocol that allowed free displacements and cross-border activities,
   including trade, and of the absence of improvements in communication and transportation to allow
   travel amongst the different countries. Candidates may refer also to the lack of policies to prevent
   discrimination against migrants. Other relevant factors may be addressed, such as the evaluation of
   how the imposition of colonial borders, preserved after independence, altered traditional circulation
   since political boundaries did not always coincide with ethnical, cultural or economic areas. Candidates’
   opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29. Discuss the view that strategic reasons were the main cause of the South African War (1899–1902).
   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the concept that
   strategic reasons were the main cause of the South African War. Causes may predate the timeframe
   but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the British view
   that a wealthy Transvaal was a threat to British colonies in Southern Africa. German support for the
   Transvaal was seen as a threat by Britain to British territory and interests. The Transvaal blocked
   British strategic goals such as the Cape to Cairo railway. Other relevant factors may be addressed
   such as the imperialist ambitions of Rhodes, Chamberlain and Milner, the British desire to obtain the
   wealth of the Transvaal by any means (the Jameson Raid). Boer fears of losing their society and
   culture to an influx of British miners and settlers encouraged resistance. The inability of the two sides
   to reach a diplomatic solution meant that armed conflict was the only method remaining. Candidates'
   opinions or conclusions must be clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.

30. Evaluate the reasons for the National Party election victory in 1948.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the victory of the
   National Party in the 1948 election. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to
   the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the revival of Afrikaner nationalism by the
   Broederbond in the 1930s which created a political movement to assert Afrikaner control over the
   British and native populations. Support of Britain in the Second World War was very unpopular with
   the Afrikaner population. Growing native economic power threatened Afrikaner jobs and increased
   native political militancy which threatened Boer political and social power. The growth of the native
   population and their migration to the cities were seen as a threat by Afrikaners. The apparent failure
   of the segregation system to limit native influence led to a call for stricter measures. This resulted in
   increased support for the National Party which promised increased Afrikaner political and economic
   control. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31. Compare and contrast the reasons for the spread of Islam and Christianity in Africa in the 19th
    century.

   The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
   Islam and Christianity in terms of the reasons for their spread in Africa referring to both throughout.
   There does not have to be an equal number of each. Reasons may predate the timeframe, but they
   must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the influence of
   conquest, invasion, or colonialism by supporters of each, the influence of missionaries, the influence
   of other individuals such as merchants, explorers, or traders. The nature and attraction of the
   doctrines of each may be considered as well as practical inducements or advantages offered by
   each as well as the influence of local political leaders, or other influential groups or individuals.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence.

32. “Colonialism brought limited educational benefits to Africa.” Discuss with reference to two countries.

   The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
   colonialism brought limited educational benefits to Africa. Candidates may refer to the fact that the
   small number of schools provided meant access to schools was limited and educational materials
   were not plentiful and of lower quality. Many schools were religious in nature, which could limit
   curriculum and access, and some schools were designed to serve the needs of the colonial powers
   and focused on specific skills and did not provide higher education or the development of a
   professional class. Colonial school systems may also have weakened local traditions and cultures.
   Other relevant factors may be addressed: missionary schools offered opportunities for advanced
   study overseas which produced many leaders; the creation of rudimentary school systems provided
   a basis for future development of education; and the concept of education as crucial became an
   important goal for independent states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented
   clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

33. Evaluate the effects of the Six Day War for Israel.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effects of the Six Day War on Israel
   weighing up the positive and negative impacts. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but must
   be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to territorial acquisitions by
   Israel, improvement of their strategic position, increased support from the United States, defeat, and
   humiliation of its two strongest enemies (Egypt and Syria) and the increase of disunity amongst its
   Arab opponents. Candidates may also refer to the problems created by an increase in the
   Palestinian population of Israel, increased militancy of groups such as the PLO, refusal of Arab
   nations to negotiate a peace treaty, increased support for Egypt and Syria from the USSR, Arab
   determination to recover territory and prestige which meant that future conflicts were very likely.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
   evidence.


34. “Nasser’s social and economic policies were mostly beneficial for Egypt.” To what extent do you
    agree with this statement?
   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
   Nasser’s economic and social policies were mostly beneficial for Egypt. Candidates may refer to
   nationalization of the Suez Canal and other foreign industry, land reform, increased agricultural
   output and investment in industry, modernization of the economy and increased employment. This
   may be counter-balanced against high rates of inflation, inefficient industry, high rates of
   unemployment, increased government debt and a collapsing economy. High rates of military
   spending compounded economic problems and limited development. Social reforms may include
   modernizing education, health care, and better working conditions. A more secular society and
   increased rights for women were also instituted. These reforms were generally successful although
   there was some backlash from militant religious groups against these new ideas. Some of the
   reforms were negated or suspended due to an increasingly authoritarian political culture. Candidates’
   opinion or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35. To what extent were economic problems the main cause of ethnic conflict in two African countries
    after independence?

   The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
   economic problems were the main cause of ethnic conflict in two African countries after
   independence. As colonial borders were preserved, it implied the coexistence of different
   cultural or ethnic groups inside the same independent African country. Although some
   theoretical analysts consider that conflicts arose among communities of different historical
   identities because they had been forced to live inside the same state, others state that
   economic interests were the real cause that led to the rise of confrontations attributed to ethnic
   reasons. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the situation in the two countries, or they
   may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both countries must be a feature of
   the response. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
   by appropriate evidence.


36. Evaluate the success of the return to multi-party democracy in the 1980s and 1990s in two African
    countries.

   The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the success of the return to multi-
   party democracy in the 1980s and 1990s in two African countries, weighing up its strengths
   and limitations or otherwise. After the independence struggles in Africa, the most common
   solution proposed by nationalist leaders was the one-party state. The reason that justified this
   choice was the need for a new nation state to develop a common political and economic
   programme without wasting efforts in the competition between different political parties.
   However, the emergence of autocratic governments at the hands of a small elite or a single
   person, gave place to demands that resulted in the extended application of multi-party system.
   Candidates may refer to the level of democratization and legitimacy that this system implied
   in both countries, and they may evaluate whether autocratic practices disappeared or not.
   Other relevant factors may be considered, for example, corruption and fraudulent elections.
   Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented and supported by appropriate evidence.
