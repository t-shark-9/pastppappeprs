      Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

      Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

      The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including reasons,
      for how enculturation affects cognition and/or behaviour, with reference to one relevant study.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised
by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the
question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the
issues or problems.

 Marks     Level descriptor

    0      Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1      Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2      Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.

B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of
psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
   1–2
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
   3–4
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
   5–6
          Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                M23/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves
   1–2
          to repeat points already made.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
   3–4
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
   5–6
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding
of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking about the
knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge
and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                 M23/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M



 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
  1–2
          discussion, if present, is superficial.

          The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
  3–4
          most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

          The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
  5–6
          and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning
the argument.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
    1
          the response.

    2     The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                               Section B

4.   Discuss one or more genetic similarities for one or more behaviours.                          [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of one or more genetic similarities (twins, siblings, parents, adopted children) for
     one or more behaviours.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Skre et al.’s (1993) twin study investigating genetic influences on anxiety disorders
     • Holland et al.’s (1988) twin study investigating genetic influences on anorexia
     • Kendler et al.’s (2006) twin study investigating genetic influences on depression
     • Bouchard et al.’s (1990) twin study into genetic influences on intelligence

     • Yehuda et al.’s (2000, 1998) kinship (parental) studies investigating symptoms of PTSD
         among adult children of Holocaust survivors.
     • McGuffin et al.’s (2006) twin study investigating genetic influence on depression
     • Scarr and Weinberg’s (1983) adoption study on intelligence.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • examining the underlying assumptions
     • the validity of evidence in support of the explanation
     • methodological and ethical considerations in the research into genetic similarities and behaviour
     • the difficulties of carrying out empirical research
     • the role of culture and/or environment on behaviour
     • limitations of a reductionist argument.
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence

     Candidates may discuss one genetic similarity in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of genetic similarities in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may discuss one behaviour in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
     may discuss a larger number of behaviours in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates are not required to state exact concordance rates in order to be awarded
     full marks.

6.   Evaluate one or more research methods used to study the influence of globalization
     on behaviour.                                                                              [22]
     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term "evaluate" requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing the
     strengths and limitations of one or more research methods used to study the influence of

       strengths and weaknesses
     • possible theoretical assumptions and/or biases in relation to the chosen method
     • the issues of validity and reliability
     • the generalizability of findings
     • the use of alternative/additional methods (triangulation).
