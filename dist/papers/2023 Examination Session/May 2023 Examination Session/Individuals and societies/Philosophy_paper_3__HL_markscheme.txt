How to use the Diploma Programme Philosophy markscheme

The assessment markbands constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment markbands examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the assessment markbands listed on page 6.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills referred to in the various
assessment markbands published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement with philosophical
activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing responses, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme:

• The Diploma Programme Philosophy course is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy
  in the candidates. These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment markbands in the
  subject guide
• The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct answer
• The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
• The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list but rather an indicative list where they might appear in the answer
• If there are names of philosophers and references to their work incorporated into the markscheme,
  this should help to give context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such
  philosophers and references should appear in an answer: they are possible lines of development.
• Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
• Examiners should be aware of the command terms for Philosophy as published on page 54 of the
  Philosophy subject guide when assessing responses
• In markschemes for Paper 3, there are suggested pertinent points found in the text extract relating to
  philosophical activity. The markschemes include suggested questions that might stimulate analysis of
  those points. It is not intended that all possible points raised by the text are to be covered by the
  candidates. The markbands direct examiners to rewarding the responses accordingly
• The markscheme bullet points cannot and are not intended to predict how a candidate will relate his
  or her personal experience of the DP HL Philosophy course to the text extract, so the examiner must
  be aware that much of the response of the candidate will not be covered by material in the
  markscheme; but the candidate’s response must relate to the text extract.

        • The response is poorly structured, or where there is a recognizable structure there is
          minimal focus on the task. Philosophical vocabulary is not used, or is consistently used
          inappropriately.
        • There is a very basic understanding of the view of philosophical activity raised by the
   1–5
          unseen text. Few, if any, references are made to the text.
        • There is limited reference to the student’s personal experience of philosophical activity but
          no comparison or contrast of this experience with the view(s) raised by the text.
        • The essay is descriptive and lacking in analysis. Few of the main points are justified.
        • There is some attempt to follow a structured approach although it is not always clear what
          the answer is trying to convey.
        • There is a limited understanding of the view(s) of philosophical activity raised by the text.
          Few, if any, references are made to the text.
        • There is some evidence that the student has drawn on their personal experience of
  6–10    philosophical activity.
        • The response identifies similarities and differences between the student’s personal
          experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the
          text, although the analysis of these similarities and differences is superficial.
        • The response contains some analysis but is more descriptive than analytical. Some of the
          main points are justified.
        • There is a clear attempt to structure the response, although there may be some repetition
          or a lack of clarity in places. Philosophical vocabulary is used, sometimes appropriately.
        • There is a satisfactory understanding of the view(s) of philosophical activity raised by the
          text. Some references are made to the text.
        • There is some evidence that the student has drawn on their personal experience of
 11–15    philosophical activity, with examples or illustrations used to support their points.
        • There is some analysis of the similarities and differences between the student’s personal
          experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the
          text, although this analysis needs further development.
        • The response contains critical analysis rather than just description. Many of the main points
          are justified.
        • The response is well organized and can be easily followed. Philosophical vocabulary is
          used, mostly appropriately.
        • There is clear identification of the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the unseen
          text. Some references are made to the text.
        • The student draws on their personal experience of philosophical activity, using examples or
 16–20    illustrations to support their points.
        • There is clear analysis of both similarities and differences between the student’s personal
          experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the
          text, although this analysis needs further development.
        • The response contains critical analysis rather than just description. Most of the main points
          are justified. The response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
        • The response is well structured, focused and effectively organized. There is appropriate
          use of philosophical vocabulary throughout the response.
        • There is clear identification of the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the unseen
          text. Effective references are made to the text.
        • The student draws explicitly on their personal experience of philosophical activity, using
 21–25
          well-chosen examples or illustrations to support their points.
        • There is clear analysis of both similarities and differences between the student’s personal
          experience of philosophical activity and the view(s) of philosophical activity presented.
        • The response contains well developed critical analysis. All or nearly all of the main points
          are justified. The response argues to a reasoned conclusion.

When responding to this extract candidates should focus on the activity of philosophy. In the course of
analysing and evaluating the ideas in the extract candidates should reflect on their own experience of
doing philosophy and should therefore make explicit comparisons/contrasts between their experience
of studying the HL Philosophy course and what the extract is saying about doing philosophy.
Candidates should make explicit reference to the ideas and arguments in the text in their response. [25]

Candidates might consider the following:
• Philosophy as incorporating wonder as well as classifying what knowledge is in the natural world
• The demarcation of science and philosophy – methodological and investigative differences
• Philosophy as concerned with the process of thinking as well as the object of thought
• Questions having purpose – see examples in the course both from the Core Theme but also Optional
  Themes or Prescribed texts, eg: Can life have meaning? Virtue Ethics, Descartes, Plato, Taylor
• Technical curiosity – how might this proceed and be different from philosophical curiosity?
  eg: Philosophy of Science, Epistemology
• The world within the human being as well as the world outside (See Core Theme)
• The inner cosmos and the outer cosmos – is there an epistemic distance that allows humans to make
  conclusions from within their own cosmos? eg: Kant and noumena/phenomena
• The difference(s), if any, between non-human animals and humans (See the Core Theme)
• The human self – being apart from experience (See the Core Theme)
• The interplay of “body” and “spirit” – is a form dualism inevitable in approaching human nature
  philosophically? (See the Core Theme, Ethics, Epistemology, Philosophy of Religion)
• What counts as “fact” and settling fact? – verification and factual confirmation (See Epistemology,
  Philosophy of Science)
• “Words” and the role of language – definitions, signs, symbols
• Consciousness as a feature of philosophical interest – why is it not merely a neurological question?
• How to think – the methodologies of thinking, eg: Plato, Descartes, Hume, Nietzsche, Ortega y Gasset
• Jaspers and wonder.
