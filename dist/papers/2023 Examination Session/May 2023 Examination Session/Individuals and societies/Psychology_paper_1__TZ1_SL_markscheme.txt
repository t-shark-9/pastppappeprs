Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised
by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the
question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the
issues or problems.

 Marks     Level descriptor

    0      Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1      Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2      Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.

B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of
psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
   1–2
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
   3–4
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
   5–6
          Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                M23/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves
   1–2
          to repeat points already made.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
   3–4
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
   5–6
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding
of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking about the
knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge
and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                  M23/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M



 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
  1–2
          discussion, if present, is superficial.

          The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
  3–4
          most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

          The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
  5–6
          and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning
the argument.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
    1
          the response.

    2     The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                               Section B

4.   Discuss one or more genetic similarities for one or more behaviours.                          [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of one or more genetic similarities (twins, siblings, parents, adopted children) for
     one or more behaviours.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Skre et al.’s (1993) twin study investigating genetic influences on anxiety disorders
     • Holland et al.’s (1988) twin study investigating genetic influences on anorexia
     • Kendler et al.’s (2006) twin study investigating genetic influences on depression
     • Bouchard et al.’s (1990) twin study into genetic influences on intelligence
     • True et al.’s (1993) twin study investigating genetic influences on PTSD symptoms among
         U.S. Vietnam veterans
     • Weissman et al.’s (2005) kinship (parental) study of MDD
     • Yehuda et al.’s (2000, 1998) kinship (parental) studies investigating symptoms of PTSD
         among adult children of Holocaust survivors.
     • McGuffin et al.’s (2006) twin study investigating genetic influence on depression
     • Scarr and Weinberg’s (1983) adoption study on intelligence.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • examining the underlying assumptions
     • the validity of evidence in support of the explanation
     • methodological and ethical considerations in the research into genetic similarities and behaviour
     • the difficulties of carrying out empirical research
     • the role of culture and/or environment on behaviour
     • limitations of a reductionist argument.
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence

     Candidates may discuss one genetic similarity in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of genetic similarities in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may discuss one behaviour in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
     may discuss a larger number of behaviours in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

Candidates are not required to state exact concordance rates in order to be awarded
     full marks.

5.   Discuss the influence of emotion(s) on one cognitive process.                          [22]

Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the influence of
emotion on cognitive processes.

Responses may focus on any cognitive process that is affected by emotion such as memory or
decision-making, or any other cognitive process

Candidates may discuss the influence of one emotion or emotions in general, in order to
demonstrate depth of knowledge or may discuss different influences of emotion in order to
demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

Appropriate research may include, but is not limited to:
• Brown and Kulik’s (1977) study of flashbulb memory
• Nutt and Lam (2011), Fisher and Craik (1977), Overton (1964) studies of state-dependent
  memory
• Sharot et al. (2007) on 9/11 flashbulb memories and proximity
• Neisser and Harsch’s (1992) study of emotion and memory
• Talariko and Rubin’s (2003) study on increased confidence in memory correlated to emotional
  intensity
• Speisman et al.’s (1964) experimental manipulation of emotions.
• LeDoux’s (1996) theory of the emotional brain
• Scherer’s (2001) appraisal theory.

Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
• examining the underlying assumptions
• the validity of evidence in support of the explanation
• strength and limitations of the methodology
• the difficulties of carrying out empirical research
• cultural and ethical considerations
• limitations of a reductionist argument
• alternative explanations/findings.

If a candidate addresses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to
the first one.

6.   Discuss the formation of stereotypes and/or the effect(s) of stereotypes on behaviour.         [22]
     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     formation of stereotypes and/or the effect(s) of stereotypes on behaviour.

     Candidates may address the effect of stereotypes in relation to specific aspects of human
     behaviour or address the effect of stereotypes on behaviour in general. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

     Candidates may discuss only the formation of stereotypes or only the effect(s) of
     stereotypes. Both approaches are equally acceptable. If a candidate addresses both
     formation and effect(s) of stereotypes, the response does not need to be equally balanced in
     order to access marks in the top bands

     Explanations for the formation of stereotypes may include, but are not limited to:
     • Grain of truth hypothesis (Campbell, 1967)
     • Illusory correlation: Hamilton and Gifford (1976)
     • Social Identity Theory: Hilliard and Liben (2010); Park and Rothbart (1982)


     Effects of stereotypes on human behaviour may include, but are not limited to:
     • Memory distortion (eg Allport and Postman, 1947; Martin and Halvorson, 1983)

     • Stereotype threat (eg Steele and Aronson, 1995; Spencer et al., 1999;)
     • Prejudice and discrimination against individuals (eg Duncan, 1976; Buckhout, 1974;
        Gibbins, 1969).

     Relevant discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • methodological considerations
     • cultural considerations
     • ethical considerations, including the social sensitivity of this research
     • implications of the findings
     • contrasting explanations.
