Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment
criterion has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate
range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels
failure to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
  the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
  when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
  should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
  necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion
  until they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed.
  If a piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and
  the one that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

• Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
  if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should
  award the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
  acceptable.

• Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
  the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
  a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
  the work being assessed.

• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
  attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
  low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
  other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will
  produce any particular distribution of marks.

• The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

                         Theme: Medical delivery drones in Rwanda

Criterion A — The issue and stakeholder(s)                                                        [4]

1.   (a)   Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system in the article.

           Note to examiners: The concern may relate to its impact or result or consequences
           or effect or outcome.

           Award [1] for identifying the concern (which does not have to be stated explicitly).
           Mark the first concern only (if there are two or more).

           Award [2] for a description of the concern that must be stated explicitly.

           Social/ethical concerns may include:
           • Reliability: reliability of the cell/mobile phone signal (an unreliable signal may
             mean the request is not received/the drone arrival is not announced), the
             operation of the drone (an error in the programming may prevent the drone
             functioning). Availability of internet connectivity (for internet based
             messaging).
           • Reliability: accuracy of the GPS signal (inaccuracies in the GPS coordinates
             could mean the drone does not reach its target).
           • Reliability: drone operation, GPS signal and Text/internet connectivity in
             extreme weather.
           • Reliability: when package might exceed the maximum weight limit that could
             affect the flight path of the drone (the drone may not reach its target)
           • Privacy: medical delivery drones may be flying over forbidden areas – drones
             could be misused to gain information relating to national security. Transmitted
             information by text message - data such as location and blood type/medicines
             to be delivered (for example, HIV medicines).
           • People and machines: the pilot’s responsibility and ownership of the flight
             which relies on the drone operator as he/she sets the flight path – (an
             inaccurate flight path would result in the drone not reaching its
             target)/operators and doctors may need special training.
           • Policies: local governments may need to regulate the operation of the drone
             to maintain a safe air space – (without regulation, drones could interfere with
             other aircraft).
           • Equality of access/Accessibility: range of drone (diagram is 80km one way)
             may exclude some patients. Cost of drone service/medical supplies/cost of the
             equipment.
           • Security: such as the drone being taken over or disabled by third parties –
             (the lifesaving medicines would not reach the patient).
           • Reliability: the navigation system of the drone cannot be guaranteed to deliver
             the package in a usable condition (which means it cannot be used by the
             health care worker). .

 (b)    Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system in the
        article.

        Note to examiners
        Award [1] for identifying the stakeholder (who). Mark the first stakeholder only (if
        there are two or more).

        Award [2] for describing how the stakeholder interacts with the IT system or what
        part of the IT system relates to the stakeholder.

        Primary stakeholders may include:
        • Doctors/healthcare worker (as per article)/Health care centre who use a
           cell/mobile phone to generate the request and will receive the medical
           resource through the delivery of the request by the drone.
        • Patients who are the recipients of the medical delivery by the drone / whose
           data is in the database.
        • Facilities staff who receive the medical request, and handle and package the
           request.
        • Flight operator who fixes the package to the drone.
        • government departments who are responsible for regulating the use of drones
           and setting rules for their use in healthcare
        • Government departments who are responsible for regulating the use of drones
           and setting rules for their use in healthcare.
        • Third parties who may intercept or take control of the drone.
        • Developer/Developer company responsible for the hardware/software and
           who have a responsibility to ensure its security and reliability.

2.   (a)   Describe, step-by-step, how the IT system works.
           IT system: Text messaging, GPS, drones

           The major steps are the use of the components of the IT system: smartphone,
           texting, GPS positioning.

           Note to examiners
           Award [1] if there is some understanding of the process but NOT in a step-by-step
           approach using the information within the article with possibly some steps missing.
           Award [2] if there is a logical step-by-step account using the information within the
           article (but it may lack some detail).
           Award [3] if there is a step-by-step account that identifies information about how the IT
           system works that goes beyond the article.
           Award [4] if there is a step-by-step account that describes information about how the IT
           system works that goes beyond the article.

           Answers provided in the article include:
           • doctor pushes “send” (text message with request through cell/mobile phone)
           • text message is received at the response centre/medical warehouse
             Accept either cellular or internet based messaging requiring internet
             connection
           • loads package to the drone
           • loads destination GPS coordinates algorithm to the drone
           • a text message alerts the doctor on site just before the drone arrives
           • drone uses onboard sensors to measure wind and judge speed for final
             approach
           • drone releases its payload by disposable parachute
           • drone returns to base.

Additional information that goes beyond that provided in the article may include:
• verification of the request e.g., requesting phone number is checked in a
  database against registered users
• authenticates the user
• selects from warehouse stock via database/data warehouse
• both the cell/mobile phone and the drone use GPS satellites to trilaterate
  (accept triangulate) their position– Enhanced GPS and GPS coordinates of
  the destination are stored
• drone continuously sends GPS coordinates of its current position back to base
• identification of the nearest medical warehouse based on the requester’s
  cell/mobile phone location
• drone pinpoints its base position using GPS and flies to the destination GPS
  coordinates
• system alerts air traffic controller about the upcoming flight
• medical request requirements (for example: items packed individually,
  appropriate temperature, fragile, etc)
• package drop-off minimal requirements
• local doctor may have to text to confirm delivery.

(b)   Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
      described in Criterion A.

      Note to examiners
      Explaining the link between the concern and specific parts, or whole, of the IT system
      means the candidate must include how and why the concern has arisen from the use of
      the IT system. The concern identified in Criterion A may be implicit.
      There must be a link to the concern identified/described in Q1(a).

      Award [1] If the relationship between the concern and the IT system is identified. This may
      be a repeat, or rewording, of the response to Q1(a) or lack of detail for the how or why.
      If there is more than one concern identified in Q1(a) accept any concern (i.e., preventing
      a follow through error).

      Award [2] if how or why the concern that has arisen is described. Appropriate IT or ITGS
      terminology is used.

      For example, using a privacy concern, responses need to explain:
      •    HOW the data can be accessed (e.g., interception of the WiFi signal is achieved)
           OR
      •    WHY it is possible to access the data (e.g., lack of encryption of the WiFi signal)

      • How – reliability of the cellphone signal / internet connection to make the
        request, loss of connectivity.
      • Why – loss/interference of cellphone signal during the transmission and
        system is unable to identify its location (GPS destination coordinates).

      • How – reliability of the operation and function of the drone, loss of
          connectivity/interference.
      • Why – operators may not be aware of the connectivity boundaries that can
          lead to a potential risk of interference causing loss of control. Also, a drone’s
          battery/life may be insufficient to complete a flight. Resilience of the drone for
          weather events/conditions.

      • How – reliability ,GPS signal loss occurs in built up areas or due to the
        degradation of a signal caused by the electromagnetic interference of the
        leading edge of a storm front, rain fade.
      • Why – low power of the GPS signal can be absorbed by structures and other
        features, impacting on the accuracy and reliability of the positioning systems.

      • How – privacy, Medical delivery drones may be misused (forbidden locations
        as airports, forest fires, etc).
      • Why – consciously (flight path programmed to fly over forbidden areas) or
        unknowingly not following regulations.

      • How – policies to maintain a safe air space.
      • Why – consciously or unknowingly (eg not including in flight program the
          maximum altitude for drones, resulting in drones invading airspace of
          commercial planes) not following regulations.
                                              –9–                  M23/3/ITGSX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


        • How – security concerns, such as the drone being taken over or disabled by
          third parties.
        • Why – lack of network security allowing hackers to intercept, reprogram and
          redirect the drone.

        • How – reliability concern due to an excess of package load.
        • Why – consciously or unknowingly not following drone load capabilities.

        • How – Reliability (accuracy) is affected by programming.
        • Why – Programming needs to account for weather factors that may impact
          accuracy.

        • How: Digital divide, software and system is proprietary, or service is a
          subscription-based service.
        • Why: Service is unavailable if the subscription/costs are not paid (there is a
          clear link in 2A to the technical developments).

        Note:
        Candidates are expected to refer to relevant stakeholders, information
        technologies, data and processes.
        Candidates should explain to “how the IT system works” using appropriate IT
        terminology.

Positive impacts may include:
Medical delivery drones save lives
• permit entry to areas that would be inaccessible/hazardous
• timely delivery of goods due to overcoming road congestions
• provide necessary medical resources, thus enabling doctors to provide better
  treatment.

Negative impacts may include:
Business and Employment
• loss of jobs as drones take over the delivery of goods. but different jobs are created
  eg drone operators/programmers.

Reliability
• reliability of the hardware/software due to weather conditions – which could
  endanger lives
• limited range of the WiFi signal – endangering people/possible loss of the drone
• reliability of the GPS signal – impacting on the accuracy of the drone’s operation
• reliability of package quality assurance.

Security concerns such as the drone being taken over or disabled by third
parties
• drone itself may be stolen – implications of access to medical resources
• drone may be used to endanger people on the ground due to loss of control/
  deliberate intent by the third party to crash the drone or endanger people.

Safety concerns where drones are used inappropriately (eg near airports, over
forest fires, overcrowded areas such as sporting fixtures)
• drone owners may not be aware of the regulations or choose not to follow them as
   they feel they have little chance of being caught.

Inappropriate use of the drone may
• impede the work of emergency services (eg fire services unable to fly over forest
   fires due to presence of drones
• cause a dangerous situation near airports; aircraft may be at risk of collision with
   drone and possible life-threatening damage (eg drone getting sucked into an aircraft
   engine); may result in flights being delayed/diverted
• the drone may be operating within restricted airspace – inexperienced or unqualified
   drone operator may not be aware of restrictions
• disrupt sporting fixtures or outdoor events; progress of the event may be held up by
   the presence of a drone; possibility of drones crashing into crowds and causing
   injury; possibility of drone causing an accident by obstructing or distracting people
   participating in the event.

Privacy
• the drone may be used as an improvised weapon or surveillance device by terrorist
   groups/may be used as a mechanism for illegal activities (delivering drugs/weapons
   etc to restricted areas).

Scalability
• provide worldwide service
• regulation of this service.

Criterion D — A solution to a problem arising from the article                                        [8]

4.   Evaluate one possible solution that addresses at least one problem identified in Criterion C.

     Note to examiners
     The problem should be stated in the box above the response. However, if this is not done, a
     solution can be evaluated that addresses any problem identified in Criterion C.
     The solution must be feasible.

     If there is more than one solution, mark the first solution only.

     Mark holistically using a two-step process:
      1. Determine the markband the response falls into.
      2. Determine the level within the markband using the guidelines attached.
     The solution may be a series of related measures that address the problem identified. For
     example, if the candidate identifies a problem such as security and then includes a range of
     security measures that are grouped together, this is acceptable.
     If there are more than one solution, and there is no explicit connection between them, only
     mark the first solution.

     Band 1 - 2
     The link to the problem may be implicit.
     Award [1] if a solution is identified.
     Award [2] if a solution is described.

     Band 3 - 5
     The solution is explicitly linked to the problem.
     Award [3] if the solution described and there is at least one evaluative statement.
     Award [4] if the solution described has limited evaluative comments about the strengths and
     weaknesses of the solution.
     Award [5] if the solution described has evaluative comments that address a range of strengths
     and weaknesses.

     Band 6 - 8
     There are explicit references to the article throughout the response.
     Award [6] for an overall judgement about the effectiveness of the solution.
     Award [7-8] for an overall judgement about the effectiveness of the solution that is supported
     by the evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. Future developments may be proposed
     and/or insightful thinking demonstrated.
