Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders


1.   (a) What, according to Source A, were the consequences of the Mongol
     invasion of Khwarezmia?                                                                        [3]

          The Mongol invasion devastated the region.
          Important cities such as Bukhara and Samarkand were sacked.
          The underground irrigation system was destroyed.
          The Mongols killed up to three quarters of the population.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].



     (b) What does Source D suggest about the Mongol invasion of the region?                        [2]

          Mongols employed weapons such as catapults, as well as bowmen.
          Mongols besieged important urban centres, as depicted by the image of the walled city.
          Mongols faced resistance when they invaded.

2. With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
   Source C for an historian studying the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia.                          [4]

      Value:

      It provides a 13th century perspective from a Persian historian.
      It offers an historical record of the Muhammadan (Muslim) dynasties.
      It provides information on how the conflict began between Genghis Khan and Muhammad Shah
       II.

      Limitations:

      Since it was written in the late 13th century, it lacks the benefit of hindsight.
      The purpose of the book is to record a general history of the Muslim dynasties and so the focus
       on the Mongol invasion may be limited.
      The source provides information on the reasons for the invasion but does not give any detail on
       the events or outcome of the invasion.

           The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only
           value or limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and
           content should be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on
           the value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of
           them in either the value or the limitations.

3.        Compare and contrast what Sources A and B reveal about the Mongol invasion
          of Khwarezmia (1219-1221).                                                                 [6]

          indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither
          prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Comparison:
   Both sources suggest that the Mongol invasion had a devastating impact on the local population.
   Both sources state that the invasion led to the decline of agriculture.
   Both sources mention that the city of Samarkand was sacked.

Contrast:
    While Source B suggests that the invasion of Khwarezmia was part of the larger Mongol
      expansion, Source A states that Muhammad Shah II was directly responsible for the invasion.
    While Source B suggests the success of the Mongols was due to their strategy of generating fear
      and terror, Source A argues that their superior discipline and coordination were significant
      factors.
    Source A indicates that Mongol violence was the cause of depopulation whereas Source B states
      there were other causes such as epidemics and famines.

not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

Indicative content

Source A              The Khwarezmian ruler Muhammad Shah II provoked Genghis Khan by killing
                      Mongol merchants and diplomats. In response, Genghis Khan declared war and
                      sent well-equipped and numerous forces.


Source B              After conquering most of Central Asia, Genghis Khan wanted to expand further
                      into Persia and Armenia. The source mentions that there were economic factors
                      that led to the invasion.
                                            –7–                  M23/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source C        Genghis Khan was interested in keeping a continuous trade between his territories
                and Khwarezmia, and sent envoys to Muhammad Shah II. The plot between
                Muhammad and the governor of Utrar to kill Genghis Khan’s envoys and seize
                their property led to Genghis Khan seeking revenge.


Source D        The successful military methods of the Mongols were a factor in their ability to
                invade Khwarezmian cities. Their use of complex devices like catapults also
                contributed to their successful invasions.


Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss that the conquest of Khwarezmia was not the original
                goal of Genghis Khan, who was more interested in establishing a trade route
                between Khwarezmia and his territories. Candidates may offer further details on
                the killing of the Mongol envoy, merchants and diplomats sent to Muhammad Shah
                II as a factor that started the war. Candidates may also consider that Muhammad
                had only recently taken some of the territory under his control, and he was
                engaged in a dispute with the caliph in Baghdad.

                Candidates may also state that Genghis Khan took advantage of the support of
                small local communities who were enemies of the Khwarezmian empire. They may
                offer further details on the resourcefulness of the army that contributed to Genghis
                Khan’s success, such as the way in which the essential role played by
                the intelligence network organized by the Mongols allowed them to prepare better
                for their invasion of Khwarezmia.

5.       (a) What, according to Source E, were the problems that Moctezuma II faced with the
         arrival of the Spanish?                                                                      [3]

        Moctezuma II did not have the support necessary to rule a diverse population.
        He was engaged in constant warfare.
        His rule relied on terror which led to numerous revolts.
        When the Spaniards arrived, many indigenous people viewed them as liberators and joined the
         Spanish.

         (b) What does Source F suggest about the arrival of the Spanish in the region?             [2]

        The Spanish used force.
        Some indigenous populations fought for the Spanish.
        There were some negotiations at Texcoco.

 6. With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source H
    for an historian studying the conflict between Moctezuma II and the Spanish.                     [4]

      Value:
       It is a contemporary letter by Hernán Cortés about Moctezuma II.
       The source offers the official report by Cortés to the Emperor about an encounter with the
        Aztecs.
       The writer provides detailed information of the Cholula episode and Moctezuma’s reaction.

      Limitations:
       In the report written by Cortés to the Emperor, the purpose is to explain and justify his actions.
       The source is from 1520 when the conquest was still ongoing and lacks hindsight.
       The source only gives a Spanish version of events.

The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are
discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting
evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one
reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

   Comparison:
    Both sources state that Cortés was ambushed at Cholula.
    Both sources mention that Moctezuma II’s troops were involved in the attack.
    Both sources show that events in Cholula were extremely violent.

   Contrast:
    Source G argues that Moctezuma had prepared plans to attack Cholula whereas Source H refers
      to the people of Cholula carrying out the attack without his orders.
    Source H depicts Cortés as a victim of treachery, whereas Source G argues that he was
      responsible for excessive slaughter.
    While Source H refers to Moctezuma as a weak leader, Source G argues that he was a strong
      ruler.

Source E              Moctezuma II’s methods of ruling his empire led to a lack of support when the
                      Spanish arrived. He faced opposition to his rule and some indigenous people
                      turned against him and joined the Spanish.


Source F              The source depicts the alliance between the Spanish and indigenous populations
                      as a way to challenge Moctezuma’s authority. The Spanish were better armed and
                      supplied.

Source G        Moctezuma’s plan to ambush the Spanish failed and the Spanish retaliated with
                excessive force and slaughtered many Aztecs. Moctezuma’s various attempts to
                defeat the Spanish were ultimately ineffective.


Source H        An alliance of indigenous communities worked against Moctezuma. He is
                presented as a weak leader, who is also willing to appease and support his
                Spanish enemies.


Own knowledge   Candidates may offer further detail on Moctezuma II’s weak leadership of his
                empire. There were some indigenous leaders who wanted to challenge his power
                and were ready to commit treason—such as Ixtlilxochitl, the Texcocan dissident
                prince who allowed the Spanish passage to advance. The ruthlessness of
                Moctezuma’s rule, his centralized political project and excessive demands for
                tribute led to deep resentment among the indigenous populations and greatly
                hindered support for him.

                Candidates may also refer to Aztec prophecies, omens [signs] and other
                superstitious beliefs and how they contributed to the reaction of indigenous people
                to the arrival of the Spanish. This led to many indigenous people actually
                welcoming the Spanish as opposed to resisting them. Cortés was able to rely on
                military superiority and support and was able to besiege major Aztec cities such as
                Tenochtitlán. Candidates may also discuss the effects of diseases, brought from
                Europe by the Spaniards, on the indigenous population.

    (b) What does Source J reveal about British defence spending in the 1930s?                       [2]

      In the early 1930s defence spending was relatively low
      *From mid 1930s spending on defence rose rapidly
      The Air Force received the largest amount of funding by 1939.

10. With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source I
    for an historian studying appeasement.                                                                  [4]

   Value:

       It is contemporary to events and is by a well-known politician.
       It aims to offer a critical overview of the policy of appeasing Hitler and the Nazis.
       The speech details the consequences for Britain of adopting the policy of appeasement.

    Limitations:

       Churchill was a strong critic of appeasement and so would not be impartial.
       The speech aims to discredit the British government’s policy of appeasement.
       The speech is from October 1938, when events were still unfolding.


The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are
discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting
evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one
reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

       Both sources state that memories of the First World War were a key factor in determining
        government policy.
       Both sources recognize that Britain needed to appease Hitler in order to have time to rearm.


   Contrast:

       Source K argues that appeasement was a sensible strategy at the time, whereas Source L states
        clearly that the policy became absurd.
       While Source L maintains that the political parties were divided in their support for action, Source
        K argues that both public and parliamentary opinion would not support the measures against Hitler.

Indicative content

Source I              Appeasement was a total defeat for Britain. Hitler should have been stopped
                      earlier. The policy did not prevent Germany from rearming, nor did Britain rearm in
                      time; it neglected British security.

Source J              Between 1938 and 1939 appeasement was successful in buying time for Britain to
                      build up its armed forces; military spending increased dramatically in the late
                      1930s.

Source K              Britain needed two or three years to increase its armament levels to be ready for
                      war with Hitler’s Germany. Appeasement was a sensible strategy at the time.
                      Appeasement attempted to limit German expansion at a time when Britain was
                      overstretched, but ultimately it was ineffective.

Source L        Britain knew that it needed appeasement to gain time to rearm and to prepare for
                war, whilst trying to avoid it. But by March 1939 the policy had become ineffective
                with the invasion of Czechoslovakia.

Own knowledge   Candidates may refer to the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Treaty as an act of
                appeasement that contributed to the breakup of the Stresa Front. The appeasement
                of Mussolini’s actions in Abyssinia also reassured Hitler that his actions would not
                be challenged. He reintroduced conscription in the German army in 1935. Germany
                was also able to carry out the Anschluss with Austria in March 1938 with no effective
                opposition. Candidates may offer further detail on the Czech crisis and Munich
                Conference to show how ineffective the policy of appeasement was.
                Candidates may argue that Italy’s realignment meant that appeasement was the
                only realistic policy for Britain and France. Given the effects of the Great Depression,
                appeasement was also effective whilst Britain and France prepared to face a
                possible war with both Germany and Italy. More detail on how neither France nor
                Britain were militarily strong enough to resist Hitler at this point might be offered.
                However, some may argue that the outbreak of a European war in September 1939
                clearly demonstrated the ineffectiveness of appeasement.

      The determined actions of the police in handling the mob and keeping events peaceful.
      The majority of white citizens did not support Governor Faubus.
      People were choosing to support public schools rather than segregation.

     Source O for an historian studying the events at Little Rock in 1957.                                  [4]

Value:

        The interviewee is a professor of political science and so can offer his expertise on events.
        As it was a documentary on Eisenhower’s administration, its purpose is to inform.
        It provides an analysis of the response of Eisenhower to the Little Rock crisis.

Limitations:

        The documentary is specifically on Eisenhower, and lacks focus on the causes and events at
         Little Rock.
        It is only a contemporary political perspective.
        The content of the interview seems to be very critical of Eisenhower’s actions at Little Rock.


The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are
discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting
evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one

Source O             Eisenhower failed to take a moral stand on civil rights, but the source suggests that
                     he acted impressively by returning to the White House to deliver his address to the
                     nation, emphasizing the need to defend law and order.

Source P        The source praises Eisenhower’s actions in sending in troops to prevent “anarchy”,
                suggesting that the role played by the president was crucial. Eisenhower was
                determined to uphold the rulings of the Supreme Court and found a middle way
                through a difficult situation.


Own knowledge   Candidates may offer further details on how Eisenhower used federal troops to
                enforce integration. He had worked patiently with Governor Faubus and believed
                that he had reached an agreement with him that the African American students
                would be enrolled.

                Candidates may argue that the role of the media was significant in resolving the
                crisis. Events unfolding in front of television cameras meant that the violence and
                hostility of the white population was beamed into the homes of millions, giving
                widespread support to Eisenhower’s actions. Candidates may further argue that the
                overall strategy and specific role of the NAACP was important to the success at
                Little Rock. They may also refer to key individuals who took on the task of selecting
                and mentoring the nine students, to test the ruling of the 1954 Brown case. The
                peaceful persistence of the students, such as Elizabeth Eckford, was a factor in
                resolving the crisis, as their actions led to them gaining acceptance for their right to
                education.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention


 17.   (a) Why, according to Source Q, did the US join NATO’s bombing campaign
       against Serbian forces?                                                                        [3]

      To protect innocent people of Kosovo.
      To prevent a wider war by defusing a dangerous situation in Europe.
      To stand united with its allies.
      To uphold its values.


The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each relevant point up
to a maximum of [3].


       (b) What does Source R suggest about the effects of NATO’s bombing campaign?                 [2]

      The bombing campaign caused death and destruction.
      It forced Kosovars to flee from their homes
      It led to Kosovars resenting NATO intervention.

18. With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source T
    for an historian studying NATO’s bombing campaign against Serbian forces.                               [4]

Value:

        The author is a specialist in international security studies.
        The purpose is to provide an academic review of NATO’s intervention in Kosovo.
        It offers an overview of events leading up to the bombing campaign and an analysis of its
         success.


Limitations:

        Written in 2003, some long-term effects of the campaign may not be considered.
        The title of the article suggests that the evaluation may be one-sided.
        The author draws no clear conclusions on the outcome of the intervention.


The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are
discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting
evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one
reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

   wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what candidates may elect
   to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
   required.

   Comparison:

           Both sources suggest that a cause of the bombing campaign was the displacement of 300 000
            Kosovar Albanians in 1998.
           Both sources state that Milošević and the Yugoslav delegation refused to sign the Rambouillet
            Accords.


   Contrast:

           Source S maintains that the bombing campaign avoided a humanitarian disaster whereas Source
            T states that NATO was not successful in stopping the killing.
           While Source S suggests that NATO allies had common aims, Source T suggests that NATO
            members were not unanimous regarding the goals of the campaign.
           While Source S states that the bombing campaign ended due to terms presented by NATO,
            Source T indicates that such terms were presented by the EU and Russia.
           Source S argues that NATO achieved every one of its goals whereas Source T suggests that the
            outcome of the bombing campaign was not clear.

Indicative content

Source Q              The source lists some of the aims of NATO’s campaign, such as the protection of
                      Kosovars against a Serbian military offensive and the preservation of regional
                      stability. Candidates may assess if such aims were achieved successfully or not.

Source R              The source suggests that NATO failed to avoid a humanitarian crisis as the effects
                      of the campaign resulted death and destruction and gave rise to a refugee crisis.

Source S        The NATO bombing campaign was successful, as it achieved all of its goals
                without the loss of NATO soldiers. Indeed, a humanitarian disaster was prevented
                as Serbian forces were forced to withdraw from Kosovo and refugees could return
                in safety. Furthermore, NATO could establish a stronger peacekeeping force in
                Kosovo.

Source T        The outcome of NATO’s bombing campaign was not clear. There were some
                failures, including the increasing exodus of Albanian refugees as well as an
                intensified ethnic cleansing campaign by Serbian forces during the bombing
                campaign. Serbia withdrew its troops in response to terms from the European
                Union and Russia, as opposed to NATO terms.


Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that NATO’s bombing campaign was a military success.
                They may refer to the effectiveness of the air war, which was directed at specific
                targets, with minimal collateral damage and with the loss of only two aircraft and
                no servicemen. During the campaign NATO worked to protect the lives of Kosovar
                Albanians through Operation Allied Harbour. Some candidates may suggest that
                the bombing campaign confirmed NATO’s international role in a post-Cold War
                world.

                Candidates may challenge the view by arguing that NATO did not achieve its
                humanitarian aims, as an estimated 10 000 people died and 1.4 million people
                were displaced. The bombardment gave Milošević the opportunity to implement
                ethnic cleansing plans that may have long been devised, including possible
                evidence on Operation Horseshoe. NATO intervention failed to protect the
                precarious political stability of countries of the region, including Albania and
                Macedonia. Furthermore, candidates may refer to collateral damage in the air war,
                which affected civilians, infrastructure and even refugee columns, and the bombing
                of the Chinese embassy.
