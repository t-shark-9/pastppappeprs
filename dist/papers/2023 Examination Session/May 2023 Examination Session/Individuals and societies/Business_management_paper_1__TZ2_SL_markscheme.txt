                                              Section A
1.   (a)   Outline possible different interests of two external stakeholders arising from SVT’s Outreach
           Programme (lines 96–115)                                                           [4]


           External stakeholders could include: Government, suppliers, customers and
           consumers, local community, financiers, pressure groups, the media, NGOs,
           charities.

           In this instance:

           • People in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) would receive free
              skilled labour;
           • NGOs would get support and cooperation;
           • customers might benefit from new products that might arise from the
              programme eg WF15;
           • possible suppliers for future distribution channels;
           • the media might view SVT in a better light – important because of adverse
              publicity;
           • lower profits might impact on potential investors;
           • local people/communities: would receive training;
           • school education, infrastructure would be repaired.

           N.B. shareholders and the winner of the competition are not considered as external
           stakeholders.

           Accept other relevant stakeholder and interests in context.

           Mark as [2] + [2].


           Award [1] for each correct external stakeholder identified and [1] for a description of
           how that stakeholder’s interests are affected by the outreach programme. Award a
           maximum of [2] per stakeholder.

(b)   Explain the factors that SVT should consider when deciding on a marketing
      strategy for the WF15 water purifier (lines 116-138).                              [6]

      Factors include:
      • market research carried out;
      • marketing budget available;
      • aspects of the 4 P’s.

      Product:
      • winning design;
      • produces sufficient potable water;
      • meets WHO standards.

      Place
      • not yet decided;
      • would need to be able to deliver to remote places;
      • use of agencies overseas?;
      • no existing distribution channel;
      • little experience of distributing consumer products in LEDCs.

      Price
      •  under discussion but one proposal is not-for-profit;
      •  pricing strategy not yet agreed;
      •  impact on other products?;
      •  can SVT afford this?;
      •  subsidize product? Affordable for families versus unhappy stakeholders?.

      Promotion
      • choice of media is important, few newspapers read, few televisions owned;
      • however large and growing use of social media;
      • can use the CSR aspect in general promotion for the business.

      Candidates are not required to follow a 4P’s approach and may use different parts of the
      course to answer this question. Finance, staffing etc. could be valid factors to consider.

      Accept any other relevant factor and explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] if the explanation is limited to one factor.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

2.   (a)   Outline two possible economies of scale that are likely to have been achieved
           through the takeover of H4 (lines 49–81).                                           [4]

           Possible economies of scale include:

           Technical: Does the businesses have better technology? Would it be cheaper to
           install technology across a range of businesses?

           Managerial: Perhaps it reduced the number of managers needed. Managers
           specialize in one job. They can work with greater efficiency;

           Financial: The businesses taken over were small so maybe not much power in
           financial markets, but the combined size might be significant. Bigger
           businesses are less risky than smaller businesses. Banks will charge lower rates
           of interest on loans and overdrafts;

           Marketing: We don’t know much about how the products are promoted. We do
           know there’s a significant marketing budget which needs to be spread over a
           wider range of products. They can direct more effective marketing campaigns.

           Purchasing: Do the various firms share similar raw materials? Bulk buying;

           Risk bearing: Fewer competitors, lower risk? They spread the risk of one
           product failing.

           Mark as [2] + [2].


           Award [1] for each economy of scale identified and [1] for an outline of how that
           economy of scale relates to SVT PLC. Award a maximum of [2] per economy of
           scale.

(b)   Explain the advantages of organizing SVT into divisions based on product
      (lines 10–14).                                                                     [6]

      Possible advantages include:

      • decisions can be made quicker eg Yannick’s quick response to a crisis;
      • leadership style can be chosen to suit needs eg Ariadne versus Yannick;
      • each division will have its own areas of expertise and it will be easier to
        ensure these skills are focused where needed eg Consumer Products will
        probably need people able to undertake consumer market research and have
        marketing and sales experts;
      • customers will know where in the organization to seek help and advice eg
        potential customers seeking desalination equipment will have immediate links
        with the Desalination Division;
      • it may be easier to focus finance and other support to areas where it is
        most needed eg if a new major project is to be undertaken, the Engineering
        Division might be the key focus.

      Accept any other relevant advantage and explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] for an answer that limits explanation to one advantage.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.

3.   (a)   Outline two steps in the recruitment process for the 300 new employees needed for the
           former H4 factories (lines 65–72).                                                      [4]

           Steps include:

           Identification: of job role:
           • doing a job audit;
           • preparing job description;
           • person specification.

           Attracting applicants

           Applications:
           • job advertisement;
           • application forms designed, circulated, received;
           • recruitment by business or agency?

           Selection:
           • shortlisting;
           • testing;
           • interviewing.

           Candidates can be rewarded for identifying any of the main headings or the sub-
           headings. These ideas can be contextualized by reference to the facts that:
           • 300 vacancies to fill is a large number;
           • the vacancies are for highly skilled people;
           • there are a few such highly skilled people available;
           • range of skills needed, so recruitment may have to be spread over a variety
             of methods;
           • the HR department should choose carefully where to advertise the
             vacancies;
           • teamwork necessary: may require testing;
           • there may not have been sufficient suitable applicants in UK alone;
           • recruitment methods to be decided (interviews, tasks, tests, etc.): what
             cost? What might be best method for selecting?

           N.B. Do not accept any form of training including induction.

           Mark as [2] + [2].


           Award [1] for each correct step identified and [1] for a description of how that
           step relates to SVT. Award a maximum of [2] per step.

(b)   Explain suitable sources of finance that SVT may have used when taking over
      the small water filter manufacturers in Europe and the United States of America
      (USA) (lines 91–92).                                                               [6]


      SVT is a public limited company so a range of sources could include:

      • Loans/mortgages/bonds/debentures etc. business is profitable, works well,
        banks and other investors may want to lend with favourable conditions
        (interest rates, terms, favourable conditions for collateral etc.);
      • share issue: conditions are good for a share issue: PLC, good reputation,
        sound profits successful business;
      • profits: are there any retained profits not yet spent? Sufficient for such a
        development?
      • Joint ventures/venture capital: no real evidence that these are needed.
        Would they want it?

      Accept any other relevant source of finance and explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

      Award a maximum of [4] for an answer that limits explanation to one source of
      finance.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation is mainly descriptive, but in context.
      Eg if most of the context is mentioned but not developed.

                                               Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term quota sampling.                                                          [2]

           Quota sampling: gathers data from a group or sub-group with a specified number
           (target) of participants (respondents) in each group or sub-group. Groups/sub-
           groups will have specific traits/characteristics.

           Quota sampling involves segmenting a given population into a number of
           groups that share certain characteristics (mutually exclusive sub-groups) such
           as age and gender. Targets are then set for the number of people who must be
           selected in each segment.

           One starts by dividing the population into mutually exclusive groups or sub-groups
           (called strata) and sample units are selected, until the quotas (targets) are reached.

           N.B. no application required.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above.

     (b)   (i)  Calculate SVT’s home water filter market share in 2022 (show all your
           working).                                                                                      [2]

           World market in 2022 = $14bn
           SVT’s total revenue = $4.9 bn
           SVT’s market share = (SVT’s total revenue / World market in 2022) x 100 = ($4.9
           bn/14bn) x 100 = 35%

           Award [2] for working and a correct answer which must include the percentage
           sign (%) either in the final answer, or in the working.

           Award [1] for some correct working but with an arithmetic error.

           Do not reward formula only.

           (ii) Calculate the number of home water filters SVT sold in 2022 to the rest of
           the world (excluding Europe and the USA) (show all your working).             [2]

           SVT’s sales are $4.9bn
           SVT’s sales to Europe and the USA = 90% of SVT’s total sales
           SVT’s sales to the rest of world = $0.49bn (10% of total sales)
           Average revenue earned per water filter = $20
           So, $0.49bn/$20 = 24.5m water filters

           Alternative answer:
           $490 000 000 / $20 = 24 500 000 water filters

           Award [2] for working and a correct answer with the correct unit (“water filters” or
           “units” or “pieces” or “products”) either in the final answer, or in the working.

           the world”) but with an arithmetic error.

(c)   Explain two factors that SVT would have needed to consider when deciding
      where to open the new factory in Asia.                                               [4]

      Possible factors include:

      • how do rents and cost of land compare between existing factories and Asia?
      • how do energy costs compare (again high in US/Europe);
      • what management issues are there, possibly with different cultures?;
      • what would happen to existing employees?;
      • main markets are outside Asia (90% of sales are in Europe and USA), so
        possible logistical issues (infrastructure, transport): distance from suppliers
        and customers so is this a sustainable model?;
      • availability of sufficient skilled labour in Asia?;
      • legal (law, tax) issues especially about pollution and the environment;
      • support (or not) from the government (and the community) of the country where
        the new factory is located.


      Accept any other relevant factor.

      Candidates may use different parts of the course to answer this question, for
      example with external factors from a STEEPLE analysis, or considering the
      “business functions” (finance: costs; human resources: available workforce;
      operations: logistics etc.). All these approaches are fine. The question is about
      “opening a new factory in Asia”, not about selling and commercializing in Asia, so
      factors such as local demand, local competition and advertising are not relevant.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for each relevant factor in context and an additional of [1] for an
      explanation linking that factor to SVT. Maximum 2 factors.

(d)   Discuss whether SVT should have increased the price of its home water filters.     [10]

      Possible arguments in favour:

      • enabled them to launch advertising campaign which would potentially benefit
        millions;
      • enabled some filters to be provided free to charities in LEDCs;
      • fits in with SVT’s CSR ideas;
      • good for SVT’s reputation;
      • 80% of SVT’s customers in Europe and the USA have above-average incomes
        and can afford the price increase from $20 to $21.
      Possible arguments against:

      •   many customers may not be able to afford the increased price;
      •   sales might fall;
      •   say lead to lower profits;
      •   some directors disagree.


      Accept any other relevant arguments.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4 with further
      guidance below.

      Theoretical answer or context limited to naming the business or lack of
      development max [4].

      Discussion of only one option marks limited to [5].

      Discussion but no clear balance [6].

      Options considered, good use of evidence, particularly from section B, but no
      effective conclusion award a maximum of [8].

      For [10] the answer needs to be clearly relevant to SVT with good use of context
      and a clear sense of whether or not SVT should have increased its prices.
