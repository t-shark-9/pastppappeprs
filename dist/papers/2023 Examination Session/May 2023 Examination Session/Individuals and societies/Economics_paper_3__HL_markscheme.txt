Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02
   command terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit
   should be given.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly or for not including the appropriate
   units. However, a candidate may only be penalized ONCE per script for each type of error.


1.   (a)   (i)    Using the information in Figure 1, calculate the price elasticity of demand
                  for capsicums when the price increases from NZ$18 per kg to NZ$24 per
                  kg.                                                                              [2]

                                           18

                  Any valid working (correct %Δ Qd or %Δ P, provided the formula is not
                  inverted) is sufficient for [1].
                  = – 0.82 or 0.82 or 0.8̅1 (repeating) or 9/11
                  An answer of – 0.82 or 0.82 or 0.8̅1 without any valid working is sufficient
                  for [1].

                  For full marks to be awarded, the response must provide valid working.

           (ii)   Calculate the loss in consumer surplus resulting from the increase in the
                  price of capsicums from NZ$18 per kg to NZ$24 per kg.                            [2]

                  (0.5 × 40 000 (40 – 24)) – (0.5 × 55 000 (40 – 18))

                  OR

                  Change in CS = 0.5 (55 000 + 40 000) × 6

                  Any valid working is sufficient for [1]

                  = $285 000

                  An answer of 285 or 285 000 (or –285 or –285 000) without any valid
                  working is sufficient for [1].

                  For full marks to be awarded, the response must provide valid working and
                  include correct units.

(iii)   Calculate the revenue per kilogram (after tax has been paid) to producers
        when the price is NZ$24 per kg.                                                      [2]

                        24
        Revenue/kg =
                       1.2
        Any valid working (eg division by 1.2) is sufficient for [1]

        = $20

        An answer of 20 or $20 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

        For full marks to be awarded, the response must provide valid working and
        include correct units.

        A response that calculates total revenue and that produces a correct
        answer of $800 000 may be awarded [1].

(iv)    With reference to Figure 1, explain why the price elasticity of demand for
        capsicums would change if the price continued to increase beyond NZ$24
        per kg.                                                                              [4]

         1        The written response is limited.                                 1–2
                  For the idea that as price increases from $24/kg demand will
                  become more price elastic [1]
                  and, therefore, the (absolute) value of PED rises / an accurate
                  calculation of PED that demonstrates how elasticity rises as the
                  price rises [1]
         2        The written response is accurate.                                3–4
                  For an explanation that as price increases beyond $24/kg
                  demand will become more price elastic/more responsive to an
                  increase in price / accurate calculation [2]
                  because of one of the following [2]:
                  • As price increases consumers will be more inclined to
                     purchase a substitute good instead of capsicums
                  • As price increases the proportion of income spent on
                     capsicums/the product will increase
                  • As price increases the % change in quantity demanded of
                     capsicums increases while the % change in price decreases
                  • PED=(1/slope) x (P/Q). Since (1/slope) is a constant and P
                     and Q move in opposite directions then necessarily when P
                     changes the Q of capsicums and PED will change.

        A response that does not make some reference to the diagram (eg linear demand
        curve; capsicums; a calculation) may be awarded a maximum of [3].

(iv)   A Nigerian business pays US$14 000 every year to a consultant in the
       United States. Using the information in Table 2, calculate the increase in
       the cost of this payment, in naira, between 2018 and 2020.                         [2]

       2018: 14 000 × 306.5 = 4 291 000

       2020: 14 000 × 379.5 = 5 313 000

       Increase = 5 313 000 – 4 291 000

       Any valid working (either 2018 or 2020 is correct) is sufficient for [1].

       = 1 022 000

       An answer of 1 022 000 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

          rate is maintained above the equilibrium or free market value or
          floating rate value.

(vi)    Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how the Central Bank of Nigeria
        might attempt to maintain a fixed exchange rate.                                 [4]

          For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram with a
          shift of the demand curve for the naira to the right and an
          increase in the exchange rate OR for an explanation that the
          central bank is selling foreign currency to purchase naira, thus
          increasing the demand for naira on the foreign exchange market
          and bringing the price of the naira back to the fixed rate.

           shift of the demand curve for the naira to the right and an
           increase in the exchange rate AND for an explanation that the
           central bank is selling foreign currency to purchase naira, thus
           increasing the demand for naira on the foreign exchange market
           and bringing the price of the naira back to the fixed rate.

        An alternative approach which suggests that the central bank may increase the
        interest rate, which may increase the demand for naira, may be fully rewarded.

Alternatively, the increase in interest rates may decrease the supply of naira, as
investors may be discouraged from selling naira in the foreign exchange market
in order to invest overseas, OR the central bank reduces its sales of naira, which
shifts supply to the left. Therefore, a diagram which shows a shift of supply of
naira to the left should be rewarded.




Another valid approach would be to show that, at the fixed exchange rate, a
surplus of naira would need to be offset by the central bank purchasing naira,
thus increasing demand for the naira.

For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price/value

(viii) Using an AD/AS diagram and information from Table 2, explain how the
       change in the official value of the naira between 2018 and 2020 might have
       influenced the rate of inflation for Nigeria.                                       [4]

          For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a rise
          in aggregate demand and an increase in the average price level
          OR for explaining that a fall in the price of the naira will result in
          an increase in net exports (X-M), due to cheaper exports and/or
          more expensive imports, which increases AD, causing (demand-
          pull) inflation.

           and/or more expensive imports, which increases AD, causing
           (demand-pull) inflation.

        Candidates might explain that the depreciating naira results in an increase
        in the cost of imported inputs and therefore, a fall in (short-run) aggregate
        supply, resulting in (cost-push) inflation. This alternative approach should
        be fully rewarded.

        If the student assumes that the naira has appreciated (revalued), an
        accurate diagram (with AD shifting left or SRAS shifting right) and

(b)   Using the text/data provided and your knowledge of economics, recommend a
      policy which could be introduced in Nigeria to stabilize the value of the naira.         [10]

      Possible policies may include (but are not restricted to):
      • Policies to increase the export of manufactured goods (supply-side policies)
      • Interest rate increase
      • Exchange controls – limiting access to foreign currency
      • Adopting a floating exchange rate
      • Demand-management policies to limit imports (expenditure reducing)
      • Trade barriers to reduce import spending (expenditure switching)
      • Borrowing from overseas
      • Attempt to persuade fellow OPEC members to increase the world price of oil
      • Tax and other incentives to encourage inward foreign direct investment and portfolio
        investment
      • Since most rice is imported, incentives to agricultural sector to grow rice
      • Any other valid policy.
