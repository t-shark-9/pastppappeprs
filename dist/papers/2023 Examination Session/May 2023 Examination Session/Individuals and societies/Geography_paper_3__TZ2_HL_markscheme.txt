1.   (a)   Analyse the economic risks that new technologies are creating for different places.         [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Economic risks can encompass loss of income/earnings, unemployment (or loss of
           job security), business closures and loss of tax revenues. Identity theft may lead to
           catastrophic losses for targeted individuals.
           New technologies include digital/online services/activity (including those which help
           facilitate the global shift of industry and online retailing), industrial automation, drones,
           3D printing and artificial intelligence (AI).
           Places are geographical contexts which may be analysed with reference to criteria such
           as their development indicators, urban/rural characteristics, industrial/retailing dependence,
           etc. In any context, the economic risks may be universal or more selective in terms of
           which members of a society or community are affected.

           Possible technologies and risks:
           • Digital retailing growth, accelerated by Covid-19, has led to the closure of many stores
              in high streets and cities throughout the world, affecting incomes and tax revenues.
           • Digital technology allows TNCs to develop complex supply chains, resulting in
              deindustrialization of urban districts e.g. ‘rust belt’ US cities.
           • Drones and 3D printing are ‘disruptive’ technologies which bring benefits but may
              lead to the loss/closure of some traditional services/types of employment.
           • Identity theft, hacking, counterfeiting and the losses this brings to individuals.
           • Surveillance may make it harder for some people to conduct illegal forms of trade.
           • AI could have negative economic impacts (job losses or replacing humans) but also
              benefits (lowers costs, might help students gain qualifications and higher pay).
           • Credit other ‘new’ technologies whose risks are only now becoming apparent.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding (AO1)
           in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a structured systematic
           analysis of different kinds of economic risk and their possible severity (incomes, business
           closures, taxes etc). Another approach might be to provide a structured systematic analysis
           of different categories of place (high streets, industrial zones, high-income countries etc).
           Another approach might be to analyse the net long-term risk (e.g. new technology both
           creates and destroys jobs; thus the long-term risk may be lower than it appears at first).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of problems associated with two
           new/recent technologies/developments.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:

           • either how two or more new technologies create different kinds of economic risk
           • or varied places/geographical contexts in which technological change is happening.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

           Historical examples can be partially credited if they include an appropriate analysis of the
           concept of ‘economic risk’ and show geographic understanding of how places and contexts
           can vary.

(b)   To what extent do low-income countries and their citizens have global power
      and influence?                                                                              [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to the
      markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.

      Low-income countries are crudely classified as such according to average incomes
      (usually adjusted for purchasing power). Some have been re-classified as middle-
      income/emerging economies; however, incomes remain relatively low compared with most
      high-income OECD countries. Local conditions vary greatly within many LICs (e.g. rural and
      urban areas). Credit any reasonable framing of ‘low’ or ‘high’ income used by candidates
      (e.g. China might be framed as ‘lower’ or ‘higher’ depending on context and time period
      used). Some citizens and communities may have far greater involvement than others in, and
      potential influence over, global interactions e.g. growth of global culture; UN/WTO voting
      rights; role in environmental conferences and agreements. Power can be defined as an
      ability to create or resist change; governments use soft power (e.g. influence of media and
      diplomacy) and hard power (e.g. military and economic tools).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • influence via MGO membership e.g. African trade agreements [Guide 4.2]
      • adoption of communications technology in LICs and increased involvement and
         influence within global social media networks [Guide 4.3]
      • positive involvement in UN agreements and initiatives e.g. SDGs [Guide 5.1]
      • diffusion of cultural traits originating in LICs/EEs, such as music or food [Guide 5.2]
      • countries who are sources for valuable raw materials, providing them with leverage on
         the world stage (e.g. history of OPEC nations gaining influence)
      • growth of global diaspora communities e.g. contemporary migration of Somalis, Afghans;
         implications of historical/colonial ties between ‘core’ and ‘periphery’ nations [Guide 5.2]
      • specific instances of sporting or musical or sporting celebrities; but concerns exist about
         ‘brain drain effect’ (talented citizens may migrate elsewhere)
      • role of some LIC-based organizations in global tensions/conflicts [Guide 6.1]
      • influence of some LIC-based organizations over illegal global flows e.g. narcotics
         (Afghanistan, Colombia) [Guide 4.2].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other) themes
      in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement that
      evaluates the distinction between different types of power and influence. Another approach
      might be to evaluate the connectivity and potential influence of particular places (megacities
      compared with isolated areas) and different countries. Another approach might be to
      evaluate the influence of LICs as global environmental stakeholders who may be able to
      influence global governance of climate change or other concerning issues. A good evaluation
      may conclude with a substantiated final judgement on the overall influence held by LIC
      citizens and governments in a global context.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and/or imbalanced outlining of two or
      three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
        and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the reasons why some national governments introduce
           trade restrictions.                                                                   [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Reasons include: economic, social and political arguments favouring
           protectionism; politically-motivated sanctions; environnemental/social/ethical
           reasons for restriction of some trade flows. Contemporary examples could
           include the USA, China or Bolivia. Also, the war in Ukraine.
           Trade restriction methods include tariffs, quotas, sanctions, etc. The most likely
           foci are protectionism and resource nationalism (in relation to e.g. rare earths).
           National governments may introduce policies on a targeted/sectoral basis;
           or may have a wider agenda (e.g. N Korea).

           Emphasis should be placed on the reasons why national governments seek to
           restrict trade with some or all nations. These may include:
           • the perception that it is economically advantageous to do so (imports may
              threaten a country’s domestic industries and economic growth)
           • evidence that other countries are not “playing by the rules” (e.g. Chinese
              government support/subsidies for industries runs afoul of WTO free trade
              rulings) – this may apply to particular sectors only, however
           • political reasons/trade embargoes (e.g. USA with Cuba, Iran; sanctions)
           • the perception that benefits of free trade do not outweigh harm done to
              deindustrialized regions and communities
           • the political manifestos of elected leaders and parties (possibly in relation to
              populist or nationalist agendas, and re-shoring promises).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured response based around different categories of reason/rationale (there
           may be economic, social, political gains). Another approach might be to analyse,
           in turn, the differing strength and/or scale of trade restrictions (ranging from
           complete embargo to highly-targeted actions e.g. tariffs on solar panels or
           processors).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of one or two generalized reasons/
           methods. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either two or more reasons why governments may restrict trade using different
             methods (e.g. protectionism, geopolitical reasons, sanctions)
           • or a wider variety of national/political reasons and contexts (e.g. varying scale
             or strength of restrictions/protectionism/nationalism).

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “Physical factors are the main reason why cultural diversity varies from place to place.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                     [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to
      the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.

      Physical factors, depending on the scale of analysis, include relief, terrain,
      climate, accessibility, ecosystems access to a coastline, proximity to other
      places/countries/people.
      Cultural diversity describes the heterogeneity of a population, measured
      according to traits/criteria such as ethnicity, race, language, clothing, music, diet,
      etc. Allow for a wide interpretation of this concept.
      Place is a concept applicable at scales varying from neighbourhood to national
      geographies, or varying contexts such as rural and urban areas. Good answers
      are likely to show understanding of this. Physical place characteristics (climate)
      may in turn influence culture and cultural landscape (clothing; housing character).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • what is meant by cultural diversity and cultural traits
      • the role of migration and diasporas in giving rise to diversity
      • the geography of physically isolated areas (island states, remote and hard-to-reach rural
        areas)
      • political factors affecting cultural diversity and cultural isolation (e.g. migration rules)
      • historical factors responsible for cultural diversity/homogeneity e.g. colonialism
      • shrinking world/spread of global culture and the lessening of diversity in some
        places e.g. loss of languages.

      Candidates may show greater familiarity with non-physical factors/reasons. They
      should, however, try to engage with physical factors and reasons. Unbalanced
      responses (with very few or detailed physical factors/reasons mentioned) are
      unlikely to reach to the top end of the 9-12 band.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three of more of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement, which discusses its veracity at different scales or for different contexts
      (local, rural, urban, national). Another approach might be to critically discuss
      different perspectives on what cultural diversity means, e.g. dimensions of
      language/religion/ethnicity, and the extent to which physical factors/isolation
      could affect each of these dimensions. A good discussion may conclude with a
      substantiated final judgement on the relative importance or significance of
      physical factors.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and/or imbalanced outlining of two or
      three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide, including one physical factor
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Analyse how people’s perception of a “shrinking world” has been
           influenced by different transport and communications technologies.                          [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Transport and communications technology includes: shipping, railways and
           airplanes, spanning civilian, commercial and military spheres of activity; telephone
           and broadband services, and the growth of different social media platforms and
           services. The timeline of innovation stretches back over centuries or thousands of
           years.

           The shrinking world effect is the perception that distant places feel closer together
           and more closely interconnected in ‘time-space’ than in the past when travel times
           were longer.

           People’s perception is shaped in a range of ways, including their participation in
           tourism and travel (i.e. flows of people); receipt of goods and services from distant
           places (i.e. flows of trade); global social networking and use of global
           entertainment platforms e.g. Amazon, Netflix (i.e. flows of ideas). People’s
           perceptions depend additionally on: their local geographical and developmental
           context; their age and other identity criteria; their access to and use of online/digital
           technologies such as Zoom and Teams (or lack of access in some countries and
           contexts).

           Likely themes for analysis include:
           • Successive revolutions in sail and steam technology, and the falling time
               taken to circumnavigate the globe by sea.
           • The telegraph, telephone and internet; accelerated use of teleworking and
               online learning during lockdowns.
           • The importance of air travel in reducing time travel between continents, and
               increasing access to low-cost air travel over time.
           • The key role of the motor car for individuals and societies with a growing
               middle-class of consumers.
           • Other key breakthroughs such as: high-speed rail travel; space travel
               (photographs of planet Earth and their influence on culture and people’s
               perceptions).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of the way different technologies, in chronological
           order, have influenced the shrinking world effect as experienced by connected groups
           of people. Another approach might be to analyse the relative importance of different
           technologies. Another approach might be to analyse the varying perceptions of
           different communities in located contexts.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the way two or more
           types of transport/technology have connected people and places in generalized ways.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either a range of technologies that allow people to experience the shrinking world
             effect (for example via travel, trade and information exchange)
           • or the varying perceptions of different individuals and societies with varying access
             to, or use of, technologies.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   To what extent have people in wealthy countries benefitted from global interactions?        [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to
      the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.

      People may benefit in varied ways– including positive and quantifiable changes in
      income/wealth, health and welfare, rights and freedoms, along with harder-to-
      quantify/subjective benefits such as happiness and sense of belonging/identity/culture.
      Global interactions and flows have multiple dimensions, spanning trade, lending,
      migration, information exchanges, governance etc. One view is that some local societies
      in wealthy countries have experienced economic losses due to de-industrialization, while
      the opposing view is that the global shift of polluting industries has benefited HICs. Views
      diverge (e.g. in UK, US) on whether cultural and political globalization is beneficial
      /desirable.
      Wealthy countries is a broad category which includes high-income countries (HICs) and
      might also include emerging economies (EEs) and OPEC countries - a wide range of
      interpretations are allowed. Differing experiences of people can be explored at local scales
      (urban and rural areas). Impacts on particular societies may not be uniform: improvements
      (or otherwise) may vary according to income, race and other identity criteria.

       Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of the
       diverse challenges and opportunities associated with:
      • global governance to tackle climate change which affects all countries [Guide 2.3]
      • the actions of TNCs, including inward investment, outsourcing, offshoring and
          glocalization, and their impact on the lives of societies in HICs and EEs [Guide 4.2]
      • new technologies and benefits (and challenges) they bring [Guide 4.3]
      • economic migration and remittance flows, and their links with the societies and
          economies of wealthy countries [Guide 4.2]
      • global and local cultural changes (linked with music and social media for example),
          loss of sovereignty, and varying perspectives on these changes [Guide 5.2]
      • technological and environmental risks associated with global interactions (these
          should be explicitly linked with impacts on HICs and/or EEs) [Guide 6.1-6.2]
      • tax avoidance by TNCs could increase personal wealth of some individuals
          (company owners and shareholders) but governments lose income [Guide 6.1].

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other) themes
      in a well-structured (AO4) way. Good answers may additionally offer a critical
      evaluation (AO3b) of the statement that critically discusses different perspectives on
      which changes are most beneficial – and which are not. Another approach might be
      to evaluate the extent to which the most powerful wealthy countries have benefited
      most (e.g. comparing the US with China). Another approach might be to evaluate the
      contribution made by different global processes (trade, migration, data flows etc) to
      quality of life improvements in specified local places. A good evaluation may conclude
      with a substantiated final judgement on the overall impact of global interactions on the
      societies and environments of wealthy countries.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and/or imbalanced outlining of two
      or three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.
