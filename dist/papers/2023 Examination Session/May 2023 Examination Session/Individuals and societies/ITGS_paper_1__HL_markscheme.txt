Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to
include a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is
no “correct” answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which
synthesize and evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                               Section A

1.   Intelligent Transport Monitoring (Government and Politics / Environment)

     (a)   (i)     State two file formats that could be used for the images of car number
                   plates.                                                                           [2]

                   • Gif

                   Award [1] for each file format stated up to [2].


           (ii)    Identify two pieces of information, in addition to the location of the vehicle,
                   that could be communicated from a vehicle to the monitoring centre.               [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Speed of travel / stopping (lack of speed)
                   • Direction of travel
                   • Rate of acceleration/braking
                   • Distance travelled
                   • Registration number / number plate number
                   • Time of event / time reading taken

                   Award [1] for identifying each other piece of information that could be
                   communicated from the vehicle to the monitoring centre up to [2].


           (iii)   The government is considering using the data from the Intelligent Transport
                   Monitoring System (ITMS) to create a model of the traffic patterns in a city.

                   Identify two factors that should be taken into account when developing this
                   model.                                                                            [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Quality of the data which is used in the model (GIGO)
                   • Quantity of the data which is used in the model
                   • Bias when deciding which data should be used to develop the model.
                   • Number of variables taken into account
                   • Sample size / variety (is the data collected at various times of the day
                     and at multiple locations)

                   Award [1] for identifying each factor that should be taken into account when
                   developing this model up to [2].
                                              –5–                  M23/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   (i)    The government also wants to use the Intelligent Transport Monitoring
             System (ITMS) to produce a simulation of traffic patterns.

             Explain one benefit of producing a simulation of traffic patterns.               [2]

             Answers may include:
             • enables testing of extreme situations (e.g. congestion due to a big event)
             • In order to predict the outcomes in order to prevent problems.

             • can easily test outcomes from potentially dangerous situations
             • In order to avoid these situations happening.

             • obtain results immediately
             • rather than waiting for a specific event to happen in reality.

             • help in predicting factors that promote a smooth, convenient and time efficient
               commute
             • additional mark for examples of these factors or solutions.

             • by using simulations to model the effect of changes to the road network conditions
               e.g. like the timing to traffic lights, or creating alternative routes.

             Award [1] for identifying a benefit of a simulation and [1] for a development
             of that benefit up to [2].


      (ii)   Explain one advantage of outsourcing the development and operation of
             the Intelligent Transport Monitoring System (ITMS) to a company in another
             country.                                                                         [2]

             Answers may include:
             • Not the technical skills within Uganda
             • Therefore, it is unlikely the system will be developed to the specifications
               required

             • Existing traffic monitoring systems may exist in other countries.
             • Therefore, the Ugandan Government may be able to purchase an
               existing system and get it modified which will be quicker and cheaper
               than developing it in house.

             • Employment costs might be lower in another country.
             • Therefore this would lower the overall cost of the project.

             • Government of Uganda will not need to invest the money needed in
               providing hardware and employing people to run the system in their own
               country.
             • Thereby lowering the cost of the project for the government.

             Award [1] for identifying an advantage of a simulation and [1] for a
             development of that advantage up to [2].

(iii)   Explain one disadvantage of outsourcing the development and operation of
        the Intelligent Transport Monitoring System (ITMS) to a company in another
        country.                                                                         [2]

        Answers may include
        • Data protection rules may differ from country to country
        • and this might put the data at risk.

        • The foreign company may not understand the problem which the
          Ugandan government is trying to solve
        • because it is different from the problems which they experience in their
          own country.

        • Ugandan government may lose control over the project
        • and find it difficult to direct the project according to their needs.

        Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage of a simulation and [1] for a
        development of that disadvantage up to [2].

(c)   Discuss whether the advantages for the government of monitoring the movement
      of vehicles in the Republic of Uganda outweigh the disadvantages.                    [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages
      • Will be able to cut down on crimes e.g., which involve 'get away cars’.
      • Allows government to track down cars in an emergency or if there is theft.
      • Helps the government maintain safer roads as citizens drive more safely as
        they know they are being monitored
      • Could help government see where the traffic is, and therefore do something to
        improve the traffic situation
      • Could be used to see what time of day the traffic is worst / best.
      • Could be used to see where there are regular traffic jams.
      • Could be used to identify roads which are not heavily used.
      • Could be used to see what types of vehicles use which routes.
      • Could be used to see what the speed of vehicles travelling on different roads
        is (for example to recommend speed bumps or speed cameras).
      • Could be used to deploy emergency services or traffic police in the case of an
        unforeseen event or emergency.
      • Extra jobs are created by the implementing the system in various sectors.

      Disadvantages
      • May make citizens think the government is spying on them I.e. breakdown of
         trust.
      • Could be used to suppress right to freedom of movement or association I.e.
         see where people are and who they are near.
      • If the data was hacked, criminals would be able to tell when people are not at
         home and this might lead to increased crime.
      • Will cost the citizens money as they need to pay for the system during
         registration which could lead to problems for the government if citizens refuse
         to pay this fee.
      • May lead to a black economy or ways that the ITMS will be circumvented.
      • Cost of the system for the government
      • Government would need to employ people to implement, maintain and monitor
         the new system. This would include training.
      • Government would need to roll out an information campaign to inform people
         about the system which will cost money and require staff.

2.   EyesOnU; (Home and Leisure)

     (a)   (i)     State the primary key in the Users table in Figure 3.                              [1]
                   • UserID


           (ii)    State the relationship between the Users table and Images table in
                   Figure 3.                                                                          [1]
                   • One to many


           (iii)   Identify two reasons for using a relational database to store this information.    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Reduces redundant data / redundancy
                   • Saves storage space
                   • Reduces errors (caused by repeating data un-necessarily)
                   • Allows for database to be normalised (avoids anomalies)
                   • Increases integrity by avoiding update errors (data is updated in one
                     table but not in another when the data is not in a relational database)

                   Award [1] for identifying each reason for using a relational database up to [2].


           (iv)    Describe the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web.               [2]

                   Answers may include
                   • Internet is the physical networks of computers which spans the world
                   • WWW is the websites / webpages stored on webservers which are
                     viewed in a browser.

                   Award [1] for describing each difference between the Internet and the World
                   Wide Web up to [2].

(b)   The EyesOnU facial recognition tool has drawn criticism from privacy
      campaigners who say that the tool could be used to compromise a user’s privacy.
      EyesOnU has stated that their privacy policy will prevent this.

      Explain three rules that could be included in a privacy policy for EyesOnU.          [6]

      Answers may include:
      • Images will only be used for the purpose intended.
      • This will mean that users must specify the purpose for which the image is
        intended when it is uploaded and if they intend to use for other purposes must
        complete a check box to acknowledge they give their consent for the image to
        be other uses.

      • Images will only be shared with the consent of the subject
      • So if another user wishes to use an image they must contact the owner of the
        image before they can use it (this may include a check box where the subject
        of the image formally gives permission for it to be used).

      • Images will be stored for a limited time only.
      • Which means that the images stored on EyesOnU will automatically be
        deleted unless the subject provides permission for it to be kept on the website
        for longer.

      • Details of the image owner will not be shared with third parties.
      • If the image owner wishes to share their personal details with third parties
        (such as age, location, gender etc), they must give additional consent.

      • Only relevant information should be collected / stored.
      • For example the address of the person need not be stored along with the
        image as it is not needed for the purpose of searching the pictures.

      Award [1] for identifying each rule that would be included in a privacy policy for
      EyesOnU and [1] for a development of that reason up to [2].

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

(c)   There have been concerns raised about the way people use facial recognition
      sites like EyesOnU.

      To what extent is it the responsibility of the website owners and the users of
      EyesOnU to ensure that users act ethically?                                            [8]

      Answers may include:

      Responsibility of the users of EyesOnU
      • EyesOnU cannot be held responsible for the actions of every user and
        appropriate use of the service requires users to act responsibly
      • Each user must read the privacy policy and agree to its terms before using the
        service.
      • Each user must only use the site for what it was intended (search for their own
        photographs).
      • Users Should take responsibility for their own behaviour, for example they
        should not use the site to carry out activities such as spying on other people,
        stealing another user's identity or tracking another user.

      Responsibility of EyesOnU
      • Allows users to check to see if their photos are being used on other websites
        without permission
      • EyesOnU has a set of terms and conditions and it is a requirement that every
        user signs this before they can use the service.
      • EyesOnU does not allow minors to use the service (may require ID check)
      • EyesOnU uses algorithms that are not harmful to the users. This may include
        adapting algorithms used that have proved to be harmful.
      • Should take appropriate action when users are seen to be acting
        inappropriately / should be cognizant of the way the service is being used.
      • Should provide appropriate duty of care to users, for example, to deal with
        conflict resolution.
      • EyesOnU should ensure that the photos that are uploaded to the site are only
        of the face of the registered user and does not contain any other images of
        other people or parts of the body.

      Conclusions
      • It is unrealistic for either the users or EyesOnU to be the only party who is
        acting unethically. Both sides must act ethically.
      • Users must police their own behaviour so that it is easier for EyesOnU to
        police the behaviour of all users.
      • Ethical behaviour, and its promotion, should lead to the development of trust
        between EyesOnU and its users, or between users.
      • It could be difficult to verify that users are only uploading their own images and
        not engaging in wrongful activities

                  • using User B’s public key
                  • Encrypted message / cypher text is sent to User B
                  • User B decrypts the message,
                  • using their private key.

 (b)    It has been proposed that the following measures could be introduced to reduce
        the risk of users spreading false information:
        • Limiting the size of the messaging app groups.
        • Limiting the number of times a message can be forwarded.
        • Labelling messages as being forwarded.

        Analyse this proposal.                                                                     [6]

        Answers may include:

        Reasons that support the proposal
        • Limiting the size of the group - fewer people will see a message in a particular
          group
        • Limiting the size of the group - people might be more selective about who they
          invite to a group they have created
        • Limiting the number of times a message can be forwarded - there is a reduced
          risk of a message 'going viral’.
        • Labelling messages as being forwarded -people will be able to see that the
          message has not been written by the person who forwarded it.

        Reasons that do not support the proposal
        • Limiting size of group - users may simply make several groups to get around the group
          size limit
        • Limiting forwarding – message may still reach a large number of people in groups
        • Labelling messages as forwarded – some people could miss this if it is not evident enough
        • Labelling messages as forwarded - Could get around forwarding restrictions
          by retyping the information or by taking a screen shot and sending that.

        Analysis
        • Only slows the dissemination of false information, but does not stop it
        • The technical solution to the problem may be less effective than inculcating good
          behaviour in the users of these messaging apps.
        • Users of this messaging service may use other similar services so the problem is
          displaced rather than resolved.
        • Users of the service may find ways to get around the restrictions

(c)   To what extent is it the responsibility of the individuals within these communities
      to address the issue of false information being spread on social media?                    [8]

      Answers may include:
      Individuals can take responsibility for their use of social media by:
      • Individuals should take more responsibility for fact checking information they receive /
      • Individuals should try to gather information from a range of sources to determine the
         veracity of the information rather than to assume everything they receive is true.
      • Individuals should be accountable for their own actions such as forwarded information that
         may be false
      • Individuals should not act on the information without considering the implications of their
         actions.
      • Individuals are responsible for their own well being if this is linked to their use of the
         messaging app.
      • Users who are admins of messaging groups have a responsibility to remove users (and
         messages) who are posting irresponsibly.
      • Users can remove themselves from groups which are spreading false information.
      • Users should report the fake news to others on the group (or to the social media company
         or other authorities)

      Individuals are unable to take responsibility for their use of social media because:
      • If the news provider is a monopoly, what else can individuals who want access to news on
         the internet do?
      • As the users may not be able to afford a different internet provider (the app is free), they
         are effectively trapped / locked in to this service.
      • Many of the features of social media platforms, such as no limits on the number of other
         users a message can be forwarded to built in, and cannot be managed by individuals
      • They may not be sufficiently informed to understand the impacts of their actions or
         inactions.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two components of an expert system.                                    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                   • Knowledge base
                   • Inference engine
                   • User interface

                   Award [1] for identifying each component of an expert system up to [2].

           (ii)    Outline one advantage of using a Gantt chart rather than a PERT chart.          [2]

                   Answers may include:

                   • Use of a Gantt chart creates a clear visualization of the process
                   • Whereas a PERT chart can become very complicated.

                   • A Gantt chart allows more than one task being carried out concurrently to
                     be easily displayed.
                   • Whereas this is not so straight forward for the PERT chart.

                   • A Gantt chart is more flexible
                   • This offers more options than a Pert chart for changes


                   Award [1] for identifying an advantage of a Gantt chart over a Pert chart and
                   [1] for a development of that advantage up to [2].

(b)   (i)   Figure 6 shows part of a decision tree where a person has been in an
            accident and may need a lawyer.

            Study the rules below, then copy and complete the decision tree.

            • A person has been in an accident.
            • If the person has been in an accident and has been accused of causing the
              accident, they will need a lawyer.
            • If the person does not meet both these requirements, they will receive the
              following message: “You do not require a lawyer”.

            Example response:




            Award [1] for the correct structure of the decision tree

(ii)   Distinguish between white-box testing and black-box testing.                 [3]

       Answers may include:

       Black box
       • tester doesn’t know anything about the internal working of the system
       • tester needs to know what the software will do
       • focuses on the behavior of the software from the end-user perspective
       • high level testing
       • Mostly done by software testers
       • Functionality testing.

       White box
       • checks the internal functioning of the system
       • based on code
       • low level testing
       • tester needs to know how the software works
       • Very thorough
       • Easy to automate
       • Logic testing
       • Time consuming.

(c)   SLF Law have decided to purchase the Quick Research expert system.

      To what extent will the use of an expert system like Quick Research be beneficial
      to SLF Law?                                                                              [8]

      Answers may include:

      SLF
      Will be beneficial
      • Saves time for potential clients as they will be able to make initial investigations
        into whether they need to see a lawyer independently.
      • Will allow lawyers can spend time on more important tasks rather than
        mundane tasks / Lawyers can specialize in areas of interest
      • Once it’s developed a knowledge base can be adapted and used in many other
        situations.
      • Could reduce staffing costs as the expert system may take up the position of a
        staff member.
      • The machine learning element of the expert system may allow for local factors
        to be considered / learn local dialects or speech patterns.

      Will not be beneficial
      • It may be expensive to develop the expert system, so it may not be cost
        effective.
      • The knowledge base may become outdated as laws may change / may be too
        expensive to continually update it.
      • The expert system may not cover the range of possibilities that exist and cases
        may need to be discussed with SLF to determine whether a lawyer is needed.
      • Will SLF dismiss/not need lower level employees, so there may be no way for a
        lawyer to gather experience of handling more straight forward cases.
      • If the expert system gives poor advice it may lead to a reputational risk for SLF.

(b)   (i)    Concerns have been raised about information technology (IT) projects that are
             completed in a very short time.

             Explain one reason why completing IT projects in a short time may lead to
             problems.                                                                       [3]

             Answers may include
             • Working too quickly promotes mistakes / Not enough time to test the
               software
             • This means that software will require many updates
             • Which may prove costly in the long run

             • Insufficient time to consult with the end users/Incomplete stakeholder
               analysis
             • This means that both end users and other stakeholders may well be very
               dissatisfied with the end result
             • So there may be lower sales / Or a need to revise the software

             • Lack of strong code review (checking that it is understandable, follows
               guidelines, can be tested/debugged
             • Will result in code that may not be testable
             • So errors will arise that need to be fixed.

             Note: Candidates may develop ideas from more than one cluster. Marks can
             only be awarded when the original point is developed.

             may lead to problems and [1] for each subsequent development up to [3].

      (ii)   Explain why the software developers have chosen the agile (scrum)
             development methodology for this project.                                       [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Follows an incremental approach. Developers start off with a simplistic
               project design, and then begin to work on small modules
             • allows for changes to be made after the initial planning
             • it is easier to add features that will keep the project up to date with the
               latest developments in the area
             • At the end of each sprint project priorities are evaluated. this allows
               clients to add their feedback.
             • The testing at the end of each sprint ensures that the bugs are caught
               and taken care of in the development cycle.

(c)   Two additional processes have been proposed during the development of the artificial
      intelligence (AI) software. They are:
      1. Involving end users at all stages of the project.
      2. Checking that the data being input into the system is not biased.

      Discuss whether these two processes should be included in the development of
      the AI software.                                                                       [8]

      Answers may include:

      Advantages of involving end users at all stages of the project
      • This will ensure that the final version of the software will be optimised for end
        users
      • Involvement of end users will assist the developers in developing the questions
        and/or algorithms used in the software
      • Involvement will lead to greater transparency in the process and this may give
        potential users confidence that the software is ethical / does not have hidden
        aims.

      Disadvantages of involving end users at all stages of the project
      • Will slow the process as it may require end-user sign off at each stage of the
         development process.
      • There is no guarantee that the end users will be able to make sufficiently
         informed decisions about the usability of the software in its prototype stages.
      • There is no guarantee the developers will be able to ask the right questions to
         elicit appropriate information from the end-users
      • Could the end-users involved in the trial be considered accountable in any way
         if the IT does not functions as intended / Would end-users want to be involved if
         they believed they could be accountable?

      Advantages of checking data input
      • Data can be checked that it is representative, for example the sample data that
        is used to train the algorithms is representative of the wider population.
      • This may lead to potential biases within the algorithms being spotted and
        reduced / removed prior to the software being launched.

      Disadvantages of checking data input
      • This may be a time-consuming process and considerably delay the
         development process
      • Will the ‘correct’ data be available, or will there be enough of it?

             • Enables all the information necessary for the project to be gathered
             • Which should lead to the needs of the various stakeholders being
               discussed/met etc / which may lead to the product working for a wider
               range of end-users
             • Better understanding of current systems.

             better project outcomes and [1] for each subsequent development up to [3].

      (ii)   Explain why user acceptance testing is a critical part of the development of
             the robots.                                                                        [3]

             Answers may include:
             • Allows the developers to see how the product will function when used by
               end users
             • Which may be different from what is carried out in alpha testing
             • Which gives a greater likelihood that the product will function as intended
               when used in real situations / can the users work with the robot
             • May prevent extra costs in repairing the software when it fails in the field.

(c)   There have been concerns raised about the use of autonomous robots in war.

      Discuss whether it is acceptable to use autonomous robots in war.                 [8]

      Answers may include:

      Acceptable:
      • Robots can make decisions very quickly in dangerous situations.
      • Robots save lives because they replace soldiers
      • Decisions made by robots are not affected by emotions or stress
      • Robots can operate where communication is poor
      • Increasing accuracy in targeting saves lives
      • Could act as a deterrent
      • Many nations are working on this, being without could be dangerous

      Not acceptable:
      • Who should be held responsible/accountable for a mistake? To what extent?
      • Machines can’t replace human logic’
      • Machines can’t make decisions based on the rules of war because they are too
        complex.
      • Machines cannot adjust to slight differences in the situation
      • What happens if you lose contact with the machine?
      • Is there a difference between targeting people vs. ships or planes
      • Danger on unintended consequences
      • Machines are vulnerable to hacking
