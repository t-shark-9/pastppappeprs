Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Genghis Khan (1200–1227) — Campaigns: Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia (1219–1221).

Source A                   Steven R Ward, a professor at the US Naval Academy, writing in the academic
                           book Immortal: A military History of Iran and its Armed Forces (2009).

The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were catastrophic for Persia as a series of Mongol invasions
devastated the region. The Khwarezmian ruler Muhammad Shah II (ruled 1206–21) caused his own
destruction by mistreating Mongol merchants and diplomats, and intentionally insulting Genghis Khan.
In response to these insults, Genghis declared war and sent four armies with a total strength of two
hundred thousand warriors against Muhammad in 1219. The opponents both had cavalry forces
armed with bows and used similar tactics, but the discipline and coordination of the Mongols were
superior. In addition, Genghis had thousands of Chinese siege engineers, who enabled his armies to
build and use battering rams, catapults, and other war machines. The Mongols proved unstoppable,
spreading devastation wherever they went. In 1220, the Mongols plundered Bukhara and then sacked
Samarkand and brutally massacred its citizens. During the war, the Mongols destroyed the centuries-
old underground irrigation system that had helped Persian agriculture prosper. The result was that the
Mongols left behind expanding deserts and numerous isolated oasis cities. Overall, the Mongol violence
killed up to three quarters of the population of the region, possibly ten to fifteen million people.

                           academic book The Chosen Few (2014).

In 1219, after conquering most of Central Asia, Genghis Khan invaded northern Persia and Armenia.
On his way to the Middle East, he sacked many cities including Samarkand, which was one of the
largest and most commercial cities along the Silk Route from Europe to China. Genghis Khan used his
large army both to invade new territories and to control his newly established empire. The basic military
strategy of the Mongol rulers was to generate fear and terror; to loot and collect all valuables and food
for their army and for Mongol civilian consumption; and to impose heavy taxes in many forms. As a
consequence, urban centres collapsed and agricultural production fell sharply. The population of the
invaded territories declined dramatically as a result of massacres, epidemics, and famines.

                       History of the Muhammadan Dynasties of Asia (completed c1260).

When Genghis Khan began his conquests and all fell into his hands, the news of these successes
reached Muhammad Shah II, and he became filled with ambition. Genghis Khan sent trustworthy and
confidential persons of his own, bearing numerous rare items as presents to Muhammad. Genghis Khan
requested that envoys on both sides, and merchants, should constantly come and go, and bring and take
away with them arms, cloths, and other valuables. Genghis Khan asked that between the two monarchs
a permanent treaty should be maintained. He sent merchants to Muhammad, with about five hundred
camel-loads of gold, silver, and silks, together with other precious items. They entered the territory of
Islam by way of Utrar. At that place, there was a governor named Kadr Khan, and he sent an account to
Muhammad Shah describing the importance and value of the merchandise. The governor plotted and
asked permission from Muhammad to stop the party of merchants. Having obtained permission to do so,
he seized the envoys and all the merchants, and killed them, and took possession of all their property,
and sent it to Muhammad. Of that party, there was one person, a camel-driver, who succeeded in
making his escape. He returned and made Genghis aware of the betrayal of Kadr Khan of Utrar and the
slaughter of the party. Genghis Khan prepared to take revenge.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
The conquest of Mexico and Peru (1519–1551) — Key events and actors: Key actors: Diego de Almagro,
Malinche, Atahualpa, Moctezuma II; Bartolomé de las Casas; Juan Gines Sepúlveda.

Source E               Nancy Fitch, a professor of history, writing in the online article on “The Conquest
                       of Mexico – An Overview” on the website of the American Historical Association.

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, many omens [signs] predicted an impending [coming] disaster. Thus,
when the Aztec leader Emperor Moctezuma II learned of the arrival of strangers, the omens predicting
destruction dominated his imagination. Adding to Moctezuma’s difficulties was the ruthlessness of his
rule. Moctezuma engaged in constant warfare in order to obtain victims for human sacrifices as well
as manpower/labour for agricultural labour and urban construction. At the same time, while he and
his ancestors had constructed a large empire in Central America, they had never achieved the kind of
support necessary to rule such a diverse population. Instead, they relied on terror, which also led to
numerous revolts. When the Spaniards arrived on the coast of Mexico, many indigenous people viewed
them as liberators and joined them against the Aztecs.


Source F               Diego Muñoz Camargo, a 16th century Mexican chronicler, depicts the encounter
                       between the Spanish and indigenous peoples at Texcoco in The History of
                       Tlaxcala (c1585). The Spanish figure near the temple is Hernán Cortés. Next to
                       Cortés is Prince Ixtlilxochitl, leader of Texcoco.

Source H               Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, writing in his second letter to Emperor
                       Charles V (October 1520).

I spoke to those messengers of Moctezuma II who remained with me, about the treachery that had been
plotted against me in the city of Cholula. The leaders of the city confirmed that the ambush had been
carried out on the advice of Moctezuma. Moctezuma said he was my friend, while on the other hand he
devised plans for injuring me. Later, his own messengers told me that Moctezuma was much saddened
over the violence that had happened in Cholula. They said that I must believe that it had not been on his
advice and order, for they assured me it was not so. Although the people who were stationed in Cholula
were Moctezuma’s, they had moved without his orders, persuaded by the natives of Cholula, who
bordered on two of his provinces. The messengers said that there existed a certain alliance between
indigenous communities, for helping each other, thus they had come to Cholula, and not on Moctezuma’s
orders. In the future [the messengers said], I should learn from his actions, that what he had told me was
true, though he still begged me not to enter his territory. Moctezuma said it was an unproductive land,
and that we would suffer hardships, and that from wherever I might be I could ask him for whatever I
wanted, and he would send it very promptly.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
German and Italian expansion (1933–1940) — Causes of expansion: Appeasement.

Source I               Winston Churchill, a British politician, in a speech to Parliament (5 October 1938).

I will begin by saying what everybody would like to ignore or forget, but which must nevertheless be
stated, namely that [at Munich] we have sustained a total and absolute defeat, and that France has
suffered even more than we have. When I think of the hope for peace which still existed in Europe at the
beginning of 1933, when Hitler first obtained power, and of all the opportunities of slowing the growth of
Nazi power which have been thrown away, I cannot believe that a similar situation exists in history. So far
as this country is concerned, the responsibility must rest with those who have had control of our political
affairs. They neither prevented Germany from rearming, nor did they [the British government] rearm
themselves in time. They discredited the League of Nations and neglected to make alliances, leaving us
without adequate national defence or effective international security.

                       section on political history on the website of the University of Virginia (2021).

President Eisenhower never wished to become a champion of civil rights. The issue made him
uncomfortable, and he often expressed his opinion that black activists wanted too much change, too
quickly. But the president also refused to allow school boards and state politicians to defy the rulings
of the Supreme Court. When the school board in Little Rock, aided by segregationist Governor Faubus
and the Arkansas National Guard, sought to prevent black students from attending school in September
1957, Eisenhower moved decisively. He ordered troops of the 101st Airborne [an elite military unit] to
take command of the school and allow black students to enter the school building unharmed by angry
mobs. In an address to the nation on September 24, he expressed “sadness” for the decision to send
troops to the city but said “the President’s authority is inescapable.” Unless he carried out the orders
of federal courts, “anarchy would result.” Eisenhower avoided the moral questions at hand. He did not
champion the need for equality and fairness in America. Many felt that Eisenhower should have done
more to express his support for the moral cause of justice and equality for all. But Eisenhower had a
narrow view of the matter. His duty as President was to uphold federal court orders. He found a middle
way through a terribly difficult problem that would torment later Presidents for many decades.

                        (24 March 1999).

My fellow Americans, today our armed forces joined our NATO allies in airstrikes against Serbian forces
responsible for the brutality in Kosovo. We have acted with determination for several reasons. We act to
protect thousands of innocent people in Kosovo from a mounting military offensive. We act to prevent a
wider war, to defuse a dangerous situation at the heart of Europe, that has exploded twice before in this
century with catastrophic results. We act to stand united with our allies. By acting now, we are upholding
our values. Now I want to be clear with you, there are risks in this military action—risk to our pilots and
the people on the ground. Serbia’s air defences are strong. It could decide to intensify its assault on
Kosovo, or to seek to harm us or our allies elsewhere. If it does, we will deliver a forceful response.

Source S               Javier Solana, NATO Secretary-General, writing in the article “NATO’s Success in
                       Kosovo” for the journal Foreign Affairs (November 1999).

NATO’s Kosovo operation was a major challenge in the history of the NATO alliance. For the first time,
a defensive alliance launched a military campaign to avoid a humanitarian crisis outside its borders.
For the first time, an alliance of sovereign nations fought not to conquer or preserve territory but to
protect the values on which the alliance was founded. And despite many challenges, NATO prevailed.
Over the course of 1998, fighting between the Kosovar Albanian and Serb forces grew and 300,000
Kosovar civilians fled their homes. UN Resolution 1199 of September 23, 1998, spoke of an “impending
humanitarian catastrophe” and characterized the developments as “a threat to peace and security in
the region.” NATO brought the Serbs and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) together at Rambouillet,
France, in February 1999. After difficult negotiations, the Kosovar Albanians signed the agreement
on March 18. [Slobodan] Milošević, however, rejected it. NATO’s use of force did not come about
unexpectedly. It happened after all diplomatic means had been exhausted. The air campaign achieved
every one of its goals. Milošević accepted NATO’s demands on June 3. After 77 days, with no casualties
of its own, NATO had prevailed. A humanitarian disaster had been avoided. About one million refugees
could now return in safety. Ethnic cleansing had been reversed. No Serbian forces remain in Kosovo.
NATO’s current peacekeeping force is stronger than anything considered previously.
