                                                 Section A

1.   (a)   State two features of a mass production process.                                          [2]

           Features of a mass production process include:
              • continuous flow production;
              • division of labour;
              • high start-up costs;
              • highly automated;
              • uniformity of products/standardized products;
              • high volume of products;
              • typically much of the labour force can be unskilled and need minimal training.

           Do not accept economies of scale, which is not always true of mass production, and is a
           benefit, not a feature.

           Accept any other relevant feature of mass production.

           N.B. no description is required.

           Award [1] for each relevant feature stated. Award a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Using relevant information from Table 1:

           (i)     calculate LC’s net profit after interest and tax for the year ended 31 December
                   2022 (no working required);                                                [1]


           net profit after interest and tax = $11 000 [sales revenue] - $6 000 [cost of goods sold]
           – $3 000 [expenses] – $150 [interest] – $370 [tax] = $1 480.
           The correct answer is $1 480. Candidates are not required to produce a profit and loss
           account, though they may without penalty (assuming that they arrive at the correct answer).

                 sales revenues                             $11 000
                 <Cost of goods sold >                      – $6 000
                 Gross profit                                 $5 000
                 <Expenses>                                 – $3 000
                 Net Profit before interest and tax           $2 000
                 <Interest>                                 – $ 150
                 Net Profit before tax                        $1 850
                 <Tax>                                      – $ 370
                 Net profit after interest and tax            $1 480

           Accept $1 480 or $1 480 000. Also, accept without a dollar sign.

           Award [1] if a candidate provides the correct answer.

         (ii)   construct a fully labelled balance sheet for LC as of 31 December 2022.           [5]


         Balance sheet for LC as of 31 December 2022 (figures in $ 000s)
                                   $000s         $000s

Total current liabilities               1 500

Net current assets (working capital)                     500
Total assets less current liabilities                  3 500

Long-term liabilities (debt)            1 500

Net assets                                             2 000

Financed by:

share capital                           1 000
accumulated retained profit             1 000

Equity                                                 2 000


      N.B. if the candidate does not follow the IB prescribed format award a maximum of [3].
      N.B. candidates should not be penalized for: omitting the row “Long-term liabilities (debt)”, or for
      writing “retained profit” omitting the word “accumulated”.
      Award [1] if the candidate demonstrated some understanding of what a balance sheet is.
      Award [2] if the candidate constructs a largely recognizable balance sheet, but it does not balance,
      or it has two major problems of classification. If the balance sheet such as one described here but
      lacks a heading, award [2].
      Award [3] for a largely accurate balance sheet that balances. (There could be one
      misclassification.) If it lacks a proper heading, deduct [1]. Thus, [3] – [1] = [2].
      Award [4] if the candidate constructs an accurate balance sheet (that balances) according to the IB
      prescribed format. If it lacks a proper heading, still award [4].
      Award [5] if the candidate constructs an accurate balance sheet (that balances) according to the IB
      prescribed format and the balance sheet is dated.

      N.B. A minor misclassification that is numerically correct demonstrated that the candidate has
      sufficient understanding. In the spirit of positive marking, give the candidate credit. If, above, the
      candidate wrote “Total assets”" instead of “Total assets less current liabilities, accept, provided that
      to the right they have the mathematically correct figure, in this case $3500.
                                             –8–                 M23/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


(c)   Explain the impact on LC’s profit and loss account of selling its current building and
      leasing a new one.                                                                [2]

      Leasing means that paying the costs of the building will be an expense, deducted before
      tax. Previously, the company was paying for its building costs by owning the building and
      paying a long-term loan, which is paid, apart from the interest, with after-tax finance.
      Therefore, LC will see its expenses rise and its profit before interest and tax decline.
      Additionally, when the company sells the current building and pays off its long-term debt,
      interest expense will decrease. LC’s tax expense will also decline, as the lease
      payments will be higher than interest expense, and the net profit after interest before
      tax will be lower.

      Award [2] for a clear explanation of any of the three outcomes explained above with
      application to LC.
      Award [1] for some understanding.

      N.B. If a candidates says only “expenses will increase” (or something to that effect, without
      further explanation), award [1].

2.   (a)   State two benefits to a business of having a mission statement.                       [2]

           A mission statement is an action-oriented statement and declares the purpose of an
           organization to its audience. It often includes a general description of the organization, its
           function, and its objectives. As a company grows, its objectives and goals may be reached,
           and in turn they will change. Therefore, mission statements should be revised as needed to
           reflect the business's new culture as previous goals are met. Some benefits are that it helps
           to:

           •     communicate the direction or purpose of the organization (can state aims and goals);
           •     make day-to-day operating decisions;
           •     keep the organization focused;
           •     motivate the employees and attract new talent;
           •     differentiate from the competition;
           •     give stakeholders an idea of the business’ values;
           •     assist in establishment or maintenance of brand image;
           •     promotional tool that might attract customers when the business’s values (as embedded in
                 the mission statement) align with potential new customers.

           Accept any other relevant benefit. Candidates do not have to use identical wording to the
           above.
           Award [1] for each benefit stated up to a maximum of [2].
           N.B. no description is required.

     (b)   Using relevant information from Table 2, calculate:

           (i)     the break-even quantity of rugs in 2022 (show all your working);                    [2]

                   Break-even = Fixed cost / Contribution
                      = $ 2 000 / $105 – $65
                      = $ 2 000 / 40
                      = 50 rugs

                   Accept if the candidate does not say rugs or units.

                   Alternative answer:

                   Break-even point ($):
                   Price per unit x units = Fixed cost + (variable cost per unit x units)

                   Q = Quantity/units/rugs

                   $105 x Q = $2 000 + ($65 x Q)
                   $105 x Q – ($65 x Q) = $2 000
                   $40 x Q = $2 000
                   Q = $2 000 / $40 = 50 rugs

                   Accept if the candidate does not say rugs or units.

                   Award [1] for the correct working and [1] for the correct answer.
                   Award [2] for a correct answer with working.
                   Award [1] for correct answer without working.
                   Award [1] for correct method with an error in the calculation.

(ii)    the profit or loss for AH if 500 rugs were sold in 2022 (show all your working).    [2]

        Profit = Total revenue – Total cost
                = $105 x 500 – ($2 000 + ($65 x 500))
                = $52 500 – ($ 2 000 + $32 500)
                = $52 500 – $34 500
        Profit = $18 000

        An alternative method could be:
        450 x $40 = $18 000

        Award [1] for correct method with an error in the calculation.

(iii)   the margin of safety in 2023 if AH sells 750 rugs (show all your working).          [2]

        Margin of safety = Current output (units) – Break-even output

        MoS = 750 – ($2000 / ($120 – $70))

        MoS = 750 – 40

        MoS = 710 rugs

        Apply Own Figure Rule

        Provided that the candidate uses a mathematically correct method, they may express the
        margin of safety in dollars or as a percentage.

        Typically, the way to calculate the MoS in dollars would be:
        (750 x $120) – (40 x $120) = $90 000 – $4800 = $85 200.

        MoS = $85 200.

        To calculate MoS as a percentage, use the following formula:

        (Total revenue – break-even revenue)/(total revenue) x 100 =
        ($90 000 – $4 800)/$90 000 x 100 = 94.66666667%

        Allow rounding, provided they have rounded correctly. Accept 94.67%, 94.7%, or 95%.

(c)   Explain whether AH’s change in pricing strategy for 2023 will have an impact on its
      unit contribution.                                                            [2]

      AH decided to pass on all cost increases to its customers, therefore, the $5 increase in
      variable cost means that the new selling price of $120 will represent a $10 unit contribution
      increase.
      Or,
      Since unit contribution is the difference between the selling price and its variable cost,
      according to the figures from the table in 2023, $120 – $70 = $50, which is a $10 increase in
      contribution from 2022.

      Candidates do not have to word their responses in exactly the same way.

      explanation), award [1].

           Features of ecommerce include:
           • e-commerce faces few geographic constraints;
           • it can be available/accessible at any time;
           • large potential customer base (global reach);
           • largely standardized (across companies) platforms. Thus, to most customers easy to
             use;
           • multiple payment options;
           • personalization is increasingly common and practiced;
           • websites can be interactive;
           • websites can contain lots of information and allow the combined use of audio, video and
             text messages to deliver a marketing message;
           • a quick and easy way for consumers to shop;
           • convenient and relatively inexpensive for businesses to set up;
           • cheaper than brick-and-mortar stores/no need to have stores.

           Accept any other relevant features.

           Do not accept that e-commerce is selling online or through the internet.

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for EL of having a unique selling
      point/proposition (USP).                                                            [4]

      Advantages of a unique selling point/proposition include:
      • customer loyalty;
      • differentiation from competition;
      • focused marketing;
      • revenue increases;
      • it can create barriers to entry to deter potential competitors.

      In the case of EL, the advantage that it had because of its USP was that it could differentiate
      itself from the other packaging companies with its focus on fulfilling quickly customized
      orders. Also because of its USP, EL attracted additional customers and, presumably, its
      revenue increased.

      Disadvantages of a unique selling point/proposition include:
      • it can shape customer expectations, which the company must then meet or disappoint;
      • it can become meaningless because of obsolescence of technology;
      • it can be too focused, which can result in lost opportunities;
      • the messaging about the USP may not be speaking properly to the intended target
         market.

      In the case of EL, a disadvantage of its USP was that the company had effectively shaped
      customer expectations. However, as the company grew and encountered diseconomies
      of scale, it began to fail to fulfil orders in a timely fashion. This situation was
      problematical for EL because its customers chose EL as their supplier precisely because the
      company’s USP was fulfilling orders in a timely fashion.

      Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      Award [1] for one appropriate advantage / disadvantage and [1] for a development with

(c)   Explain two diseconomies of scale that EL may have experienced.                      [4]

      EL’s decision to have four small factories rather than one large factory allows the
      company to be responsive to customers and, when possible, manufacture the product in a
      factory geographically close to the customer. This operating model, however, can cause
      several diseconomies of scale:

      • managerial diseconomies of scale, as each factory must have its own plant manager;
      • organizational diseconomies of scale, as coordination of the four factories consumes
        time and money;
      • communication diseconomies of scale. As EL now has multiple factories in two countries
        where different languages are spoken, communication becomes more challenging and
        could be more costly by slowing operations down.
      • technical diseconomies of scale, at times, according to the stimulus, individual factories
        are working at full capacity, which can lower productivity because of overcrowding;
      • purchasing diseconomies of scale: too much stock in each factory. Stock can also
        become spoilt, obsolete or unfashionable.

      Candidates may state financial or capital diseconomies of scale, with some
      explanation. However, given the stimulus, there is no opportunity for application. Thus, the
      maximum a candidate could get for either financial or capital diseconomy of scale is [1].

      Accept any other relevant diseconomy of scale.

      Mark as [2] + [2].

      or application.

(d)    Discuss whether EL should enter into the contract with WM if they have the winning bid.
       [10]

       EL has many compelling reasons to enter the five-year contract with WszystkoMart (WM):
       • WM is a major retailer and in terms of growth for EL this opportunity is special. EL
         would benefit from WM´s experience and from synergies;
       • EL could quickly become one of the largest eco-friendly packaging companies;
       • the prestige of getting a contract with WM would also presumably enhance EL’s
         reputation;
       • the five-year contract would virtually guarantee profits in the first five years;
       • it will be able to reduce diseconomies of scale.

       EL also has many compelling reasons not to enter the five-year contract with WM:
       • Getting in large-scale manufacturing competing on price (“focusing on keeping costs
         low”) would be inconsistent with the USP EL had built;
       • The contract would require building a huge factory (huge investment) and neither method
         of financing the new factory is altogether satisfactory;
         o With the debt option, EL would have to take out a 30-year loan but gets only a
             five-year contract.
         o with the equity option, Marek and his father would no longer have a controlling
             interest (will lose control and power) in the company.

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of paying commission to sales
      staff working in its shops.                                                  [4]

      Commission makes reference to the payment to employees after finishing a particular
      task such as selling a number of products or services (employees are paid by results).
      However, in addition to their sales commissions employees are usually paid a (sometimes
      low) basic salary. Paying commission has advantages and disadvantages to LA:

      It is important that responses focus on the affects to LA. Do not reward responses that focus
      on the advantages/disadvantages to staff.

      Advantages:

      • motivates employees to work harder. LA pays commission to sales staff working in
        physical shops. Employees, driven by income, can make an extra effort to sell more. This
        is particularly important to boost LA’s sales in physical shops that have fallen after LA´s
        online shop was launched;
      • commissions are tied to sales so, if there are no sales there are no commission
        costs. As LA only pays commissions to workers in physical shops where sales have
        fallen, cost reductions can be substantial.

      Disadvantages:

      • customers can be driven away by pressure from sales people. Customer service
        quality could be undermined. LA could lose customers that value a good personalized
        sales service;
      • employees may be tempted to sell products that are not in the best interests of the
        customer or business; this could in turn affect the developed brand awareness and
        customer value for LA’s personalized service.
      • as sales in physical shops are falling, sales staff would receive less commission
        leading to demotivation and perhaps increased labour turnover at LA that so far has
        been low.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Do not accept as a disadvantage - less profits for LA, since if commission payment was
      NOT used then presumably fixed salaries would have to be increased.

      Similarly, do not accept something to the effect of “increased costs,” since with a correctly
      structured commission system, the increase in revenue generated from the commission
      system is greater than the cost of the commissions.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of Marie’s democratic leadership
      style.                                                                        [4]

      Democratic leadership style is such that promotes an active participation of employees in
      decision making and informs them about issues that affect them.

      Advantages:
      • employees feel more committed to the potential changes and decisions if they are involved
        in the business decision-making process. LA will have to decide whether to sell online only or
        not. If LA employees are involved in this decision there are higher chances that they will
        embrace the resulting solution whichever it is and lower chances of conflict;
      • motivation levels are enhanced leading to commitment. This is evident in LA as there is low
        labour turnover;
      • better final decisions could be made as the staff has much to say and could give very
        valuable experience. For example, Marie consulted the e-commerce department who have
        suggested investing in software that could help online customers to find their correct clothing
        size (reducing cost of returns) and thus help decide whether to go online only or not
      • lack of conflict between LA’s managers and employee representatives is possibly due to
        Marie’s democratic leadership style and her regular meetings with staff.

      Disadvantages:
      A democratic leadership style can be time consuming. Attending meetings and consulting
      employees, can slow down the decision-making processes at LA.

      Some decisions such as closing down shops could be very difficult for a democratic
      leader like Marie to make. It is unlikely that Marie will decide in a democratic way whether to close
      the LA physical shops or not, because there is a conflict of interests unlikely to be resolved.
      Marie would not be able to decide this in a meeting with her managers. There is a potential
      conflict between Marie and LA employees that would be difficult to resolve. If LA closes all her
      shops many employees will be made redundant. This could erode LA’s organizational culture
      used to democratic leadership style. Seems not to be good for LA? (never had conflict before).

      Marie’s democratic style may see her wish to avoid conflict at all cost (there has never been any
      conflict) resulting in her making decisions which may not be in the best interest of LA.

      A democratic style is unlikely to hear arguments with equal weight, especially when a PLC like LA
      is likely to give greater stakeholder weight to that of shareholders.

(d)   Discuss whether LA should close all its physical shops and sell only online. [10]

      Candidates can structure their answers in two different ways. They can view “close
      retail + sell online” as one issue and provide two arguments for and two against.
      Alternatively, candidates can talk about advantage and disadvantage of “closing”,
      then advantage and disadvantage of “all online”. Either approach is acceptable.

      Possible advantages of LA closing all its physical shops and sell only online:
      • if LA closes all physical shops, important cost reductions could be made. For instance,
        LA will make savings in sale commission paid to sales staff in physical shops and in the
        cost of wages that are above the industry average;
      • LA will also gain in other costs reductions such as leasing costs from physical shops. It
        will also gain in flexibility, as online selling has lower fixed costs;
      • another advantage of having an online business is that you break the physical barriers
        and do not depend on the number of people passing by your street or the number of
        brochures you have delivered to mailboxes;
      • low costs involved in marketing products abroad;
      • from the internet (online) you can sell to a global market (global reach);
      • LA could sell its physical shops to raise finance as well.

       However,
       • Selling online only can be a dangerous move as it lowers visibility. Physical shops allow
         clients to see the products, which facilitates purchasing decisions. Further, a physical
         store offers a sense of security to the clients. Hence, clients will trust you more when
         they are aware you operate from a physical place they can access. If you have an online
         presence, a physical store will complement your marketing efforts;
      • Customers at LA are used to personalized assistance. Buying online is a totally
         different experience; this is evidenced by the increasing number of returns experienced by
         LA;

      • physical shops assist customers that like personalized customer service. Online
        selling does not quite match the target market of customers that value personalized
        customer service even if online sales are increasing;
      • return costs from online sales are increasing. LA will have to invest in new software to
        cope with sizing problems.
      • the buying experience of clothes is different online than in physical shops.
      • Employee redundancies can damage LA’s working environment (and LA corporate
        image) and clash with the CEO´s democratic leadership style and LA’s organizational
        culture. Potential conflicts with employees and employee representatives;
      • LA may be left paying leases on shops it closes;
      • Online selling is not without investment costs – technology equipment, warehousing,
        hiring staff with online experience, online marketing, scheduling and delivery systems etc.

      All in all, it seems that closing all shops is too drastic. LA already has incurred setting up
      costs of an important number of shops, they could take the advantages of online selling but
      still keep some physical shops, or phasing out those underperforming stores on a more
      gradual basis.

5.   (a)   State two features of loan capital.                                                  [2]

           Features of loan capital include:
           • it is medium or long-term borrowed money (rather than shares).
           • it must be repaid.
           • the borrower must pay interest.
           • the borrower might be required to put up security to obtain a loan.
           • it is an external source of finance.

           If a candidate just says “borrowed money” or something to that effect with no time modifier,
           do not accept.

           If a candidate exemplifies with overdraft or says short-term loan, do not accept unless they
           say “short-term” and/or medium- or long-term loan. In that case, accept on the basis of
           positive marking.
           If the candidate says something to the effect of “over time” when referring to the payback
           period or time modifier, do not accept. Such a descriptor is too vague. Over time could be six
           months or thirty years.

           Accept any other relevant or accurate feature.

           Award [1] for each feature stated up to a maximum [2].

           N.B. no description is required.


     (b)   With reference to JP, explain the differences between job/customized production and batch
           production.                                                                             [4]

           Job production occurs when a business manufactures each item one at a time and
           typically to unique specifications. Currently, all clothes produced by JP are unique, and
           each item must be made individually, which means that a tailor will begin each single item
           one at a time and complete it before moving on to the next item. The emphasis is on
           quality and originality, and the producer can charge premium prices. Production is
           market-oriented. The order is made for a specific customer.

           Batch production occurs when a business produces items with common
           characteristics in groups (or batches). The items move from one stage of production
           to the next as a group, with different processes occurring at every stage. Under JP’s
           possible switch to batch production, whole groups of items (shirts of a certain design and
           size) would be made in stages (cutting from the pattern>sewing>putting on buttons, etc.>until
           the shirts are completed).

           Mark as [2] + [2].

           Award [1] for only stating the basics of how each production process works.
           Award an additional [2] for sound and thorough application to the stimulus.
           Award a maximum of [4].

(c)   With reference to JP, explain Justin’s leadership style.                                  [2]

      Based upon the stimulus, Justin has a democratic leadership style. With a democratic
      leadership style, a leader consults with subordinates and gets their input before
      deciding or, as with JP, the leader actually empowers people to make decisions. Justin
      asked his management team to determine which of the two options to choose.

      Award [1] if the candidate accurately explains Justin’s leadership style with reference to the
      stimulus.

      Award an additional [1] if the candidate uses the term “democratic” in their explanation.

      Award a maximum of [2].


(d)   With reference to JP, explain the term brand loyalty.                                       [2]

      Brand loyalty refers to when particular customers will always, or almost always, choose
      one brand over another. It is when consumers become committed to a firm´s brand and
      are willing to make repeat purchases over time. In the case of JP, though not many
      people are aware of the JP brand, those who are and who have purchased from them tend to
      keep going back to JP for repeat purchases. In fact, 84% of JP’s customers have purchased
      from JP more than five times.

      Award [1] for indicating that brand loyalty means that consumers are loyal and choose one
      brand over another.

      Award an additional [1] for a clear development and application to the stimulus.

      Award a maximum of [2].
                                               – 23 –              M23/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


(e)   Discuss the two options that Justin has suggested.                                [10]

      Option 1, switching to batch production, would mean that one important feature of JP’s
      business model would weaken: clothing would no longer be unique to each customer
      (“consultants would recommend from a series of pre-made options”; “clothing will no longer be
      custom-made”). A second disadvantage would be that the company would have to increase its
      investment in stock. Right now, clothing is made one at a time, with stock delivered after the
      customer has approved the designs. With this option, JP would have large amounts of stock,
      both before production, during work-in-progress, and finished goods. This would require an
      increase in working capital. Will the price be the same?

      The advantages of switching to batch production are: that costs will be lowered, as batch
      production is generally cheaper than job production. Further, JP should be able to deliver
      items to the customer faster (since design options will come from ready-made items). A
      further advantage is that if JP’s sales grow, and all indications are that is what JP wants, the
      business can scale up operations more easily.

      However, it seems unclear how this change will improve JP’s brand awareness, one of its
      aims.

      Option 2, building retail stores, would probably increase JP’s brand awareness and,
      therefore, its customer base. Brick-and-mortar stores, if properly located, would increase
      visibility. Curious potential customers could walk into the stores, where they would probably see
      mannequins attired in JP clothing. Further, the process of being measured in a store by JP’s own
      trained salespeople and/or tailors will lead to more accuracy in measurements, which should
      strengthen brand loyalty further. Finally, the service would be even more personalized than
      before. Salespeople will be able to see customers in person and have a sharper sense of
      their fashion desires and requirements.

      The disadvantages of this approach are that JP will have to make an investment in the brick-
      and-mortar stores. Already the business has loan capital and not strong liquidity. Increasing
      debt and increasing debt service might well strain JP’s liquidity even further. While the business
      is profitable, its profitability declined for two years in a row, and increased expenses of the
      new stores and the interest expense may weaken profitability further.

      Accept other relevant judgments, if justified.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further guidance below.

                                            Section C

  Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on
  pages 4–5.

6. With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which globalization
   can influence marketing strategy.                                                [20]

7. With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of ethics and

  N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
  expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
  second concept (the one being acted on).

  Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
  be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

  Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
  For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
  attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single
  aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

  • The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
    by a candidate.
  • A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
    reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

  If only one concept is addressed:
  • Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
  • Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

  Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
  unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
  may be more significant than the other.

  Criterion B
  For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

  Criterion C
  1 + 1 arguments are expected per concept.
  • Justification is through logic or data.
  • For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
     all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
  • For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
   between the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Please do not use the adjective ‘inappropriate’ in the descriptor for [2]. If inappropriate
   award [1].

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A
and B and in the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to
questions 6, 7 and 8. When this happens please award marks as follows:

Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant
if the organization is fictitious.
Criterion B: award [0] – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”
Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is
fictitious.
Criterion D: mark as normal.
Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot
be relevant if the organization is fictitious.
