Answer one question from this section.

1.   Make-Up (MU)

     Lana Lane is an image coach and plans to open Make-Up (MU), a shop where she can
     sell her own brand of beauty products. Because Lana is a female entrepreneur, her local
     government will pay 50 % of the rent for the space in which MU will operate.

     Lana has forecasted the following figures for MU for the first six months of operation,
     beginning on 1 July 2023 (see Table 1). The opening balance will be $0.

     (b)    Using the information in Table 1, prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for MU for the
            first six months of operation.                                                            [6]

     (c)    Comment on the possible impact of the new competitor on MU’s cash flow.                   [2]

2.     Windmills OPQ (WO)

       Windmills OPQ (WO) develops and produces electrical
       and mechanical components for windmills. WO has
       developed a unique selling point/proposition (USP)
       because of its customization and modification services.

        In 2023, WO identified two six-year investment project
        options that could be beneficial.
       y Option 1: Research and development (R&D).
       y Option 2: Open a wind farm with five windmills.

       The capital costs and forecasted cash flows for both investment projects are shown in Table 2.

                          Table 2: Capital costs and expected cash flows for both
                                 investment projects (all figures in $000s)

     Investment      Capital                                                                  Total cash
                                Year 1    Year 2    Year 3    Year 4    Year 5    Year 6
       project        costs                                                                    inflows

      Option 1:       –9600        0         0       2500      4600      5000      5500         17 600
        R&D

      Option 2:       –9000      1500      2000      2500      3000      3000      4000         16 000
     Open a wind
        farm

       WO’s board of directors think that the forecasted cash flow for Option 2 is too low. They
       believe that the demand for electricity generated by windmills is likely to rise more than the
       current forecast assumes. Electricity prices are also increasing.

       (a)   Define the term unique selling point/proposition (USP).                                      [2]

       (b)   Using relevant information from Table 2, calculate:

             (i)     the average rate of return (ARR) for Option 1 (show all your working);[2]

             (ii)    the average rate of return (ARR) for Option 2 (show all your working);[2]

             (iii)   the payback period for Option 1 (show all your working).                             [2]

       (c)   Comment on whether WO should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                    [2]




                                                                                                   Turn over

                                             Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   EkoLogiczne Ltd. (EL)

     EkoLogiczne Ltd. (EL) is a packaging company owned 60 % by Marek Kowalski and 40 % by
     his father. EL is a private limited company. Marek founded the company when he realized
     that the rise in e-commerce would mean the demand for packaging would always increase.

     Originally, Marek imagined that EL’s unique selling point/proposition (USP) would be to
     offer recyclable packaging. However, the eco-friendly market was dominated by one large
     company, Big Boxes (BB), which enjoyed economies of scale. Marek reimagined his USP:
     EL would have small factories that enabled customized orders to be fulfilled quickly.

     Over time, EL opened four factories across Poland and the Czech Republic. Its customers,
     which included online retailers and small manufacturing companies, placed orders online; if
     the factory nearest the customer was too busy with other orders, the order would be shifted
     to another factory. Many customers chose EL rather than BB for this reason. With growth,
     however, EL began to experience diseconomies of scale and increasingly failed to fulfil
     orders on time.

     Marek is now considering bidding on a large five-year contract for all the packaging solutions
     for WszystkoMart (WM), a huge traditional retailer trying to expand its e-commerce presence.
     The contract would require building a huge factory and focusing almost exclusively on
     keeping costs low. In terms of scale, EL would be almost as big as BB, the large company
     dominating the eco-friendly packaging market.

     To finance the new factory, Marek would either have to sell many shares and reduce his and
     his father’s combined ownership to 40 % or take a 30-year loan from a bank.

     (a)   State two features of e-commerce.                                                          [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for EL of having a unique selling point/
           proposition (USP).                                                                         [4]

     (c)   Explain two diseconomies of scale that EL may have experienced.                            [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether EL should enter into the contract with WM if they have the winning bid. [10]

4.   Les Amis PLC (LA)

     Les Amis PLC (LA) is a public limited company that sells casual clothes for men. Its target
     market is high-income professionals who value a personalized sales service. LA has
     developed brand awareness and operates 42 shops around the country. It owns 10 of these
     shops and leases the remaining 32. LA employs 950 people, who receive a higher wage
     than the industry average. LA also pays commission to sales staff working in the shops. LA’s
     organizational culture values the wellbeing and needs of its employees. Labour turnover is
     very low.

     Recently, LA launched an online shop. Since then, online sales have increased considerably,
     while sales in LA’s physical shops have fallen. Shareholders want LA to close all its physical
     shops and sell online only. However, many of the employees will be made redundant if the
     physical shops are closed.

     LA’s current chief executive officer (CEO), Marie Brossard, has a democratic leadership
     style, and she regularly meets with employees and encourages feedback. LA’s managers
     and employee representatives have never had a conflict. Marie plans to discuss the
     shareholders’ desire to close LA’s physical shops with all the shop managers.

     Customer returns of clothing orders at LA have increased substantially. Most returns are from
     online customers unfamiliar with LA’s clothing sizes. Marie has consulted the e-commerce
     department on how to reduce the increasing cost of returns, and they have suggested
     investing in expensive software that will enable online customers to find their correct clothing size.

     (a)   Define the term target market.[2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of paying commission to sales
           staff working in its shops.                                                                   [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for LA of Marie’s democratic leadership
           style.[4]

     (d)   Discuss whether LA should close all its physical shops and sell only online.                [10]




                                                                                                 Turn over

5.   Justin Price Clothing Ltd. (JP)

     Justin Price Clothing Ltd. (JP) is a private limited company that manufactures clothing. Its
     unique selling point/proposition (USP) is its innovative process. Customers send images of
     themselves and some measurements to JP via the internet, which JP uses to determine the
     customer’s exact measurements. Then, a style consultant contacts the customer via video
     conference to discuss the customer’s fashion preferences. After this, the style consultant
     designs clothing for that customer. Using job/customized production, JP manufactures and
     ships the clothing to the customer. Most materials (stock) are ordered when a customer
     agrees to the designs. A total of 84 % of JP’s customers have purchased items from JP more
     than five times.

     Justin Price, JP’s owner, asked his management team to consider two options and decide
     which would best increase profitability:
     y Option 1: Change JP’s design and production model. Consultants, when working with
        customers online, would recommend from a series of pre-made options. The company would
        shift to batch production and have the stock (inventory) available. Style consultants would still
        be central to the process, but the clothing would no longer be custom made.
     y Option 2: Increase JP’s customer base. JP’s customers have high brand loyalty. However, the
        brand is not very well known. JP would open several strategically located retail stores in a few
        major cities to increase brand awareness. In the store, customers could get their measurements
        taken and receive in-person fashion advice from a fashion consultant, after which they could
        purchase unique clothing. JP would continue its online services.

     (a)   State two features of loan capital.                                                        [2]

     (b)   With reference to JP, explain the differences between job/customized production and
           batch production.                                                                          [4]

     (c)   With reference to JP, explain Justin’s leadership style.                                   [2]

     (d)   With reference to JP, explain the term brand loyalty.                                      [2]

     (e)   Discuss the two options that Justin has suggested.                                       [10]
