1.   (a)   Identify the research method used and outline two characteristics of the method.             [3]

           Award [1] for identification of correct research method: Semi-structured interviews
           (identifying the research method as ‘interview’ without specification is acceptable).

           Award [0] for structured interview, unstructured interview or focus group interview.

           Answers related to an outline of characteristics of the research method may include
           two of the following characteristics: Award [1] per relevant point. Maximum of [2].

           •   Interviews are self-report techniques.
           •   Interviews allow insight into the subjective experience of participant to be gained.
           •   Interview data is analysed in order to identify patterns and themes.
           •   Semi-structured interviews are conducted based on an interview guide with a list of
               questions and topics that need to be covered during the interview, usually in a
               specific order.
           •   Semi-structured interviews are flexible. The interviewer follows the interview guide
               but is able to ask the respondent to elaborate on answers.
           •   Semi-structured interviews use a combination of closed and open-ended questions,
               which allows for a detailed exploration of topics related to the study.
           •   Semi-structured interviews are informal and conversational in nature. This is
               important for establishing rapport between the interviewer and the respondent.
           •   Semi-structured interviews are most effective when carried out by an interviewer
               who is trained and experienced.
           •   Semi-structured interviews are useful when researching socially sensitive issues, or
               when focusing on each participant’s unique experience.
           •   Semi-structured interviews are more time consuming to analyse than structured
               interviews.
           •   Because each semi-structured interview includes questions specific to that
               participant, there is less comparability between answers.


     (b)   Describe the sampling method used in the study.                                              [3]

           Award [1] for naming the correct sampling method: Purposive sampling [1].

           Description of the sampling method used in the study may include two of the following
           characteristics: [1] per relevant point. Maximum of [2].

           • Purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling method, which means that
             participants are not chosen randomly from a target population.
           • A purposive sample is based on specific selection criteria / salient characteristics.
           • A purposive sample is relatively easy to select.
           • A purposive sample is flexible because it can be supplemented with more
             participants during the research process if needed.
           • Because the participants are chosen based on characteristics that the researcher
             judges to be salient, there is a higher likelihood of the sample being affected by bias.
           • When purposive sampling means that the results are very specific to a small number
             of people, transferability is affected
                                             –5–                 M23/3/PSYCH/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Suggest one alternative or one additional research method that could be used
      to investigate the aim of the original study, giving one reason for your choice.            [3]

      Award [1] for naming an alternative or additional research method and up to
      [2] for reason with rationale.

      The candidate may choose to write about an alternative or an additional method. Either
      approach to answering the question is acceptable. The rationale may differ depending
      on which is chosen.

      Suitable alternative or additional research methods and reasons (with rationale) could be, but
      are not limited to:

      Focus group interview:
      • This is a different way to explore the smokers' own perception of their difficulties
        giving up smoking. The facilitator would encourage the participants to share their
        views and experiences of their attempts to quit smoking. The focus group as an
        additional research method (triangulation) could compensate for the limitations of
        the semi-structured interview, and vice versa.
      • The focus-group approach could provide the researcher information she may not
        have thought of herself when preparing the questions for the interview.
      • The focus group is a quick way to collect data from all participants at the same time.
      • The focus group provides a natural setting for interactions between participants
        because they can use their own language, and it is less artificial than the one-to-one
        approach of the semi-structured interview.
      • A reason for choosing a focus group interview could be that this method gives a
        special dynamic to the interview because participants continue the conversation
        among themselves. This is likely to generate rich data, although there may be
        problems of conformity within a focus group.

      Survey:
      • This method could function as a follow up on certain findings from the semi-
        structured interview and the themes related to dissonance reduction strategies
        (triangulation). A survey with closed questions could collect quantitative data on
        participants’ smoking habits as well as their opinion on the difficulties of giving up
        smoking.
      • Data from a large-scale survey could add data to the investigation of the complex
        problem of why people smoke and the psychological factors that prevent them from
        quitting. This would allow for statistical comparisons (between groups or across
        time).
      • A survey can be used as an alternative method and then be supplemented with a
        qualitative method such as the semi-structured interview to investigate certain
        findings in more depth.
      • Surveys generally allow researchers to collect a large amount of data in a relatively
        short period and they are less expensive than qualitative methods.
      • With a survey it is easy to analyse the data statistically. If the sample is randomized
        then the findings can be generalized to a target population.

      If a candidate suggests more than one alternative or one additional research method, credit
      should be given only to the first one.

2.   Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study and explain if further ethical
     considerations could be applied.                                                                    [6]

     Award [1] per relevant point made, up to a maximum of [3].

     Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study.
     • Informed consent: When the participants signed up for the study they were informed
       (consent form) that the study was about smoking and problems in quitting. This was in
       order for them to decide whether or not they wanted to participate.
     • Right to withdraw: The participants were also informed about their right to withdraw at
       any time. This means that they can stop at any time or withdraw their data once the study
       is finished. The participants had access to the transcript and the researcher's conclusion
       before the final report was published and they could decide that they wanted to withdraw
       their data even at that point.
     • Deception: Participants were NOT deceived and there were no reasons to use deception.
       They were made aware that the study was about smoking and problems in quitting. The
       participants were given the opportunity to check the transcripts, researcher conclusions
       and final report to ensure that it accurately represented what they had said in the
       interview. These measures allowed there to be full transparency.
     • Any other relevant points (such as protection from harm was being applied when the
       participants were given a chance to check the conclusions).

     If a candidate names relevant ethical considerations without also accurately describing them,
     a maximum of [1] should be awarded.


     Award [1] per relevant point made, up to a maximum of [3].

     Explain if further ethical considerations could be applied.
     • Anonymity: It may be difficult to ensure because participants in this study belong to the
       researcher's social network and may even know each other. A way to cope with this could
       be to guarantee that participants would be given another name or a number in the final
       report order to ensure anonymity. Since there were only six participants in this study it
       could be easy to identify them as the researcher had written in the report that she had
       recruited the participants through her social network.
     • Confidentiality: The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. The researcher
       needs to ensure that this data is stored in a safe manner and cannot be connected to the
       participants. The researcher also needs to provide clarity for participants regarding how
       and when their data will be destroyed.
     • Debriefing: The participants should be debriefed after they have completed the study.
       The researchers should explain the purpose of the study and what results they expected
       to find. The purpose of debriefing is to treat participants in an ethical manner so that they
       are fully informed about the study, at least after the study is completed, and how the data
       is going to be used.
     • Protection from harm:
       o Participants should be informed that they could contact the researcher if they had any
           questions regarding the study. Once they have been debriefed, they may have
           questions or worries concerning their own difficulties in quitting.
       o Participants who show signs of distress after the interview should be offered
           psychological support by a different psychologist.
     • Any other relevant points (such as withdrawal of results).

     If a candidate names relevant ethical considerations without also accurately explaining them,
     a maximum of [1] should be awarded.

3.   Discuss how a researcher could ensure that the results of the study are credible.                     9

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of credibility in
     this study. Conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate knowledge
     of credibility in relation to the stimulus material.

     Credibility is a criterion used to judge the quality of qualitative research and how it
     corresponds to internal validity in quantitative research. The conclusions of the study must
     give a true picture of the phenomenon under investigation and accurately represent the
     perspective of the participants, that is, represent reality as the participants see it. Credibility
     is considered the most important aspect in establishing trustworthiness in qualitative
     research. Credibility can be linked to researcher bias and participant expectations (demand
     characteristics).

     The discussion of how the researcher in this study could ensure that the results of the study
     are credible could include but is not limited to:

     • Having reflexivity, for example:
       o Personal reflexivity – the researcher should use critical self-awareness as to how her
          personal beliefs and expectations could influence the research process and conclusions. The
          researcher was a former smoker and the participants belong to the researcher's social
          network. She needs to be aware that these factors could result in bias.
       o Epistemological reflexivity – the researcher needs to consider factors such as the strengths
          and limitations of semi-structured interviews and the possibility of sampling bias from using
          purposive sampling / participants belong to the researcher's social network.
     • Leaving a “decision trail” (or audit trail), documenting every decision made in the
       collection, analysis and interpretation of the data. For example, a reflective journal/diary.
     • Having credibility checks: This refers to checking the accuracy of data, for example, by
       asking participants to read the transcripts of the interview and confirm that they accurately
       represent their statements.
     • Using researcher triangulation: the researcher in this study asked another researcher to
       check her findings and this could contribute to credibility. If another researcher agrees on
       the findings, this increases credibility of the findings.
     • Controlling for participant expectations (participant bias), for example:
       o by ensuring that each participant is given the opportunity to refuse to participate in the study.
           The researcher needs to take into consideration the fact that the participants all belong to
           her social network and that they may only be saying they will take part just to please her.
       o by encouraging participants to be frank from the start of the interview. Being aware of any
           potential effects of the participants already knowing the researcher. This will mean rapport is
           already established, but may mean the participants do not feel as able to be honest if they
           are embarrassed about an answer. Letting participants know that there are no right or
           wrong answers to the questions that will be asked.
       o by using iterative questioning, that is, being attentive to ambiguous answers and later
           rephrasing the same question in order to get a deeper insight into this sensitive topic. If
           participants in this study try to impress the researcher (that is, social desirability effect)
           instead of answering truthfully, the researcher will revise the question.
     • Examination of previous research findings on the same topic: Assessing the degree to
       which the findings of this qualitative research are congruent with previous studies.

     Candidates can refer to measures to ensure credibility that were applied in the study
     and/or measures that could be taken. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
