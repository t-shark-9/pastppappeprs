                                               Section B

Answer the following question.

4.    SVT organizes each of its water treatment plants as a profit centre. SVT’s water treatment
      plant in a Middle Eastern country extracts water from a local river to supply households in
      Dalgera, the capital city. In 2019, many people complained about the water’s bad taste. A
      television documentary suggested that SVT was negligent.

      SVT investigated and found that employees at its water treatment plant had failed to treat the
      water properly. This failure resulted in lead* from inside old pipes entering the water that was
      supplied, exposing the inhabitants of Dalgera to water with high levels of lead.

      In 2020, SVT dismissed the regional director of Dalgera and installed automated monitoring
      equipment (which was already being used in its European water treatment plants) in all of
      SVT plants across the world. This equipment, which monitors lead levels, costs $100 million
      and depreciates on a declining-balance basis at a rate of 20 % per annum to a residual value
      of $10 million. However, in 2021, a court ordered SVT to pay $300 million in damages to the
      affected people in Dalgera, which was widely publicized across the world, badly damaging
      SVT’s brand image.

      By 2022, the global home water filter market was $14 billion, and 90 % of SVT’s water filter
      sales were to Europe and the USA. SVT now wants to increase sales in Asia, a market with
      significant growth potential. In the same year, SVT closed its European and USA water filter
      manufacturing factories, partly because of increasing costs of energy and labour. These
      factories were replaced by a huge new factory in Asia.



* lead: a chemical element that is a soft, heavy, grey metal. In the past, it was widely
  used to make pipes, cover roofs, and in paint; it is harmful when ingested

      (a)   Define the term profit centre.[2]

      (b)   (i)	Using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation, calculate the total
                 depreciation of the automated monitoring equipment after a period of two years
                 (show all your working).[2]

            (ii)   With reference to SVT’s automated monitoring equipment, explain one
                   advantage of using the reducing/declining balance method of depreciation.             [2]

      (c)   Explain two ways in which effective contingency planning at SVT could have prevented
            the problems experienced in Dalgera.                                                         [4]

      (d)   With reference to SVT, evaluate the opportunities and threats posed by entering
            international markets.                                                                      [10]

                                              Section C

Answer the following question.


5.   SVT is negotiating with a foreign government to construct and operate, for 20 years, a large
     desalination plant. SVT would be paid to construct the plant and be paid an annual fee for
     its operation.

     SVT will, whenever possible, power the desalination plant using electricity from 30 large wind
     turbines located in the sea (offshore) near the plant.

     However, SVT is unable to manufacture the 30 large wind turbines in time with its current
     manufacturing capacity. Delays in the desalination plant going into operation would lead to
     SVT facing severe financial penalties.

     SVT’s directors must choose between two options:
     y Option 1: Increase SVT’s wind turbine manufacturing capacity (see Table 1). Investment
       is needed to increase capacity initially to meet the order for 30 large wind turbines. SVT’s
       production director has calculated a 60 % probability that the order can be delivered on time, a
       30 % probability of a 60-day delay and a 10 % probability of a 120-day delay.
     y Option 2: Enter into a joint venture with ZAZ PLC, a leading specialist wind turbine
       manufacturer. Costs and fees for the construction and operation of the desalination plant would
       be shared equally (see Table 2 and Table 3). ZAZ would guarantee availability of the wind
       turbines in time to fulfil the contract. SVT’s board of directors has estimated a 20 % probability of
       the joint venture failing.

     ZAZ believes further collaborations are possible, as the demand for desalination plants is
     increasing each year.

                         Table 1: Selected financial information for Option 1

                    Capital investment required                     $120 million

                    Estimated life of investment                    20 years

                    Forecasted number of large wind turbine         40
                    sales needed annually to break even

                    Annual manufacturing capacity of large          60
                    wind turbines

                    Forecasted net return from the sale of one      $0.5 million
                    large wind turbine

                    Cost of each 60-day delay in the                –$40 million
                    desalination plant beginning operation

                              of the new desalination plant in Option 2

                    Capital cost of construction                      $504 million

                    Cost of 30 wind turbines                          $60 million

                    Installation cost for 30 wind turbines            $36 million

                    Desalination plant construction fee paid to       $650 million
                    SVT at the end of year 1

                    Table 3: Selected financial information about the operation
                             of the new desalination plant in Option 2

     Annual operating fees paid to desalination
     plant operator(s):

     Years 1–8                                               $90 million

     Years 9–15                                              $95 million

     Years 16–20                                             To be negotiated in year 15

     Forecasted annual average net returns from
     the desalination plant operating fees:

     Years 1–8                                               $60 million

     Years 9–15                                              $58 million

     Years 16–20                                             Dependent on fees negotiated in year 15

     Using the case study and additional information on pages 4 and 5, recommend whether SVT
     should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[20]
