Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Examine the importance of the Domesday Book to the reign of William I.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Domesday Book
     and the reign of William I. Identifying the purpose of the Domesday Book will enable candidates to
     judge its importance. It was a survey of land tenure holdings confirming changes since 1066. One
     aim was to resolve disputes between Normans and Anglo-Saxons.
     Its main purpose was to identify the rights and dues owed to the crown by landholders. These
     include military service and other fees due to the crown such as relief that would ensure an heir’s’
     smooth succession. Some Normans landholders tried to evade the liabilities of the previous
     landholder. It also gave William specific knowledge of the military resources he could utilise in time
     of war/external threat. It was undertaken in 1086 just before the end of William’s reign and
     arguably it enabled William to pass onto his heir a clear picture of royal authority and a clear
     definition of the social structure that feudalism had established. Candidates’ opinions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

2.   Discuss the reasons for conflict between Philip II (Philip Augustus) and the Angevin Kings of
     England.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reason
     for conflict between Philip of France and the Angevin Kings of England. One underlying reason
     was the reluctance of the Angevin Kings to acknowledge Philip as their suzerain. Simultaneously
     Philip was determined to reduce the power of the Angevins in France. Their control of
      Aquitaine, Normandy and Anjou undermined the power of the French crown. There may be
     some discussion of more immediate causes of conflicts such as the refusal to repay the
     dowries of French princesses, and/or Philip’s support for the rebellion of Henry II’s sons. In 1194
     conflict resumed when Richard I returned from the Crusades and was determined to regain
     territory lost in his absence, in 1198 a truce was signed. When John succeeded Richard, Philip
     acknowledged his power in England and Normandy, however the death of Arthur of Brittany
     led Philip to renew the conflict which continued until John was defeated at Bouvines in 1214.
     Candidate's opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported with appropriate
     evidence.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “The Crusades were the most significant reason for Christian hostility to Muslims.” To what extent
     do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     Crusades were the most significant reason for Christian hostility to Muslims. Candidates may support
     the statement considering the Crusades as a response to Muslim expansion over the Mediterranean.
     They may also refer to the recovery of the Holy Land, and other territories significant to Christianity,
     as a reason for Christian hostility. They may also measure the impact of the descriptions of Islam
     written by monks and priests in the Middle East which further reinforced Christian hostility.
     Candidates may challenge the statement arguing the Crusades were part of a general European
     expansion starting in the 11th century that provoked hostility due primarily to economic goals. They
     may also consider this as the most significant reason for the conflicts taking place in Europe between
     Christian and Muslim communities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

4.   Examine the results of warfare on the borders between Christian and Muslim ruled-states.

     The question requires that candidates consider the results of warfare on the borders between
     Christian and Muslim ruled-states. Candidates may examine process of migrations and/or relocation
     of population in border areas. The redefinition of borders could also be a result of the warfare and
     the expansion of Christian or Muslim armies over new territories. They may also consider political
     results of the warfare, like the reinforcement and/or fall of the kings and dynasties. Other relevant
     results may be considered, for example the changes in the control of sea routes and trade routes,
     especially in the Mediterranean, and the changes in the use of currency and the transportation of
     gold and silver. Warfare also affected many cities and their centres of study. Conflict and the inability
     to travel for study had a negative impact on intellectual life. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –6–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Evaluate the impact of the Hundred Years’ War on France between 1415–1453.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of war in France in the
     stated period. Initially the impact was disastrous for France; defeat at Agincourt and the Treaty of
     Troyes meant that Henry V was designated heir to Charles VI. After Henry’s death in 1422 the
     English under Bedford controlled most of France north of the Loire. The emergence of Joan of Arc
     led to a revival of French fortunes and the Dauphin was crowned in 1429. Conflict continued
     intermittently until 1453 when the English were defeated at Castillon. Initially the impact was an
     undermining of the French monarchy but as Charles VII gradually gained control of more territory
     there emerged a greater sense of French nationalism and a stronger centralised monarchy. The
     war led to the removal of English control except in Calais. There may be some discussion of the
     social and economic impact, with population decline, famine and the breakdown of law and order
     as a consequence of conflict. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be clearly expressed and
     supported by evidence

6.   Evaluate the importance of the long- and short-term causes to the outbreak of the Wars of the
     Roses.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of both the long and short-term
     causes of the Wars of the Roses. Some may argue the deposing of Richard II was a long-term
     cause that set a precedent for the removal of weak kings and established the rivalry between the
     houses of York and Lancaster. Responses may discuss the immediate causes of each phase
     linking them to “weak kingship” arguing Henry VI was a weak king, as was Edward IV during his
     first reign because of the dominance of Warwick. In the case of the last phase of the Wars, Richard
     III’s dubious claim to succeed to the throne gave Henry Tudor the opportunity to make his bid for
     the throne. Short term causes were more important in the outbreak of conflict in each phase
     especially where the monarch was deemed to be weak or had a questionable claim to the throne,
     but some may argue that long term causes were as important as they established the context for
     conflict. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly presented and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                   –7–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Examine the contribution of the social and political situation in Florence to the origins of the
     Renaissance.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the social and political
     situation in Florence and the origins of the Renaissance. Candidates may argue that Florence, a
     city-state ruled by important families, was more democratic than other cities in Europe ensuring a
     certain degree of independence for artistic and intellectual creation and allowing the development of
     individual careers. Florence was also financially prosperous by the late Middle Ages, being an
     important trading centre on the route from Rome to Venice, and well known for its important
     merchants and bankers who invested in art. Other relevant contributions may be considered, for
     example the freedom of intellectual life that allowed for the presence of artists and scholars in the
     city. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

8.   Evaluate the impact of the patronage of Ludovico Sforza to the Italian Renaissance.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the patronage of Ludovico
     Sforza to the Italian Renaissance. Candidates may refer to the role played by Ludovico Sforza as
     patron of artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Donato Bramante, Botticelli, Lippi, Perugino and Ghirlandaio.
     Many of them were present at Ludovico Sforza´s court. Candidates may refer to Ludovico Sforza´s
     important investments not only in art works, but also in extensive works in civil and military
     engineering, such as canals and fortifications. Candidates may also refer to Ludovico Sforza’s good
     relations with Lorenzo de Medici and Pope Alexander VI which provided further opportunities for
     patronage. Candidates may also evaluate the impact of Ludovico Sforza’s patronage on ordinary
     people who were increasingly burdened by taxes to support architectural works and celebrations.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                 –8–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

 9. “Religion was the main reason for exploration in the 15th century.” To what extent do you agree
    with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that religion
     was the main reason for exploration in the 15th century. Candidates may argue that from its
     beginnings Christianity has been an apostolic or missionary faith that advocates for the conversion
     of people. They may also point out that belief in the existence of utopian societies outside Europe
     also played a role in exploration. Competition with the Ottoman Empire and Muslim religion also
     could be analysed as a motive for exploration. Candidates may challenge the statement, arguing
     that religion did not play the main role as a motive since economic factors prevailed, like the need
     for territory to feed a growing European population. They may also argue that trade, the search for
     gold and spices, or the new scientific developments, especially in astronomy and navigation, were
     more important that religion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

 10. “Political tensions between European states were the main consequence of exploration of
     the New World.” Discuss.


     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
     political tensions between European states were the main consequence of exploration of
     the New World. Candidates may argue that successful exploration brought recognition and prestige
     to a number of European dynasties, as well as resources and wealth, causing rivalry and political
     tensions. The competition to control routes and lands to explore also led to political disagreements
     between European states, as in the case of Portugal and Spain. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example the impact on those European states that did not take part in exploration
     such as the loss of reputation and the chance to improve their economies. Candidates may challenge
     the statement arguing the major consequences of the exploration were economic, especially the
     reorganization of trade routes and the entry of new goods in Europe. They may also point out that
     the political tensions could have different origins caused by historical rivalries and alliances among
     the different European dynasties. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                   M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (c1500–1563)

 11. Evaluate the impact of the Tetzel Mission and the Ninety-Five Theses on the development of the
     Reformation.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Tetzel Mission and the
     Ninety-Five Theses on the development of the Reformation. Candidates may refer to Tetzel´s role
     as general commissioner and his actions as a seller of indulgences. Candidates may also consider
     Tetzel´s preaching in Meissen, Magdeburg, and Halberstadt which provoked Martin Luther’s Ninety-
     Five Theses in 1517, the event that is considered the beginning of the Reformation. Candidates may
     argue that even if Luther had no intention of breaking from the Catholic church, the Theses,
     translated and printed, circulated throughout Germany becoming a manifesto that turned a protest
     into a major crisis. They may suggest that the excommunication of Luther and his followers also had
     an impact on the development of the Reformation, as well as his conflict with German princes and
     authorities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

 12. To what extent did the Reformation contribute to the outbreak of the Peasants’ War?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     Reformation contributed to the outbreak of the Peasants’ War. Candidates may argue that the
     Peasants´ War was inspired by changes brought about by the Reformation since peasants
     invoked divine law to demand agrarian rights and freedom. Peasants believed that Luther´s
     manuscript, “Of the freedom of a Christian”, confirmed that they need no longer endure bondage or
     serfdom. They also had the support of the radical reformer Thomas Muentzer who argued for their
     violent liberation. The Reformation also highlighted the poor state of church organisation in the
     country. Candidates may challenge the question arguing that Luther, after initially showing sympathy
     for the peasants, changed his mind and asked authorities to take action against them. They may
     consider other reasons for the outbreak of the war like the actions of the nobility in removing the “old
     rights” of the peasantry, appropriating communal pasturelands, forests and fishing areas, and forcing
     the peasants to pay additional services. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

 13. “Enlightenment ideas had significant political impact.” Discuss with reference to two of the
     following: Germany, England, Scotland, France, Spain, the Dutch Republic or Italy.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the political impact
    of the Enlightenment. Key ideas may include the notion of individual liberty, freedom of expression,
    religious tolerance and the social contract. France and England are likely to be popular examples
    referring to the impact of Enlightenment ideas on the French revolution and how the American War
    of Independence affected English politics. Some may choose to agree with the statement
    depending on their exemplars. Others may refer to the impact of Enlightened despotism arguing
    that some ideas led to some changes but with a limited impact on the political structure. An
    example could be in Habsburg controlled areas of Italy where Enlightenment ideas led to some
    administrative reforms but no change in the political structure. Candidates’ opinions and
    conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence

 14. “The growth of cities during the Enlightenment led to major social and economic change.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
     economic impact of urban growth. Some may argue that the growth of cities was actually quite
     limited e.g., Paris was only 2% of the French population but that they were very influential. To
     agree with the statement some may argue that the influence of urban merchants and financiers
     contributed to the end of the mercantile system and the acceptance of laissez-faire economics. It
     could also be argued that there was significant social change with the emergence of a clearly
     identifiable middle class whose wealth derived from trade and finance. To argue against the
     statement some may point out that established cities may have increased in size but that most
     nations’ economies were still heavily reliant on agriculture. Also, that whilst a middle class may
     have emerged in many countries, the social structure remained overall very traditional and
     hierarchical. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be clearly expressed and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

 15. Evaluate the significance of the social and economic challenges facing the Ancien Régime before
     1789.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the challenges facing the Ancien
    Régime. The main focus should be on social and economic challenges, but candidates may also
    discuss political challenges, the weak ineffectual rule of Louis XVI and the increasing demands for
    political change. Financial challenges include the massive deficit in the Royal Finances because of
    involvement in the American War of Independence and the problem of a low tax base. France had
    limited financial institutions (no national bank) limited manufacturing and low levels of agricultural
    productivity. French society was very stratified, the Estate structure meant that the bourgeoisie had
    limited access to public office, and many began to question the idea of the divine right of kings.
    Some may argue that the economic crisis of 1786 was the greatest challenge as this precipitated
    the demands for political change. Others may suggest that social discontent was the greatest
    challenge or that both were of equal importance. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
    presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence.

 16. Evaluate the social and economic impact on France of Napoleon’s foreign policy.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Napoleon’s foreign policy
    on France. The social impact included a repressive authoritarian government which was necessary
    to execute the various military campaigns. France was at war for 17 years and by 1814 conscription
    was enforced ruthlessly. This led to resistance and discontent even amongst the normally
    acquiescent peasantry. In Southwest France the population had to submit to the requisitioning of
    supplies for the army trying to resist the advance of Wellington’s forces. Economically the impact of
    foreign policy was very damaging. The Continental System damaged trade and by the time the
    empire collapsed France was virtually bankrupt. High levels of taxation in order to pay for war led to
    limited investment in industry and by the end of the war standards of living were in decline. Some
    may argue that the economic impact was far more significant than the social impact. Candidates’
    opinions and conclusions will be stated clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

 17. “The domestic policies of Napoleon III brought stability and prosperity to France.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
    Napoleon III’s domestic policies. Responses may argue that there was political stability, ensured in
    the early stages by repression and censorship of opposition. It may also be pointed out that the
    Empire was popular with the French as the plebiscite of 1870 demonstrated, and opposition was
    largely confined to Paris and industrial cities. There was economic growth in the 1850s with the
    establishment of banks such as Credit Mobilier, investment in the railways and building projects
    (Hausmann in Paris). Trade was stimulated by free trade treaties such as the Cobden–Chevalier
    treaty. To disagree some may argue that stability was superficial citing the ease with which
    Napoleon III was overthrown. Prosperity was uneven across the population, working class wages
    failed to keep pace with the rising cost of living and rents increased significantly in Paris. In the
    1860s trade declined as the textile industry was hit by the American civil war. Agriculture remained
    largely unmodernised. Candidates’ opinions will be stated clearly and supported by appropriate
    evidence.

 18. “Boulangisme was a major threat to the Third Republic.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

    The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that
    Boulangisme was a major threat to the Third Republic. There may be discussion of the scale of
    support for Boulanger, he won a series of elections and had popular support for his policy of
    revanche. He had the support of some monarchists, the League of Patriots and some in the Army
    and the Church. The republic under Grevy seemed weak as a consequence of the corruption
    scandals. To argue against, it may be pointed out that Boulanger’s support was very disparate and
    unlikely to remain consistent and some feared he would become a dictator. Boulanger was
    indecisive, he was unwilling to stage a coup and hoped to gain power via the ballot box. The
    republican system took decisive action, unifying to deflect the threat (“no enemies on the left”).
    Grevy was replaced by Sadi Carnot and a warrant issued for Boulanger’s arrest, he fled to Belgium
    and the movement collapsed. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly presented and
    supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

 19. Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Disraeli and Gladstone.

    The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
    the domestic policies of the two prime ministers. Both were seen as domestic reformers trying to
    improve society so were broadly similar. The major contrast was in the rationale for reforms.
    Gladstone was concerned with ensuring equality of opportunity (army reform, civil service reform),
    he was less concerned with social reform believing it was up to the individual to progress once
    artificial barriers were removed. Disraeli believed in ‘Tory Democracy', protecting the elites who
    would their use their position to improve the position of the poor. Arguably Disraeli’s social reforms
    were more effective than Gladstone's. His 1875 Public Health Act clarified the compulsory duties of
    local authorities whereas Gladstone’s 1872 Act was less comprehensive. Candidates may cite
    other legislation, such as the Artisans Dwellings Act which attempted to address the issue of slum
    housing or Gladstone’s wide ranging Education Act. Disraeli’s Trade Union legislation effectively
    gave the unions more power to improve wages and conditions. Candidates’ opinions and
    conclusions will be clearly presented and supported by appropriate evidence.


 20. “The aim of the ‘People’s Budget’ was to support major social reforms.” To what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement.
     Responses may wish to set some context; the Liberal government was committed to social reform
     for both compassionate reasons and to maintain the working-class vote. However, they were
     obstructed by an inbuilt Conservative majority in the Lords. The People’s Budget intended to raise
     £15 million pounds for Old Age Pensions, labour exchanges and Dreadnoughts. Some may agree
     with the statement as Old Age Pensions were a significant social reform. Others may argue that
     Lloyd George deliberately set a controversial budget in order to force a confrontation with the Lords
     who had rejected such legislation as the Plural Voting Bill. The struggle to pass the budget led to
     the constitutional crisis of 1910 and the subsequent 1911 Parliament Act which clarified the power
     of the Commons over the House of Lords. The fact that Pensions were only applicable to the over
     70s further reinforces the view that the budget was deliberately provocative. Candidates’ opinions
     and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported with appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

 21. Evaluate the significance of foreign influence to the process of Italian unification between 1849–
     1871.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of foreign influence on
     Italian unification. Some may argue that foreign influence was crucial to the process suggesting
     that hostility to Austrian control was a factor in driving the demand for unification. Other instances
     of foreign influence include the alliance with France (Pact of Plombieres) leading to the gaining of
     Lombardy. There may be reference to Britain’s tacit support for Garibaldi’s expedition to Sicily.
     Foreign influence may also include the Prussian alliance in 1866 which led to the annexation of
     Venetia. Negative foreign influence could include the French garrison in Rome which prevented full
     unification until 1871. Some may suggest that Cavour and Garibaldi were more significant to the
     process of unification or that foreign influence was crucial at different stages but that there was
     also a need for action from Italian leaders and politicians. Candidates’ opinions and conclusion will
     be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

 22. Examine the successes and failures of Bismarck’s domestic policies between 1871 and 1890.

    The question requires that candidates consider the successes and failures of Bismarck’s policies,
    identifying his aims before making a judgement. He aimed to ensure the dominance of Prussia
    within the federal empire; unifying the empire’s administration and weakening internal enemies
    (Reichsfeinde). The new constitution ensured that power was centred on the Kaiser, the federal
    states and the Reichstag had limited influence and Prussia’s priorities prevailed. Economic policies
    helped unify the empire with a national currency, the Reichsbank and the abolition of internal tariffs.
    Legal procedures both commercial and criminal were unified, strengthening the power of Prussia.
    Bismarck’s policies towards the Reichsfeinde were less successful, the Kulturkampf failed to
    weaken the Centre Party and by 1890 it had 107 seats in the Reichstag. Policies toward the
    Socialists combined repression with State Socialism, but these failed to halt the growth in support
    for the Social Democratic Party whose vote share almost doubled between 1887 and 1890. Two
    major national groups, the Poles and the Alsatians remained unreconciled to being in the Empire,
    regularly returning separatist deputies to the Reichstag. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will
    be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

 23. Evaluate the significance of the Russo-Japanese War to the outbreak of the 1905 Revolution.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of the Russo-Japanese
    war to the outbreak of the 1905 Revolution. Despite various mutinies such as the Potemkin mutiny
    the military remained loyal to the regime. Defeat in the war increased criticism of the Tsar’s
    government, uniting various opposition groups, (Liberals, Kadets and the SRs) in demands for
    reform. Responses may argue that there were important underlying causes for the revolution, such
    as “land hunger “and high levels of peasant taxation (peasants taxed twice as much as the nobility).
    There was also considerable urban discontent between 1902-1904 and there had been major
    strikes against poor living and working conditions. There were also many instances of student
    unrest. Arguably the spark that started the revolution were the events of Bloody Sunday in January
    1905 where the demonstrators were focused on living and working conditions and not defeat in the
    war. Some may argue the war was of limited significance merely highlighting the incompetence of
    the government. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by
    appropriate evidence.

 24. “The introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP) ensured the survival of the Bolshevik Regime.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates give a considered and balanced review of the importance of
     NEP to the survival of the Bolshevik regime. To agree with the statement, there may be discussion
     of the unpopularity of the Bolsheviks by the end of 1920. There was anger about the impact of War
     Communism, grain requisitioning and forced conscription into the Red Army. There were peasant
     revolts in many areas including the Tambov and Volga regions, strikes and unrest in Moscow and
     Petrograd and the Kronstadt Mutiny in February 1921. These events convinced Lenin that a
     change of direction was necessary even if only temporarily. NEP was a compromise ending grain
     requisitioning, allowing some private enterprise in industry and agriculture while the state retained
     control of the “commanding heights” of the economy. By the mid-1920s the economy had
     stabilised. Some may argue that the NEP reduced criticism to some extent but that it was the
     Cheka’s repression of other political parties (Mensheviks and SRs) and the establishment of the
     one-party state that ensured Bolshevik survival. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
     clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

 25. Examine the impact of the First World War on the civilian population
    of two European countries between 1914–1918.

     The question requires that candidates consider the impact of the First World War on the civilian
     population of two European countries between 1914–1918. Responses will vary according to which
     countries are chosen. Candidates may refer to the impact of the First World War due to the death
     toll and its effect on population demographics. . They may also state that children were particularly
     impacted by the war through disruption to home life and to schooling, absent parents, and deaths of
     family and friends. Candidates may also consider the impact of the First World War on labour: since
     men were sent to the front, women were transferred from sectors such as textiles and domestic
     service. Other relevant factors may be considered, for example the blockades that caused shortages
     of food and fertiliser, tools, and lighting fuel. Candidates may also examine the impact on civilian
     population of the destruction of hospitals, schools and towns in combat areas. Candidates could also
     consider the impact of inflation and hyper-inflation caused by the cost of war. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

 26. To what extent did US entry into the First World War contribute to the defeat of the Central
    Powers?

     The question requires that candidates consider to what extent the US entry into the First World War
     contributed to the defeat of the Central Powers. Candidates may consider the entry of the United
     States as the turning point of the war thanks to the US supply of large credits, arms, soldiers, and
     food to the Allies. By 1918, US troops were arriving in large numbers on the Western Front. Some
     may argue that they played a significant role in the defeats the German army suffered from August
     1918 until the end of the war. Other relevant factors may be addressed to challenge the question,
     for example the domestic difficulties of the Central Powers could also be considered as a reason for
     their defeat. Some of them were struggling with revolts and/or the effects of a long war that exhausted
     their economies. They may also argue that the military campaigns of British Imperial troops and
     those of the European allies were more important as factors in defeating the Central Powers.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 14 : Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

 27. Discuss the view that the use of force was the most significant factor in Mussolini’s consolidation of
     power up to 1926.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that the
     use of force was the most significant factor in Mussolini’s consolidation of power up to 1926.
     Candidates may refer to the early actions taken by the fasci di combattimento who supported
     Mussolini and incited the support of the discontented, unemployed and war veterans. The Fascist
     squads, often created by local leaders, also played a role attacking Socialists, burning down union
     and party offices, and terrorizing the local population. Candidates may also point out that in late 1920
     the Blackshirt squads, often with the help of landowners, began to attack local government
     institutions to prevent left-wing administrations from taking power. There may be reference to the
     murder of Matteotti and its impact on opposition parties. Candidates may challenge the view
     discussing the contribution of other factors in Mussolini´s consolidation of power, such as the broad
     base of support around the ideas of nationalism and anti-Bolshevism held by the upper and middle
     classes. They may also argue that Italy’s democracy was too fragile and could not prevent the
     proscription of opposition parties, trade unions, and destruction of the free press. The passing of the
     Acerbo Law ensured a Fascist majority in parliament, contributing to Mussolini´s power. Reference
     to the various “battles” of Mussolini’s regime should be made relevant to his consolidation of power
     up to 1926. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.




 28. Examine the economic and political developments in one European country (other than Germany,
     Italy or Spain) in the inter-war years.

     The question requires that candidates examine the economic and political developments
     in one European country (other than Germany, Italy or Spain) in the inter-war years. Candidates’
     responses will vary depending on which country they choose. Established states such as Great
     Britain or France would be appropriate as would any of the states which emerged from the post war
     settlement. The Soviet Union is also a permitted choice of country for this question. In many cases,
     there were impacts on economic and political developments due to the dislocations caused by the
     First World War and these lasted into the 1920s. In the 1930s, many countries saw significant
     impacts on economic and political developments due to the Great Depression. In some cases,
     countries saw the emergence of extremist parties and the rise of dictatorships. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

 29. “The League of Nations was an effective organization in the 1920s.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. There
     may be some reference to the main tasks of the League which were to arbitrate in disputes to help
     maintain peace, further disarmament and assist in economic and social issues. To agree, it could
     be pointed out that some disputes were settled by the League (Memel, Aaland Islands, Greek/
     Bulgarian border dispute). The League was also effective in its work on some social and economic
     issues, for example the work of the refugee department under Nansen, the health department and
     the ILO. To argue against, responses may point out that any forceful action required the support of
     the major powers. They often worked outside the League e.g., the Corfu crisis was resolved by the
     Conference of Ambassadors. The League had limited success in furthering disarmament, the
     British rejected the Geneva Protocol 1924 and the late convening of the World Disarmament
     conference in 1932 meant there was little chance of progress. Candidates' opinions and
     conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by appropriate evidence.

 30. “German foreign policy under Stresemann achieved limited success between 1923 and
     1929.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of Stresemann’s
     foreign policy. Evidence of success could include the negotiation of the Dawes and Young Plans to
     reduce the burden of reparations. He improved Germany’s relations with other powers (Locarno
     Accords, entry to the League of Nations 1926) which reduced the potential threat from France.
     Better relations with other powers led to the gradual withdrawal of occupation troops. He retained
     some flexibility over Germany’s eastern borders and maintained good relations with the Soviet
     Union, renewing the treaty of Rapallo with the Berlin Treaty 1926. Arguably he failed in his main
     goal which was the revision of the Versailles Settlement, the return of all German territory and the
     end of reparations. Despite his best diplomatic efforts, he was never able to overcome French fear
     and suspicion of Germany, this limited his success on the major issue of revising the Versailles
     settlement. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be clearly stated and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

 31. Examine the political and economic developments in the Soviet Union between 1945–1953.

     The question requires that candidates examine the political and economic developments in the
     Soviet Union between 1945–1953. Regarding political developments candidates may examine the
     reintroduction of Stalin´s policy of terror, for example the response to the so called “Doctors’ Plot”
     and the Leningrad Affair. Candidates may also discuss the sidelining of potential rivals to Stalin such
     as Zhukov after the war. Candidates may also discuss the fourth and fifth Five Year Plans with their
     policies to restore industrial and agricultural production The new era of nuclear developments also
     posed a challenge to Soviet industry and science. Candidates may also examine the impact on the
     Soviet economy of the establishment of COMECON. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

 32. Evaluate the impact of Yeltsin’s policies in post-Soviet Russia up to 2000.

     The question requires that candidates evaluate the impact of Yeltsin’s policies in post-Soviet Russia
     up to 2000. Candidates may discuss Yeltsin´s conflicts with the Russian Parliament including the
     attack on the Russian White House in October 1993. This led to increased powers for Yeltsin.
     Candidates may also further evaluate the impact of the ending of government price subsidies and
     controls over food and other goods, the permission for the growth of free markets, and the
     privatization reforms that resulted in 70% of the economy being privatized by 1994. Yeltsin also
     started a loans-for-shares programme that transferred ownership of a number of natural resource
     enterprises to businessmen in exchange for loans to the government. Candidates may argue that
     despite Yeltsin’s reforms, the economy performed badly through much of the 1990s, suffering
     numerous bouts of inflation that ruined the savings of the citizens. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

 33. “Fear of the spread of communism led to the breakdown of the wartime alliance in Europe.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
     fear of the spread of communism led to the breakdown of the wartime alliance in Europe. Candidates
     may argue that the US suspected that Stalin wanted to convert the rest of the world to communism,
     and it was US duty to stop him. Candidates may point out that Truman saw Soviet domination of
     Eastern Europe as an act of aggression, and he was worried that this meant communism would
     spread into Western Europe. Candidates may challenge the statement arguing that the members of
     the Wartime Alliance had little in common, and conflicts arose after defeating Hitler. They may also
     argue that Stalin´s policies were in fact focused on protecting the Soviet Union with a buffer zone
     rather than being interested in its expansion. They may also point out that the different plans for the
     future of Germany also led to the breakdown of the alliance. The use of atomic bombs in Japan could
     also be considered a reason for the breakdown. In 1946, Stalin accused America of using its atomic
     advantage to spread its control. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

 34. Discuss the factors that contributed to the German “economic miracle” up to 1963.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
     factors that contributed to the German “economic miracle” up to 1963. Candidates may refer to the
     policies of the Adenauer government such as currency reform as a factor contributing to recovery.
     The reforms re-established money as the preferred medium of exchange and monetary incentives
     as the prime mover of economic activity. The confidence in the new currency also meant
     absenteeism plummeted, increasing productivity. The ending of price controls and the
     implementation of tax reductions may also be argued to have contributed to economic growth. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed, for example the impact of the Marshall Plan on the German
     economy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

 35. To what extent were economic factors the main motive for Soviet domination in central and eastern
     Europe between 1945–1955?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     economic factors were the main motive for Soviet domination in central and eastern Europe between
     1945–1955. Candidates may refer to the state of the Soviet economy devastated by the war and the
     establishment of COMECON. Also, the fragile economic situation of many central and eastern
     European countries meant they collaborated with the domination of the Soviet Union. Many were
     unable to modernize their economies without the loans and technical help offered by the Soviet
     Union. It may be argued that another motive for Soviet domination was Stalin´s need for security.
     This led to the formation of a belt of buffer states that were members of the Warsaw Pact. With the
     emergence of the Cold War, it could also be argued that Stalin wished to enhance the Soviet Union’s
     status as a superpower. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.

 36. Examine the consequences of the collapse of Soviet control in central and eastern Europe.

     The question requires that candidates consider the consequences of the collapse of Soviet control
     in central and eastern Europe. Candidates may examine the protests against Communist regimes
     as Soviet control weakened and which took place in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and
     Romania. In these former Eastern Bloc states, democratic governments emerged after the end of
     Soviet control. In most cases, this happened relatively peacefully. The freedom to establish
     diplomatic relations with the rest of the world impacted on their foreign policies, but also on their
     economies since now they could sign new trade treaties. Nonetheless, the collapse of the Soviet
     Union also meant former Eastern Bloc nations lost their main client for exports and the country that
     usually provided loans, technical help and imports. Candidates may point out the new freedom of
     speech many countries experienced, and the freedom to travel for the population. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
