                                               Section A

1.   Changing population

     (a)   (i)    Identify the age group with the highest number of people.                               [1]

                  65-69

           (ii)   Estimate the total population, in millions, aged 0–14.                                  [1]

                  16 (million) Accept 14-18.

     (b)   Explain two ways of managing the economic problems associated with an
           ageing society.                                                                              [2+2]

           Award [1] for identifying a valid way and [1] for further development/exemplification that
           explains how it addresses the economic problem.

           For example: Raising pension age [1] so individuals are paid pensions for a
           shorter period of time [1].

           Other management strategies include:
            • Encouraging immigration to increase workforce/maintain tax revenues.
            • Increasing taxation to pay for pensions.
            • Increased use of technology e.g. in care homes
            • Changing pension system e.g. introduction of private pensions to decrease the burden
               on the state, phased retirement to encourage older workers to stay in employment
            • Encourage volunteer care work to reduce expenditure on the elderly.
            • Improve health of elderly to reduce money spent on hospitals.
            • Improve workplace attitudes to the elderly/workplace design – encourages elderly to stay
               in employment and require less money spent on them/keep contributing.
            • Support lifelong learning – boosts employability of ageing society/keeps minds active.
            • Pro-natal policies – increases working age group to increase tax revenue.
                                              –6–                 M23/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain how two physical factors can lead to uneven population distribution in one
      place you have studied.                                                                     [2+2]

      The geography guide refers to population distribution at a national scale so expect many
      candidates to refer to this scale but accept other valid scales that illustrate one place – e.g.
      regional

      Award [1] for a physical factor and [1] for further development/exemplification that explains
      how the factor leads to uneven distribution.

      Candidates may refer to uneven via concentration or sparsity. Physical factors must refer to
      one place for full marks. Only credit factors that relate to the same place for both physical
      factors. If no identified place award [1] for valid factor plus development up to a maximum of
      [2].

      For example: Population will be concentrated in areas close to rivers in New South Wales [1]
      where there is abundant water supplies for agriculture/domestic consumption [1].

      Other possible physical factors include:
      • Climate – population sparse in areas of arid climate in Australia/lack of water supply
      • Relief – population concentrated in lowland areas such as North China Plain/easier to
          farm.
      • Altitude – population sparse at high altitude in Chile/difficult to breath
      • Proximity to bays/estuaries/coast – high population densities along Norwegian
          coast/access to fishing and transport
      • Fertile soils – higher concentrations in the Nile valley in Egypt/allow agriculture.
      • Distance – isolated areas in northern Canada/away from areas of economic
          development
      • Resources e.g. coal/mineral deposits – high concentrations in South Wales valleys/coal
          mining attracted people for jobs
      • Floodplains of the Severn Valley that suffer from frequent natural disasters [e.g. flooding]
          have lower density/as housing is in danger
      • Areas that suffer from disease induced by physical factors [e.g. coastal areas of Papua
          New Guinea] have lower densities/people suffer from malaria
      • Landlocked areas have lower population/difficulty of trade.
      • Dense vegetation in the Amazon Basin area of Brazil has sparse population/provide
          issues of accessibility.
                                                   –7–                 M23/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Global climate – vulnerability and resilience

     (a)   Outline what is meant by global dimming.                                                  [2]

           Reduction in the amount of solar energy/sunlight (reaching the Earth’s surface) [1 reserved],
           because volcanic activity has put dust in the atmosphere [1] /air pollution (sulphate aerosols)
           from industrialization [1] leading to a decrease in global temperatures [1].

     (b)   Suggest two ways in which economic development leads to international
           variations in greenhouse gas emissions.                                                   [2+2]

           Award [1] for identification of a valid way and [1] for the effect leading to international
           variation in GHG emissions.

           Candidates may refer to international variation via comment on levels of development
           (richer/poorer/HIC/MIC/LIC etc.)

           For example: Higher level of economic development means more people can
           afford cars [1] therefore GHG emissions are higher in HICs [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • More domestic appliances are used in HICs/results in greater use of electricity which
              gives more GHG.
           • Changed diet of middle classes in countries with a growing economy/result in more meat
              and methane emissions
           • More manufacturing industry in HICs/results in higher emissions of GHG
           • More alternative energy use in HICs/decreases use of fossil fuels
           • Increased awareness/education in HICs/people use less fossil fuel/recycle.
           • Government initiatives in HICs/encourage use of alternative energy.
           • Move from manufacturing to service industry in HICs/means move to less carbon-based
              industry.
           • Shift to sustainable growth in richer countries/more responsible consumption thus less
              energy – recognition of embedded energy.
           • Economic shocks (e.g. COVID, 2008 financial crash and conflict)/reduce economic
              activity in countries with developed economies.
                                             –8–                M23/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two reasons why wealthy people are less vulnerable to climate change.         [2+2]

      In each case, allow [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development/exemplification to
      explain why wealthy are less vulnerable.

      For example: Wealthy people can afford to live in areas which have better sea
      defences [1] so they are less vulnerable to sea level rise [1].

      Other possibilities include:
      • Houses of wealthy are built of sturdier materials/can withstand impacts of climate change
         induced flooding.
      • Can afford food or purchase food from elsewhere/can mitigate decrease in food supplies.
      • richer farmers can use irrigation/mitigate against the effects of drought.
      • have the education/skills/funds making migration possible/possible to move to areas
         where climate change less susceptible to the impacts.
      • can afford medicines to combat disease/reduce the impacts climate change induced
         medical issues e.g. malaria.
      • Wealthy people can afford insurance/reduces the level of loss of the individual.
      • Wealthy people have access to political power/can skew policies in favour of their
         protection.
      • Wealthy people are employed in jobs less affected by climate change/fewer are engaged
         in farming which is more vulnerable.
      • Wealthy people have access to education/provides awareness of the impacts of climate
         change which can then be avoided/mitigated.

3.   Global resource consumption and security

     (a)   (i)    Estimate the oil consumption of Japan, in million oil-equivalent tonnes,
                  in 2016.                                                                             [1]

                  Allow 150 to 200

           (ii)   Identify one country that consumes more oil than it produces.                        [1]

                  United States / India / China / Australia / Malaysia / UK

     (b)   Explain one reason why oil consumption per person over the last 20 years has:

           (i)    decreased in some high-income countries                                              [2]

           Award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development/exemplification to explain
           decrease.

           For example: Germany has adopted renewable sources of energy such as large scale
           solar/wind/biomass power [1] due to a desire to cut carbon emissions [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • awareness of environmental impact/people reduce use of transport by cars or use bikes
           • relative economic cost/means that people cannot afford to use oil
           • depletion of local reserves/access to oil is reduced
           • advancement of technology/efficiency of machinery has increased
           • global shift of industry/manufacturing has reduced in HICs
           • changes in transport e.g. electric vehicles/require less fossil fuel

           (ii)   increased in some middle-income countries.                                           [2]

            Award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for further development/exemplification to explain
           increase.

           For example: Growth of wealth of the middle class [1] leads to increased use
           of/demand for cars [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • industrialization of economy/increased use of machinery which requires power/fuel.
           • increased living standards/people use more devices that require electricity or fossil fuels.
           • urbanization/people in urban areas have greater access to transport

(c)   Explain one environmental impact and one economic impact of international
      flows of waste on receiving countries.                                                [2+2]

      Award [1] for the impact and [1] for development/exemplification that explains impact on
      receiving countries.

      Candidates may discuss a variety of types of waste including e-waste, and
      other types of consumer waste such as plastics and paper.

      Environmental impact

      For example: Water may become polluted [1] by heavy metals from dump sites [1]

      Other possibilities environmental impacts include:
      • Air pollution from gases escaping from waste tips/methane from decomposition or toxic
         gases from burning.
      • Soil pollution by leachates from waste/changing pH and heavy metal contamination.
      • Ocean pollution from plastics and other elements of waste/waste dumps eroded by rivers
         or wind.
      • Loss of biodiversity/dump sites destroy local ecosystems or water pollution kills wildlife in
         streams.

      Economic impact

      For example: Jobs are created [1] extracting precious metals from electronic components [1]

      Other possible economic impacts include:
      • Market for reused goods/e.g. clothes recovered from waste.
      • Source of raw materials/new goods can be made from recovered material.
      • Fuel for electricity generation/provides power for people and industry.
      • Foreign exchange/countries are paid to import waste.
      • Costs of cleaning up/removal of wastes or medical costs of treatment.

                                                    Section B

4.   (a)   (i)        Identify the extreme weather event in the Americas with the highest
                      economic cost in 2019.                                                               [1]

                      Wildfires/droughts/extreme temperatures

     (a)   (ii)       Identify the modal value, in billions, for the cost of floods in 2019.               [1]

                      $2.5 (billion).

     (b)   Suggest one reason for the trend in weather-related disasters between
           1980 and 2019.                                                                              [2]

           Award [1] for stating a valid reason for the increase that specifies a consequence of climate
           change (e.g. increased temperatures/humidity) and [1] for valid development relating to
           increased number of disasters per year.

           For example: Increasing due to global warming [1] due to rising temperatures causing more
           cyclones [1].

           Other possibilities include:

                  •    Increased water vapour in atmosphere [1] resulting energy increases the number of
                       intense storms [1]
                  •    Increased sea level [1] increased incidence of flooding in low lying areas [1]
                  •    Increased frequency of El Niño [1] more hurricanes in Pacific/more droughts in
                       Australia [1].

(c)   To what extent does the evidence in the infographic support the view that the
      impacts of climate change are uniform?                                                        [6]

      Award [1] for each valid point supported by evidence taken from the infographic,
      up to a maximum of [5].

      Award a maximum of [4] if only one side of the argument is given.

      Award the final [1] for an overall appraisal, which weighs up the points made in the answer
      relating to the infographic as a whole.

      Supporting:

      •   Storms occur on all continents.
      •   Floods occur in most areas.
      •   Climate threatens health of all settlements.
      •   Weather events produce similar diseases.
      •   Affects people of all ages/cultures

      Against:

      •   Reference to differences in population displaced by different extreme weather events
      •   Reference to differences in damage between extreme weather events
      •   Reference to differences in damage between world regions
      •   Reference to differences in the changes of number of climate related disasters over time
          e.g. fluctuating.

      Do not credit simple quoting of data from the resource – it needs to be given a context.

      For example: The information on the infographic supports the view as it shows that climate
      change effects all types of settlement [1]. It also shows that cyclones, typhoons and
      hurricanes have an economic impact across all the regions shown [1] However their overall
      cost is more than the other extreme weather events [1] at $55.2 million whilst floods only
      cost $43.6 million and wildfires etc costs $25 million [1 for contextual use of data]. There is
      also a difference in the number of internally displaced population caused by different events
      with floods and cyclones etc displacing the most people [1]. In my opinion the impacts of
      climate change are far from uniform and are instead unbalanced [1].

                                              Section C
5.   “The policies used to manage natural population change are more successful than those
     used to manage climate change.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?      [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):

     •   Responses should show knowledge and understanding of the reasons that population
         change needs to be managed and could refer to ageing societies, issues of population
         growth, issues of population decline, rapid growth of urban populations due to youthful
         populations etc. Answers should show knowledge and understanding of policies used
         to address issues of population change that could include control of birth rates (increase
         or decrease), government and societal policies used to address issues of an ageing
         population etc. Some answers may refer to policies that exploit the advantages of the
         demographic dividend.
     •   Responses should show knowledge and understanding of the effects of climate change
         that need to be managed and could refer to sea level change, extreme weather, changes
         to agriculture, health issues, migration and changing ocean transport routes. Answers
         should show knowledge and understanding of policies used to issues of climate change
         which could refer to government led strategies such as geopolitical treaties, carbon
         offset and trading, geo-engineering. Some answers may refer to corporate and individual
         strategies such as reduction of carbon footprints.
     •   Responses should show knowledge and understanding of the operation and level of
         success of the policies discussed.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation
     (AO3) which focuses on the relative success of the policies selected with reference to
     population change and climate change and may refer to the difficulty of controlling natural
     systems. Responses may focus on a comparison between policies used for population and
     climate change or may compare the success of policies within climate change and population
     change. Some comments may refer to the relative success introducing ideas of community
     risk and vulnerability. Other critical evaluation may refer to spatial variations in success such
     as a comparison of nations/regions and spatial variation in exposure to population and climate
     change. Some answers may comment on temporal variations of success.

     For 5–6 marks, expect a weakly-evidenced outlining of some of the policies (and their success)
     used to manage population and/or climate change.

     For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account, which includes:

     •   either a well-evidenced synthesis which links together several themes from the guide
         and acknowledges both sides of the argument
     •   or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
         and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both traits.

6.   “The most important factor influencing the water–food–energy nexus is climate change.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):

     •   Responses should show knowledge and understanding of the WFE nexus – nexus
         refers to connections and so candidates should display an understanding of the
         interactions between two or more elements whether they are dependent or
         interdependent. The WFE nexus therefore studies the connections between these three
         resource sectors whether they are harmonious or conflicting. Responses may outline
         how changes in one element of the nexus has an influence on one or both of the other
         elements.
     •   The geography guide gives some emphasis to the idea of resource security so responses
         may develop interactions in the form of impacts on resource security. Answers may give
         some development of these securities – water security is access to safe drinking water
         and sanitation, energy security is access to clean, reliable and affordable energy and
         food security is access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. Some candidates may
         discuss this in the context of sustainability.
     •   Responses should show a knowledge and understanding of the impacts of climate
         change on the WFE nexus. For instance, climate change may affect water availability
         and thus crop yields, increased drought may impact on water availability and thus the
         production of hydroelectricity. Some answers may address the idea that the influence is
         both ways and that elements of the nexus may impact on climate change – e.g. a green
         economy approach to resources may be used to manage climate change.
     •   Responses should show that other factors have an influence on the WFE nexus.
         Answers may address the links between population change and the nexus, technology
         and the nexus, changing diets and the nexus, changing economies and the nexus,
         environmental movements and the nexus, etc.

     Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation
     (AO3) which focuses on the relative importance of climate change on the WFE nexus. Some
     answers may address the idea that climate change has varying importance on different
     elements of the nexus. Responses may focus on a spatial approach and give an evaluation
     of the importance of climate change on the nexus in different regions/countries.

     For 5–6 marks, expect a weakly-evidenced outlining of some links between climate
     change/other factors and the WFE nexus

     For 7–8 marks, expect a well-structured account, which includes:

     •   either a well-evidenced synthesis which links together several themes from the guide
         and acknowledges different elements of the dialogue
     •   or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
         and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks, expect both traits.
