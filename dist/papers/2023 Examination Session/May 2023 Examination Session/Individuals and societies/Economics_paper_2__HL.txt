Answer one question.

1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Overview of Mexico

     1   Mexico, with its abundant natural resources, is the second largest economy in Latin America.
         However, compared to other Latin American countries, Mexico has underperformed. Its annual
         economic growth rate averaged 2.5 % between 1994 and 2019. Per capita income rose more
         slowly, at an average rate of less than 1 % annually.

     2   Government expenditure has been rising, while taxation revenue has been stable or falling.
         Therefore, there is concern about the increasing government debt. If there is a recession,
         automatic stabilizers will increase the budget deficit, further raising the level of government debt.
         However, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that government debt will stabilize in
         the mid-2020s, at around 65 % of gross domestic product (GDP).

     3   The oil sector makes an important contribution to Mexico’s economy. Earnings from this sector
         were about 30 % of total government revenue in 2019. However, as countries increase their use
         of alternative energy sources, the long-term trend of falling oil prices will probably continue.

     5   Since 1994, the exchange rate for the peso (Mexico’s currency) has been floating. In March
         2020, the rate changed from 18 pesos per United States (US) dollar to 25 pesos per US dollar.
         During 2020, the deficit on the balance of trade in goods continued to widen. However, by
         April 2021 the trade balance had changed to a surplus as exports of manufactured goods rose
         strongly. The deficit on the current account has also been narrowed by rising net remittances.

Text B — Free trade agreements

     1   The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a three-country accord negotiated by
         the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States that entered into force in January
         1994. NAFTA eliminated most tariffs on products traded between the three countries, with a
         major focus on liberalizing trade in agriculture, textiles, and automobile manufacturing. The
         deal also sought to protect intellectual property, establish dispute resolution mechanisms, and
         through side agreements, implement labor and environmental safeguards. Trade among the
         NAFTA members tripled over the following 25 years, partly due to trade disputes between the
         US and China.

     2   Following the establishment of NAFTA, productivity increased in Mexico. US and Canadian firms
         viewed Mexico as a low-cost location for factories, which could improve their competitiveness.
         Therefore, foreign direct investment (FDI) into Mexico grew significantly throughout the 1990s
         and early 2000s. In the industrial north of Mexico, high-tech manufacturing factories were
         established and wages increased. However, the agricultural south did not benefit from the FDI.
         Agricultural exports from Mexico did increase, but Mexican farmers, especially corn producers,
         faced competition from subsidized US agriculture.

(Question 1 continued)

   3   The wage differential between the US and Mexico was predicted to decrease significantly, but
       a large wage gap remains. NAFTA’s effect on employment has been mixed. Some workers
       became unemployed when their firms lost market share due to increased competition, while
       others gained from the creation of new market opportunities.

   4   In 2020, NAFTA was renegotiated as the US–Mexico–Canada Agreement, which kept
       elements of NAFTA, while adding provisions regarding digital trade and financial services.
       The requirement that a high proportion of the inputs used in exported goods must come from
       member countries may mean that the cheapest inputs cannot be used. There are also additional
       rules to protect the environment and support labour rights. For example, 40 % of the value of the
       components in each vehicle exported from Mexico must come from factories paying a wage of
       at least US$16 per hour. As a result, the incomes of Mexicans who find industrial employment
       are raised.

Text C — Access to banking and finance in rural areas

   1   The persistence of income inequality in Mexico is partly due to domestic factors, such
       as underdeveloped financial institutions and low productivity in the large informal sector.
       Improving access to banking and finance could significantly benefit low-income households
       and small firms.

   2   The Expanding Rural Finance Project aims to provide finance for women, young people, and
       small firms in rural areas where there are no commercial banks. Over 170 000 loans (averaging
       US$1850 per loan) were provided from 2016 to 2020. Among the recipients, 76 % lived in rural
       areas and 81 % were women.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Indonesia and palm oil production

     1   Indonesia is the largest economy in Southeast Asia and its gross domestic product (GDP) has
         grown strongly. The proportion of those living in absolute poverty in Indonesia decreased from
         37.4 % in 1999 to 2.7 % in 2019.

     2   The palm oil industry is a major contributor to the Indonesian economy, accounting for 4.5 %
         of GDP and providing employment for over three million Indonesians. Palm oil production is
         technologically simple and profit margins are large. As a low-cost producer, Indonesia produces
         over 50 % of the world’s output. Palm oil is the most widely used vegetable oil in the global
         market. It is an ingredient in many products (including foods, cosmetics, cleaning products and
         biofuel) and demand continues to increase.

     3   In 2015, despite a widening budget deficit, the Indonesian government began subsidizing
         biodiesel (a type of renewable fuel) made from palm oil to make it more price competitive with
         conventional diesel. The subsidies were aimed at reducing Indonesia’s dependence on fossil
         fuel imports and at increasing exports of high-value refined palm oil products.

     4   In Indonesia, 80 % of the palm oil produced is exported, contributing substantially to export
         revenue and to government tax revenue. However, palm oil prices are volatile, due to changes
         in supply, making planning difficult and causing fluctuations in the exchange rate. For example,
         studies show that, due to the low price elasticity of demand (PED) for primary commodities,
         an increase in the price of palm oil results in greater export revenue. Consequently, the rupiah
         (Indonesia’s currency) may appreciate.

     5   In 2019, the European Union (EU) decided to impose an 18 % tariff on imports of palm oil
         based biodiesel from Indonesia, partly due to concerns that palm oil production damages
         the environment. The EU also claimed the tariff was necessary to offset the effects of the
         biodiesel subsidy.

Text E — Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 and concerns about palm oil production
in Indonesia

     1   In the past, the Indonesian government supported the rapid growth of palm oil production in
         order to increase GDP and employment. This policy often resulted in an inefficient use of land
         and high carbon emissions, as a result of deforestation.

     2   Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 (responsible consumption and production) requires
         resources to be used more efficiently and sustainably through changes in production methods.
         Unsustainable use of Indonesia’s natural resources will probably reduce long-term economic
         growth. Forests are necessary for food security, fuel, shelter and jobs. They also reduce the
         carbon in the atmosphere and protect against floods.

     3   Rates of deforestation in Indonesia have decreased recently. The World Bank’s Forest Carbon
         Partnership Facility is providing US$110 million in aid to help reduce deforestation. Protecting
         forests from agricultural expansion will significantly reduce emissions. Profits will be lower,
         but the reputation of the palm oil industry will be improved and its long-term future made
         more secure.

     4  More than 50 multinational companies (MNCs) which use palm oil in their products have
        pledged to ensure that their suppliers do not contribute to deforestation. Pressure from the
        MNCs is encouraging Indonesian producers to use natural resources more sustainably.

(Question 2 continued)

Text F — Small-scale farmers and the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certificate

   1    Small-scale farmers manage approximately 40 % of Indonesian plantations, but produce only
        30 % of Indonesia’s palm oil, because of poor farming techniques, low quality seeds, and a
        weak banking system, which limits their access to finance. In addition, land disputes occur due
        to a lack of property rights. To make up for their low productivity, farmers sometimes illegally
        clear more land for planting.

   2    The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification system requires that palm oil
        producers only occupy land legally, that they do not plant in areas designated as forest, and that
        they use sustainable agricultural practices. Initially, only large plantations had to get certification.
        However, the system was extended in 2020 and now small-scale farmers also have to obtain
        certification. Participating in the system should improve the productivity of small-scale farmers
        and reduce deforestation.
