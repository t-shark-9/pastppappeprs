Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor
           • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands

              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
           • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well
              structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and
10–12
              relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
           • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

   1.     “Political authority in pre-Columbian societies depended on religious power.” With reference
          to two societies, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

          With reference to two societies, the question requires that candidates consider the merits or
          otherwise of the statement that political authority in pre-Columbian societies depended on
          religious power. Candidates may refer to the significance of religion in the acquisition and
          maintenance of political authority by pre-Columbian rulers arguing that legitimacy rested upon
          their shamanistic ability to communicate with the supernatural. Pre-Columbian religions, such
          as the Inca’s, also conceived rulers as embodiments of time, thus legitimizing authority in
          their exclusive control over calendrical knowledge. Other relevant factors that contributed to
          the maintenance of political power may be addressed, for example competitive sports as a
          catalyst for communal identities in Maya societies, or warfare as a means of suppressing
          internal rebellions, as in the case of the Aztecs, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
          Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
          evidence.

   2.     Evaluate the contributions made to scientific development and the arts by two indigenous
          societies in the Americas.

          The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions to scientific and
          artistic development, weighing up the strengths and limitations, in two indigenous societies.
          Contributions may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
          raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of developments in science and
          the arts, or they may prioritize their examination of one. However, both aspects will be a
          feature of the response. Candidates may refer to scientific developments that include Mayan
          architecture, astronomy and calendar-making; Inca cosmology; and Aztec botany. Candidates
          may also discuss extensive contributions to the visual arts given the lack of writing systems.
          Candidates may draw connections between the arts and scientific development, as the former
          allowed the recording of scientific knowledge, and scientific innovations further developed the
          arts. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the fact that we are not truly
          aware of the degree of scientific and artistic development achieved, as Spanish conquerors
          destroyed records, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
          conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                –5–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

   3.    To what extent was military superiority the main reason for the Spanish defeat of the Incas?

         The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
         military superiority was the main reason for the Spanish defeat of the Incas. Reasons may
         predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
         Candidates may refer to the tactical and psychological impact of steel weapons and armour,
         the impact of gunpowder, the use of the arquebus and cannon, the shock value of horses and
         the superior command decisions of Pizarro. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
         example the impact of ‘The War of the Two Brothers’ that had left the Inca Empire weak and
         disorganized, the devastation of diseases such as smallpox and measles introduced by the
         Spanish, and the lack of unified resistance by the indigenous peoples but with a focus on the
         issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
         supported by appropriate evidence.

   4.    “Assimilation was the main aim of the Spanish in the treatment of indigenous populations.” To
         what extent do you agree with this statement?

         The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
         assimilation was the main aim of the Spanish in the treatment of indigenous populations.
         Candidates may offer equal coverage of assimilation and alternative aims, or they may
         prioritize their assessment of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
         Candidates may refer to the view that Catholicism required the indigenous population to be
         treated humanely as the ‘children of God’ to be converted and assimilated; assimilation would
         enable Spain to better meet the shortage of labour, and the policy of assimilation reduced the
         need for a large garrison of security forces. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
         example the avarice of conquistadors encouraged labour practices which prioritized profits
         over human life leading to enslavement and premature mortality and the unintended
         consequence of European diseases caused death rates as high as 90% among the
         indigenous populations, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
         conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                –6–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

   5.    Evaluate the impact of the Bourbon reforms in Spanish America.

         The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Bourbon reforms in Spanish
         America, weighing up their successes and failures. Results of the reforms may extend
         beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
         Candidates may argue that the reforms were successful at countering the decline of Spanish
         power over the Empire but suggest that in the long-run reforms were insufficient and
         generated widespread unrest. Economically, candidates may argue that changes in tax
         collection and trade policy succeeded in raising revenue and overall production in Spanish
         America; but may also suggest that local industry suffered which led to greater inequality.
         Candidates may refer to social unrest generated by the reforms, as evidenced by increased
         rioting in the Andes region. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
         supported by appropriate evidence.

   6.    “The French and Indian Wars were mainly caused by economic competition.” To what extent
         do you agree with this statement?

         The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that the French
         and Indian Wars were mainly caused by economic competition. Causes may predate the
         timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
         refer to competition over access to the Ohio River Valley as the primary cause of the conflict
         since the area had a number of valuable resources, such as a very profitable fur-trading
         industry. They may also argue that conflict was caused by competition over essential
         transport corridors for goods that could enhance trade in the region. However, other relevant
         factors may be addressed, for example the strategic importance of the valley to facilitate
         continental expansion, or long-standing rivalries between Britain and France that contributed
         to the outbreak of conflict. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
         supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –7–                 M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

   7.     To what extent was the Catholic Church successful in achieving its aims in Spanish America
          in the 16th and 17th centuries?

          The question requires that candidates consider the extent in which the Catholic Church was
          successful in achieving its aims in Spanish America in the 16th and 17th centuries. Results
          may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the question. Candidates
          may evaluate the extent of success of churchmen and missions at civilizing and achieving the
          conversion of millions of natives to Catholicism. Candidates may also discuss the extent of
          Church success in expanding its political and economic power through Spanish America,
          referring to its control over land and commercial agriculture and its intervention in political
          decision taking. Candidates may challenge the assumptions that the Church was a monolithic
          institution, for example, religious orders had their own internal governance and hierarchy,
          thus pursuing different aims. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
          and supported by appropriate evidence.


   8.     Compare and contrast the role of the Catholic Church and religious orders in New France.

          The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences
          between the Catholic Church and religious orders, (Black Robes, Jesuits and Recollects), in
          terms of their religious roles in New France, referring to both throughout. There does not need
          to be an equal number of each. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the role played by
          the Church and the role of religious orders, or they may prioritize their discussion of either.
          However, both will be a feature of the response. For contrast, candidates may refer to the
          dominant role in colonial affairs played by the Catholic Church in New France, considering its
          social, political, economic, and religious authority. They may also discuss its extent of
          success as an institution that ensured social control, and yet acknowledge declining power
          over time. Additionally, candidates may argue that the religious orders sometimes altered the
          policies of the church to meet the unique demands of their local circumstances. For
          comparison, candidates may also refer to the specific role played by Catholic missions,
          including Black Robes, Récollects and Jesuits, in promotion of education, health and
          religious policies directed by the Catholic Church. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
          presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

   9.    Compare and contrast the living and working conditions of slaves in the British and Spanish
         colonies of the New World.

         The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences
         between living and working conditions in the British and Spanish colonies of the New World,
         referring to both throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. For
         comparison, candidates may refer to the fact that Spanish and British colonies both adhered
         to a policy of ‘chattel slavery’ in which slaves were considered the property of their owners,
         living and working conditions were determined by the economic incentives of the slave
         owners, and conditions in the British West Indies colonies differed marginally from those in
         Spanish colonies. For contrast, candidates may argue that slave populations in British North
         American colonies increased by natural reproduction while, due to much higher mortality,
         populations in Spanish colonies increased mostly by importation, and that Spanish colonies
         were more accepting of racial mixing and established a multi-tiered system which impacted
         living and working conditions depending on status. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
         be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   10.   "The main reason for opposition to slavery and the slave trade was the inhumane conditions.”
         Discuss.

         The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
         statement that the main reason for the opposition to slavery and the slave trade was the
         inhumane conditions. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to
         the issue raised in the question. Examples after 1800 are not relevant. Depending in part on
         the geographic area of focus, candidates may refer to the inhumane conditions of the ‘Middle
         Passage’, the separation of families, the poor quality of food and shelter and the life-
         shortening effects of forced labour in mines and on plantations. Candidates may also refer to
         opposition based on religious tenets, (for example de las Casas in Spanish colonies or the
         Quakers in British colonies). In the era of the American Revolution, opposition was often
         based on ideas of equality and personal liberty in the founding documents of the United
         States. Depending on time period and region, arguments were made that slavery was of
         declining economic viability and a poor use of human resources. Other relevant factors may
         be addressed, for example, concerns based on fears of violence associated with slave
         rebellions, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
         will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                –9–                  M23/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

   11.   “Internal factors were more important than external factors in causing the rise of
         independence movements.” Discuss with reference to one country of the Americas.

         The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
         statement that internal factors were more important than external factors in causing the rise of
         independence movements in one country of the Americas. Candidates may offer equal
         coverage of internal and external factors, or they may prioritize either. However, both will be a
         feature of the response. For internal factors, candidates may refer to social conflicts such as
         that between Peninsulares and Creoles in Spanish colonies or suppression of social and
         political equality in North America by the British government. The application of mercantilism
         and various trade restrictions on colonial economies may also be addressed as having both
         an internal and external component. Relevant external factors may be discussed, such as the
         impact of the Enlightenment movement and changing regime policies leading to foreign
         intervention as a cause of revolution, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
         Candidates' opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
         evidence.

   12.   Evaluate the impact of independence on two of the following social groups: indigenous
         peoples, African Americans, Creoles.

         The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of
         independence on two of the following social groups: indigenous peoples, African Americans
         and/or Creoles, weighing up positive and negative results. Results may extend beyond the
         timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the question. Candidates may offer equal
         coverage of both chosen groups or they may prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both
         aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how independence did not
         necessarily improve the status of indigenous peoples or African Americans, as they were not
         granted citizenship, they were often kept segregated, and indigenous land gradually came
         under attack. Still, they may also argue that after independence elites increasingly opened
         opportunities and granted greater freedom. As for the Creoles, candidates may argue that
         independence allowed them greater political and economic participation, but that this was
         affected by civil conflict that soon emerged. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
         presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

   13.    “The causes of the War of 1812 were mostly economic.” To what extent do you agree with
          this statement?

          The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
          the causes of the War of 1812 were mostly economic. Candidates may offer equal coverage
          of economic and alternative causes, or they may prioritize their assessment of economic
          causes. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. For economic causes,
          candidates may refer to British impressment of US sailors that harmed US trade, British
          seizure of US ships and cargoes during the Napoleonic Wars and the territorial expansion
          motives of US Congressional ‘War Hawks’. Alternative causes may include the death of US
          settlers resulting from British support for Native American rebellions in the Northwest Territory
          and affronts to US sovereignty as illustrated by the Chesapeake-Leopard incident.
          Furthermore, the pro-French and anti-British leanings of the Jeffersonian party may be
          addressed but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
          will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   14.    Evaluate the effectiveness of the British North America Act of 1867.

          The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the British North America Act of
          1867, weighing up the extent of its effectiveness. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
          effectiveness and ineffectiveness, or they may prioritize their evaluation of either. However,
          both aspects will be a feature of the response. For effectiveness, candidates may refer to the
          uniting of three separate territories into a single dominion thus establishing Canada as a
          largely self-governing federation, the establishment of a constitution that would remain in
          effect until 1982 and the distribution of powers between central and provincial governments.
          For limitations, candidates may refer to the absence of a process for amending the
          constitution. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the provision that social
          services were the responsibility of provincial government thus inhibiting a consistent and
          uniform delivery system, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
          conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

   15.    “Political issues between 1850 and 1860 were the main cause of the US Civil War.” Discuss.

          The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
          statement that political issues between 1850 and 1860 were the main cause of the US Civil
          War. Causes may predate the time frame but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
          the question. Candidates may refer to the balance of power conflict between slave and free
          states illustrated by the Compromise of 1850 and Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), Northern
          concerns that the Dred Scott decision would allow the expansion of the South’s political
          power and the South’s concerns that the rise of the Republican party and Lincoln’s election
          (1860) would cause their interests to be ignored. Candidates may address other causes such
          as the rise of radical abolitionism and the violence associated with events such as John
          Brown’s raid at Harpers Ferry. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the
          South’s conclusion that its economy depended on the expansion of slavery, but with a focus
          on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
          and supported by appropriate evidence.


   16.    Discuss the view that Union strength, rather than Confederate weakness, was the main
          reason for the Union victory.

          The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
          Union strength, rather than Confederate weakness was the main reason for the Union victory.
          Candidates may offer equal coverage of Union strength and Confederate weakness, or they
          may prioritize their discussion of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
          response. Candidates’ may refer to the Union’s centralized government providing a more
          efficient response, the military advantages associated with the Union population doubling that
          of the South and the ability of the North’s industrial economy to provide munitions, rail
          transport and naval expansion. Examples of Confederate weakness may include the failure to
          gain foreign intervention, economic decline due to inability to export cotton, lack of an
          integrated rail network, and the limited industrial capacity to produce munitions. Other
          relevant factors may be addressed, for example the impact of Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation
          Proclamation, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
          conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

   17.   Examine the impact of immigration on the development of two countries in the Americas.

         The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between immigration and
         the development of two countries in the Americas. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe
         but must be clearly linked to the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both case-
         studies or may prioritize one. However, both will be featured. Candidates may examine
         immigration’s impact on urbanization, industrialization and rural production, and immigrants’
         political, cultural and religious contributions. Candidates may also examine the negative
         interrelationship between immigration and development, arguing that immigration meant
         strain on towns, cities and jobs. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
         and supported by appropriate evidence.


   18.   “The role of women had changed significantly by 1929.” Discuss with reference
         to two countries of the Americas.

         The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
         statement that the role of women had changed significantly by 1929 in two countries of the
         Americas. Candidates may refer to a changing female role in labor, which in Latin America
         began in the 1880s with the establishment of large numbers of schools and which expanded
         in North America during the First World War. Candidates may also refer to a changing
         political and social role, as female intellectuals fought for independence in Cuba, for
         revolutionary change in Mexico, and for political and social reform in Argentina, Uruguay, and
         Brazil, while attaining suffrage rights in the U.S and Canada. Candidates may, nevertheless,
         point to the limited significance of such changes, as the state, family and church were still
         dominant institutions that maintained patriarchal power relations; or argue that changes
         brought by the First World War were soon reversed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
         be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

   19.    Discuss the view that economic factors were the main reason for the expansionist foreign
          policies of the US.

          The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
          economic factors were the main reason for the expansionist foreign policies of the US.
          Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
          question. Candidates may refer to the view that application of the Monroe Doctrine to Latin
          America could allow the US to dominate the economy of the Americas region, post-Civil War
          industrial growth exceeded US potential for consumption and the US had to compete with
          other world powers for raw materials and markets. Candidates may also argue that the
          Republican party aligned itself with the interests of industrial plutocrats. Other relevant factors
          may be addressed, for example the impact of Alfred Mahan’s advocacy for US naval
          dominance, Social Darwinism supported expansionism and was the dominant ideology of the
          era and Protestant denominations sought missionary opportunities abroad, but with a focus
          on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
          and supported by appropriate evidence.

   20.    “President Wilson’s peace ideals were the main reason why the US did not ratify the Treaty of
          Versailles.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

          The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
          President Wilson’s peace ideals were the main reason why the US did not ratify the Treaty of
          Versailles. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
          raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the view that the peace ideals in the Fourteen
          Points appeared unrealistic as Americans became aware of the carnage of the First World
          War, that the plan for US leadership in the League of Nations violated US principles of non-
          entanglement in Europe, and that European interests were dominated by desires for revenge
          rather than peace. Candidates may also argue that Wilson failed to engage Republicans in
          the negotiations and his ‘October Appeal’ was viewed as hyper-partisan. Other relevant
          factors may be addressed, for example Wilson’s unwillingness to compromise, the impact of
          Wilson’s physical exhaustion and subsequent stroke on his public appeal for support, but with
          a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
          clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

   21.   To what extent did the 1917 Constitution address the aims of the Revolution?

         The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which the 1917 Mexican
         Constitution addressed the aims of the Revolution. Candidates may refer to the liberal
         provisions of the constitution, which called for federalism, separation of powers, and a bill of
         rights, the separation of church and state, and universal male suffrage, and examine if these
         responded to Madero’s Plan of San Luis Potosi or Carranza’s Plan of Guadalupe; or if these
         simply reworded the 1857 Constitution. Candidates may also examine provisions on labour
         established by Article 123 and provisions on private property established by Article 27 to
         assess if these responded to the social and economic revolutionary aims of Zapata and Villa.
         Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example the need for national
         pacification as a determinant for constitutional provisions. Candidates’ opinions or
         conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   22.   To what extent was Obregón successful in addressing the challenges he faced?

         The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which Obregón was successful
         in addressing the challenges he faced. Results of Obregon’s policies may extend beyond the
         timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
         offer equal coverage of successes and failures, or they may prioritize their assessment of
         one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
         use of force and political incentives to address on-going violence. They may also evaluate the
         extent to which his policies of land reform, labour relations, education and culture successfully
         addressed society’s social demands and the 1917 constitutional provisions. Candidates may
         also assess if Obregon’s economic policies were successful at achieving economic
         rehabilitation and international recognition for the Revolution. Candidates’ opinions or
         conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

   23.   Evaluate the effectiveness of President Hoover’s response to the Great Depression.

         The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of President
         Hoover ‘s response to the Great Depression, weighing up its strengths and limitations or
         otherwise. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
         issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate Hoover’s ideology of limited
         government and rugged individualism, his initial call for volunteer efforts by business and
         charity to address unemployment and his use of force to evict the ‘Bonus Army’ from
         Washington D.C. Candidates may also evaluate Hoover’s support for the Agricultural
         Marketing Act, tax cuts to stimulate spending and creation of the Reconstruction Finance
         Corporation to bail out banks and insurance companies as efforts to address some of the
         depression conditions. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example his continued
         opposition to direct relief, even food handouts, as harmful to the character of those suffering
         from hardship, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
         conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   24.   “Mackenzie King was more successful than RB Bennett in his response to the Great
         Depression.” Discuss.

         The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
         statement that Mackenzie King was more successful than RB Bennett in his response to the
         Great Depression. Candidates may offer equal coverage of King and Bennett or they may
         prioritize their coverage of either. However, both will be a feature of the response. Candidates
         may refer to King’s initial view that provinces, not the central government, were responsible
         for addressing citizen’s needs. During King’s second term, starting in 1935, he increased
         spending for relief, subsidized housing and supported a more interventionist role for the
         central government. For Bennett, (1930-35), it may be argued that he attempted to apply
         ‘New Deal’ legislation, (though much was rejected by the courts), and his image was badly
         tarnished by the response to the ‘On to Ottawa Trek’. Other relevant factors may be
         addressed, for example that neither leader was very successful and it was the Second World
         War which extricated Canada from the Great Depression, but with a focus on the issue in the
         question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported with
         appropriate evidence.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

   25.   “Inter-American diplomacy between 1933 and 1945 was largely a failure.” To what extent do
         you agree with this statement?

         The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
         inter-American diplomacy between 1933 and 1945 was largely a failure. For success,
         candidates may refer to the US pledge of non-intervention made at the Montevideo
         Conference (1933), the removal of troops from Haiti and the annulment of the Platt
         Amendment, the negotiated settlement in response to Mexico’s nationalization of US oil
         fields, the advancement of collective security outlined by the Declaration of Lima (1938),
         Mexico and Brazil sending troops to combat zones and Mexico helping to meet US labour
         needs (Bracero program). Examples of failure may include the argument that the US did little
         to help Latin America recover from the Great Depression, US support for Pan-Americanism
         was motivated predominantly by US efforts to win the Second World War, and the successes
         were transitory given the dominance of Cold War issues after 1945. Candidates’ opinions or
         conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   26.   Evaluate the impact of conscription on the US and Canada during the Second World War.

         The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of conscription during
         the Second World War, weighing up its positive and negative effects or otherwise. Candidates
         may refer to the precedent of the US instituting its first peace-time draft, substantial
         opposition in the US House of Representatives where conscription passed by a margin of one
         vote, and the initial racist exclusion of African-Americans (though a quota system was
         adopted in 1943). For Canada, candidates may address Mackenzie King’s initial promise to
         prevent conscription to avoid the disunity experienced in the First World War, the 1940
         National Resources Mobilization Act allowing a draft for home service jobs only, and the 1942
         plebiscite where 65% of Canadians approved unrestricted conscription. Other relevant factors
         may be addressed, for example the impact of conscription upon the role of women and
         minorities in the economy, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions
         or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

   27.    Compare and contrast the economic policies of two populist leaders in Latin America.

          The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences
          between two populist leaders in Latin America in terms of economic policy, referring to both
          throughout. Reasons for the application of economic policy or their economic effects may
          predate or extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
          the question. Popular case studies may include Castro, Peron, or Vargas (post-1945), among
          others. Candidates may restrict their analysis to one economic period of a populist leader, for
          example, the economic policies of Peron’s first presidency, or extend their analysis beyond
          one period. Candidates may compare and contrast economic policy in terms of pursued aims,
          including self-sufficiency, industrial promotion or social justice; in terms of enacted methods,
          including ISI or land redistribution; or in terms of results achieved, considering agricultural
          and/or industrial output, indexes of social or economic integration, or GNP or GDP to
          compare overall economic growth. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
          clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   28.    Evaluate the economic and social impact of a military dictatorship in one country.

          The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic and social impact
          of a military dictatorship in one country, weighing up its successes and failures. Results may
          extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
          question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic impact, or they may
          prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
          Popular case studies may include military governments in Brazil after 1964, Uruguay and
          Chile after 1973, and Argentina after 1976. Candidates may argue military dictatorships often
          relied on external borrowing, which demanded a liberal approach including structural
          adjustments and privatizations and assess the economic and social impact of such approach.
          Candidates may also assess the social impact of political restrictions and violence, including
          limitations to female participation and human rights’ violations. Candidates’ opinions or
          conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

   29.    Examine the impact of internal conflicts within the Democratic and Republican parties on
          elections in the 1960s and 1970s.

          The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between internal conflicts
          within the Democratic and Republican parties and the impact on elections in the 1960s and
          1970s. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the Democratic and Republican parties or
          they may prioritize either. However, both will be a feature of the response. For the Democratic
          party, candidates may examine John Kennedy’s loss of southern support due to his
          Catholicism and advocacy of civil rights, which nearly led to his defeat in 1960; Lyndon B
          Johnson’s ‘Great Society’ programs triggering white flight into the Republican party (causing
          Democratic losses in the 1966 Congressional elections) and George Wallace’s exit from the
          Democratic Party to run as an independent on a segregation platform, which may have
          caused the Democrats to lose the 1968 Presidential election. For the Republican party,
          candidates may examine Barry Goldwater’s opposition to the civil rights movement, causing
          some African Americans to leave the party of Lincoln and contributing to his landslide defeat,
          and conflict over Richard Nixon’s progressive environmental legislation and overtures to
          China costing him some decline in Congressional elections. Other relevant interrelationships
          may be considered, for example the emergence of cultural issues such as abortion, but with a
          focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
          clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   30.    “The rise of Quebec nationalism was the main cause of the October Crisis of 1970.” Discuss.

          The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
          statement that the rise of Quebec nationalism was the main cause of the October Crisis of
          1970. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised
          in the question.
          Candidates may refer to the view that Quebec nationalism was rooted in the effects of
          industrialization, urbanization, disparities of wealth and social grievances and the actions of
          the Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ) which were influenced by anti-colonial movements
          in Algeria and Cuba. They may argue that the FLQ sought to achieve both the release of
          imprisoned FLQ members and achieve Quebec independence by their kidnapping of
          Canadian and British officials. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the view
          that the ‘actual’ Crisis of 1970 was Trudeau’s violation of civil liberties and the Canadian
          constitution through application of the War Measures Act, but with a focus on the issue in the
          question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported with
          appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

   31.   Evaluate the impact of Truman’s containment policies within the Americas between 1947 and
         1953.

         The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Truman’s
         containment policies within the Americas, weighing up their strengths and limitations.
         Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
         raised in the question. Candidates may argue that Truman’s containment policies
         strengthened hemispheric solidarity, referring to the Act of Chapultepec, the Rio Pact and the
         consolidation of the Organization of American States (OAS). They may also evaluate the
         impact of Truman’s military approach towards the region, strengthening Latin American
         armed forces through bilateral agreements but failing to address development through
         economic plans. Candidates may refer to adherence within the region to U.S. broader
         containment policies, including Canada’s inclusion in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
         (NATO) and Colombian participation in the Korean War. Other relevant factors may be
         addressed, for example the abolition of the Western Hemisphere Defence Program, but with
         a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
         clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   32.   To what extent was Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress successful?

         The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which Kennedy’s Alliance for
         Progress was successful. Results may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
         linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of successes
         and failures, or they may prioritize their treatment of one. However, both aspects will be a
         feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the programme’s extent of success at
         achieving the targeted 2.5% GDP growth across the continent, creating a Latin American free
         trade area to facilitate the flow of goods and capital, and promoting land reform. They may
         also evaluate the program’s extent of success at promoting democracy and social reform,
         including the reduction of adult illiteracy, advancement of housing and health programmes,
         and enactment of labor reforms. It may also be argued that the programme was largely a
         failure due to the minimal extent of land reform achieved and the replacement, during the
         1960s, of many constitutional governments by military dictatorships. Candidates’ opinions or
         conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

   33.    Discuss the extent of the impact that radical African American activism had on the civil rights
          movement.

           The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the extent
          to which radical African American activism impacted the civil rights movement. Candidates
          may refer to concern among white moderates that radicalism and violence might dominate
          the civil rights movement unless reforms were instituted, the success of radicals in
          galvanizing support among the urban poor, the impact on Martin Luther King Jr. causing him
          to oppose the Vietnam War and address social justice issues in the North and backlash
          against the Black Panther movement which led to tactics of violent repression by police.
          Relevant limitations may also be addressed, for example the ‘Black Nationalism’ of Malcolm X
          and the ‘Black Power’ movement of Stokely Carmichael were interpreted as radical and led to
          repression by white authorities, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
          opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

   34.    To what extent did the counter-culture movement of the 1960s and 1970s change society in
          the Americas?

          The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which the counter-culture
          movement of the 1960s and 1970s changed society in the Americas. Consequences may
          extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
          question. Candidates may refer to the ideals of free speech, social equality, world peace, anti-
          materialism, sexual freedom and non-conformity, among others. The movement contributed
          to the anti-Vietnam War movement, civil rights movement (for African Americans and
          indigenous peoples), women’s rights movement, and communal living experiments. Evidence
          of the counter-culture movement was also seen in new forms of music and fashion which
          became prime exports from the US to the rest of the Americas. In Latin America the counter-
          culture movement contributed to the rise of the ‘New Left’ which focused on the rejection of
          US capitalism and imperialism. Relevant limitations may also be addressed, for example the
          creation of a ‘generation gap’ and the backlash against the counter-culture movement that led
          to a resurgence of conservatism in the US during the 1980s, but with a focus on the issue in
          the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
          appropriate evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

   35.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of Presidents GHW Bush and Clinton.

         The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences
         between Presidents GHW Bush and Clinton in terms of foreign policies, referring to both
         throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. Reasons for the
         implementation of foreign policy and their results may predate or extend beyond the
         timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
         refer to the fact that both administrations acted to remove tyrannical regimes from power;
         argue that both worked towards non-proliferation; or suggest that the foreign policies of both
         Bush and Clinton improved relations with Russia and China. As for differences, candidates
         may argue that Clinton was a strong believer in multilateralism while Bush’s foreign policy
         actions evidence greater unilateralism, with the exception of US intervention in the Middle
         East. They may also point to Bush’s maintenance of improved U.S.-Sino relations with limited
         intervention; while Clinton’s early China policy pursued greater coercion. Candidates’
         opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


   36.   To what extent did two Latin American countries achieve justice and reconciliation
         after their transition to democracy?

         The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which two Latin
         American countries achieved justice and reconciliation after their transition to democracy.
         Policy results may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
         raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of policies that aimed at justice
         and those that aimed at reconciliation, or they may prioritize their assessment of one.
         However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Popular case studies may include
         justice processes in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, among
         others. Candidates may debate the degree upon which justice was achieved through judicial
         procedures that allowed for the conviction of perpetrators. Candidates may also debate the
         degree to which reconciliation was achieved following state-led investigative processes and
         truth commissions; or assess if the provision of victim reparation contributed to the
         achievement of justice and reconciliation. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
         presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
