Write a guided analysis of the following text.

1.    This is an excerpt from Angry Alan, a play by Penelope Skinner.


                                                          I.

                                                 Where It All Begins…

                  ROGER talks to the audience.

                     Do you ever do that thing where you think to yourself
                     I should really go for a run
                     so you look out the window
             5      but hmm. That sky looks kind of ominous. Doesn’t it? So
                  you pick up your phone to check the weather
                     see if it’s going to rain
                      but when you look at your phone you’ve got a message or
                  an email so you open the message or the email and it contains
            10    like
                     a link to an article or whatever so you click on it and you
                  read it and it’s interesting enough to keep you reading to the
                  end so you read to the end and then at the bottom of the page
                  you see another link and this one is like
            15       ‘You’re not gonna believe what they found when they cut
                  open this giant snake,’ and you’re like well okay that I’ve gotta
                  read so you read it and then next to that article is a photograph
                  of a celebrity on the beach that you need to take a closer look
                  at so you do and so on and so on and eventually
            20       you realize time has sort of
                     and it’s forty minutes later and you put your phone down
                  and wonder what you were doing and remember you were
                  going to go for a run but when you look outside it’s raining so
                    why am I telling you that? Oh right. Because that is
            25    exactly how I first find Alan. Which when I think about it
                     is where it all begins. It’s Monday morning and just to
                  provide you with some context
                     on this particular Monday morning
                     things are what I would consider to be
            30      normal. Not the old normal. The old normal is long gone.
                  On a Monday morning
                                          –3–                                          2223 – 0046


           Roger-from-before would be getting in his fancy car and
         heading into the office. But what you’re looking at here is
         Roger-Now. And Roger-Now is the third assistant store
    35   manager in the Walnut Creek Safeway and he doesn’t work
         Mondays and if you’re wondering what the third assistant store
         manager does
            you know when you have to bring something back to the
         store and you’re complaining to the checker? And she’s not
    40   dealing with your complaint to your satisfaction so you say,
             ‘I’d like to see the manager’? The guy who comes along at
         that point? It’s not the actual store manager just so you know.
         His name is Tim and he’s sitting up in his fancy glass office on
         the second floor. We actually went to high school together
    45   which is how I got this job. But that’s a whole nother story.
         Point is you don’t need to worry about Tim because you never
         meet Tim. See? But me? Sure. I’m the guy who comes to help.
         I’m not in a suit I’m in a shirt and tie and I’ve got a badge
         and it says my name is Roger and I’m happy to help. And
    50   apparently it also says: I’m a guy you can yell at. Sometimes
         if you’re mad enough you can threaten me with physical
         violence. But I’ll just offer you a refund and tell you I’m very
         sorry and I hope you’ll continue to choose Safeway for all your
         shopping needs. Because that’s store policy and I know better
    55   than to go up against store policy. Where am I going with this?
         Oh right. I’m at the beginning. And it’s Monday morning.


–   How is the monologue used to reveal the character of Roger?

Write a guided analysis of the following text.

2.        This is an excerpt from “A Dreamer”, a short story by Barbara Baynton.


          A swirl of wet leaves from the night-hidden trees decorating the little station beat against the closed
          doors of the carriages. The porter hurried along holding his blear-eyed lantern to the different
          windows, and calling the name of the township in language peculiar to porters. There was only one
          ticket to collect.
    5            Passengers from far up-country towns have importance from their rarity. He turned his
          lantern full on this one, as he took her ticket. She looked at him too, and listened to the sound of
          his voice, as he spoke to the guard. Once she had known every hand at the station. The porter
          knew everyone in the district. This traveller was a stranger to him.
                 If her letter had been received, someone would have been waiting with a buggy. She passed
10        through the station. She saw nothing but an ownerless dog, huddled, wet and shivering, in a
          corner. More for sound she turned to look up the straggling street of the township. Among the
          sheoaks1, bordering the river she knew so well, the wind made ghostly music, unheeded by the
          sleeping town. There was no other sound, and she turned to the dog with a feeling of kinship. But
          perhaps the porter had a message! She went back to the platform. He was locking the office door,
15        but paused as though expecting her to speak.
                 “Wet night!” he said at length, breaking the silence. Her question resolved itself into a request
          for the time, though this she already knew. She hastily left him.
                 She drew her cloak tightly round her. The wind made her umbrella useless for shelter. Wind
          and rain and darkness lay before her on the walk of three bush miles to her mother’s home. Still it
20        was the home of her girlhood, and she knew every inch of the way.
                 As she passed along the sleeping street, she saw no sign of life till near the end. A light
          burned in a small shop, and the sound of swift tapping came to her. They work late tonight, she
          thought, and, remembering their gruesome task, hesitated, half-minded to ask these night workers,
          for whom they laboured. Was it someone she had known? The long dark walk—she could not—
25        and hastened to lose the sound.
                 The zigzag course of the railway brought the train again near to her, and this wayfarer2 stood
          and watched it tunnelling in the teeth of the wind. Whoof! whoof! its steaming breath hissed at her.
          She saw the rain spitting viciously at its red mouth. Its speed, as it passed, made her realize the
          tedious difficulties of her journey, and she quickened her pace. There was the silent tenseness that
30        precedes a storm. From the branch of a tree overhead she heard a watchful mother-bird’s warning
          call, and the twitter of the disturbed nestlings. The tender care of this bird-mother awoke memories
          of her childhood. What mattered the lonely darkness, when it led to mother. Her forebodings
          fled, and she faced the old track unheedingly, and ever and ever she smiled, as she foretasted
          their meeting.
35               “Daughter!”
                 “Mother!”
                 She could feel loving arms around her, and a mother’s sacred kisses.

          –     How does the setting create a sense of mystery and suspense?
