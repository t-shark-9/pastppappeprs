Write a guided analysis of the following text.

1.    The following transcript is from the podcast, The Happiness Lab, hosted by Dr Laurie Santos,
      professor of psychology at Yale University.




      [00:16:09]
      SANTOS: This is my friend Jamil Zaki, a professor of psychology at Stanford University. Jamil
      Zaki has just written an important new book called The War for Kindness: Building Empathy in a
      Fractured World.

 5    [00:16:19]
      ZAKI: I started writing it in 2015 and I don’t know, around late 2016, early 2017, I can’t quite put
      my finger on what it was, but something changed in our in our culture. I felt like things were getting
      crueler and less connected, and people were getting really exhausted trying to connect with each
      other and were really embracing social division in a way that I hadn’t seen in my adult life. I felt like
10    I was being a Pollyanna2 just writing this kind of positive, hey, you know, you can choose empathy,
      when all around me it seemed like this giant tire fire—people just hated each other more than ever.

      [00:17:01]
      SANTOS: If you’ve paid any attention to the news in the last few years, you understand that Jamil’s
      war for kindness is becoming more and more of an uphill battle. A growing body of work shows
15    that our empathy in general seems to be decreasing over time. In one study, in 1979, the average
      American scored like a 4 out of 5 on an empathy scale, which doesn’t sound terrible. But by 2009,
      the average American had dropped down to a 3.5 out of 5. This rising level of disconnection means
      that more and more of us are missing out on a potential boost to our well-being.

      [00:18:42]
20    ZAKI: It’s surprising to a lot of people that empathy is good for us. We typically think of empathy
      almost like a transfer, like I give up my money or time or emotional peace in order to help you have
      more of it. It’s sort of the quintessential act of self-sacrifice. It turns out, though, that the data point
      almost exactly in the opposite direction, that caring for others is one of the most important ways we
      can care for ourselves.

25    People who experience a lot of empathy also tend to be happier, less stressed, and experience
      less depression. They find it easier to make new friends and to maintain important relationships
      like their marriages. Seventh graders who are able to understand what others feel are also better
      able to survive seventh grade, which is not easy.
                                                   –3–                                           2223 – 2013


       [00:23:22]
30     SANTOS: It turns out that, in fact, empathy is like a skill and there are lots of things that we
       can do to cultivate empathy in ourselves and others. When Jamil taught his “Becoming Kinder”
       class at Stanford, he gave his students a super hard assignment, an empathy challenge that
       demonstrated this.

       [00:23:45]
35     ZAKI: I told my students, instead of yelling at each other, judging each other, or even debating,
       I want you to try to cultivate curiosity about each other. Ask the other person how they came to
       have their opinion in the first place and share with them the story of how you came to have your
       opinion in the first place. Students then embarked on hard conversations with racist Facebook-
       posting uncles and frank discussions about sexuality with their less-than-progressive parents.
40     They predicted that these exchanges would end in frustration or even tears. But in nearly all cases,
       those story-sharing conversations went better than expected.

       When you start with narratives, instead of either calling people out or saying how wrong they are,
       you get to a new type of discussion right away, one in which it actually doesn’t matter as much if
       you would agree on every point. But something just as important or maybe even more important
45     also happens, which is that you grow to appreciate the people you disagree with. No one should
       feel like they’re obligated to connect with or empathize with somebody who’s saying awful things.
       No one has to do this. It’s not anybody’s job. But when we do, it’s remarkable how powerful that
       can be, because sometimes what you realize is that people on the other side are also waiting for a
       chance to be human.
