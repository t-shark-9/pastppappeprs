Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page. Full
marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be supported
by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported
by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part
of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided
this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     A large international sports tournament tests their athletes for banned substances.
     They interpret a positive test result as meaning that the athlete uses banned substances.
     A negative result means that they do not.

     The probability that an athlete uses banned substances is estimated to be 0.06 .

     If an athlete uses banned substances, the probability that they will test positive is 0.71 .

     If an athlete does not use banned substances, the probability that they will test negative is 0.98 .
