Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     The three countries of Belgium, Germany and The Netherlands meet at a single point
     called Vaalserberg.

     To support future transport planning, a 10 km circle was drawn around Vaalserberg on a map.
     A study was carried out over five years to determine what percentage of people living in
     each of these countries (within the 10 km circular region) either stayed in their own country
     or moved to another country within the circle.

     From this study, the following movements were observed during the five years.
     y From Belgium, 5 % moved to Germany, and 0.5 % moved to The Netherlands.
     y From Germany, 2 % moved to The Netherlands, and 1.5 % moved to Belgium.
     y From The Netherlands, 3 % moved to Germany, and 2 % moved to Belgium.

     All additional population changes within the circular region may be ignored.

     (a)   Represent the above information in a transition matrix T .                                 [3]

     At the end of the study, the population of the Belgian side was 26 000, the population of the
     German side was 240 000, and the population of The Netherlands side was 50 000.

     (b)   By using T , find the expected population of the German side of Vaalserberg 30 years
           after the end of the study.                                                                 [4]

     The gardener in a local park suggested that the number of snails found in the park can be
     modelled by a Poisson distribution.




     (a)   Suggest two observations that the gardener may have made that led him to suggest
           this model.                                                                                    [2]

     Now assume that the model is valid and that the mean number of snails per m2 is 0.2.
     The gardener inspects, at random, a 12 m2 area of the park.

     (b)   Find the probability that the gardener finds exactly four snails.                              [3]

     (c)   Find the probability that the gardener finds fewer than three snails.                          [2]

     (d)   Find the probability that, in three consecutive inspections, the gardener finds at least
           one snail per inspection.                                                                      [3]

     Following heavy rain overnight, the gardener wished to determine whether the number of
     snails found in a random 12 m2 area of the park had increased.

     (e)   State the hypotheses for the test.                                                             [2]

     (f)   Find the critical region for the test at the 1 % significance level.                           [3]

     (g)   Given that the mean number of snails per m2 has actually risen to 0.75, find the
           probability that the gardener makes a Type II error.                                           [3]

      A biologist suggests that the rates of change of the population of fruit flies (after time t ≥ 0 )
      in a particular ecosystem are given by the following equations, where x is the population of
      male fruit flies and y is the population of female fruit flies.
