            • juxtaposition of urbanus & urbicus highlighting that Caecilius is a city-dweller,
               but in no way refined/cultured
            • litotes (non optimus) to emphasize Caecilius is the worst type of poet
            • enjambment (fractis/ permutat); breaking up of the idea across the lines
               mirroring the notion of broken glass
            • repetition (quod/ quod/quod/quare/ qui) to lend momentum to the attacks
            • tricolon (quod custos…quod viles…quod fumantia OR quod…poeta,
               quod…magister, quod bucca…) to lend momentum/emphasis to the attacks
            • metaphor (salibus, habere nasum) for wit, underlining the poet’s cleverness in
               attacking Caecilius with his sharp wit
            • polyptoton (videri…videris) emphasizes that Caecilius’ good qualities are
               completely imagined
            • repetition (tibi videri/ tibi…tibi videris) emphasizes that Caecilius’ good qualities
               are completely imagined.
            • Rhetorical question/hypophora (Quid ergo?) emphasizes Caecilius self-
               ignorance
            • Hyperbole (custos dominusque viperarum) emphasizes Martial’s judgment of
               Caecilius by describing him as a master of vipers.
            • Analogy (quod non optimus urbicus poeta or others) emphasizes Martial’s
               attacks on Caecilius by comparing him to undesirable people.
