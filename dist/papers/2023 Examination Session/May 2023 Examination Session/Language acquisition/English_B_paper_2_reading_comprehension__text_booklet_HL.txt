                               Top Future Transport Innovations
         A recent report released by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) identified a critical need
         for improvement of the nation’s transportation system. While the DOT has begun accelerating
         the improvement of the country’s highways and bridges, new forms of transit are being
         developed and will most likely be implemented soon.

    5    These five innovations will revolutionize transportation in the near future.

          1. Hyperloop transportation systems
             Hyperloops are essentially transportation tubes where pods of passengers or freight pass
             through a pressurized track at high speeds. Hyperloops run at an average of 600 miles
             per hour. There are several companies currently working to advance the technology. One
  10         company hopes to launch its first passenger service in the next year or two.

          2. Self-driving electric buses
             Automated city buses and shuttles will be in operation in the near future. Autonomous
             vehicles use cameras, radars and GPS systems to recognize and communicate with traffic
             lights and have impressive safety records. These buses of the future will reduce the impact
  15         on the environment because they are electric. Such buses are already in operation in
             China and Germany, and are being tested in the US.

          3. Elevated buses
             While automated buses are being developed worldwide, China is working on a bus system
             that will reduce traffic congestion. The bus “straddles” traffic by running on special tracks
  20         that allow regular vehicles to drive underneath. A system currently being designed in China
             is expected to reduce traffic congestion by thirty percent.

          4. Flying hotel pods
             A fleet of flying hotels is being designed by a company in Canada. Driftscape is a mobile,
             self-sustaining hotel that uses drone technology. Driftscape allows guests to travel while
  25         sleeping, and to roam or to touch down in diverse locations. It consists of several modular
             units including food and beverage elements. Driftscape offers spectacular panoramas and
             has minimal impact on the environment, preserving the integrity and authenticity of the
             locations visited.

          5. Satellite-based air traffic control
  30         Air traffic control systems in operation today are ground-based, using technology that
             dates back to the 1960s. Control systems using satellites allow air traffic controllers to be
             more efficient. The US is currently working on such a system: NextGen, which is being
             implemented in stages through 2025. GPS technology will be used to increase accuracy
             and shorten routes. NextGen will save time and fuel, reduce late arrivals, increase flight
  35         capacity and permit controllers to monitor aircraft with improved safety margins.

                             The Kanneh-Mason Family in Concert




     1    Harriet Smith unpacks the success of the seven gifted Kanneh-Mason siblings.
          What makes the Kanneh-Mason siblings so remarkable? Is it the fact that all seven of them
          seem equally obsessed with music? They are, by order of age, Isata (24), Braimah (22),
          Sheku (21), Konya (20), Jeneba (18), Aminata (15) and Mariatu (11), and all play either piano,
          violin or cello or a combination. Or is it the fact that their parents Stuart and Kadiatu – neither
          of them musicians but both musical – didn’t go down the more obvious hot-housing1 route with
          specialist music schools but instead opted for state education in Nottingham at a school that
          truly integrated music into the curriculum? Or is it the fact that they are equally at home playing
          Bob Marley, Mozart or tunes from the musicals?

     2    One of the most striking things about the family is the way that music is music. They grew up
          surrounded by music – reggae, rap, rock, country & western, as well as classical. That was
          undoubtedly the secret to their semi-final success in Britain’s Got Talent2 in 2015, where, after
          their medley of classical and electronic rock music, even the most prickly judge waxed lyrical,
          commenting that they were ‘probably the most talented family in the world.’ A fellow-judge hit
          the nail on the head when she summed up their performance with the observation: ‘So many
          younger people might think this music is stuffy and you give it personality and character and fun:
          I think you could probably introduce it to a whole new audience of people who have never really
          appreciated that kind of music before.’

     3    How right she was, and in the years since then the siblings have made their mark both
          individually and as a family. In 2016 cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason was the first-ever black
          musician to win the coveted BBC Young Musician, while pianist sisters Isata and Jeneba
          reached the keyboard finals in 2014 and 2018 respectively. In 2018 Sheku reached an audience
          of two billion worldwide when he played at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
          Sheku and Isata have both made best-selling recordings and all seven will shortly release a new
          album together.

     4    But before we get carried away by the fairy-tale aspect of the Kanneh-Masons, let’s not forget
          that this has come about through a mix of talent, hard work and a certain amount of sacrifice
          too, as their mother relates in her recently published book House of Music. She doesn’t like
          the word ‘talent’ very much though. ‘I think all children actually have genius … and it’s all about
          championing that.’ She explains: ‘Genius is something you really, really want to do, which is
          probably more important than something called “talent”. It’s loving something, wanting to do it,
          having the thirst to do it, and then channelling that hard work. It’s not something you are born
          with, because if you do nothing about it, it goes nowhere.’
