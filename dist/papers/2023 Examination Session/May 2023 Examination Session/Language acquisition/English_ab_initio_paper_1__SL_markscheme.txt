Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is limited
           Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1-2    Basic grammatical structures are used.
           Language contains errors in basic structures. Abundant repetition and inaccuracies
           interfere with meaning.
           Command of the language is generally effective.
           Vocabulary is generally appropriate to the task, and varied.
           Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more complex
    3-4
           structures.
           Language is generally accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
           structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
           Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
           Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    5-6
           A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
           Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message

To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
   • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
   • To what extent are ideas developed?
   • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery
      of the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.

Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type,
appropriateness of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

If candidates indicate their choice of text type but they produce another, examiners must mark the
response based on what they have produced.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

                                              Section A


Task 1

 Today, your teacher returned your English homework. Your mark is not as good as you had
 hoped. Write a text to reflect on why this happened, how you feel about it, and what you can do
 to improve your mark in the future.

 Blog                              Diary                               Speech


Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• At least one reason to explain why the mark was not as good as expected (e.g. did not do
   homework, missed class, did not like the course / the teacher...)
• How the student feels about the situation (e.g. disappointed, surprised, angry...)
• What they can do to improve the mark. This should include at least one idea not already
   mentioned, i.e. it should not only repeat the reason for the disappointing mark.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type             Rationale
Appropriate                 Diary                 This text type is “appropriate” because the diary is
                                                  primarily a private text that is used for reflection
                                                  (why the mark was disappointing). It is intended to
                                                  be read only by the writer.
Generally appropriate       Blog                  This text type is “generally appropriate” because
                                                  the blog may be used for personal reflections to be
                                                  shared with an audience that has the same
                                                  interests as the writer i.e. with friends or possibly
                                                  with the English class.
Generally inappropriate     Speech                This text type is “generally inappropriate” because
                                                  it does not correspond to the context. The topic and
                                                  audience of the task are personal and private,
                                                  whereas the message of a speech is delivered to
                                                  a group of people in a specific place.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Informal register
• The tone might express annoyance, determination, optimism etc.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

 You received an invitation from your friend to go to a show. You really want to go, but you
 cannot. Write a text to your friend to explain the situation: say why you wanted to see this show
 and why you cannot go. Suggest what you think your friend should do.

 Blog                              Email                               Message


Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Give a reason why they wanted to go to the show: e.g. favourite singer, enjoy being with
   his/her friend, relaxation. A “show” may be interpreted broadly: pop/rock/classical concert, play,
   film, recording of a TV programme…
• Explain to their friend why they cannot go: e.g. unwell, previous arrangement, in class test the
   next day…
• Suggest what their friend might do instead: e.g. exchange the tickets for another date, invite
   someone else, cancel the tickets…

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type             Rationale
Appropriate                 Email                 This text type is “appropriate” because an email is
                                                  typically used to send a personal message to an
                                                  individual or a small group.
Generally appropriate       Message               This choice of text type is “generally appropriate”
                                                  because it is a means of communicating a
                                                  personal message with someone one shares the
                                                  same space with or has close contact with.
Generally inappropriate     Blog                  This choice of text type is “generally inappropriate”
                                                  because a blog is primarily a mass media text and
                                                  is not used to communicate a message to a
                                                  specific person.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Informal to semi-formal register
• The tone is one of disappointment.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 3

 For the next three months, the school cafeteria will serve only vegetarian food. You think this is a
 good idea and you want all your friends at school to also support it. Write a text to present an
 example of a vegetarian meal and give at least two reasons why you should all support this
 change.

 Blog                               Diary                              Speech


Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Give an example of a vegetarian meal: this could be a single dish described with several details
   or a meal consisting of more than one course.
• Give two reasons why they support this change: it is good for health, good for the planet,
   supports local farmers...
• There should be some mention of the context: the school’s plan to serve only vegetarian food
   for a period of time.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type             Rationale
Appropriate                 Blog                  This choice of text type is “appropriate” because a
                                                  blog is primarily a mass-media text used to
                                                  communicate with a large audience who has a
                                                  common interest (school community). It is also
                                                  suitable for covering content such as an example
                                                  of a meal, which might be best presented in a
                                                  visual/written format.
Generally appropriate       Speech                This choice of text type is “generally appropriate”
                                                  because it is suited to delivering a message to a
                                                  group of people gathered in a specific place. A
                                                  speech is not, however, usually addressed only to
                                                  one’s friends.
Generally inappropriate     Diary                 This choice of text type is “generally inappropriate”
                                                  because a diary is a private text intended to be
                                                  read by the writer only. It is not used to persuade
                                                  others to take a specific course of action.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type             Rationale
Appropriate                 Letter                This text type is “appropriate” because it is suited
                                                  to conveying a formal message to someone one
                                                  does not necessarily know.
Generally appropriate       Speech                This choice of text type is “generally appropriate”
                                                  because it is suited to the content, but it is usually
                                                  used to deliver a message to a group of people
                                                  rather than a specific person. It may be considered
                                                  “appropriate” if the thank you speech is given at the
                                                  conclusion of the medal winner’s speech.
Generally inappropriate     Report                This choice of text type is “generally inappropriate”
                                                  because it is used primarily for describing and
                                                  providing an evaluation of something that has
                                                  taken place. It is not used primarily to express
                                                  thanks.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal to formal register
• The tone is polite and enthusiastic

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type             Rationale
Appropriate                 Leaflet               This text type is “appropriate” because the purpose
                                                  of this text type is informative. The leaflet provides
                                                  factual information intended for a large audience
                                                  not known to the writer (e.g. everyone in the local
                                                  area).
Generally appropriate       Article               This text type is “generally appropriate” because it
                                                  is suited to a large audience, but it is not
                                                  necessarily used to communicate practical
                                                  information.
                                                  If there is a reference to the target audience
                                                  (people in the local area), the choice may be
                                                  considered appropriate.
Generally inappropriate     Report                This text type is “generally inappropriate” because
                                                  a report is used for providing an evaluation of
                                                  something that has already taken place and not for
                                                  describing an event yet to take place.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal to formal register
• The tone is objective / informative and persuasive

 Leaflet                           Report                              Speech


Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Explain where the school trip went: the response should refer to a specific English-speaking
   country or make clear that the location they visited was English-speaking.
• Explain what you did when you were there: e.g. lived with a host family, visited local tourist
   attractions, attended school…
• Give at least one example of how the trip helped you to improve your English: e.g. you
   communicated with the host family, the trip gave you confidence to speak English, you made
   friends …

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                            Text type             Rationale
Appropriate                 Report                This text type is “appropriate” because it is a text
                                                  type used for providing an evaluation of something
                                                  that has taken place (the school trip) for a specific
                                                  person (the trip organizer).
Generally appropriate       Speech                This text type is “generally appropriate” because it
                                                  is suitable for providing feedback, but it us usually
                                                  used to communicate with a group of people. If the
                                                  response makes clear that the speech is given to
                                                  the organizer as verbal feedback, it may be
                                                  considered appropriate.
Generally inappropriate     Leaflet               This text type is “generally inappropriate” because
                                                  its purpose is descriptive/informative not
                                                  evaluative. The intended audience is usually not
                                                  known to the writer of a leaflet.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal to formal register
• The tone is objective and evaluative.
