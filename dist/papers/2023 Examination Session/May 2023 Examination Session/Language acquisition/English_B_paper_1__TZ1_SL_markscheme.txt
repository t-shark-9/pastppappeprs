Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3
             Basic grammatical structures are used.
             Language contains errors in basic structures. Errors interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task.
             Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
    4–6
             complex structures.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    7–9      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
  10–12
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type, appropriateness
of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1
You feel that the technology of your school is outdated. You want the school to upgrade it to
enhance teaching and learning for all students. Write a text in which you explain to the school
principal the problem with the current technology and suggest how it should be improved.

Blog                      Proposal                         Speech

Criterion B:
• The two required aspects of the task are [i] “explain the problem with the current technology” and
    [ii] “suggest how it could be improved”.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to those two elements, but both should be given some
    developed attention. If any aspect is ignored or given only cursory attention (e.g. very brief and
    general or in a single sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded since the task
    has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• While a response can mention how outdated technology affects the writer personally, it should
    focus on the impacts on the student body in general.
• “outdated” might include unstable wi-fi connection, no smart TVs in classrooms, slow printers,
    etc.
• The term “improved” can be interpreted as a replacement of the existing technology, addition of
    equipment, and/or modification of the technology or the way in which they are used.
• It is necessary for the suggestion(s) to be linked directly to how they will enhance teaching and
    learning.
• In some responses, ‘limitations, advantages, benefits, budget, etc.’ might be explained. This is
    expected in proposals and should be permissible as long as they are linked to how technology
    enhances the teaching and learning of students.

Criterion C:
Choice of text type:
                           Text type      Rationale
Appropriate                Proposal       The text type is suitable for the purpose of submitting
                                          ideas or solutions for implementation in order to address
                                          an issue that affects a large group of people.
Generally appropriate      Speech         The text type is suitable for the purpose of sharing ideas
                                          and suggestions, but it is not usually used to
                                          communicate with an individual (the school principal). If
                                          the response makes clear that the writer is addressing
                                          the principal only in a formal context to provide a
                                          proposal verbally (i.e. it is indicated that the meeting had
                                          been pre-arranged) then it may be considered
                                          “appropriate”.
Generally inappropriate    Blog           The text type is typically used for the purpose of sharing
                                          the writer’s thoughts and opinions with a larger group of
                                          unspecified audience.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.
Register and tone:
• Formal register
• Serious, explanatory, persuasive tone

Task 2
You want to make a short video using cameras on a drone (a small flying device) to show the
unique sides of your neighbourhood. You know that there might be privacy and safety concerns,
so you want to seek permission. Write a text for the city council in which you explain your goals
for the video and how the drones will be used responsibly.

Blog                         Email                        Speech

Criterion B:
• The two required aspects of the task are [i] “to explain your goals” and [ii] “explain how the drones
    will be used responsibly”.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to those two elements, but both should be given some
    developed attention. If any aspect is ignored or given only cursory attention (e.g. very brief and
    general or in a single sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded since the task
    has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• It is expected that the “goals” be plural i.e. there should be 2 or more distinguishable goals.
    However, should the script introduce one single goal only, this should be fully developed and
    well supported with examples and details.
• The “goals” may relate to what the final video will be like (the end product), or to the reason why
    they are wanting to create the video (their motivation), or both.
• The response should explain how the drones will be used responsibly, rather than simply
    providing an explanation of what they will do. “used responsibly” is expected to relate to privacy
    and safety.
• The writer may discuss where the drones will be used, but it must be developed to harness the
    idea of "using drones responsibly" (e.g. addressing safety/privacy concerns).

Criterion C:
Choice of text type:
                           Text type        Rationale
Appropriate                Email            The text type is suitable for the purpose of actively
                                            communicating information to a specific audience (the
                                            city council).
Generally appropriate      Speech           The text type is suitable for the purpose of providing
                                            information, but it is not usually used to communicate
                                            something that is more in the interest of the audience.
                                            The choice may be considered appropriate for this task if
                                            sufficient contextualization is provided (e.g. that the
                                            council has agreed to/invited the student to meet in
                                            person).
Generally inappropriate    Blog             The text type is usually used for the purpose of sharing

                                            unspecified audience. It is not typically used to
                                            communicate with a single entity (city council).

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Formal register with perhaps some flashes of semi-formality
• Serious, persuasive, and polite tone

Task 3
Last week, you read an article about a teenager who had contributed greatly to protecting the
oceans. You want to share your thoughts about this article with other young people. Write a text in
which you highlight what the teenager did, and what you and other young people might learn from
the teenager’s achievements.

• Equal weight does not have to be given to those two elements, but both should be given some

    general or in a single sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded since the task
    has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• There should be some reference to the article that triggered the writer to share thoughts about
    the topic.
• While the response could mention the teenager’s general biography, the focus should be on
    their contribution to protecting the oceans and what young people might learn from them.
• “Protecting the oceans” may be interpreted broadly, referring to the water, the coast, or to
    marine life.
• The teenager’s contribution may be direct (e.g. collected rubbish from beaches, invented a
    device to remove pollution) or indirect (e.g. organized an event to raise awareness, pressured
    the local government to change policy).
•   “What you and other young people might learn..” may include “changed behavior, what
    to do, how to help the teenager, how inspiring achievements are, etc.) as long as ideas
    are related to ‘protecting the oceans'.

                                             people’).
Generally appropriate      Email             The text type is suitable for sharing personal thoughts,
                                             but it is usually sent to a specific individual. The
                                             choice may be considered appropriate if the response
                                             makes clear that the email is being sent to a group of
                                             young people.
Generally inappropriate    Essay             The text type is typically used for academic discussion
                                             of a topic within an education context. It is not usually
                                             used to share personal thoughts with a wider
                                             audience.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register with possibly some flashes of informality
