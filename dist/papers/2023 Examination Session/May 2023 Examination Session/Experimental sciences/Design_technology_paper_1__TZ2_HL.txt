20.   The Dr. Martens 1460 boot, see Figure 5, is an iconic design first worn in its modern British-made
      form in 1960. The air cushion sole from which the boot gets it name was called “Dr. Maertens” and
      was a German invention from 1945. The German “Dr. Maertens” sole was originally incorporated in
      shoes in Germany and Austria and sold to women. In 1960, a British shoe making company bought
      the licence for the outsole and designed the boot which we now know as the iconic “Dr. Martens”
      boot. This included Anglicising “Dr. Maertens” to “Dr. Martens”. The British company made design
      innovations to the boot to emphasise that this was something new, including adding a distinctive
      yellow stitch, a two-toned grooved sole edge, a black and yellow heel loop and a unique sole
      pattern.
