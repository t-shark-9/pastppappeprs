Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                               Section A
1.   (a)   State the category with the highest percentage of vulnerable species in Figure 1(a).      [1]

           Coral (reef-forming);

     (b)   Outline two reasons why Amphibians have the highest percentage of critically
           endangered species in Figure 1(a).                                                        [2]

           a.    They require both aquatic and terrestrial habitats/specialised niches so more
                 likely to be affected by habitat loss/limitations;
           b.    They have permeable/soft skin more vulnerable to disease/UV/pollution;
           c.    Few amphibians have great public/charismatic appeal attracting
                 protection/conservation efforts;
           d.    They generally have very limited parental care so offspring more
                 vulnerable/high mortality rates in offspring;
           e.    They often depend on small bodies of water that are particularly vulnerable to
                 drought/global warming/human development of wetlands;

           Note: Only credit marks that are explicitly related to the vulnerability of amphibians.
           General factors such as habitat destruction, hunting or climate change alone are TV.

     (c)   Using Figure 1(a), state the approximate percentage of threatened crustaceans.            [1]

           28;

           Note: Accept 26–29

     (d)   Describe one reason for the lack of available data for crustaceans.                       [1]

           a.    They are mobile species/some have large habitat range;
           b.    Lack of expertise in identifying species (exacerbated by multiple immature
                 stages in life cycle);
           c.    The oceans are vast and difficult/expensive to do research in;
           d.    Many species camouflage with their surroundings / difficult species to capture
                 and tag;
           e.    Some species inhabit inaccessible regions;
           f.    Sea-floors beneath ice-sheets round Antarctica have been little explored.
                                             –6–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


(e)   Outline three reasons why the trend for corals is different to other categories shown
      in Figure 1(b).                                                                         [3]

      corals …
      a. are sedentary/cannot migrate (to avoid pollution or other risks);
      b. are r-selected species so high mortality rates (in planktonic phase);
      c. (have delicate symbiotic relationship) highly sensitive to small changes in
          abiotic conditions;
      d. are impacted worldwide through ocean acidification (causing bleaching);
      e. are impacted worldwide by global warming/climate change /warmer waters
          (causing bleaching);
      f. inhabit areas with high human polluting activity such as urban waste/agricultural
          run-off/oil spills/aquaculture;
      g. have value as souvenirs/trophy/collectors’ items;
      h. are fragile/easily damaged unintentionally (by boats/nets/storms etc);
      i. have very slow growth rates (in sedentary phase);
      j. have limited ranges/ocean depths/habitats where they can live;

      Credit any response that is consistent with the increasing trend of extinction in
      corals.
      Do not credit “pollution” alone there must be reference to a relevant source of
      pollutant as in MPf

(f)   Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are based on records for species diversity. Identify one other
      factor that may be measured to assess the diversity of life on Earth.                   [1]

      a.   genetic diversity;
      b.   habitat diversity;

      Do not accept “evenness/equitability” or “richness” they are already included within
      concept of species diversity
                                                  –7–                  M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe the overall trend shown in the recorded annually averaged data in Figure 2.          [2]

           a.   ozone initially declined;
           b.   ozone stabilized / began to increase slightly;

           Note: do not credit descriptions of the projected values.
           Allow 1 mark for overall decline
           Precise dates are not necessary for credit (i.e. accept change occurring around
           2000).


     (b)   State one chemical responsible for the trend in the recorded annually averaged data
           between 1980 and 1990 shown in Figure 2.                                                      [1]

           halons/CFCs/HCFCsHBFCs/N2O/methyl bromide/methyl chloroform/carbon tetrachloride/
           chlorine/bromine:

           Note: do not credit HFCs/ODSs


     (c)   Outline one impact of low concentrations of stratospheric ozone on humans.                    [1]

           b.   cataracts / eye damage;
           c.   immune system suppression;


     (d)   Identify the year that stratospheric ozone is predicted to return to 1980 levels in Figure 2. [1]

           Accept any year in range 2041-2043;


     (e)   Describe two reasons for the projected change in ozone levels after 2020 in Figure 2.         [2]

           a.   Montreal Protocol resulted in unprecedented international cooperation to
                address loss of ozone (and its influence still continues);
           b.   banned use of CFCs/ phasing out of CFCs/ ozone depleting substances
                /refrigerants/aerosols/recycling of refrigerants;
           c.   alternatives to CFCs (HFCs/HCFCs) were developed reducing harm to ozone;
           d.   education/awareness campaigns led to changes in consumer preferences;
           e.   ozone reforms due to natural reversible chemical reactions/processes / ODSs
                eventually begin to break down/dissipate;


     (f)   Outline one factor that may affect the reliability of the model projections in Figure 2.      [1]

           a.   oversimplification that does not take into account full range of factors;
           b.   hard to predict consumer/government/industry behaviour;
           c.   production and release of new ozone depleting substances;
           d.   countries not following the Montreal Protocol / black market ODSs;
           e.   difficult to obtain accurate data;
                                                    –8–                  M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


3.   (a)   State one storage of fresh water not shown in Figure 3.                                    [1]

           Lakes/rivers/glaciers/groundwater/aquifers/reservoirs/organisms other than plants;


     (b)   State one input of water into the atmosphere not shown in Figure 3.                        [1]

           Evaporation (from inland waters/oceans/soil) / sublimation / water vapour from
           respiration/combustion;


     (c)   Describe the positive feedback mechanism by which deforestation may decrease the
           availability of water in certain regions.                                                  [2]

           Fewer trees -> more runoff;
           ->Less infiltration into soil -> less water for trees -> fewer trees;

           OR

           More runoff -> Less infiltration to soils;
           ->Less uptake by trees -> more runoff;

           OR

           Deforestation -> decreased evapotranspiration;
           ->Decreased precipitation -> declining tree population;

           Credit valid responses in form of full sentences or accurate diagrams. 1 max if positive
           feedback loop is incomplete.
                                             –9–                 M23/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


(d)   Evaluate the role of reforestation in the mitigation of climate change.                 [4]

      Pros:
      a. more trees absorb more CO2 so reduce global warming;
      b. reforestation simultaneously increases biodiversity;
      c. requires minimal technology/labour/expense;
      d. forests are naturally renewable carbon sink/indefinite lifetime;
      e. reforestation requires minimal ongoing maintenance;
      f. regulating local weather /decreasing extreme weather patterns;
      g. protects against run-off/soil erosion/desertification;
      h. it increases evapotranspiration which may increase cloud cover increasing
          albedo/mitigating warming

      Cons:
      a. it increases evapotranspiration so more water vapour/greenhouse
         gases/warming;
      b. more trees reduce reflected heat into atmosphere/absorb more heat so
         increase warming;
      c. it reduces land availability for agriculture/urban growth;
      d. it is not feasible in all locations/habitats;
      e. it requires large areas to make a significant difference;
      f. can be an expensive/unpopular solution;
      g. can take a long time/period of growth before it has significant impact on CO2;

      Award [3] max if only pros or only cons are given.
      Pro MPh and Con MPa may contradict one another but both are valid hypotheses and
      deserve credit
      Do not credit vague responses like “improves air quality” or “reduces air pollutants”

                                              Section B
4.   (a)   Outline the transfers and transformations of matter as it enters and flows through the
           first trophic level of a food chain.                                                     [4]

           Transfers: [3 max]
           a. Carbon dioxide diffuses into leaves;
           b. Nitrates/phosphates/(inorganic) minerals diffuse/actively transported into roots;
           c. Water is taken up/diffuses into roots;
           d. Sugars translocated from leaves to other parts of the plant;
           e. Water vapour/oxygen diffuses out of leaves;
           f. Organic matter is transferred to next trophic level/decomposers through feeding

           Transformations: [3 max]

           d. Water evaporates through leaves in transpiration;
           e. Conversion of organic matter to inorganic matter through decomposition

           Only credit transfers/transformations referring to matter (not energy).


     (b)   Describe how the emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels may impact the
           productivity of terrestrial ecosystems.                                                  [7]

           a. CO2/greenhouse gas emissions lead to increasing global/atmospheric
              temperatures;
           b. Increased temps may cause increase in rate of photosynthesis/increased
              productivity;

              radiation;
           h. …which will damage plants & reduce primary productivity;
           i. NOx/hydrocarbons may cause photochemical smog that damages
              plants/reduces primary productivity;
           j. NOx/hydrocarbons may produce tropospheric ozone further increasing
              atmospheric temperatures;
           k. NOx/SOx are sources of acid deposition that can alter soil pH/damage plants
              reducing productivity;
           l. …also causing the leaching of soil nutrients which reduces productivity;

              productivity;
           n. ...reduction in primary productivity is likely to cause loss of secondary
              productivity;

(c)   With reference to named societies, to what extent do the environmental impacts of energy
      resources influence their choice of energy?                                                  [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
      markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with “understanding
      concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be seen
      as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when deciding
      on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

           Answers may demonstrate:
           • understanding concepts & terminology of renewable/non-renewable energies;
              wind; solar; hydro; geothermal; fossil fuels; global warming/climate change; acid
              deposition; ozone depletion; photochemical smog; oil spills;
              political/economic/geographic factors affecting energy choice; energy security etc
           • breadth in addressing and linking energy choices of a range of different
              countries in different locations to environmental impacts and other factors.
           • examples of named energy sources, and countries energy choices, and
              environmental impacts; and other influences etc
           • balanced analysis evaluating extent to which energy choice is determined
              more by environmental impact than any other influence.
           • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
              examples given e.g. Although countries are becoming more concerned with
              regard to environmental impact, while MEDCs may afford environmentally
              friendly choices, the need in LEDCs to adopt economic solutions tends to be an
              over-riding factor in energy choices.

           Please see markbands on page 18.

      Note: Reward giving specific examples: e.g. UK, Netherlands, France, Scandinavia are
      leaders in relatively expensive (to install) wind power.

5.   (a)   With reference to four named agricultural strategies, outline how they improve the
           sustainable use of soils.                                                               [4]
           a. Using organic fertilisers maintains the presence of a decomposer
               community/humus in soils;
           b. Crop rotation/strip cropping prevents the excessive loss of particular nutrients
               from the soil;
           c. Cover crops to replace nutrients/reduce desertification/soil erosion/loss of water
               from soils;
           d. Drip irrigation prevents excessive leaching of nutrients/water loss through
               evaporation/salinization of soils;
           e. Terracing/contour ploughing prevents water erosion/run-off of soils on slopes;
           f. No-till farming reduces soil erosion/nutrient loss;
           g. Windbreaks prevent wind erosion/loss of soils by winds;
           h. Biological pest control avoids pesticide use that can toxify soils/kill non-target
               species.
           i. Manually pull weeds/mulch/use ground cover instead of using herbicides to
               avoid killing non-target species/toxify soils;
           j. Using crops that are tolerant to the climate (local/GMO) to minimize soil
               damage from irrigation;
           k. Rotate pastures for livestock to avoid nutrient loss/soil compaction from
               overgrazing;


     (b)   Explain how the process of succession leads to changes in productivity.                 [7]

           General:
           a. GPP continues to increase throughout the successional stages due to
              increasing nutrient cycling / improved soil fertility/nutrients leads to greater
              productivity;
           b. NP as a proportion of GP decreases throughout the stages due to increasing
              respiration from consumers/decomposers;

           In primary succession/pioneer community:
           c. Abiotic conditions are poor/nutrient levels are low so GPP is low;
           d. NP of the community is high/NP as a proportion of the GP is high due to low
                consumption/respiration;

           In intermediate stages:
           e. Secondary productivity increases as consumers join food chain;
           f. NP/increase in biomass of entire community slows due to consumption of
                GPP/increased respiratory losses by consumers;

           In climax community/final stages
           g. Secondary productivity is at maximum as food chains are fully developed;
           h. GPP is at maximum due to plant communities reaching carrying capacity;
           i. No NP/biomass gains for community as a whole as all PP being consumed/lost
                 to respiration;

(c)   With reference to named examples, compare and contrast wild fisheries and aquaculture
            systems in terms of their efficiency and environmental impacts.                           [9]

           The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
           offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
           markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with “understanding
           concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
           seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
           deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

           Answers may demonstrate:
           • understanding concepts & terminology of aquaculture and wild fisheries;
              monoculture/polyculture; genetically modified organisms; genetic diversity;
              harvesting efficiency; use of fertilisers/pesticides/antibiotics; genetic degradation
              through escapees; waste & eutrophication; overfishing; bycatch; etc
           • breadth in addressing and linking wild fisheries and aquaculture systems with a
              range of potential impacts on the environment and issues of efficiency.
           • examples of wild fisheries and aquaculture systems along with examples of
              associated impacts.
           • balanced analysis evaluating the relative efficiency and overall environmental
              impact of wild fisheries versus aquaculture systems.
           • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and examples
              given e.g. When aquaculture is practised at a subsistence rather than commercial
              level it can be very efficient and have minimum environmental impact, but
              commercial aquaculture has many environmental impacts probably making it less
              sustainable than many wild fisheries.

6.   (a)   A new parasite is introduced into an ecosystem and manages to infect a host species.
           Outline how the host and parasite species may reach an equilibrium over time.             [4]

           a.   The parasite species may grow slowly to begin with because there are only a
                few of them to reproduce;
           b.   They will then grow at an increasing/exponential rate as the numbers
                reproducing increase;
           c.   Eventually they may begin to cause a fall in the number of hosts;
           d.   This will cause a subsequent decline in the number of parasite species;
           e.   This in turn will allow the host species to recover;
           f.   This reciprocal/cyclical fluctuation may continue indefinitely;
           g.   Achieving a negative feedback mechanism/dynamic equilibrium;
           h.   hosts that are best able to tolerate the parasite are the most likely to
                survive/reproduce/increase in numbers;
           i.   parasites that kill their hosts often struggle to reproduce as efficiently, so the
                milder versions might be more likely to survive/reproduce/increase in numbers;
           j.   -which in means over time parasites are less deadly and hosts are less
                affected;


     (b)   Explain how tectonic plate activity may lead to the formation of new species.             [7]

           a.   Volcanic activity may give rise to new habitats eg mountains/islands;
           b.   Continental drift may bring populations into new climates;
           c.   Populations may get divided by geographical barriers/uplift of mountains/plates
                separating;
           d.   Different parts of the population may find themselves in new habitats/climates;
           e.   There may be a variety of traits/genetic diversity in the population;
           f.   Some features/genetic traits may be more adapted/fit for the new
                habitat/climate/subject to natural selection;
           g.   Individuals with these adaptive traits will be most likely to survive;
           h.   These survivors will pass the adaptive features on to their offspring;
           i.   Over time further adaptations may give rise to a population that is unable to
                interbreed with original species;
           j.   Once the populations are unable to interbreed a new species has been formed

(c)   Justify the role of different environmental value systems (EVSs) in deciding between
      in situ and ex situ conservation strategies.                                               [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be

      Answers may demonstrate:
      • understanding concepts & terminology of ex situ/in situ conservation;
         ecocentric/anthropocentric and technocentric value systems; biorights; intrinsic
         value; deep ecology; cornucopian values; stewardship; keystone species; flagship
         species; reserves; zoos; breeding/re-introduction programmes; gene banks; etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking a range of in situ/ex situ conservation strategies
         with different value systems/perspectives on the nature of living things/species.
      • examples of different value systems; different perspectives on living things and
         different in situ & ex situ conservation strategies.
      • balanced analysis evaluating the relative merits and demerits of different value
         systems and their perspectives on in situ v ex situ conservation.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and examples
         given e.g. While ecocentrics are more likely to value the hands-off approach possible
         with in situ conservation there are certain cases where a natural habitat is so
         degraded the only way forward for conserving a given species is the more
         technocentric ex situ conservation.

7.   (a)   Outline how the ecological footprint (EF) of a human population is likely to change
           through the stages of the demographic transition model (DTM).                              [4]

           a.   EF is likely to start off very small because of low population;
           b.   Footprint will be low because of subsistence food production/hunter/gathering;
           c.   It will then increase with increasing numbers/consumption/development of
                agriculture;
           d.   With industrialisation/commercialisation footprint is likely to increase with heavy
                use of fossil fuels;
           e.   Development of technology for alternative energy resources may reduce
                footprint;
           f.   Technological development in food production/transport may come to reduce
                footprint;
           g.   Reduced population growth/declining populations in MEDCs may tend to
                reduce overall footprint;
           h.   However, if greater consumerism/materialism/economic growth is still pursued
                footprint may continue to increase / per capita footprint increases can negate
                effects of decreased population;


     (b)   A wild population of fish may provide a sustainable resource for human consumption.
           Describe practical procedures for estimating the maximum sustainable yield from such a
           resource.                                                                                  [7]

           a.   Maximum sustainable yield is the greatest amount of harvest that can be taken
                without reducing potential for further growth of fish population;
           b.   To measure its MSY one needs to measure net productivity/natural income;
           c.   Measuring annual change/increase in population size/biomass;
           d.   Population would need estimating at start and again after end of year/given time
                period;
           e.   Population can be measured using mark/release/recapture / Lincoln index;
           f.   A sample is caught using traps/nets and marked;
           g.   Trap/mesh size should be selected to only catch adult individuals;
           h.   They are released and given time to mix with whole population;
           i.   Traps are re-set/second sample is caught to identify proportion marked;
           j.   Total population is estimated using equation: n1 x n2 / nm (number in 1st sample
                x number in 2nd sample / total marked in 2nd sample);
           k.   Difference in population (divided by given time) is the net productivity/natural
                income/MSY.

           Note: Credit can be given if equivalent procedures to measure change in biomass
           rather than population size are described.

(c)   To what extent do different strategies for the management of solid domestic waste
      (SDW) influence the sustainability of human populations?                                   [9]

      Answers may demonstrate:
      • understanding concepts & terminology of sustainability; managing solid domestic
         waste; recycling; reuse; reduction in consumption; landfills; incineration; waste for
         energy; import/export of waste; leaching of toxins; greenhouse gases; zero waste; etc

         management strategies with their specific implications for sustainability.
      • examples of specific waste management strategies adopted by named
         communities/locations and their impacts on sustainability.
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which the waste management strategy is
         increasing or decreasing the sustaiability of a society.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
         examples given e.g. The most significant of all the strategies is reduction in the
         initial consumption of resources which is directly leads to greater sustainability.
         All the others, even recycling, involve some consumption of energy or
         production of pollution that is unsustainable.
