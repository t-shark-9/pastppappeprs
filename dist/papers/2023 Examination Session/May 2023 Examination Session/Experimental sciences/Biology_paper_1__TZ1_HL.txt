      Methylation of DNA in sperm and egg is removed immediately after fertilization. What is the
      reason for this?

      A.     Methylation allows RNA polymerase to join the promoter.

      B.     It is needed to form homologous pairs of chromosomes.

      C.     It allows expression of genes linked to early development.

      D.     Transcription of promoters only occurs in methylated genes.

27.   The image shows leucyl-tRNA synthetase from Thermus thermophilus complexed with a tRNA.
      This tRNA-activating enzyme joins the amino acid leucine to tRNA using ATP.




      Why is leucyl-tRNA synthetase not used to join the amino acid valine to tRNA?

      A.   Phosphorylation of valine occurs at a later stage.

      B.   Valine does not need to be activated to attach to tRNA.

      C.   Leucyl-tRNA synthetase is substrate-specific.

      D.   Valine has a different anticodon from leucine.

        A.    Threonine deaminase only works in the presence of isoleucine.

        B.    Isoleucine inhibits threonine deaminase at low concentrations of threonine.

        C.    Production of isoleucine is inhibited at high concentration of threonine.

        D.    End-product inhibition controls the production of threonine deaminase.
