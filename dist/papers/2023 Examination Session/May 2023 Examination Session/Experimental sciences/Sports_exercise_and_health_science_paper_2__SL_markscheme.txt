Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section B [20 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.
8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

         Angular momentum is when a body is spinning about an axis; ✔                         differences given

         A moment of inertia is determined by the distance of the load from the rotational
         axis; ✔

         Similarities:
         Angular momentum remains constant unless the diver is acted upon by an
         unbalanced force; ✔
         Start: longer maximal radius <arms / legs> to correct body position/stability to
         execute chosen dive; ✔
         Final phase: <maximized radius,> maximized moment of inertia, which reduces
         angular velocity / rotation and therefore diver can enter water vertically without
         rotation>; ✔                                                                                                                5

         Rotating about the same <transverse> axis; ✔

         Differences:
         Change in arm position B1–B2 upward thrust to initiate rotation; ✔
         Going into pike/phase B4, <radius is reduced,> moment of inertia reduced,
         angular velocity is increased, therefore spin faster to allow diver to complete
         somersault; ✔
         Diver A does not change moment of inertia during dive
         OR
         Final phase: coming out of pike/phase B6 to maximise moment of inertia which
         reduces angular velocity, therefore reduce spin speed to allow diver to enter
         water vertically <without rotation>; ✔

         Skill is practised in its entirety. The learner can appreciate the end product and Award [2] max for description
         can develop a feeling for the flow of the movement necessary for smooth and        Award [1] max for a list
         efficient production of the skill / fast and explosive movement, must be practised
         specific to the required movement, therefore can’t be broken down into
         component parts; ✔
         e.g., Golf swing / basketball shot; ✔
         Whole–part–whole; ✔
         Where the learner first tries the whole skill to get a feel of the performance
         requirements and to help identify the easy and hard elements. This may be
         different for each individual. They can then practice the difficult portion before
         integrating back into whole skill; ✔

         When the skill is too complex and or difficult for the learner and each additional
         part can build on the previous parts; ✔

         and arms, kicking and breathing, swim; ✔

         When the skill is too complex and or difficult for the learner and or when there is
         an element of danger, but the sequence is not vital; ✔
