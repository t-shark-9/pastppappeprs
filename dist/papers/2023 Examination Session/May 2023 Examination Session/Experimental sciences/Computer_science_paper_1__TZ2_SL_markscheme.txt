Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
   rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
   In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
   “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

1.   Award [2 max]
     web browser allows users access to information/resources on the WWW;
     (when a user asks for a particular website) the web browser fetches the required content
     from a web server/ acts as an interface between a client and server;
     prepares the retrieved information to be displayed/ interprets the content to be rendered in
     a format that can be understood/ displays the resulting web page on the user's device;
     allows user to navigate around website/ open more than one web page/ print/ save page/ etc. ;


2.   Award [1 max]
     holds the address of the current instruction/data that is to be fetched from / transferred to memory;


3.   Award [2 max]
     Because Unicode is (an established) standard for data representation/ a single encoding scheme
     for all languages and characters;
     So, data can be used/transported through many different systems/ platforms/ devices;

     Because of the difference between ASCII and Unicode in the number of bits used to encode
     (ASCII (8-bits) and Unicode (16/32 bits);
     It can represent over a million characters/ ASCII cannot be used to encode the many types of
     characters found around the world;

     Because Unicode can be defined with different character encoding like UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32,
     etc.;
     And is used to represent many (over a million) characters from many (more than 150) modern and
     historic scripts (along with emoji);

           Random Access Memory is volatile / requires power to maintain the stored information/ data
           is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned
           off;
           Data/instructions that are currently being used are stored in RAM;
           RAM can be modified, erased, or read/ data stored in RAM can be altered;
           RAM is small in capacity compared to secondary storage media;
           It is fast (faster to read from and write to than other kinds of storage, such as a hard disk
           drive (HDD)/ solid-state drive (SSD));


     (b)   Award [3 max]
           Cache memory is (an extremely) fast memory type;
           that acts as a buffer between RAM and the CPU;
           it holds frequently requested data and instructions;
           so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed;

           Cache memory is used as an intermediate form of storage between very high-speed CPU
           registers and the slower RAM;
           located inside the CPU and can be directly accessed by the processor;
           It is used to store instructions and data that are repeatedly required during the execution of
           programs; thus, improving the performance and speed of the whole system/ thus avoiding
           the need to access the dynamic RAM to retrieve the same data repeatedly/ is used to reduce
           the average time to access data from the main memory;

9.   Award [2 max]
     one of the key concepts of OOP languages;
     to decompose complex problems;
     Hide / remove unnecessary details;
     look for recurring patterns;

     Example 1 (OOP)
     Abstraction is a process in which a programmer hides / removes all but the relevant data about an
     object;
     in order to reduce complexity / increase efficiency;

     Example 2 (OOP)
     Abstraction in OOP is a programming methodology in which details of the programming codes are
     hidden away from the user;
     and only the essential things are displayed to the user;

     Example 3 (OOP)
     Abstraction is one of the key concepts of OOP languages;
     its main goal is to handle complexity (by hiding/removing unnecessary details);

     Example 4
     Abstraction is the process of ignoring the characteristics of patterns that we don't need;
     in order to concentrate on those that we do need;

     Example 5
     Abstraction means decomposing complex problems;
     And then looking for patterns among and within the smaller problems (that make up the
     complex problem);

                                                 Section B

10.    (a)   Award [2 max]
             Award [1] for identifying an issue (benefit or problem) caused by the introduction of
             a new computer system which transforms how end users perform and interact, x2.

             Examples (the list is not exhaustive):
             Need for training;
             (lack of knowledge of the end-users about the new system/ lack of ability to use the new
             system/ resistance to training?);

             Resistance to changes;
             (turnover-some end users leave the organisation, end user not giving feedback or
             requirements for the new system);

             End-user satisfaction;
             (end-users excited about changes? increased efficiency/ productivity/ increased employee
             morale);

             Change in roles/ role specification;
             (agreements/ disagreements on job duties/ fear of redundancy);

             Poor processes management;
             (employees may not understand what is expected of them/ employees could feel that new
             practices are in conflict with previous/ existing practices);


      (b)    Award [2 max]
             Legacy system is an outdated computer system/(application) software that is still in use/ still
             meets the needs it was originally designed for/ is essential for the organization;
             it cannot be updated /does not receive support and maintenance/ doesn’t allow for growth/ is
             incompatible with current (new) more advanced solutions;


       (c)   Award [1 max]
             Observation ;
             Survey/Questionnaire ;
             Interview;
             Brainstorming (get as many ideas as possible from a representative group of end users);


       (d)   Award [3 max]
             Example 1
             Data loss/data available in legacy system but after migration process it is not available in the
             new system;
             because data is accidentally deleted/ something causes data to become corrupted/ viruses/
             physical damage/incomplete transfer;
             cost involved in rectifying data loss leads to financial risk for the organization / sets back
             productivity / reputation risk (can cause the organization to lose customers);

             Example 2
             Data Corruption/ Data integrity;
             format and content of data in legacy system and new system is different / incompatible data/
             anomalies or redundant or duplicated data or presence of non-meaningful data;
             this affects the efficiency/ it can totally beat purpose of migration;
                                             –9–                 M23/4/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ2XX/M



      Note: Students may write an example for this, such as: the legacy system may have had
      gender details of the employees, but the new system may not have/require them).


(e)   Award [3 max]
      Example 1
      Parallel running is less risky than direct changeover;
      if the new system fails, operation can continue under the old system;
      whilst in direct changeover if the new system fails the data is lost/ operation cannot continue;

      Example 2
      Parallel running allows organization to test the new system (all features of the new system
      can be fully trialled);
      and the organization switches over to the new one if (when) it is found to be more efficient
      than the old one;
      Whilst in direct changeover the new system is started without ensuring that the new system
      is working correctly/efficiently before the old system is terminated;

      Example 3
      Parallel running ensures new system runs without errors;
      if errors are found, refer to old system to resolve and make modifications to new system;
      Whilst in direct changeover the old system is terminated (and the new system is started
      without ensuring that it is working correctly);

      Example 4
      Parallel running allows staff to be trained in the new system gradually;
      helps them gain confidence in new system;
      as the changeover does not happen immediately;

      Note: Reward other suitable responses.

(f)   (i)    Award [1 max]
             self -instruction/self-learning;
             formal classes;
             remote/online training;

             Note: Reward other suitable methods.

      (ii)   Award [3 max]
             Award up to [2] for any advantage to end-user (trainee) evaluated, and up to [2] for
             any disadvantage evaluated.
             Note: The response should match the method of training identified in (i).

             Award marks for the advantages and disadvantages involving convenience, cost, time,
             effectiveness, comprehensiveness, learning needs, etc.

             Example 1 (remote /online training)
             advantage of online training is that it allows end-users to attend classes from any
             location of their choice;
             with reduced financial costs (because online learning eliminates the cost of
             transportation/ meals/ the study materials are cheaper (available online));
             but there are also disadvantages such as: struggle with focusing on the screen for long
             periods of time/ technology issues (requirements of internet enabled devices / smart
             devices / live internet connection) /sense of isolation/ time zone differences between
             the trainer and the trainees;

             Example 2 (formal classes)
             Direct interaction between the trainer and trainees (end-users); no technology
             issues/no sense of isolation;
             Verified study materials and trainers allows immediate answer to end-users/ gives end-
             user (trainees) the benefit of receiving immediate feedback;
             but it involves high costs (the expenses associated with end-user training);
             it is time intensive/requires time away from the work;

             Example 3 (self-instruction)
             Self-learning is neither location constrained nor time-bound (end users can choose
             their own pace/materials/methods);
             less stressed out about failing in front of another person/no social interaction;
             lack of input from trainers can lead to slower progress than f2f training;

            physical distance/ the number of network devices which have to be crossed;
            the performance of each of the devices (sender and receiver), for example weak processor;
            quality/characteristics of network equipment (such as the router or transmission media/
            cable/fibre/wireless);
            number of network users (and their demand at any particular time);

            Accept other reasonable answers, such as the type of encryption used or the encryption
            strength/ server bandwidth/ size of the user data/ type of protocol used, etc.;


      (c)   Award [3 max]
            (Because) compression reduces the size of a file/ size of data/ the number of packets to be
            transmitted;
            Which reduces transmission time/ consumes less bandwidth;
            And can result in significant cost savings;


      (d)   Award [2 max]
            Encryption scrambles readable text;
            So, it can only be read/understood by the person who has the decryption key;

            Data encryption translates plain text into ciphertext;
            That can be viewed/read in its original form only if it is decrypted with the correct key;

            rules)/ restricts access to parts of a network / prevents unauthorised access of
            confidential data);

            Note: Accept software and hardware firewalls.

            A (software) firewall (is a program installed on each computer that) monitors incoming and
            outgoing traffic/ controls the behaviour of applications;
            and filter/block traffic coming from unsecured or suspicious apps/ blacklisted apps;

            A (hardware) firewall (is a piece of equipment installed between the network and gateway
            that) regulates traffic through ports;
            and prohibits suspicious data packets from passing through;

(f)   Award [4 max]
      Award [2 max] for positive aspects, 1 mark for stating any of the positive aspects (of working
      from home) and 1 mark for discussion.
      Award [2 max] for negative aspects, 1 mark for stating any of the negative aspects (of
      working from home) and 1 mark for discussion.

      Examples (Positive aspects):
      Flexibility and agility
      Increased productivity - due to fewer interruptions
      Increased motivation
      Autonomy
      Improved health and wellbeing
      Better work/life balance

      Examples (negative aspects):
      Working from home doesn't suit everyone
      Employees feeling isolated
      Home distractions
      Negative impact on mental health
      Not all jobs suit home working


      Note: When a change to the work pattern is identified it can be an advantage or a
      disadvantage. For example, working at home can improve interaction with the family but also
      provide a distraction to work.

12.   (a)   Award [2 max]
            Predetermined size (size should be known in compile time / it should be known in advance
            how many elements are to be stored in array);
            Fixed size (once the memory is allocated to the linear array, it cannot be increased or
            decreased);
            An array holds elements that have the same data type;
            Array name represents the address of the starting element, all elements of an array can be
            distinguished using an index number (direct access to each element);
            Array elements are stored in subsequent memory locations;


      (b)   Award [2 max]
            Linear/sequential search;
            Binary search;

            Note: Award other suitable responses such as Jump search, Interpolation search,
            Exponential search, etc.


      (c)   Award [5 max]
            Award [1] for the input of X and initialization of all variables used
            Award [1] for a correct loop
            Award [1] for checking if ROOMNUMS[K] is equal to X
            Award [1] for changing the value of FLAG/FOUND
            Award [1] for correct if statement after the loop
            Award [1] for outputting both appropriate messages

            Note: The binary search is not acceptable, it will not work in this situation because the
            ROOMNUMS array is not sorted.
            Note: The sub-program heading may not appear.
            Note: For the loop accept either 0 to 9 (as question paper) or 0 to 999 to match array
            capacity

            Example 1
            check(ROOMNUMS)
                input X
            FOUND=false
                K=0
                loop while K<=9 and not FOUND
                     if ROOMNUMS[K]=X then
                         FOUND=true

                if FOUND then
                     output('The student in the room ', X, 'has paid the bill ')
                else
                     output('The student in the room ', X, 'has not paid the bill
            yet')
                end if
            end check

(d)   Award [6 max]
      Award [1] for correct outer loop
      Award [1] for MINIM initialized (within outer loop and before inner loop)
      Award [1] for correct inner loop
      Award [1] for comparing ROOMNUMS [I] with ROOMNUMS [MINIM]
      Award [1] for changing the value of MINIM (if needed)
      Award [1] for if statement after inner loop and within outer loop
      Award [1] for comparing MINIM with J (after inner loop)
      Award [1] for correct swap

      Note: The bubble sort bubble sort algorithm is not acceptable because the selection sort
      algorithm is requested in the question paper.
      Note: Allow an upper limit of 999.

      loop J from 0 to 9
          MINIM=J
          loop I from J + 1 to 9
