12.   The effect of substitution mutations in a salamander gene was studied. Some mutations have
      no observable effect on the phenotype and are called silent mutations.




                                     Removed for copyright reasons




      What conclusion about the position of the mutation in the codon can be drawn from this graph?

      A.   Most changes in this gene are silent.

      B.   A change in any position of the codon will always cause a change in the protein.

      C.   More phenotype changes occur due to a mutation in the second position.

20.   Humans have persecuted predators such as coyotes (Canis latrans), causing severe reduction in
      the number of large carnivores throughout the world. The diagram represents part of a food web in
      Texas, USA.




      What is a possible outcome for the lagomorph population in this ecosystem if coyote numbers
      were controlled by killing them to reduce losses of domestic livestock?

      A.   Decrease because there are fewer predators

      B.   Increase because there are fewer foxes to eat them

      C.   Decrease because there are more rodents for foxes to eat

      D.   Increase because, although there are more foxes, there are also more rodents


21.   The ability to digest lactose in adulthood appeared due to a mutation in the lactase gene. The
      frequency of the lactase persistence allele was recorded as 0.8 in present-day European populations
      and as 0.05 in fossils from populations of their prehistoric ancestors.

      What could have caused the change in the allele frequency?

      A.   Drinking more milk caused the mutation to occur.

      B.   There was a strong positive selection for the lactase persistence allele.

      C.   Lactase persistence was transferred to humans from cows.

      D.   Prehistoric milk did not contain lactose.

22.   The photograph shows a scorpion (Pandinus imperator).




      What recognition features indicate that it is an arthropod?

      A.   Exoskeleton and articulated legs

      B.   Segmented body and endoskeleton

      C.   Soft body covered by calcium exoskeleton

      D.   Body divided into three parts and radial symmetry
