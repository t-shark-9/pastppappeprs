Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP1
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions
• The maximum total = [35].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points:
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
      iv.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
      iv.    Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  M23/4/ENVSO/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

           formation of ozone;
        d. in the summer months there may be an increase in tourism/travel leading to greater use of
           transport that generates NOx/volatile organic compounds (VOCs)/precursors of tropospheric
           ozone;                                                                              [1 max]

           c. cap on number of new cars in Beijing/reduction in use of buses/increase in use of cyclists (in
              2017) /increase in use of subways therefore reduction in NO2/SO2/precursors of acid
              deposition;
           d. use of catalytic converters/scrubbers that remove NO2/SO2/precursors of acid deposition;

              environmental awareness;
           e. since about 2015 gradual increase in use of bikes due to government drive to encourage
              bike use (e.g. subsidies to buy bikes)/due to greater environmental awareness to reduce use
              of private vehicles;
           f. decrease in use of taxis as public transport has improved / decrease in taxi use due to
              increase in price of using taxis;                                                       [2 max]

               Conclusion [1 max] needs to be balanced considering both sides of the argument for credit
               and makes a clear value judgement e.g.: While the benefits to Beijing in terms of addressing
               water scarcity would be enormous, the environmental impacts (e.g. of loss of habitats) and
               social impacts (e.g. loss of villages and communities) of increasing the dam size would
               outweigh the benefits.

               Conclusion is not mandatory and 3 marks can be achieved through consideration of both
               cons and pros.

         ozone/NO2/SO2/precursors of acid rain/GHGs;
      c. the Beijing Clean Air Action Plan is limiting the number of private vehicles/has
         reduced use of coal which emit air pollutants (such as PMs/GHGs);
      d. increasing green areas/dead hedges provides habitats for urban wildlife/wildlife
         corridors;
      e. increasing green areas provides carbon sinks/helps absorb air pollutants;
      f. creation of green areas/parks can help improve mental/physical well-being /
         provide areas for recreation;
      g. through these environmental management strategies Beijing has potential to reach
         net zero carbon emissions by 2050 which would reduce its contribution to global
         warming/climate change;
      h. policies/investment into prevention of air pollution has resulted in a reduction in
         pollution between 1998 and 2017 of PM/NO2/SO2;
      i. in recent years there has been an increase in the use of less polluting forms of
         transport such as bikes/subways and trains;
      j. the council has stricter standards/legislation/greater enforcement which limits
         water pollution;
      k. the South–North Water Project ensures that Beijing has a reliable/safe supply of
         water;
      l. South–North Water Project provides renewable hydroelectric power/flood control /
         use of hydroelectric power will reduce use of fossil fuels;
      m. waste management strategy includes reduction of waste generation at source /
         use of waste to energy incinerators to generate electricity will reduce use of fossil
         fuels;
      n. Beijing zoo has an active breeding program that has produced offspring of critically
         endangered species (e.g. Northern white cheeked gibbon, Guizhou snub-nosed
         monkey)/flagship species (e.g. Giant Panda);

      Cons for model of good environmental management [4 max]
      o. aging population increasing burden on health care/younger generation;
      p. reduction in working population reducing economic growth;
      q. despite cap on population in city, electricity demand continues to increase / electricity
         demand continues to increase which uses fossil fuels and releases GHGs;
      r. ozone/PM2.5 continue to be above the WHO limits;
      s. use of private cars continues to be high (about 30% of all transport modes) which
         generate air pollutants / a lower proportion of people use bikes than in the past
         opting to use alternative modes of transport that create more air pollution;
      t. a large proportion of rivers in Beijing (40%) are still highly polluted;
      u. the South–North Water Project has diverted water away from other areas adversely
         affecting wildlife/communities downstream / construction of South–North Water
         Project has resulted in loss of wildlife habitats / extending the dam/constructing
         pipelines damages the soil and can lead to soil erosion;
      v. dam scheme interferes with fish migratory routes / may cause seismic movement;
      w. incineration of waste creates air pollutants such as dioxins;
      x. focus on popular flagship species (e.g. Giant Panda) may detract from funding/supporting
         other species with higher ecological value;
      y. due to the interconnected nature of systems on earth, relocating factories to outside Beijing
         can still have an adverse effect on the planet (e.g. carbon dioxide emissions causing climate
         change);
                                                                                                   [6 max]

Conclusion [1 max]
  For example: Although air pollution has decreased since 1999, PM2.5 levels are above WHO
  safe limits throughout the year and therefore Beijing cannot yet be considered a good model
  of environmental management;
  Although expanding the Danjiangkou dam provides more clean/renewable electricity for
  Beijing, it causes more loss of habitat for local species and demand of energy keeps rising;
  hence Beijing cannot be considered a model of good environmental management;
  Despite relatively high levels of PM2.5 recorded in 2015 and poor water quality in 2018,
  Beijing is moving in the right direction with implementation of the Beijing Clean Air Action
  Plan, stricter water quality standards and greening the city and hence Beijing can be
  considered a good model of environmental management;

   A valid conclusion should be credited if it is explicit, balanced (addresses both sides of the
   argument) supported by evidence and makes a clear value judgement.
   Do not credit the conclusion if only one side of the argument has been considered
   within the overall response.
