22.   Which is an example of evolution by selective breeding?

      B.       The variation in the size of different breeds of dogs

      C.       The tendency, during breeding, for birds to produce more offspring than will survive

      D.       Some female spiders only breeding with males which make the right signals


23.   Which statement best describes how evolution occurs?

      A.       Species which produce the most offspring are favoured by natural selection.

      B.       Mutations in somatic cells are passed on to offspring.

      C.       Natural selection decreases the frequency of unfavourable characteristics.

      D.       Changes in species lead towards greater complexity over time.
