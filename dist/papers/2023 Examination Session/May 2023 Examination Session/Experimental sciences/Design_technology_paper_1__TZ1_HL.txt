Questions 36 – 40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Marco Maran’s X3 Chair is elegant, flexible, strong and manufactured using innovative technologies, see
Figure 9. The chair is widely used in restaurants due to its low price and its particular characteristics.
The price is approximately US$50.

The seat and back of the chair is created by bio-injection moulding. The chair is manufactured from a
clear polycarbonate called Desmopan®.

Desmopan® is a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer which has the strength of polyurethane, but the
characteristics of rubber. The geometric arrangement in the structure gives the chair a distinctive look,
structural strength and performance characteristics that many consumers like.
