Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

1.   (Maximum mark: 26]

     This question considers the optimal route between two points, separated by several
     regions where different speeds are possible.

     Huw lives in a house, H, and he attends a school, S, where Hand Sare marked on the
     following diagram. The school is situated 1.2km south and 4km east of Huw's house.
     There is a boundary [MN], going from west to east, 0.4km south of his house. The land
     north of [MN] is a field over which Huw runs at 15 kilometres per hour (kmh-'). The land
     south of [MN] is rough ground over which Huw walks at 5 kmh-'. The two regions are
     shown in the following diagram.

                                                                             diagram not to scale

     (a)   Huw travels in a straight line from H to S. Calculate the time that Huw takes to
           complete this journey. Give your answer correct to the nearest minute.                       [6]

     (b)   Huw realizes that his journey time could be reduced by taking a less direct route.
           He therefore defines a point P on [MN] that is x km east of M. Huw decides to run
           from H to P and then walk from P to S Let T(x) represent the time, in hours, taken
           by Huw to complete the journey along this route.

2.   [Maximum mark: 29]

     This question considers the analysis of several datasets of examination marks using a
     variety of standard procedures and also an unfamiliar statistical test.

     A class of eight students sits two examinations, one in French and one in German.

     The marks in these examinations are given in Table 1.

                                                      Table 1

     The maximum mark in both examinations is the same.

     You may assume that these data are a random sample from a bivariate normal distribution
     with mean µ, for the French examination, mean µ0 for the German examination and
     Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient p,

     Before the examinations were sat, the Head of Languages, Pierre, decided to investigate
     whether there would be significant evidence of a difference between µ, and µ0 . He decided
     to analyse the data using a two-tailed paired t-test with significance level 5 %.

     ( a)   Explain briefly

            (i)     why he chose to use a I-test and not a z-test;                                            11 l
            (ii)    why he chose to use a two-tailed test and not a one-tailed test.                          [1 I

     (b)    (i)     State suitable hypotheses for the !-test.                                                 [1 l

            (ii)    Find the p-value for this test.                                                           [2]

            (iii)   The p-value is a probability. State the event for which it gives the probability.         11 J
            (iv)    State, giving a reason, what conclusion Pierre should reach.                              (2]

(Question 2 continued)

     (c)   Pierre believes that students who score well in one language examination lend to score
           well in the other language examination. He therefore decides to carry out a test at the
           5 % significance level to investigate whether there is a positive correlation between the
           French examination marks and the German examination marks.

           (i)    State appropriate hypotheses in terms of p.                                           [1]

           (ii)   Perform a suitable test and state the p--value. State, in context, the conclusion
                  that Pierre should reach, giving a reason.                                            [4]

     (d)   There are actually two more students in this particular class, Paul and Sue. Paul sat
           the French examination, but he was unable to sit the German examination. Sue sat
           the German examination, but she was unable to sit the French examination.

           (i)    Paul's mark in the French examination was 58. Use the data in Table 1 to
                  predict the mark that Paul would have obtained in his German examination.             [3]

           (ii)   Based on her mark in the German examination, Sue's mark in the French
                  examination was predicted to be 71. Find the mark she obtained in the
                  German examination.                                                                   [2]

     Six students sit examinations in mathematics and history and their marks are shown
     in Table 2. The Vice Principal, Angela, decides to investigate whether there is any
     association between the marks obtained in these two subjects.

(Question 2 continued)

     Angela is informed that the maximum mark in each subject is 100.

     Angela believes that the data might not be normally distributed, so she investigates
     what suitable tests are available which do not assume the data is normally distributed.
     She decides to use an unfamiliar test based on a statistic called Kendall's r.

     Consider n bivariate observations (x;, y,), i = 1, 2, . . . n, such that there are no
     equal x-values and no equal y-values. Any pair of distinct bivariate observations
     (x;, y,) and (x1, y1) is said to be concordant if (x; - x1 )(y, - Y) > 0 and discordant
                                                                          n(n -
     if (x; - x)(y, - y1) < 0. For n bivariate observations, there are          I) distinct pairs.
                                                                             2
                                  2( C - D)
     Kendall's r is defined as              where C and D denote respectively the number of
                                   n(n -1)
     concordant pairs and discordant pairs.

     ( e)   (i)     Show that the value of Kendall's , always lies in the interval [-1, + l].                11 I
            (ii)    For students P 1 and P2 , show that their pair is concordant.                            [1]

            (iii)   Show that the value of Kendall's , for the mathematics and history data is 0.2.          [4]

     (f)    Angela decided to use this statistic in a two-tailed test at the 10% significance level.
                                               I I
            The critical region for her test is r 2 0.733.

            (i)     State, in words, her null and alternative hypotheses.                                    [1 I

            (ii)    State the conclusion that Angela should reach. Give a reason for your answer.            [2]

     Angela now finds that the history marks are actually out of 120. The history teacher advises
     Angela to scale the history marks so that they are out of 100 and then redo the calculations
     for the value of r.

     (g)    State, with a reason, whether you agree with the advice given by the history teacher.            [2]
