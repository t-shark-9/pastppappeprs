Answer one question.

1.   (a)   Explain the difference between price elasticity of demand and income elasticity
           of demand.                                                                               [10]

     (b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the view that an understanding of price elasticity
           of demand can be useful for firms trying to increase total revenue.                      [15]


2.   (a)   Explain how an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in interest rates
           might affect macroeconomic equilibrium in the short run in an economy.                   [10]

     (b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the view that economic growth always leads to a
           rise in economic well-being.                                                             [15]


3.   (a)   Explain how a country might use trade protection to raise government revenue and
           and protect employment in an industry.                                                   [10]

     (b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate a country's decision to impose trade protection on
           imported goods.                                                                          [15]
