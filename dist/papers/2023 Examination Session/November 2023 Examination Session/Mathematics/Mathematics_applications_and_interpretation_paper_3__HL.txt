Answer both questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

1.   [Maximum mark: 28]

     This question uses differential equations to model the maximum velocity of a skydiver
     in free fall.

     In 2012, Felix Baumgartner jumped from a height of 40 000 m. He was attempting to travel
     at the speed of sound, 330 m s-1, whilst free-falling to the Earth.

     Before making his attempt, Felix used mathematical models to check how realistic his
     attempt would be. The simplest model he used suggests that

                                                     dv
                                                        =g
                                                     dt
     where v m s-1 is Felix’s velocity and g m s-2 is the acceleration due to gravity. The time since
     he began to free-fall is t seconds and the displacement from his initial position is s metres.

     Throughout this question, the direction towards the centre of the Earth is taken to be positive
     and v is a positive quantity.

     When s = 0 , it is given that Felix jumps with an initial velocity   v = 10 .

                                                   dv     dv

           (ii)    Assuming that g is a constant, solve the differential equation v     = g to find
                   v  as a function of s .                                         d s             [4]

           (iii)   Using   g = 9.8 , determine whether the model predicts that Felix will succeed
                   in travelling at the speed of sound at some point before s = 40 000 .
                   Justify your answer.                                                                    [3]

     (b)   To test the model

                                                    dv

                                                    dt

           Felix conducted a trial jump from a lower height, and data for v against t was found.

           (i)     If the model is correct, describe the shape of the graph of v against t .               [2]

(Question 1 continued)

           Felix’s data are plotted on the following graph.

           where k is a positive constant. You are reminded that initially   s = 0 and v = 10 .

                           dv     dv
           (i)     By using    = v , solve the differential equation to find v in terms of s , g  and k .

                   You may assume that g - kv2 > 0 .                                                     [5]

           Felix uses the graph of v against t shown in part (b) to estimate the value of k .

           (ii)    The gradient is estimated to be 9.672 when v = 40 . Taking g to be 9.8, use this
                   information to show that Felix found that k = 8 × 10-5 .                              [2]

           (iii)   Hence, find the value of v predicted by this model, as s tends to infinity.           [2]

           (iv)    Find the upper bound for the velocity according to this model, given that
                   0 < s ≤ 40 000 . Give your answer to four significant figures.                        [2]

(Question 1 continued)

     The assumption that the value of g is constant is not correct. It can be shown that

                                                      3.98 1014

     (d)   Use Euler’s method with a step length of 4000 to estimate the value of v

     (e)   After Felix completed his record-breaking jump, he found that the answer from part (d)
           was not supported by data collected during the jump.

           (i)    Suggest one improvement to the use of Euler’s method which might increase
                  the accuracy of the prediction of the model.                                        [1]

           (ii)   Suggest one factor not explicitly considered by the model in part (d) which might
                  lead to a difference between the model’s prediction and the data collected.         [1]

2.   [Maximum mark: 27]

     This question is about applying ideas from logarithms, calculus and probability to an
     unfamiliar mathematical theory called information theory.

     Claude Shannon developed a mathematical theory called information theory to measure the
     information gained when random events occur. He defined the information, I, that is gained
     when an event with probability p occurs as

                                                   I = - ln p

     where 0 < p ≤ 1 . For example, no information is gained ( I = 0 ) when an event is certain
     to occur ( p = 1 ).

     (a)   (i)	Sketch the graph of I = - ln p , for 0 < p ≤ 1 , labelling all axes intercepts and
                 asymptotes.[3]

           (ii)    Show, using calculus, that I is a decreasing function of p .                             [3]

           (iii)   Interpret what “ I is a decreasing function of p ” means in the given context.           [1]

     (b)   A computer selects at random an integer x from 1 to 10, inclusive. Each outcome is
           equally likely.

           Alessia is trying to determine the value of x and asks if x is odd.

           (i)     Write down the probability that x is odd.                                                [1]

           (ii)    Alessia is told that x is odd. Find how much information Alessia gains.                  [2]

           The computer then selects at random an integer y from 1 to 10, inclusive.
           Each outcome is equally likely.

           Daniel is trying to determine the value of y and asks if y is 7. He is told that it is not 7.

           (iii)   Find how much information Daniel gains.                                                  [2]

(Question 2 continued)

     If a random variable has n possible outcomes with probabilities p1 , p2 … pn , then the
     expected information gained, E ( I ) , is defined as

     (c)   For the integer guessing game described in part (b), when Daniel asks if y is 7,
           there are two possible outcomes: “ y is 7” or “ y is not 7”.

           (i)     Show that the expected information gained by Daniel is 0.325, correct to
                   three significant figures.                                                             [2]

           (ii)    Alessia asks if x is odd. Show that her expected information gained is
                   greater than Daniel’s expected information gained.                                     [2]

     Information theory can be applied to a variety of situations.

     (d)   When a coin is flipped, the outcome is either heads or tails. The coin may be biased.
           Let p be the probability of the outcome being heads.

           (i)     Find, in terms of p , the information gained when the outcome is tails.                [1]

           (ii)    Find, in terms of p , the expected information gained when the coin is
                   flipped once.                                                                          [1]

           (iii)   Hence, find the value of p when the expected information gained is maximized.          [2]

     A famous puzzle uses 12 balls which appear identical. 11 have the same weight, but one is
     either lighter or heavier than the others. A pair of scales can be repeatedly used to compare
     the weights of different combinations of the balls.




     The outcome of each weighing can be “balanced”, “left-hand side heavier” or “right-hand
     side heavier”. The aim of the puzzle is to identify the ball which is the different weight, and
     whether it is heavier or lighter than the others, in as few weighings as possible.
