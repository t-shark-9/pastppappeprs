Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Madhu is designing a jogging track for the campus of her school. The following diagram
     shows an incomplete portion of the track.

     Madhu wants to design the track such that the inner edge is a smooth curve from point A to
     point B, and the other edge is a smooth curve from point C to point D. The distance between
     points A and B is 50 metres.

                                                                            diagram not to scale

     To create a smooth curve, Madhu first walks to M, the midpoint of [AB].

     Madhu then walks 20 metres in a direction perpendicular to [AB] to get from point M to point F.
     Point F is the centre of a circle whose arc will form the smooth curve between points A and B
     on the track, as shown in the following diagram.

                                                                              diagram not to scale

     The outer edge of the track, from C to D, is also a circular arc with centre F, such that the
     track is 2 metres wide.

     (d)   Calculate the area of the curved portion of the track, ABDC.[4]

     The base of the track will be made of concrete that is 12 cm deep.

     It is believed that the heights of university students follow a normal distribution with mean
     176 cm and standard deviation 13.5 cm.

     It is decided to perform a χ2 goodness of fit test on the data to determine whether this sample

     Tiffany wants to buy a house for a price of 285 000 US Dollars (USD). She goes to a bank
     to get a loan to buy the house. To be eligible for the loan, Tiffany must make an initial down
     payment equal to 15 % of the price of the house.

     The bank offers her a 30-year loan for the remaining balance, with a 4 % nominal interest
     rate per annum, compounded monthly. Tiffany will pay the loan in fixed payments at the end
     of each month.

     (a)   (i)	Find the original amount of the loan after the down payment is paid.
                 Give the exact answer.

           (ii)   Calculate Tiffany’s monthly payment for this loan, to two decimal places.                [5]

     (b)   Using your answer from part (a)(ii), calculate the total amount Tiffany will pay over
           the life of the loan, to the nearest dollar. Do not include the initial down payment.           [2]

     Tiffany would like to repay the loan faster and increases her payments such that she
     pays 1300 USD each month.

     (c)   Find the total number of monthly payments she will need to make to pay off the loan.            [2]

     This strategy will result in Tiffany’s final payment being less than 1300 USD.

     François is a video game designer. He designs his games to take place in two dimensions,
     relative to an origin O. In one of his games, an object travels on a straight line L1 with
     vector equation

     The city of Melba has an adult population of four million people. It is assumed that the
     weights of adults in Melba can be modelled by a normal distribution with mean 72 kg
     and standard deviation 10 kg.

     (a)   If 10 adults in Melba are chosen independently and at random, find the probability
           that more than 3 of them have a weight greater than 85 kg.[4]

     Laetitia runs a travel agency in Melba. The elevator to her office is designed to hold a
     maximum of 8 people.

     (b)   Write down a probability distribution that models the total weight of 8 adults chosen
           independently and at random from Melba.                                                          [3]

     the elevator.

     A newspaper claims that 42 % of the adults in Melba who go on holiday choose to go abroad.
     Laetitia believes that this is an overestimation of the true number. During the past month,
     Laetitia found that 67 of her clients chose a holiday abroad, and 133 chose a holiday that
     was not abroad.

     (d)   Laetitia decides to perform a test using the binomial distribution on her data for the
           population proportion, p , that go on holiday abroad.

           (i)     State two assumptions that Laetitia makes in order to conduct the test.

           (ii)    Write down the null and the alternative hypotheses for Laetitia’s test, in terms of p .

           (iii)   Using the data from Laetitia’s sample, perform the test at a 5 % significance level
                   to determine whether Laetitia’s belief is reasonable.                                    [8]
