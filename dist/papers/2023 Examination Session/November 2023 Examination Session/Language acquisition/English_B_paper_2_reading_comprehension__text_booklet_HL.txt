                      Young creatives travel to Melbourne for
                         Australian Youth Dance Festival
                                                    29 Jun 2022
                                                 Stephen A Russell

         Growing up in Delhi, India, Abhishree was surrounded by dance
         from an early age. ‘There’s a lot of dancing in my culture and any        Non-essential image
          time there was music, I was boogying around,’ she recalls.                    removed

          When her family moved to Australia in 2019, the now 15-year-old
    5     found her place as part of Canberra’s youth-driven QL2 Dance
          company. ‘I’ve made so many friends here, family really,’ she said.
         ‘I absolutely love the collaborative nature of the company, the chance to perform together and
          the freedom to create pieces of my own.’

         Emphasising the word ‘together’, Abhishree notes that the focus on collaboration at QL2 isn’t
   10    necessarily universal at other companies. ‘I have a lot of friends who are very competitive, so
         it’s so nice to see our company grow together, rather than individually.’

         In the spirit of collaboration, Abhishree will travel to Melbourne with fellow QL2 ensemble
         member Julia Villaflor to be the company’s youth ambassadors at this year’s Australian Youth
         Dance Festival (AYDF) alongside other young dancers from across the country.

   15    Run by Ausdance Victoria, the week-long AYDF program aims to bring together 70 emerging
         dancers and have them work with professionals. The dancers, aged 16–24, will participate in
         workshops and industry forums, and come together to present new work in a performance that
         will champion youth dancers representing five states.

         Abhishree relishes the opportunity to forge new and mutually beneficial alliances. She’s
   20    presently performing Connecting Stories: Generations at the National Portrait Gallery in
         Canberra. The work highlights dancers from QL2 with their Canberra neighbours Australian
         Dance Party as well as others from Newcastle-based company Catapult Dance.

         ‘It incorporates performers as young as eight and as old as 40,’ she said. ‘So we are
          collaborating with different ages, different stages, different dances and different companies,
   25     including dancers from Thailand. We’re seeing how different people move and sharing our
          experiences, then using them to grow together.’

         The young dancer is looking forward to meeting other performers from across the country at
         AYDF. ‘Canberra is a pretty small place, and Melbourne is a cultural hub for the arts community,’
         she said. Abhishree also hopes to make many new friends and to dance with a lot more
   30    different people. She also thinks that the AYDF may support her professional ambitions by
         giving her a chance to network and thus open more opportunities.

                                An extract from The Nickel Boys
         Elwood was twelve when the encyclopedias appeared. One of the busboys1 dragged a stack
         of boxes into the kitchen and called for a powwow2. Elwood squeezed in – it was a set of
         encyclopedias that a travelling salesman had left behind in one of the rooms upstairs. There
         were legends about the valuables that rich white people left in their rooms, but it was rare that
     5   this kind of plunder made it down to their domain. Barney the cook opened the top box and
         held up the leather-bound volume of Fisher’s Universal Encyclopedia, Aa – Be. He handed it to
         Elwood, who was surprised how heavy it was, a brick with pages edged in red. The boy flipped
         through, squinting at the tiny words – Aegean, Archimedes, Argonaut – and had a picture of
         himself on the front-room couch copying words he liked. Words that looked interesting on the
    10   page or that sounded interesting in his imagined pronunciations.

         Cory the busboy offered up his find – he didn’t know how to read and had no immediate plans to
         learn. Elwood made his bid. Given the personality of the kitchen, it was hard to think of anyone
         else who would want the encyclopedias. Then Pete, one of the new dishwashers, said he’d race
         him for it.

    15   Pete was a gawky Texan who’d started working two months prior. He was hired to bus tables,
         but after a few incidents they moved him to the kitchen. He looked over his shoulder when he
         worked, as if worried about being watched, and didn’t talk much, although his gravelly laughter
         made the other men in the kitchen direct their jokes toward him over time. Pete wiped his hands
         on his pants and said, “we’ve got time before the dinner service, if you’re up for it.”

    20   The kitchen made a proper contest of it. The biggest yet. A stopwatch was produced and
         handed to Len, the gray-haired waiter who had worked in the hotel for more than twenty years.
         He was meticulous about his black serving uniform, and maintained that he was always the
         best dressed man in the dining room, putting the white patrons to shame. With his attention
         to detail, he’d make a dedicated referee. Two fifty-plate stacks were arranged, after a proper
    25   soaking supervised by Elwood and Pete. Two busboys acted as seconds for this duel, ready to
         hand over dry replacement rags when requested. A lookout stood by the kitchen door in case a
         manager happened by.

         While not prone to bravado, Elwood had never lost a dish drying contest in four years, and wore
         his confidence on his face. Pete had a concentrated air. Elwood didn’t perceive the Texan as a
    30   threat, having out-dried the man in prior competitions. Pete was, in general, a good loser.
