           frustration at the army’s hesitance are portrayed through a range of literary devices,
           particularly in his speeches exhorting his men to action. Accept a range of substantiated
           answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the argument and up to [2] for
           the coherence and clarity of the argument: [2] if very coherent and well argued; [1] if

           are given.

              -   specific vocabulary of Romanitas in the direct speech (patria, Penates, Romana
                  moenia), to emphasize the values the army defends to exhort them to fight
              -   the imagery of Hannibal slipping through their fingers (Hannibal emissus e
                  manibus) highlights his eagerness and frustration at the situation

                  painting himself as a great Roman hero to his soldiers
              -   comparison (cum spem magis ipsam quam causam spei intueretur) to stress the
                  strength of the consul’s speech and his desire to fight.
              -   irony/sarcasm (effodiant signum, si ad convellendum manus prae metu
                  obtorpuerunt) to stress the consul’s courage as opposed to the fear of the
                  army/his frustration at delays/his disregard for omens
              -   the common soldiers are inspired by his bravery (milite in volgus laeto ferocia
                  ducis); his appearance of fierceness shows effective leadership of the soldiery

                                                                                                Total: [10]

Option C — Love poetry

Extract 6 Ovid, Amores 1.6.1–20

           about to be beaten (cum stares ad verbera) [1].

     (c)   The poet describes, through a variety of literary features, love controls the poet, subverts
           normal societal roles and causes a visceral emotional response in the poet. Accept a
           range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
           argument and up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument: [2] if very coherent

           direct role in instructing the poet

           - comparison between the things that used to scare the poet (umbras nocte volantis,
           strictas in mea fata manus) and love, which he now fears, suggests that love is more
           powerful than the threat of even a violent attack

           - Cupid’s laughter and mocking tone (risit, fies tu quoque fortis) show his confidence in
           his own power over the poet

           - short phrases (nec mora, venit amor) to highlight how quick love is to exert his power

           - diction (perdere, fulmen) highlighting love’s destructive power over the poet

           - love has the power to reverse the social hierarchy, with the poet begging the ianitor for
           help (ianitor! direct address; desperate diction on precor; certe ego … ad dominam pro
           te repetition of pronouns to highlight the reversal) showing love’s power to upset the
           natural order

                                                                                               Total: [10]

           can be more ingenious than Gabba; and Tettius Caballus (himself).

     (b)   The word nasum means wit / not everyone can be witty [1]; it is implied that Caecilius is
           not witty [1]

     (c)   Martial’s insulting depiction of Caecilius’s coarse nature uses a range of literary devices to
           construct a witty attack, higlighting Caecilius’s high opinion of his sophistication and wit,
           and how he is mistaken in this view. Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding
           [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the argument and up to [2] for the coherence and
           clarity of the argument: [2] if very coherent and well argued; [1] if coherent and well

           man

           -summary of Caecilius character in one single word (verna, 2)

           -repetition (quod, quod…) to intensify the enumeration of negative features; (videris,
           videri, videris) to stress Caecilius’s pretensions, contrasting with reality

           -enjambment (4-5), to stress the speed of the enumeration, due to the many negative
           figures Caecilius is compared to

           -apostrophe (Caecili, Caecili), to personalize the attack

           -alliteration (quid, quo, quid, quod, quare…) to emphasize the speed and rhythm of the
           enumeration

           -parallel structures (quod… quod… quod) to join all comparisons under the same negative
           perspective

           -dilogy /word play / pun (caballus/ nasum) to conclude his poem with a comic effect.

                                                                                                Total: [10]

10.   (a)   Brutus: pulls knife from wound (cultrum ex volnere ... extractum) [1]
            The other men: are absorbed in their grief (luctu occupatis) [1]

      (b)   That a new character had settled in Brutus’s chest (or similar) (novum in Bruti pectore
            ingenium) [1]; the strange event (rei novae) [1]. Also accept vileness/indignity (indignitate).

      (c)   Livy constructs the figure of Brutus as a hero through a series of literary devices. Accept a
            range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the argument
            and up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument: [2] if very coherent and well
            argued; [1] if coherent and well argued; [0] if incoherent and poorly argued or if no details
            from the text are given.

            Points may include:

            -Repetition (Brutus, Bruti, Brutum, Brutus, Bruto) to emphasize the protagonism of this
            character

            -Contrast between Brutus’s actions and the other men’s passivity and amazement
            (Brutus illis luctu occupatis... manantem cruore prae se tenens/ stupentibus miraculo rei)

            - Brutus’ oath to stress his determination (per hunc iuro, vosque, di, testes facio)

            - tricolon (ferro, igni, quacumque vi) to stress his commitment to avenging the crime /
            his outrage / his oratory skills to inspire the men around him

            - repetition/parallel structure (nec illos nec alium) and alliteration (regnare Romae
            passurum) to stress his determination about there being no more kings in Rome

            - amazement of the surrounding men at his revealed character (stupentibus miraculo rei;
            chiasmus novum in Bruti pectore ingenium)

            - repetition: stupentibus miraculo rei .. concient miraculo rei suggesting an equal
            importance of the new character of Brutus, and the astonishing nature of the crime

            - swift compliance from the men to follow Brutus’s orders in taking the oath (ut
            praeceptum erat iurant; word choice on praeceptum and, repetition of iuro … iurant
            showing him as a leader and model for the others)

            - parallel construction (cum patris maestitia tum Brutus castigator lacrimarum) shows
            Brutus being as influential on public opinion as sympathy for Lucretia’s father

            - repeated diction describing him as a leader (ducem, castigator, auctor, duce)

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:
• use relevant examples from the prescribed passages to support the response (candidates are not
   expected to provide exact quotes)
• demonstrate knowledge of historical, political and cultural contexts beyond those embedded in the
   prescribed passages.

Criterion B (Understanding and argument) assesses how well the response demonstrates understanding
of the chosen option. Ideally, a candidate will:
• build a critical analysis that responds directly to the prompt in a clear, logical and imaginative way
• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
    option.
                                                                                                   Total: [12]

          0          The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

         1–2         The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the chosen option
                     without addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the
                     examples.
                     The argument has limited focus, coherence and development.

         3–4         The response demonstrates limited understanding of the contexts and
                     background knowledge pertinent to the chosen examples.
                     The argument has focus but has limited coherence and is not developed.

         5–6         The response demonstrates an understanding of the chosen option by
                     addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples in a
                     limited way.
                     The argument has focus and coherence but is not developed.
