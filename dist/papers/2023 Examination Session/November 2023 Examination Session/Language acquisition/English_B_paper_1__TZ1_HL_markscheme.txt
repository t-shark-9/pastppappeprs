Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3      Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
             complex structures.
             Language contains errors in both basic and more complex structures. Errors interfere
             with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is generally appropriate to the task and varied.
    4–6      A variety of basic and some more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
    7–9
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and nuanced and varied in a manner that
             enhances the message, including the purposeful use of idiomatic expressions.
  10–12      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used selectively in
             order to enhance communication.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of the
           task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type,
appropriateness of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

You recently returned from a cultural exchange programme, where you lived for a month with a
host family in an English-speaking country. You wish to share your experiences with other
students at your school. Write a text in which you explain the positive and negative aspects of the
experience and offer advice to students who might wish to participate in the same programme.

Article                             Diary                           Social media posting

Criterion B:
• The three required elements of the task are (i) explain the positive aspects of the experience, (ii)
  explain the negative aspects of the experience, and (iii) offer advice to students who might wish
  to participate in the same programme.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or dismissed in one sentence or not approached as detailed
  below, no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been ‘generally
  fulfilled’ at best.
• Discussion of (i) and (ii) should include at least some reference to either the cultural exchange
  programme or to living with a host family (or to both); otherwise relevance and/or focus may be
  affected.
• Discussion of (iii) may take the form of “dos and/or don’ts” when students are on the same
  exchange programme, or information that will help them to decide whether to participate in the
  programme.

Criterion C:
Choice of text type:
                           Text type    Rationale
Appropriate                Article      The text type is suitable for the purpose of
                                        transmitting both factual information and personal
                                        opinions to a wide but targeted audience within the
                                        school community.
Generally appropriate      Social media The text type is suitable for transmitting both factual
                           posting      information and personal opinion, but it may have a
                                        wider mass audience. The choice may be
                                        considered “appropriate” if the response makes clear
                                        the social media post is shared with students at the
                                        school, rather than the general public.
Generally inappropriate    Diary        This text type is typically used for personal reflection.
                                        It is not usually used to share information with other
                                        people. The choice can be considered “generally
                                        appropriate” if it is clear that the diary is kept as
                                        some form of private social media and that students
                                        at the school will be given access to this post only.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Informal or semi-formal, but it should be consistent.
• Knowledgeable but engaging / approachable, respectful tone, without being pushy.

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

Your school film club wants to create a short video whose content would be particularly relevant
to young adults. You have a good idea for the video that you want to share with the members of
the club. Write a text in which you describe your idea for the video, explain its relevance to young
adults and justify why the film club should make this their next project.

Article                              Email                           Proposal

Criterion B:
• The three required elements of the task are (i) describe your idea for the video, (ii) explain its
  relevance to young adults, and (iii) justify why the film club should make this their next project.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or dismissed in one sentence or not approached as detailed
  below, no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been ‘generally
  fulfilled’ at best.
• “Describe your idea” in (i) may be interpreted broadly, including aspects such as subject matter,
  theme(s), context, filmography/style etc.
• Discussion of (ii) should relate in some way to ideas offered in (i); i.e. why the ideas they described
  are relevant to young people.
• Justification in (iii) should go beyond the information discussed in (i) and (ii), e.g. the potential
  impact of the suggested video, its appropriateness compared to other potential suggestions etc.

Criterion C:
Choice of text type:
                           Text type          Rationale
Appropriate                Proposal           The text type is suitable for the purpose of
                                              persuading a specific audience (the film club) of the
                                              writer’s ideas in a more formal context (school
                                              project).
Generally appropriate      Email              The text type is suitable for a range of purposes, but
                                              it is not necessarily used to persuade the reader of
                                              the writer’s ideas. The choice may be considered
                                              “appropriate” if the email is used as a vehicle for
                                              sending a text that is persuading a specific audience,
                                              while there is enough evidence that the text is
                                              directly addressed to the film club.
Generally inappropriate    Article            The text type is typically used to transmit information
                                              to a mass audience. It is not usually used to
                                              persuade a specific audience of an idea. The choice
                                              can be considered “generally appropriate” if the
                                              article is somewhat persuasive and addressed to the
                                              club members

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• semi-formal to formal register
• enthusiastic, convincing but respectful tone

Task 3

You have seen online that a group of students from your city held a protest about the deteriorating
state of the local environment. You wish to express your thoughts about this protest. Write a text
in which you summarise what you have witnessed online, describe your reactions to it, and
evaluate the impact the protest might have.

Diary                               Official Report                          Social media posting

Criterion B:
• The three required elements of the task are (i) summarise what you have witnessed online, (ii)
  describe your reactions to it, and (iii) evaluate the impact the protests might have.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or dismissed in one sentence or not approached as detailed
  below, no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been ‘generally
  fulfilled’ at best.
• Discussion of (i) should primarily focus on the factual details of the protest, e.g. where or when
  the protests took place, what they were protesting against and what form this took.
• It is expected that the “reactions” in (ii) be plural i.e. there should be at least 2 distinguishable
  reactions described. However, if there is only one general reaction (e.g. “impressed”, “eye-
  opening”, “disappointed” etc.) that is effectively developed and supported, this should be
  accepted. The reactions may be favourable, unfavourable or neutral.
• Any potential “impact” of the protests should be accepted in (iii), e.g. on the community, on the
  environment, on the authorities, on the young people. However, these impacts should be
  “evaluated”; i.e. to what extent the protests will have an impact.

                           Text type    Rationale
 Appropriate               Social media The text type is suitable for the purpose of
                           posting      expressing thoughts and opinions about an online
                                        event with an undefined readership.
Generally appropriate      Diary             The text type is more suitable for reflecting or
                                             recording personal thoughts, rather than to express
                                             them, as the writer is likely the sole audience. The
                                             choice may be considered “appropriate” if the
                                             response reflects a personal significance / emotional
                                             or intellectual engagement.
Generally inappropriate    Official report   The text type is typically used to convey an objective
                                             set of facts to a specific professional audience. It is
                                             not usually used to express personal thoughts and
                                             opinions on an event to an unspecified audience.
                                             The text may be considered “generally appropriate" if
                                             the official report is oral and live, in which case there
                                             needs to be some hint that it is being recorded /
                                             broadcast / screencast.
Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can be considered “generally appropriate”.
Register and tone:
