Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is limited
           Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1-2    Basic grammatical structures are used.
           Language contains errors in basic structures. Abundant repetition and inaccuracies
           interfere with meaning.
           Command of the language is generally effective.
           Vocabulary is generally appropriate to the task, and varied.
           Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more complex
    3-4
           structures.
           Language is generally accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
           structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
           Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
           Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    5-6
           A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
           Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message

To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
   • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
   • To what extent are ideas developed?
   • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery
      of the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.

Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

  Marks       Level descriptor
    0         The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
              Conceptual understanding is limited.
              The choice of text type is generally inappropriate to the context, purpose or audience.

              of the task, fluctuate throughout the response.
              The response incorporates some conventions of the chosen text type.
              Conceptual understanding is fully demonstrated.
              The choice of text type is appropriate to the context, purpose and audience.

              The register and tone are appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of the task.
              The response fully incorporates the conventions of the chosen text type.


Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type,
appropriateness of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

If candidates indicate their choice of text type but they produce another, examiners must mark the
response based on what they have produced.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

                                              Section A

Task 1

 Your cousin lives in another country. He or she would like to come and study in your school next year.
 Write a text for your cousin to describe a typical school day and explain why you like or don’t like your
 school.

 Email                               Letter                                   Speech

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Describe a typical school day, for example:
        o Timing of beginning/end, breaks/meals etc.
        o Length and number of classes; subjects taught etc.
• Explain why you do or don’t like your school, for example:
        o Feelings about classmates/teachers
        o How the school timetable fits with the writer’s life
        o Any other information pertaining to school life

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                           Text type          Rationale
Appropriate                Email              An email is “appropriate” because it is generally
                                              intended for one recipient and the message may be
                                              sent and received immediately, even by those living
                                              in another country. It is also suitable for conveying
                                              the writer’s feelings about the subject matter.
Generally appropriate      Letter             A letter is “generally appropriate” as it is generally
                                              intended for one recipient, but it lacks the same level
                                              of immediacy. A letter is also typically used in more
                                              formal contexts. The choice may be considered
                                              “appropriate” if it is written to the cousin living abroad
                                              and is suitably informal in register.
Generally inappropriate    Speech             A speech would be “generally inappropriate”
                                              because it is usually used to address a larger
                                              audience than one cousin. It also implies a level of
                                              planning that is unnecessary for the context, purpose
                                              and audience.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Informal
• Informative, possibly excited tone

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

 People are eating more and more sugar these days, often without knowing it. You want to let your
 school friends know about this problem. Write a text to describe the dangers of eating too much sugar
 and how they can avoid eating too much sugar.

 Email                                Note                                Social media posting

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Describe the dangers of eating too much sugar, for example:
        o Potential health problems
        o Potential ups and downs in concentration at school
• Describe how to avoid eating too much sugar, for example:
        o Read food labels
        o Avoid known sugary substances, e.g. soft drinks
        o Eat fresh foods instead


Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                           Text type    Rationale
Appropriate                Social media A social media posting is “appropriate” because it is
                           posting      a way of reaching a number of people interested in
                                        the topic but need not necessarily be addressed to
                                        specific individuals (‘school friends’ in general).
Generally appropriate      Email        An email is “generally appropriate” for similar
                                        reasons to social media except that it is usually sent
                                        to named individuals which makes it less likely in this
                                        instance. The choice may be considered
                                        “appropriate” if it addresses more than one school
                                        friend.
Generally inappropriate    Note         A note is considered “generally inappropriate”
                                        because it is typically used to communicate
                                        information to just one individual, or to remind
                                        oneself of something.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Semi-formal
• Serious, possibly scientific tone

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 3

 You recently took part in a cultural festival from an English-speaking country. It was very interesting
 and you want to tell your English ab initio classmates about it. Write a text to describe what happened
 at the festival and why you thought it was interesting.

 Blog                               Diary                                 Speech

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Describe what happened at the festival, for example:
        o The type of festival
        o Specific events at the festival
• Describe why you thought it was interesting, for example:
        o Whether the writer has (not) been to a similar festival before
        o Whether the festival aligned with the writer’s interests



Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                           Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                Blog              A blog is “appropriate” because it can reach a large
                                             audience with a shared interest. It often includes
                                             information as well as the writer’s opinion, which is
                                             suitable for the context and purpose stated.
Generally appropriate      Speech            A speech is “generally appropriate” as it can be used
                                             to convey information to a group, but it is less suited
                                             for communicating with classmates (friends from
                                             school). The choice may be considered “appropriate”
                                             if the speech is given in the context of an English ab
                                             initio class at school, with semi-formal to formal tone.
Generally inappropriate    Diary             A diary is “generally inappropriate” because it is for
                                             the writer’s reflections, and it is not usually used to
                                             share information and opinions with others (e.g.
                                             classmates).

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Informal or formal, but it should be consistent.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                           Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                Email             An email is “appropriate” because it is sent directly to
                                             the manager so they can do something about it. It is
                                             also discreet.
Generally appropriate      Social media      A social media posting is “generally appropriate for
                           posting           similar reasons above, except that this text type is
                                             more public. The choice may be considered
                                             “appropriate” if the post is clearly for the attention of
                                             the restaurant manager.
Generally inappropriate    Blog              A blog is “generally inappropriate” because it lacks
                                             an audience focus.


Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Formal
• Assertive and/or diplomatic tone

Task 5

 Your city has improved its public transport and you enjoy your journeys more. You want to
 recommend this way of travelling to members of the public. Write a text to explain what public
 transport you use, what the improvements are, and why people should use it.

 Article                              Pamphlet                                  Set of instructions

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:

• Explain why people should use it, for example:
        o Enjoyable experience
        o Reduces city traffic, good for the environment
        o More affordable

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                           Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                Article           An article is “appropriate” because it has a relatively
                                             large and targeted audience (members of the public
                                             living in the city), and it is suited to communicating
                                             information that is in the public’s interest. An article
                                             may include the writer’s informed opinion.
Generally appropriate      Pamphlet          A pamphlet is “generally appropriate” because it
                                             could be given out to members of the public or sent
                                             to their homes, although it does not typically include
                                             the writer’s personal opinion. The choice may be
                                             considered “appropriate” if the information is more
                                             depersonalized.
Generally inappropriate    Set of            A set of instructions is “generally inappropriate”
                           instructions      because the purpose of the task and the expected
                                             content is not about how to use a public transport
                                             system.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Formal to semi-formal
• Positive, encouraging tone

Task 6

 River pollution in your area is getting worse each year. You are very worried, and you want the local
 government to do something about it. Write a text to describe the problem, explain what the local
 government can do to help, and why it is important to do something now.

 Blog                               Letter                                Review

Criterion B:

Points to be covered:
• Describe the problem, for example:
        o Type of pollution, e.g. agricultural, chemical
• Explain what the local government can do to help, for example:
        o More policing/regulation
        o Community action, e.g. public clean up
• Explain why it is important to do something now, for example:
        o Prevent recurrence/it will get worse
        o Set a good example for environmental issues

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

                           Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                Letter            A letter is “appropriate” because it can be addressed
                                             to the specific individual(s) responsible in local
                                             government. It also provides a record of the issue
                                             having been raised.
Generally appropriate      Blog              A blog is “generally appropriate” because it is a way
                                             of raising an issue publicly, but it is not addressing a
                                             specific individual(s) with the power to act. The
                                             choice may be considered “appropriate” if the blog
                                             encourages readers to also seek action from the
                                             local government.
Generally inappropriate    Review            A review is “generally inappropriate” because it is
                                             typically used to evaluate an event or an attraction,
                                             rather than to call upon authorities to take action.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the stated task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”,
and the “generally inappropriate” text type can considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Formal
• Worried tone expecting action
