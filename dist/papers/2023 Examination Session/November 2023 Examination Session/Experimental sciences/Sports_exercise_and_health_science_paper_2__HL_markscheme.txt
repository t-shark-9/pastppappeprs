Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [50 marks] and TWO question in Section B [40 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

Markscheme format example:


     Question                                      Answers                                                    Notes                     Total

5      c    ii    this refers to the timing of the movements
                  OR
                  the extent to which the performer has control over the timing of the
                  movement ✔                                                                                                           2 max

                  external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve ✔
                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine ✔


1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.
                                                                               –4–                                                               8823 – 6602M


8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

                training will cause a depletion of energy stores e.g., ATP/ CP✔
                a reduction in energy source availability will increase the rate of fatigue✔

                sprint training will increase the levels of fatiguing by-products/ lactate/ lactic acid/

                training history will affect the individual’s tolerance to this by-product/ their ability to
                buffer these by-products and therefore affect the rate of fatigue✔

10   d   whole–part–whole
         learner first tries the whole skill to get a feel of movement✔                           Award max [3] for each method
         then practice individual parts before integrating back into whole skill✔
                                                                                                  Only credit reference to two methods
         Allows performers to focus on more challenging/ difficult aspects of the skill✔
         e.g., complete the long jump in full, then break down the run, the take off and then
         complete the full long jump routine✔

         progressive part
         learner experiences initial movement and then adds a new movement to the
         previous part building a sequence✔
         used when a skill is too complex/ difficult for the learner allowing each part to be
         mastered✔
         e.g., start with the run up, then add the take off, then add focus on the flight, then
         add focus on the landing✔                                                                                                              6

         part
         parts/ challenging/ dangerous elements of a skill are practised in isolation✔
         allows performers to develop master of each element✔
         used when the learning the skill in sequence is not vital✔
         e.g., isolate parts of the skill, such as the run up only, take-off and landing only✔

         whole
         skill is practised in its entirety✔
         e.g., complete the jump as one whole movement, run, take off, flight, landing✔
         fast and explosive movement, must be practised specific to the required
         movement, therefore can’t be broken down into component parts✔
