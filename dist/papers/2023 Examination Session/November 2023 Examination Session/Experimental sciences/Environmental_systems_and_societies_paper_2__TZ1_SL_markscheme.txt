Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                                          8823–9239M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.
                                                     –5–                                     8823–9239M


                                              Section A
1.   (a)   State the trophic level of zooplankton.                                                     [1]

           Primary consumer / second trophic level/2nd;

     (b)   State the relationship between POPs concentration and the trophic level.                    [1]

           POP concentration increases/is higher moving up to higher/at increasing trophic
           levels / positive/direct correlation / as one increases the other increases;

           Note: Do not credit biomagnification or bioconcentration in response to this
           question.

     (c)   Explain the relationship between POPs concentration and trophic level.                      [2]

           a.     POPs bioaccumulate/bioconcentrate within organisms/tissues, as they are taken up
           from surrounding environment/polluted ocean water/food;
           b.     … because POPs are non-biodegradable/don’t break down…;
           c.     …and result in biomagnification, as they pass from one trophic level to the next (across
           levels)...;
           d.     ...due to the decrease of biomass/energy (respiratory losses) up the food chain;


           Note: Do not award marks if similar statements are given in 2(b) and 2(c)

     (d)   Calculate, as a percentage, the efficiency of energy transfer between zooplankton
           and herring.                                                                                [1]

           (25/500) x 100 = 5 (%);

     (e)   Outline one strength and one weakness of a pyramid of productivity as a model to
           represent energy in an ecosystem.                                                           [2]

           Strength: [1 max]
           a. shows the flow/production rate of energy/biomass through a food chain (rather
               than the standing stock) / never inverted;
           b. tracks change over time (rather than "snapshot" in time);
           c. more efficient comparison of different ecosystems;
           d. Visual representation / simplification of complex system/ easy to communicate
               information to non-specialist;
           e. can be used to make predictions;

           Weakness: [1 max]
           f. difficult to place organisms that occupy more than one trophic level;
           g. hard to get accurate data because collection is difficult / inevitably some values
              are approximate;
           h. (estimating in field) may involve killing of organisms;
           i. oversimplification and loss of detail/complexities of interacting factors;
                                                   –6–                                         8823–9239M


2.   (a)   Using Figure 2(a), identify the month in which NOx emissions in Asia and Middle
           East has the greatest reduction.                                                                [1]

           June;

     (b)   Outline one reason for the NOx emission reductions during Covid lockdowns, shown
           in Figure 2(a).                                                                                 [1]

           reduced burning/combustion of fossil fuels, a source of NOx, due to reduced
           traffic/factory closures;


     (c)   Explain the relationship between the NOx emissions shown in Figure 2(a) and
           tropospheric ozone concentrations shown in Figure 2(b).                                         [2]

           a.   the two have a positive correlation/as NOx decreases so does tropospheric
                ozone;
           b.   …because NOx (is a primary pollutant) that can lead to tropospheric ozone
                formation (secondary pollutant);
           c.   …because NOx interacts with sunlight/UV (and sometimes VOCs) to produce
                tropospheric ozone;
           d.   tropospheric ozone continues to increase in some regions after NOx levels off /
                possibly because other factors (e.g. weather, other pollutants) influence
                tropospheric ozone production;

     (d)   Outline two pollution management strategies to reduce tropospheric ozone.                       [2]

           a. education campaigns to consume less fossil fuel/using energy efficient
              technologies/alternative energy sources/electric vehicles/public
              transportation/walking or cycling
           b. regulate and reduce burning of fossil fuels with government regulation or taxation /
              limits of when/which cars can be on the road (ex. Mexico city every other day
              driving / carpool lanes);
           c. use of catalytic converters/higher fuel quality to reduce NOx from car exhaust;

           Note: Credit any valid strategy that could reduce the use of fossil fuels

     (e)   NOx also contributes to acid deposition. Outline two impacts of acid deposition on
           living systems.                                                                           [2]

           a. damages the leaves of plants / the ability for plants photosynthesize / reduces
              agricultural productivity;
           b. nutrient leaching of soils;
           c. toxic effect from leached metals on aquatic organisms/plant roots;
           d. changes of soil or water pH kill organisms/push out of tolerance ranges;
           e. particles of sulphates/nitrates penetrate lungs and can lead to
              asthma/bronchitis/respiratory issues;

     (f)   State one method that could be used to restore an ecosystem damaged by acid
           deposition.                                                                               [1]

           liming / reforestation / restocking fish / extracting toxic metals from water/soils /
           adding nutrients/fertilisers to soils / adding woodash / planting acid resistant plants
           to bind soil;
                                                  –7–                                         8823–9239M


3.   (a)   With reference to Figure 3, identify the stage that represents the greatest food loss
           and waste in North America.                                                               [1]

           use / stage 5;

     (b)   Outline two strategies to reduce food waste at the ‘distribution and retail’ stage in
           North America.                                                                            [2]

           a.   ensure proper temperature/packaging for transport/storage to reduce spoilage;
           b.   use of proper storage/pesticides to avoid pest infestation in stores;
           c.   buy/sell “ugly” fruits and vegetables;
           d.   buy/sell products/GMOs that have a more durable shelf life;
           e.   donate unsold food/discount food near expiry to avoid waste at retail;
           f.   reduce distribution losses by feeding locally;

           Note: Accept other valid points relevant to stage 4.

     (c)   With reference to a stage in Figure 3, describe one reason for a difference
           between food loss and waste in a less economically developed country (LEDC).              [2]

           LEDCs might have more waste in stage 1/2/3/4/5…; [1max]
           …due to… [1max]
           a. …more pest infestation due to lack of pesticides (stage 1);
           b. …poor storing conditions/ higher ambient temperatures increasing spoilage
               during handling/transportation (stage 2 or 4);
           c. ...less efficient facilities/machinery may lead to increased waste during
               harvest/handling/packaging (stage 2 or 3);
           LEDCs might have less waste in stage 1/2/3/4/5…; [1max]
           …due to… [1max]
           d. …subsistence farming reduced productivity (stage 1);
           e. …local consumption of grown food reducing need for handling and processing
               (stages 2 or 3);
           f. …buying/eating the cheaper “ugly” food (stages 4 or 5);
           g. …consuming less food due to less income (stages 4 or 5);
           h. ...consuming lower on food chain/less meat (stages 4 or 5);
           i.
           Note: Accept any point of equal significance
           Only award credit for reasons that are correctly linked with “less” or “more” waste
                                             –8–                                          8823–9239M


(d)   Discuss the sustainability of two solid domestic waste disposal strategies that can
      be used to manage food waste.                                                               [4]

      a.   Composting is turning food waste into natural fertilizer / reduces waste to landfill
           / emits less methane (aerobic composting)…;
      b.   …but does not apply to meat/dairy/liquids / may associate with pests/disease;
      c.   Methane collection from landfills would contribute to sustainable/low-impact
           energy production / sustainably designed landfills (e.g. liner, collecting &
           treating leachate) is an efficient method of dealing with huge amounts of
           waste…;
      d.   …but landfills are notorious for emitting various pollutants contaminating
           ground/water/air / prevent any possibility of re-using food waste / require large
           amount of land;
      e.   Incineration would efficiently reduce volume of food waste / require less land…;
      f.   …but would release harmful air pollutants / would require a lot of energy/initial
           investment;
      g.   anaerobic digestion/fermentation may turn food waste into biogas/fuel...;
      h.   ...but requires facilities (digesters)/expertise not available in LEDCs;

       Allow [1 max] for a conclusion, like “landfill/incineration overall increase EF /
      composting overall contributes to lower EF” or comparing the sustainability of the
      SDWs discussed “compost is a less expensive SDW than incineration / compost is
      less efficient for management of large quantities of food waste”

      Award [2 max] for each SDW strategy (i.e. one mark for positive, one for negative)

      Note: only award mark once for same point for different strategies
      Note: recycling is not a valid method
                                                 –9–                                         8823–9239M


                                              Section B
4.   (a)   Outline the difficulties in determining the carrying capacity of the human population.   [4]

           carrying capacity for humans difficult to determine because:
            a. human ingenuity, meaning that humans are able to substitute one material for
               another;
            b. variations in lifestyles;
            c. technological developments that give rise to continual changes in the resources
               required and that are available for consumption;
            d. wide range of resources used;
            e. importation of resources;
            f. climate change may cause significant/rapid changes in resource availability;

     (b)   Evaluate the potential value of aquaculture for providing food for future generations.   [7]

           Aquaculture pros:
           a. Provides fish for consumption without overfishing;
           b. Producing more seafood can alleviate food insecurity;
           c. Aquaculture creates economic opportunities;
           d. Advances in technology are increasing efficiency/potential of aquaculture;
           Provides additional/healthy source of protein / seafood becoming more popular;

           Aquaculture cons:
           e. loss of habitats;
           f. pollution from feed/feces;
           g. pollution from antifouling agents/antibiotics;
           h. spread of diseases;
           i. escaped species that are not native could become invasive;
           j. if escaped species are GMOs they could alter the wild gene pool/outcompete;

           Note: [1 mark] for supported conclusion
                                                – 10 –                                 8823–9239M


(c)   Human population dynamics are influenced more by social, cultural, political and
      economic factors than by resource availability.

      Discuss the validity of this statement.                                                  [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
      markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with ‘understanding
      concepts’) This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
      deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of population dynamics; carrying
         capacity; ecological footprint; limits to growth; Malthus v Boserup; population
         policies; pro-natal & anti-natal; contraception; tax incentives; abortion policies;
         marital age; female emancipation; literacy; religions/ideologies; migrations;
         wars; child labour; importation of resources; density dependent factors; resource
         exploitation; sustainable yields; demographic transition; renewability of
         resources; recycling; etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking population dynamics (growth and decline)
         with a wide range of factors including social (e.g. role of women), cultural (e.g.
         religious imperatives), political (e.g. population policies), economic (e.g. tax
         incentives), resource availability (e.g. food production, energy, water, pollution
         management) etc
      • examples of named social, cultural, political, economic factors that influence
         population growth in a range of different named countries and societies (MEDCs
         and LEDCs, Western and Eastern, tropical and temperate) along with examples
         of different resources that may limit population growth, and different
         management strategies addressing the availability of resources.
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which sociopolitical factors are more or less
         influential than resource availability on the growth and/or decline of human
         populations considering both the pros and cons for the argument selected.
      • a conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
         examples given, e.g. Human populations in the latter stages of demographic
         transition are largely regulated by sociopolitical factors and generally it is only
         the populations at earlier stages of the DTM that are literally limited by resource

5.   (a)   Outline the differences between anthropocentric and technocentric value systems.          [4]

           Anthropocentric [2 max]
           a. Sustainable management is a duty of human societies / environmental
               manager;
           b. Population control given equal weight to resource use;
           c. Strong legal regulation by authorities / imposing environmental taxes, fees,
               compensations;
           d. It is moral for human societies to benefit from natural capital;
           e. Encourages debate to reach a consensual, pragmatic approach to solving
               environmental problems;

           Technocentric [2 max]
           f. believes technological developments can provide solutions to environmental
               problems;
           g. provides an optimistic view of the role humans can play in improving the lot of
               humanity;
           h. encourages scientific research in order to form policies and to understand how
               systems can be controlled, manipulated or changed to solve resource
               depletion;
           i. sees a pro-growth agenda as necessary for society’s improvement / believes
               that economic growth can be sustained without environmental harm;

           Note: any valid and exclusive characteristic of the given value system can be
           credited.

     (b)   Evaluate the use of ecological footprint in assessing the sustainability of a society.    [7]

           definition of Ecological Footprint [1 max]
           a. an ecological footprint represents the hypothetical area of land required by a
                society/group/individual to fulfill all their resource needs

           Strengths/advantages: [4 max]
           b. a useful snapshot of the sustainability of a population’s lifestyle;
           c. a tangible tool for individuals/governments/countries to measure/quantify their
               environmental impact/to identify necessary changes in lifestyle;
           d. iconic symbol/image for raising awareness of environmental issues;
           e. the footprint size considers both resource needs and waste assimilation;
           f. as a model for monitoring environmental impact the ecological footprint can
               allow for direct comparisons between groups and individuals, e.g. MEDCs and
               LEDCs;
           g. can provide a (quantitative) estimate of human carrying capacity;

           Limitations/disadvantages: [4 max]
           h. does not include all information on the environmental impacts of human
                activities;
           i. only a model so simplified/not precise;
           j. approximation of actual figures which cannot be accurately calculated;
           k. does not show types of resources used / shows only total resources;
           l. negative in approach so could be perceived as de-motivating;

           Conclusion [1 max]
                                                   – 12 –                                  8823–9239M


(c) Urbanization has had a greater effect on the quality and availability of freshwater resources than
         agricultural activities.
         Discuss the validity of this statement.                                                         [9]

         The following guide for using the mark bands suggests certain features that may be
         offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the
         markbands (although ESS terminology has been conflated with ‘understanding
         concepts’) This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
         seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for when
         deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

         Answers may include:
         • understanding concepts and terminology of urbanization, waste-water
            treatment; leaching of heavy metals; sedimentation; suspended solids;
            landscape changes; well-drilling; aquifers; urban growth; grey water cycling; acid
            precipitation; reverse osmosis; pesticide pollution; bioaccumulation;
            biomagnification; irrigation; flooding; drip irrigation; leaching of fertilisers;
            eutrophication;
         • breadth in addressing and linking urbanisation and agricultural activities with
            a range of associated impacts on quality and availability of freshwater including
            pollution; waste disposal; sustainable management; overexploitation;
            development of irrigation/drinking systems/dams etc
         • examples of named pollutants from urban and agricultural sources; named
            strategies for sustainable management of water in urban and agricultural
            contexts; named countries/societies in which issues arise;
         • balanced analysis evaluating the relative impact (negative or positive) of both
            urbanisation and agriculture on water quality and availability and the extent to
            which these may be mitigated through sustainable management
         • a conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
            examples given, e.g. although urbanization creates a broader range of
            negative effects on freshwater quality than agriculture it also provides methods
            for the production of freshwater from sewage and sea water.

6.   (a)   Outline how the abundance of a motile species in an ecosystem can be measured.              [4]

           a.   abundance of motile organisms can be measured using direct and/or indirect
                methods;
           b.   numbers can be counted from aerial images/ satellite images/trigger cameras
                over a representative area
           c.   overall population numbers can be calculated from extrapolation to whole area;
           d.   mark recapture techniques can be used to sample populations / description of
                Lincoln Index method/equation;

           g.   appropriate time interval between release and recapture

     (b)   Explain one natural and one human-caused factor that influences changes in
           biodiversity.                                                                               [7]

                   a. mass extinctions of the past/local extinctions caused by various natural factors,
                        have (temporarily) reduced biodiversity;

           (Evolution)
                   e. Evolution is a natural factor that has led to increased biodiversity;
                   f. Mutation leads to increases in genetic diversity;
                   g. Natural selection may lead to some reduction in genetic diversity;
                   h. Speciation has led to increased species diversity;
                   i. Adaptive radiation has led to increased speciation/genetic diversity;

           Human caused factor [4 max]:

                   j. human activity is considered to be causing a sixth mass extinction;
                   k. e.g. habitat destruction/deforestation/urbanisation;
                   l. e.g. pollution of freshwater water bodies/oceans/soils/atmosphere/leading to
                        climate change/associated environmental hazards;
                   m. e.g. over-exploitation of resources/overfishing/hunting/intensive agriculture;

           (Conservation)
                 n. conservation/restoration of ecosystems has led to increased biodiversity;

                 p. e.g. ex situ conservation/zoos/plantations/seed banks reduce loss of biodiversity;
                 q. e.g. legislation/trade agreements protecting species e.g. CITES/fishing

(c)   Discuss the effectiveness of habitat-based conservation in relation to the impacts of
      climate change.                                                                          [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be offered in
      responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria in each of the markbands (although
      ESS terminology has been conflated with ‘understanding concepts’) This guide simply
      provides some possible inclusions and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It
      outlines the kind of elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the
      specific mark within that band.
      Answers may include:
      •   understanding concepts and terminology of habitat-based conservation;
          species-based conservation; reserves; national parks; size; shape; edge effects;
          corridors; buffer zones; ecotourism; climate change; precipitation patterns;
          global warming; biome shifts; migrations; extinctions; salinity change; melting
          glaciers; hazardous weather events; droughts; rising sea levels; salt intrusion
          etc
      •   breadth in addressing and linking a good range of features of habitat-based
          conservation including design and management of reserves and their relevance
          in addressing a range of impacts from climate change including those leading to
          loss of biodiversity and changing distribution patterns.
      •   examples of named conservation areas from a variety of named
          regions/countries and examples of named species impacted by climate change
          along with relevant named organisations currently addressing habitat
          conservation (e.g. World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Greenpeace, Friends of the
          Earth International and Earth First!)
      •   balanced analysis evaluating the degree to which the various aspects of
          conservation areas can or cannot effectively address the threats of climate
          change including both strengths and limitations of habitat-based conservation.
      •   A conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
          examples given, e.g. habitat-based conservation strategies are effective,
          especially when contrasted to species approach, but cannot compensate for
          climate change impacts on their own; there needs to be international
          cooperation and political will toward mitigating climate change altogether.

7.   (a)   Outline two transfers and two transformations within a soil system.                     [4]

           Transfers [2 max]:
           a. biological mixing of nutrients and inorganic material;
           b. movement of water due to percolation/infiltration;
           c. minerals dissolved in water moving through soil/leaching;
           d. feeding/ingesting of organic matter;
           e. uptake of nutrients by plants;
           f. soil erosion by wind/water.
           g. sediment deposition;

           Transformations [2 max]:
           h. decomposition of organic matter/detritus/by decomposers;
           i. weathering of parent material resulting in increase of inorganic matter,
           j. nutrient cycling example e.g. carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus;
           k. respiration by living organisms;

     (b)   Compare and contrast the pathways of energy through the atmosphere and the
           pathways of energy through an ecosystem.                                                [7]

           In both (compare) [4 max]:
           a. energy is not created or destroyed.
           b. the source of energy is the sun.
           c. energy is transformed from one form to another.
           d. energy is lost as radiated heat.
           e. sunlight energy is reflected, absorbed, radiated.

           Contrast [4 max]:
           f. energy from the sun is reflected by clouds in the atmosphere
           g. …and by light surfaces/ice in ecosystems.
           h. energy from the sun is absorbed by clouds/GHG in the atmosphere
           i. ...and by the earth’s surface/organisms/soil/water in ecosystems;
           j. the energy from the sun is used in photosynthesis by plants only in ecosystems
               (not in atmosphere);
           k. energy is lost as the radiation of heat through respiration in ecosystems as it is
               passed through food chains
           l. ...whereas in the atmosphere it is lost through radiation from resonating
               GHGs;
           m. transfers/transformations of energy in ecosystems often go through living
               organisms, but not in the atmosphere;

(c)   To what extent are food production systems impacted by anthropogenic (human-
      caused) changes to the atmosphere.                                                       [9]

      The following guide for using the mark bands suggests certain features that may be

          atmosphere do or do not influence food production systems either positively or
          negatively.
      •   a conclusion that is consistent with and supported by analysis and
          examples given, e.g. There are a wide range of anthropogenic influences on
          the atmosphere that impact both terrestrial and aquatic food production systems
          and although some impacts may positively affect productivity, the great majority
          tend to reduce it.
