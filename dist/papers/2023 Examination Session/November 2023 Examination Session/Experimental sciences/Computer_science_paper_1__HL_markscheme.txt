Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
in the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
“FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance

            Software needs to be tested with typical/extreme/invalid data so when the client (graphic
            design company) gets to use it most (or all) of the errors have been corrected;
            this can save money (if bugs are caught in the earlier stages, it costs much less to fix them);
            this adds to security/the client gets a trustworthy application (keeps client’s information and
            data safe)/vulnerability free - problems and risks are eliminated beforehand;
            this increases software quality/brings client satisfaction (best possible client experience);

             An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor;
             that halts the current process;

      (ii)   Award [3 max].
             The microprocessor responds to that interrupt with an interrupt handler/an ISR
             (Interrupt Service Routine)/a routine which instructs the microprocessor on how to
             handle the interrupt;
             the routine can send a signal to output transducers;
             to immediately turn the traffic lights to red to stop the cars;

             The microprocessor receives an interrupt request and passes control to the interrupt
             handler;
             it may wait a certain amount of time before sending the signal to output transducer;
             to turn the traffic lights to red to stop the cars;


(d)   (i)    Award [2 max].
             Cameras improve traffic flow;
             by controlling the movement of vehicles and determining traffic light timing;

             Traffic cameras help to reduce accidents;
             by controlling the movement of vehicles/identifying drivers who speed;

             Cameras improve safety/have a preventive/disciplining effect;
             can be used to identify defaulters and to take legal action/make them pay fine;

             Installation and deployment of automated traffic cameras often pays for itself in the
             long run;
             is still far less expensive than physical policing/traffic cameras can operate tirelessly
             24/7;

             Traffic cameras can be deployed with very little cost to infrastructure;
             as they can run independently from the electrical grid only on solar power;


      (ii)   Award [2 max].
             Privacy is an issue;
             as traffic cameras enable monitoring the activities of people (drivers, pedestrians);

             It can be costly;
             to install/maintain a large number of cameras and monitoring systems;

             Cameras can be vulnerable to damage;
             For example, wetness, moisture;

             Cameras can be vulnerable to misuse;
             for example, criminals/hackers might have worked out ways to disable or disconnect
             cameras;

            A linked list is a data structure made of a chain of nodes, the external (head) pointer points
            to the first node and the link part of the last element of the list points to null/nil/none;
            each node contains a data field (value) and a pointer (to the next node);


      (b)   Award [3 max].
            A queue data structure reflects the queuing which adds nodes at the end (enqueue)
            and deletes nodes from the beginning of the queue (dequeue)/FIFO data structure;

            the data about the patient which is seen by a doctor would be deleted from the beginning of
            the queue;
            and as patients arrive their data would be added to the end of the queue;
            which is not really suitable because emergency cases may arise who need to be seen by a
            doctor immediately/first so the patients’ data should be added at the beginning of the queue;
            or a patient may decide to go home/leave the queue and the data should be deleted from the
            middle/end of the queue;


      (c)   Award [3 max].
            A new node for a new patient would be created and the data about the patient should be
            stored into the data field of the new node;
            this new node should be inserted at the beginning of the singly linked list;
            so, set the next pointer of the new node to point to the node pointed to by the external
            pointer/make the link part of the new node pointing to the existing first node;
            then the external pointer to the list should be changed to make new node as the first node/
            the external pointer should be updated to point to the new node;


      (d)   Award [4 max].
            Create a new node for a new patient and place the data about this patient into the data field
            of the node;
            severity of illness defines insertion position of the node/where to place the node;
            the new node should be inserted in the middle of the list (after the node containing data
            about the patient who has more serious symptoms and before the node containing data
            about the patient who has less serious symptoms than the new patient);
            search the list for the node prior to the insertion position;
            set the next pointer of the new node to point to the node pointed to by the next pointer of
            prior node;
            set the next pointer of the prior node to point to the new node;

            Size of a static data structure is fixed whilst dynamic structures are more flexible/size can be
            changed;
            memory is allocated to a static data structure at compile time (is predetermined) whilst
            memory is allocated to the dynamic data structure as the program executes/at run-time;
            elements of a static data structure can be directly accessed whilst access to the items in a
            dynamic data structure is sequential;
            a dynamic structure come at extra costs of memory to store address pointers, so it uses
            more memory than a static structure (holding the same amount of data);
            elements can be inserted into/deleted from a dynamic data structure just by manipulating
            pointers/by updating addresses without shuffling/shifting/resorting as in a static data
            structure;
