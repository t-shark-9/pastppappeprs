Use the question-specific markscheme together with the markbands. Award up to the
maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Explain how the availability of substitutes for a good and whether a good is a necessity
             affect its price elasticity of demand.                                                     [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: substitutes, necessities, price elasticity of demand.
             • Explanation: that the greater the number of close substitutes there are for a good, the
               more price elastic the demand for it tends to be and the demand for necessities tends to
               be more inelastic.
             • Diagram: to show demand curves with different price elasticities of demand.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only substitutes or necessities in the question item
             is addressed.

(b)   Using real-world examples, examine the importance of price elasticity of demand to
      firms and to governments.                                                                [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: price elasticity of demand.
      • Explanation: of how firms can use PED to increase their total revenue and governments
        can use PED to increase the revenues from indirect taxation and/or to address a market
        failure such as reducing the consumption of demerit goods.
      • Diagram: using demand and supply diagrams to show changes in total revenue and tax
        revenue when demand is inelastic and elastic.
      • Real-world examples: of price changes with different price elasticities of demand that lead
        to increasing total revenue and tax revenue.
      • Synthesis (examine): consideration of the problems for firms and governments of using
        price elasticity of demand to increase total revenue and tax revenue, such as the impact
        of time on price elasticity of demand, the problems of measuring price elasticity of
        demand, situations where a change in price would not lead to a rise/fall in total
        revenue/tax revenue, and other factors that might affect revenue, such as changes in
        consumer income.

      A maximum of [9] should be awarded if only firms or governments in the question item is
      addressed.

2.     (a)   Explain the effects of an improvement in technology and an increase in the number of skilled
             workers on the full employment level of output (potential output).                      [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: full employment level of output, potential output.
             • Explanation: of how improvements in technology increase the quality of capital and an
               increase in the number of skilled workers increases the quality and/or quantity of labour.
               Both increase the potential output and cause the long-run aggregate supply curve to shift
               outwards increasing the full employment level of output.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the view that economic growth will always lead to an
      improvement in living standards in a country.                                          [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: economic growth, living standards.
      • Explanation: that economic growth leads to rising incomes and employment as real GDP
        rises enabling greater consumption of goods and services and possible improvements in
        healthcare, education and infrastructure as tax revenues rise.
      • Diagram: using a PPC or AD/AS diagram to show economic growth.
      • Real-world examples: of how economic growth has led to rising living standards in a
        country.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): consideration of the negative impact of economic growth on living
        standards in a country, such as environmental costs and a widening in the distribution of
        income, degree to which government invests in merit goods and infrastructure and use of
        the word “always”. The answer could also consider non-monetary factors that affect living
        standards, such as community life, leisure time, and crime rates.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: trade protection, dumping, infant industry.
             • Explanation: that trade protection can be used to protect an infant (new) industry so
               that it can establish itself, achieve efficiencies and compete in international markets.
               Trade protection may be used to counteract dumping when domestic producers face
               unfair competition from foreign competitors that export goods at very low prices or
               prices below the cost of production.
             • Diagram: a trade protection diagram such as tariff or quota used to support an infant
               industry or to counteract dumping.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only preventing dumping or protecting an infant
             industry in the question item is addressed.

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the effects of a country imposing a tariff on a good. [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: tariff.
      • Explanation: of how a tariff will increase prices for domestic consumers, decrease their
        quantity demanded and reduce their consumer surplus. A tariff will also increase the price
        for domestic producers, increase their quantity supplied and increase their revenues and
        producer surplus. Additionally, a tariff will increase domestic government tax revenue and
        reduce the quantity imported.
      • Diagram: a tariff diagram to show the impact on consumers, producers, and the
        government.
      • Real-world examples: of where a tariff has been applied to an industry and the impact it
        has had on consumers, producers, and the government.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): effect on different stakeholders, consideration of the advantages
        and disadvantages of imposing a tariff such as retaliation by other countries, which affects
        domestic producers’ export markets and how tariffs might lead to higher costs of
        production for domestic producers, causing cost-push inflation. There could also be
        evaluation of the efficiency losses caused by a tariff.
