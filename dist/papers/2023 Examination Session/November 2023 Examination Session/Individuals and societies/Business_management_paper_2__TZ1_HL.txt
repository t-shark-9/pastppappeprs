Answer one question from this section.
1.    Xiaoping Enterprises (XE)
      Xiaoping Enterprises (XE) manufactures hang
      gliders and originally manufactured one model,
      the Seagull. In 2021, XE had $1 300 000 in capital
      expenditure to create a new production line to
      manufacture a new model hang glider, the Horizon.
      XE would sell each Horizon hang glider for $5000.
      XE’s chief financial officer (CFO) budgeted for the
      sale of 2400 Horizon hang gliders in the first year.
      In 2022, production and sales began.
      XE’s CFO prepared data to analyse the variances in production of the Horizon (see Table 1).
                      Table 1: Budgeted and actual profit and loss account figures
                          for XE’s Horizon model for 2022 (all figures in $000s)

      On 31 December 2022, XE stopped producing the Horizon and sold the machinery that had
      been purchased to create the new production line for the model for $850 000.

2.   Bonds Electrical Supplies (BE)

     Bonds Electrical Supplies (BE) is a wholesaler operating in the tertiary sector. In 2022, BE
     purchased more stock than usual to take advantage of discounts that several electrical
     supply manufacturers were offering. However, much of this new stock did not sell.

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Anna’s pet salon

     In 2024, Anna Holborn plans to start a new business: a pet
     grooming salon. Although Anna has no managerial experience,
     she is eager to work for herself. In Anna’s city, three pet salons
     already exist. The market is very competitive.

                        Table 5: Selected data on the three existing pet salons

               Salon              Prices            Reputation out of         Independent or
                                                      four stars (★)             franchise

           A                Medium              ★★★                         Franchise

           B                Low                 ★                           Independent

     Anna is considering two options for opening her salon:
     y Option 1: Open it as an independent business, called AH Salon.
     y Option 2: Open it as a franchise of Paws Boutique (PB), a nationwide chain of pet grooming
       salon franchises that currently has no franchise in Anna’s city.
                 Table 6: Anna’s forecasted initial costs of starting a pet salon as an
                  independent business (Option 1) or as a PB franchise (Option 2)

                                              Option 1: As an             Option 2: As a PB
                                           independent business               franchise

               Equipment                             $15 000                  $12 000

               Grooming supplies                     $10 000                  $10 000

               Initial local promotion                $5000                     $2000

               Legal fees                             $2000                     $4000

               Purchase of franchise       Not applicable                     $10 000

               Total                                 $32 000                  $38 000

     If Anna buys a PB franchise, she must pay 5 % of revenue to the franchiser. The franchiser
     will pay for regional and national – but not local – promotion. Anna must purchase equipment
     from the franchiser. In other cities, PB franchises are rated medium in terms of price and ★★
     in terms of reputation.
     Anna has limited financial resources. She has prepared a forecast for the first year. She
     forecasts, as a PB franchise, an average of 200 pet grooming services per month at a price
     of $30. As an independent business, she forecasts that sales would be 10 % lower. For both
     options, fixed costs, including her salary, would be $2800 per month. Variable costs would be
     $5 per pet grooming.

4.   Vegan Supplies (VS)

     Five years ago, Michael Thompson opened Vegan Supplies (VS) as a vegan food*
     wholesaler selling to the restaurant industry. Two years ago, VS also began producing
     its own range of high-quality vegan food. VS’s vegan product range includes cheese and
     burgers, kebabs and sausages. Michael built VS’s customer base for this product range
     by frequent attendance at trade exhibitions. VS mostly employs staff who are vegan, and
     Michael has a broad objective of promoting veganism. VS’s vision statement is “to build a
     vegan world”. Michael encourages an organizational culture designed to promote vegan
     philosophy and lifestyles.

     A total of 60 % of VS’s sales are products purchased for resale, and the remaining 40 % of
     sales are from VS’s own vegan product range. However, sales of the VS brand vegan foods
     from their own production are increasing, and Michael is keen to see this trend continue.

     Michael works closely with suppliers and restaurants to provide the products that restaurants
     want. VS mainly uses below-the-line promotion to market their products. VS’s quality control
     inspector is approaching retirement, and Michael is considering whether to keep a system of
     quality control or move to a system of quality assurance. He is aware that changes must be
     made to operate a system of quality assurance, such as total quality management (TQM).
     Michael must convince employees that the move to quality assurance is worthwhile. Giving
     employees responsibility for their own working may prove challenging. Michael plans to
     invest in different training methods to ensure the change works effectively.



* vegan food: food that does not contain animal products, including meat, dairy,
  and eggs

     (a)   Define the term objective.[2]

     (b)   With reference to VS, explain two elements of organizational culture.                        [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for VS of using below-the-line promotion. [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether Michael should move from a system of quality control to a system
           of quality assurance.                                                             [10]

5.   Ultimate Warrior Gym PLC (UWG)

     Ultimate Warrior Gym PLC (UWG) has 212 gyms nationwide. Ali Smith is the chairman and
     majority shareholder. UWG’s business model involves providing high-tech equipment and
     employing personal trainers (PTs). In the past, UWG has struggled to recruit well-qualified
     PTs. UWG encourages its gym managers to be intrapreneurs.

     UWG is competitively priced, offers monthly contracts, and is open 24 hours a day, seven
     days a week. UWG uses social media marketing, including online forums. Through these
     forums, many members and PTs have formed friendships that give membership a rewarding
     social dimension. 95 % of UWG’s members renew their monthly contract.

     PTs are paid minimum wage but are allowed to organize private training sessions with
     UWG’s members. Consequently, it is common for only one member of staff to be on
     duty at a time. Recently, a gym member was seriously injured while lifting inappropriate
     weights unsupervised.

     The accident was a news item in the national media and required a crisis management
     response. Ali immediately recorded a video and posted it to UWG’s social media platforms.
     Apologizing for the accident, he announced that the PT contracts will be changed and they
     will no longer be allowed to arrange private training sessions. Ali also offered compensation
     to the person who was injured. However, an image mocking UWG was shared 50 000 times
     on social media.

     The crisis management response pacified investors, but 30 % of the PTs are conducting
     strike action, and some gyms have had to close due to a lack of employees. Comments on
     UWG’s online forums indicate that most members sympathize with the PTs.

     Ali is considering which industrial/employee relations methods UWG could use to get the PTs
     to accept a new contract.

     (a)   Define the term intrapreneur.[2]

     (b)   With reference to UWG, explain two reasons why Ali’s crisis management response
           may have been effective.                                                                    [4]
