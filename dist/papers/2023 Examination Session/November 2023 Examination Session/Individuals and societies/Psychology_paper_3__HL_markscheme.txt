1.   (a)   Identify the research method used and outline two characteristics of the method.           [3]

           Award [1] for identification of correct research method.

           Focus-group interview (acceptable alternative terms: focus-group, group interview)

           Answers related to an outline of characteristics of the method may include two of the
           following characteristics: [1] per relevant point. Maximum of [2].

           • A focus-group interview is carried out with a small group of participants who all have
             something in common and all take part in the interview at the same time.
           • A focus-group interview is a discussion guided by a facilitator. The facilitator keeps
             the conversation focused and brings the group back to the topic if need be.
           • The facilitator may use a guide with a list of topics developed in advance, but it is
             possible to adjust the topics. This is beneficial because the discussion between
             participants may open up new areas of interest that the researcher has not
             considered.
           • In a focus-group interview, participants are encouraged to talk amongst themselves
             rather than to the facilitator.
           • Participants can use their own language, and this together with the special dynamic
             in a focus group helps to generate rich data.
           • Because a focus-group interview is very similar to everyday interactions, it is
             considered to have higher ecological validity than other forms of interviews.
           • A focus-group interview can experience issues related to group dynamics. These
             include conformity/social desirability bias, some participants sharing less and an
             unwillingness to share personal information in front of other participants.


     (b)   Describe the sampling method used in the study.                                            [3]

           Award [1] for naming the correct sampling method.

           Purposive sampling.

           Description of the sampling method may include two of the following characteristics:
           Award [1] per relevant point, up to a maximum of [2].

           No marks should be awarded for description of the sample rather than the sampling
           method.
           • A purposive sample is a non-probability sampling technique, which means that
              participants are not chosen randomly from a target population but rather based on
              specific selection criteria / salient characteristics.
           • Purposive sampling is used when researchers have a clear idea of the
              characteristics they want to study.
           • A purposive sample is a relatively easy procedure because all the researcher has
              to do is select people who fit the criteria. However, finding these specific
              participants is not necessarily easy.
           • Researchers can use an already established network to gain participants.
           • A purposive sample is flexible because it can be supplemented with more
              participants during the research process if needed.
           • A purposive sample is inherently biased because the participants are chosen based
             on characteristics that the researcher judges to be salient. It is not likely to be
             representative of a population.

(c)   Suggest one alternative or one additional research method that could be used to
      investigate the aim of the original study, giving one reason for your choice.                [3]

      Award [1] for naming an alternative or additional research method, and up to [2] for
      reason with rationale.

      The candidate may choose to write about an alternative or an additional method. Either
      approach to answering the question is acceptable. The rationale may differ depending
      on which is chosen.

      If more than one method is suggested, only the first method can be considered for credit.

      Suitable alternative or additional research methods and reasons (with rationale) could be,
      but are not limited to:

      Semi-structured interviews
      • The semi-structured interview as an additional research method would allow
        triangulation and could compensate for the limitations of the focus group – such as
        issues around group dynamics.
      • A semi-structured interview can be used to elaborate on some of the themes
        obtained in the focus groups. The SSI can be tailored to the research question, in
        this study, what adolescents thought of the mental health programme they had
        completed. The interview guide can also be made to fit the age group being
        interviewed. This could give more in-depth information on both the benefits of the
        programme as well as any criticisms of it. This would help in making revisions of the
        programme, for example, focusing more on promoting positive mental health and
        concentrating less on problems.
      • The semi-structured interview as an alternative research method would allow
        participants to have greater anonymity which may allow the participants to feel more
        comfortable to share, especially given the sensitive nature of the topic.

      Surveys:
      • A survey with questionnaires using closed and some open-ended questions is less
        time consuming as it is easy to collect and analyse large amounts of quantitative
        data. The survey can be used as an alternative method in order to include all
        adolescents who have completed the school-based mental health programme. This
        could result in a larger group, which is more representative of the entire population
        and it would be easier to generalize findings. However, because of the nature of a
        questionnaire the data may not represent the true meaning of an experience.
      • Data from the survey could also be used as a follow-up to the focus group interviews
        in order to check whether the findings from the focus group interviews can be
        supported (method triangulation)
      • Surveys generally allow researchers to collect a large amount of data in a relatively
        short period and they are less expensive than qualitative methods.
      • With a survey it is easy to analyse the data statistically. If the sample is randomized
        then the findings can be generalized to a target population.

2.   Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study and explain if further ethical
     considerations could be applied.                                                              [6]

     Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study: Award [1] per relevant
     point made, up to a maximum of [3].

     If a candidate names relevant ethical considerations without also accurately describing them,
     a maximum of [1] should be awarded.

     • Informed consent: The participants were fully informed and signed consent forms. This
       means that they were aware of the aims of the study.
     • Parental consent: The researcher also needed to receive consent from a parent because
       the participants were younger than 16 (they were aged 13-15 years old).
     • Deception: The participants were NOT deceived and the researchers had no reasons to
       use deception. The parents were also given information about the aims of the study.
     • Confidentiality: Participants were told that their data would be kept confidential. This
       involves all of their personal information, the recordings, transcripts, notes and analysis
       being kept in secure storage. Researchers will also provide clarity for participants
       regarding how and when their data will be destroyed.
     • Any other relevant points.


     Explain if further ethical considerations could be applied. Award [1] per relevant point made,
     up to a maximum of [3].

     If a candidate names relevant ethical considerations without also accurately explaining them,
     a maximum of [1] should be awarded.

     • Privacy: Since this study focuses on sensitive issues and the risk of depression
       researchers should take care to inform participants that the focus group interviews could
       potentially touch on issues that they would feel were private and that they had the right to
       refuse to answer. This is important as some participants may find it upsetting to have
       revealed how they feel about themselves.
     • Anonymity: Participants in a study must be sure that nobody can identify them in
       research reports. However complete anonymity cannot be provided because the other
       participants and the interviewer in each focus group know who participated in their
       interview.
     • Right to withdraw: Before the study started participants should have been informed that
       they could withdraw from the study at any point. And that they could withdraw their data
       even after they have participated in the focus group interviews.
     • Protection from harm: In this study, it is in particularly important to make sure that the
       participants do not suffer from psychological harm. Since the study is about their
       participation in a mental health programme, the researcher must be attentive to personal
       and sensitive issues. In addition, since these are group discussions, the researcher
       should divert or even stop a discussion that may harm a participant.
     • Debriefing: The researchers should make sure that all participants are debriefed after the
       study is over, and that they have the opportunity to ask questions. The researchers
       should also be attentive to the possibility of vulnerable participants who may need support
       or counselling and make sure that this is offered to those who need it. This is particularly
       important because the participants are so young and the topic of investigation touches
       upon very sensitive issues.
     • Any other relevant points.

3.   Discuss how a researcher in this study could ensure that the results of the study are credible.     [9]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     Marks should be awarded according to the descriptors in the markbands.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of how the
     researcher in this study could ensure that the results of the study in the stimulus material are
     credible.

     Candidates may refer to measures that were taken in the study or suggest measures that
     could have been taken, or a combination of the two. Each of these approaches are equally
     acceptable.

     Credibility refers to the degree to which the research gives a true picture of what is being
     investigated and that the results represent the perceptions and opinions of the research
     participants. Credibility is a factor in establishing trustworthiness in qualitative research. (A
     definition of credibility is not necessary to reach the top markband.)

     Discussions related to how the researchers in this study could ensure that the results of the
     study are credible could include, but are not limited to:
     • Collecting rich data: Qualitative research uses an idiographic approach where the focus is
        on subjective data representing participants’ own opinions and experiences with the
        phenomenon under study. In qualitative research, rich data can encompass the
        complexity of adolescents’ perceptions of the mental health programme they have
        completed. Rich data and thick description can help in establishing the meaning that these
        adolescents’ place on action and words as they see it themselves.
     • Using triangulation: If similar results can be arrived at and validated using multiple sources
        of data, multiple methods or different researchers, then the result of the study will have
        greater credibility. There were two researchers in this study and both of them participated
        in the research process as one conducted the focus group interviews, and the other made
        the transcriptions from the recordings. Both of them took part in coding of the transcripts,
        and interpretation of the data, which could help to protect against researcher bias. The
        researchers in this study also invited a third researcher to check their findings. This
        measure could increase credibility as an external review could illuminate blind spots and
        overall make the findings more robust and well-documented.
     • Having reflexivity: the researcher should use critical self-awareness with regard to
        personal interests (personal reflexivity) as well as methodological choices
        (epistemological reflexivity).
     • Using a “decision trail” (or audit trail). For example, the researchers could develop a
        reflective journal where they make regular entries, with regard to methodological decisions
        and reasons for them, and/or how the researchers’ own values, beliefs, and interests may
        have come into play during the research process. It would also be appropriate to walk
        through every step of the research process to determine if there are examples of
        researcher bias.
     • Participant verification / member checking: This means asking participants in a study to
        check the results and the statements chosen to support the conclusions. Have the
        participants themselves judge whether or not the findings actually represent their
        experiences and opinions. This was not done in this study, but had it been implemented,
        the findings would increase in credibility.
     • Examination of previous research findings on the same topic: Assessing the degree to
        which the findings of this qualitative research are congruent with previous studies.
