Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study
1: Genghis Khan c1200–1227 — Campaigns: Mongol invasion of China: attacks on the Jin dynasty;
capture of Beijing (1215).

Source A                Brenda Lange, a journalist, writing about the Mongol siege of Zhongdu (Beijing)
                        in the biographical book Genghis Khan (2003).

In 1214, after several attacks and a month-long siege, the Mongols finally entered the capital city of
Zhongdu, also known as Beijing. The Jin emperor there offered gold, silver, horses, slaves, and a
princess (who became one of Genghis Khan’s wives) to persuade the Mongols to withdraw from the
city. After Genghis agreed, the court quickly relocated, an action that Genghis took as a way for it to
regroup in order to counter-attack. Genghis returned to Beijing, and this time he showed no mercy to
the city or its inhabitants. As the years passed, the armies of Genghis Khan continued to fight from time
to time with the cities of northern China. It was Genghis’ grandson, Kublai, who finally subdued the
people and founded the Yuan dynasty there in the mid-1300s. It is unclear whether Genghis Khan had
a master plan for his empire-building or if his strategies simply developed within the circumstances that
presented themselves.


Source B                Jack Weatherford, a professor specializing in Mongolian history, writing in the 		
                        academic book Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World (2004).

In 1214, Genghis Khan besieged the court of the Jin emperor himself in Zhongdu (Beijing). The court
had just been through a palace coup, and the Jin emperor had endured so much internal strife that
rather than face a prolonged siege and war, he agreed to a settlement with the Mongols to make them
withdraw. He gave them massive amounts of silk, silver, and gold, as well as three thousand horses and
five hundred young men and women. To seal the arrangement, the Jin emperor recognized himself as a
vassal of Genghis Khan and gave him one of his royal princesses as a wife. In response, Genghis Khan
ended the siege and began the long trek back toward Outer Mongolia. He showed no intention of ruling
the areas he had invaded, so long as he could get the goods he wanted. He was glad to leave so long
as they remained subservient to the Mongols and made payments to them … As soon as the Mongols
withdrew, the Jin emperor evacuated his capital at Zhongdu and the entire court fled south. For Genghis
Khan, the flight of the Jin emperor was an act of betrayal, and he considered it a rebellion. Genghis Khan
prepared to return to fight again. The Jin emperor had left a contingent of soldiers to guard the old capital
city, but the soldiers and the people knew that they had been deserted. Genghis Khan’s victories in the
previous year’s campaign inspired support, particularly from those abandoned by the Jin emperor.


Source C                “Ala-ad-Din” Ata-Malik Juvaini, a Persian historian writing in the chronicle The
                        History of the World Conqueror during the 13th century.

When Genghis Khan’s cause prospered, he dispatched envoys to the other tribes. All that submitted
were admitted to the number of his commanders and followers and were regarded with favour. As for
those that rebelled, he struck the breath from their bodies with the whip of calamity and the sword of
annihilation until all the tribes were obedient to his command. Then he established new laws and laid
the foundation of justice. Whichever of their customs were abominable, such as theft and adultery, he
abolished. Thus he too grew strong, and many followers having gathered around him there arose in him
the desire for sovereignty. In short, when these regions had been purged of rebels and all the tribes had
become as his army, he dispatched ambassadors to Khitai, and afterwards went there in person and
killed Altun Khan (the Jin emperor), the emperor of Khitai, and subjugated the country. And gradually he
conquered other kingdoms.

                       between the Moors and Isabel de Castilla and Fernando de Aragón.

The Moors shall be allowed to stay in their houses, estates, and inherited properties at that time, and
forever live under their own law. The Catholic monarchs shall not allow anyone to take away mosques,
minarets or muezzins, nor shall they interfere with their ways and customs. The Moors shall be judged
under their own laws and courts, by the Islamic law, under the authority of their judges.

The Moors shall be treated well by the Catholic monarchs and their ministers, and their views shall be
heard and their customs and rites guaranteed. All Moorish officials shall be allowed to charge their rents
and enjoy the privileges and liberties to which they are accustomed, and it is right and fair that these
things be maintained.

Legal disputes that arise among the Moors shall be judged by this Islamic law and by their judges and
jurists, as is their custom.

The Moors shall not give or pay to the Catholic monarchs more tribute than they are accustomed to
paying to the Moorish kings.

No Moor shall be forced to become Christian against his will.

Source G                  Mona Farouk M. Ahmed, an assistant professor specializing in Mediterranean
                          studies, in the article Muslim and Jewish Minorities in the Medieval Iberian
                          Peninsula After Reconquista (2019).

The largest group of Moors was in the Kingdom of Valencia, where they continued to use Arabic, but they
had disappeared by 1520 due to persecutions and forced conversions to Christianity.

In Granada, there was a large community of Moors, supposedly protected by the Treaty of 1491. A
population of 500,000 Moors was estimated, of which 100,000 died or were enslaved and 200,000
emigrated. Those that remained gradually disappeared due to the conversion policies, which became
more rigorous, causing revolts among the Mudéjars. These revolts led to the announcement that the city
would not allow Muslims to live there and to the conversion of mosques into churches. Thus, there was a
gradual elimination of Muslim culture, as illustrated by the Royal Decree of 1501 ordering the burning of
Arabic books. By February 1502, the Moors of Castile had to choose between baptism or exile. Those of
Aragon survived longer, due to their importance as a source of taxes and their involvement in agriculture
and industry. In 1526, the authorities in Granada banned Arabic and all forms of Moorish culture,
including clothing and circumcision, among others. Subsequently, the Moors gradually disappeared from
all regions of Spain.

                        the Sino-Japanese Conflict”, published in the academic journal The Annals of the
                        American Academy of Political and Social Science (1938).

The situation in China today is the direct result of Japan’s political policy rather than the pressure of her
economic problems. Since 1931, it has become obvious from Japan’s policy of conquest that “security”
and “self-defence” mean control of Chinese resources and territory. In recent years, the overpopulation
argument has been effectively used to justify Japanese expansion because of its emotional appeal, but
this has no real basis in economic reality. In 1931, the Japanese people were told that the occupation
of Manchuria would solve their economic problems. They were disappointed. After six years Japan had
not benefited from Manchuria, but she had to invest heavily there for military purposes. Unfortunately,
in Japan political policy dictates economics. The result is that Japanese militarists have overcome the
opposition of liberals and have gone far in deciding government policy. Although China is by far the
greater sufferer economically, Japan has not escaped the consequences of the war. Japan’s military
operations are becoming more expensive as her armies expand further into China. 75 % of the gasoline
Japan used in 1936 for tanks, bombers and warships came from the United States. One-third of the steel
Japan produced in 1937 came from American raw materials.

                       published in the Biographical Dictionary of Modern Peace Leaders (1985).

Martin Luther King Jr’s rapid rise to national and international prominence as leader of the American civil
rights movement began with the Montgomery bus boycott, after which King was selected as the main
spokesman for black protest.

King brought both excellent speech-making skills and intellectual arguments for peace to his new role.
King combined non-violent resistance with his Christian belief in love and forgiveness to help free black
Americans from discrimination through peaceful but aggressive efforts.

King moved forward after his success at Montgomery to set up the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) believing that the evils of racism could be defeated more successfully through mass
action rather than the slower tactics of the NAACP.

King organized a protest in Birmingham, Alabama, and when peaceful black protest marchers were met
by policemen using dogs and fire hoses, King’s effort made headlines throughout the world and forced
Kennedy to put forward a major civil rights bill.

The year 1965 brought King’s most successful civil rights campaign in Selma, and the violent police
response led to Congress approving the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

King then organized his first major effort outside the South with his “war against slums” in Chicago. While
King’s first attempt in this new area was not a success, King and the civil rights movement transformed
the American South and forever changed American race relations.

                        Criminal Tribunals (July 2018).

From when it opened in 1995 until it closed its doors in December 2015, the Tribunal brought to trial 93
individuals whom it considered responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law in
Rwanda in 1994. Those brought to trial include high-ranking military and government officials, politicians,
businessmen, as well as religious, militia, and media leaders. The ICTR has delivered some significant
developments in the application of law in the cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes,
as well as attributing individual responsibility. The ICTR is the first ever international tribunal to deliver
verdicts in relation to genocide, and the first to interpret the definition of genocide set down in the 1948
Geneva Convention. It also is the first international tribunal to recognise violence against women as a
means of perpetrating genocide. Another legal landmark was reached in the “Media case”, where the
ICTR became the first international tribunal to hold members of the media responsible for broadcasts
intended to inflame the public to commit acts of genocide.
