Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

1.   (a)   What, according to Source B, was the response of the Jin emperor to the
           Mongol invasion?                                                                   [3]

           ●    He agreed to a settlement with the Mongols and handed over valuable items
                and young men and women.
           ●    He recognized himself as a vassal of Genghis Khan.
           ●    He gave Genghis Khan one of the royal princesses as a wife.
           ●    He evacuated the capital city and fled to the south.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write
           about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no
           set answer is required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a
           maximum of [3].

     (b) What does Source D suggest about the Mongol invasion of China?                 [2]
          ●    The Great Wall was insufficient to stop the Mongol expansion.
          ●    The Mongol expansion involved large numbers of soldiers.
          ●    Mongols faced resistance from Chinese forces.

 2. With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
    Source B for an historian studying the Mongol invasion of China.                      [4]

     Value:

          ●   The author is a scholar specializing in Mongolian history so he is likely to be
              knowledgeable on the topic, and has the benefit of hindsight.
          ●   The book is focused on the role and deeds of Genghis Khan.
          ●   It provides information about the Mongol campaigns in China and the Chinese
              reaction to the invasion.

     Limitations:

          ●   The book was written in 2004 and may not reflect the latest research on the topic.
          ●   It is a general book on Genghis Khan and the material specifically on the
              invasion of China may be limited.
          ●   It offers limited information on the Chinese domestic conflicts that could have
              facilitated the Mongol invasion.

The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used
as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there
must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources A and B reveal about the consequences of the
     Mongol capture of Zhongdu (Beijing).                                          [6]

 Marks Level descriptor
  5–6  ● The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of
         contrast.
  3–4  ● The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of
         contrast, although these points may lack clarity.
  1–2  ● The response consists of description of the content of the source(s),
         and/or general comments about the source(s), rather than valid points
         of comparison or of contrast.
   0   ● The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors
         above.

Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and
award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive
and no set answer is required.

Comparison:
   ●    Both sources state there was a settlement between Genghis Khan and the Jin
        emperor to end the conflict.
   ●    Both sources mention that Genghis Khan was sent precious goods and a Chinese
        princess to marry to make him withdraw.
   ●    Both sources state the Chinese court moved from Zhoungdu (Beijing) causing
        Genghis Khan to counterattack.

Contrast:
    ●     While source A suggests there were several attacks and a month- long siege of
          Beijing, source B states the Jin emperor agreed to a settlement to avoid a prolonged
          siege and war.
    ●     While source A suggests that it is unclear whether or not Genghis Khan had a plan to
          rule, source B states that he left the administration to local authorities, as long as
          they remained subservient to the Mongols and supplied tribute.
    ●     While source A indicates that Genghis Khan massacred the inhabitants of Beijing
          during his counterattack, source B suggests many soldiers and people from Beijing
          supported Genghis Khan.

     China.                                                                            [9]

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by
     candidates and award credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following
     material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
     required. While it is expected that there will be coverage of at least two of the
     sources, candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their
     responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A           After the siege of Beijing, Genghis Khan signed an
                        advantageous agreement with the Jin emperor that allowed
                        him to obtain valuable possessions. But soon afterwards, the
                        Chinese emperor fled, forcing Genghis Khan to return and
                        counterattack. It was his grandson, Kublai, who finally
                        subdued the people and founded the Yuan Dynasty.

     Source B           The Mongol invasion successfully subdued the Jin emperor
                        as one of Genghis Khan´s vassals. But since Genghis Khan
                        was not interested in setting up a new government in the
                                            –7–                                8823 – 5301/5302M


                     region, the local authorities rebelled and left the city, forcing
                     Genghis Khan to return. On his way back, many local
                     soldiers and populations joined Mongol ranks.

    Source C         Genghis Khan united different tribes effectively, imposing
                     new rules, favouring his followers and removing those who
                     were rebels. With a considerable army, Genghis Khan slew
                     the Jin emperor, and subjugated the country.

    Source D         Large numbers of Mongols participated in the invasion of
                     China. They were able to overcome the Chinese resistance
                     and break through the Great Wall.

    Own knowledge Candidates may examine the effects of the Mongol siege that
                  exhausted the cities of northern China and forced the
                  population to hand over all their metal goods to build arms
                  and ammunition. They may also consider the success of
                  Genghis Khan´s in building alliances with the authorities of
                  the states near the Jin territory to secure their support.
                  Candidates may examine Genghis Khan´s military strategy:
                  he split his forces into three legions, all commanded by loyal
                  members of his family, to break through the Great Wall at
                  different points.

                     Candidates may also examine the contribution of domestic
                     problems to the success of the Mongol invasion. They can
                     offer further details on the inner conflicts the Jin dynasty
                     underwent. Candidates may point out that up to1215, the
                     Chinese authorities were able to stop the Mongols. They may
                     also argue that Genghis Khan did not introduce a new
                     government in the region, making his position fragile.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

5.   (a) What, according to Source F, was the situation of the Moors in Granada, at the
     end of the 15th century?                                                      [3]

           ●    Moors had to live in specified areas of the city.
           ●    Moors were obliged to accept the partition of Granada due to an agreement
                (1497-98).
           ●    The intention of the measures was to keep the Moors in a subordinate position.
           ●    Segregation was emphasised, but without expelling the Moors.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source H suggest about the treatment of Moors in Spain?          [2]

           ●    Moors were baptized in large numbers.
           ●    The expressions of some of the Moors suggest the idea of forced conversion.
           ●    The picture depicts the role of the Church in bringing the Moors under the rule
                of the Catholic Monarchs.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source G for an historian studying the Muslim and Jewish minorities in the Iberian
     Peninsula after the Reconquista.                                                  [4]

     Value:
         ●     The author is a professor specializing in Mediterranean studies.
         ●     As it was written in 2019, it is likely to benefit from recent research.
         ●     The aim of the source is to analyse the treatment of minorities under the rule of
               the Catholic monarchs.
          ●    The author presents detailed information to demonstrate that the Treaty of 1491
               did not protect the Moors.

     Limitations:
          ●    The purpose of the research is to study the persecution and mistreatment to
               which minorities were subjected and the selection of the content may be
               subjective.
          ●    The source only provides information on the policies applied to Moors.

The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used
as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there
must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

7.    Compare and contrast what Sources E and G reveal about the life of the Moors in
      Spain after the fall of the Kingdom of Granada.                               [6]

     Comparison:
          ● Both sources acknowledge the existence of an important Mudejar population in the
              kingdom of Granada.
          ● Both sources mention the payment of taxes by the Mudéjars (Muslims).

     Contrast:
           ● While Source E states that Moors can live according to their customs, law and
               liberties, Source G considers that the Granada authorities banned Arabic and all
               forms of Moorish culture.
           ● While Source E states that Moors can keep their properties, including mosques,
               Source G affirms that the city of Granada decided to transform the mosques into
               churches, in 1500.
           ● While Source E states that Moors cannot be forced to become Christians, Source
               G mentions that by February 1502 the Mudéjars of Castile had to choose between
               baptism or exile.
           ● According to source E, the Treaty of Granada (1491) is presented as tolerant
               legislation, but source G suggests that it represents an alleged protection
               contradicted by the facts.

Indicative content

Source E               This source shows the intention of the Catholic Monarchs to
                       guarantee the Moors a number of rights, continuity of their way of
                       life, and the validity of their laws and rites. This would allow the
                       Moors to live in peace.

Source F               This source shows that the intention of the Treaty was to keep the
                       Moors in a subordinate position, but without expelling them from
                       the country.

Source G               The Mudéjar (Muslim) communities, supposedly protected by the
                       Treaty of 1491, suffered persecution, forced conversions to

                  Christianity, enslavement and expulsion and gradually
                  disappeared from all regions of Spain.

Source H          The painting represents the forced baptism of Moors, under the
                  supervision of Christian authorities. This contributed to the decline
                  and eventual disappearance of Muslim culture.

Own knowledge Candidates may offer further details on the Treaty of Granada. It
              gave Muslims a deadline of three years to emigrate. Candidates
              may argue that for seven years the majority of conquered Muslims
              were treated respectfully. This continued until the Crown of Castile
              started to revoke some of the more tolerant aspects of the treaty,
              under the influence of Archbishop Cisneros. He ordered mass
              conversions, the burning of valuable Arabic manuscripts, and
              other measures detrimental to the Muslims. Candidates may also
              consider that as a result of those policies Muslims revolted, which
              led to an increase in the powers of the Spanish Inquisition.
              Candidates may argue that there were economic reasons for the
              harsh measures applied to the Muslim population.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

9.   (a)   Why, according to Source I, did Japan invade China in 1937?                [3]

           ●    Japan was disappointed with her possessions in Manchuria.
           ●    Japan’s invasion would prevent China’s industrialisation and block Chinese
                unification.
           ●    Japan needed raw materials.
           ●    Japan needed to become self-sufficient and not be reliant on foreign suppliers.

                war.
           ●    A successful occupation of China is desirable to Japan.
           ●    The occupation of China is proving difficult for Japan.

    of Source I for an historian studying the reasons for Japanese expansion in the

  Value:
           ●   It is contemporary to events and is by a political economist, an expert in the
               subject.
           ●   It informs the public of the Japanese government’s actions.
           ●   The article is supported by detailed examples of economic data.

   Limitations:
        ● As it is from a newspaper in 1937 it lacks hindsight.
        ● It was published in the US just after Japan had invaded China and portrays Japan
            in a poor light.
        ● The source only focuses on Japanese economic motives leading to expansion.

The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used
as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there
must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

       ● Both sources argue that the Japanese economy needed more resources.

   Contrast:
        ● Source K states that economic factors motivated Japanese expansion in East
             Asia, whereas Source L says that expansion was the direct result of Japan’s
             political policy rather than any economic issues.
        ● Source L states that overpopulation was used to justify Japanese expansion in
             East Asia, whereas Source K maintains that the expansion was needed to obtain
             key raw materials.

Indicative content

Source I              Indicates that Japan is determined to expand into China to obtain raw
                      materials to become more self-sufficient in commodities such as iron ore
                      and coal. Chinese cotton will replace the imported cotton from India and
                      the United States. These policies will lead to war with China as these raw
                      materials are vital to the development of Japan’s empire.

Source J              Indicates that it was the political and economic policies pursued by the
                      military that led to war and impacted on foreign relations.

Source K              The military’s policy to expand into China required raw materials such as
                      oil from the United States and rubber from British Malaya and these were
                      not in Japan’s sphere of influence. The war drained the Japanese

                economy and led to a change in strategy as the navy proposed expanding
                southwards into Dutch Indonesia for its oil and Malaya for its rubber.
                Economic factors were key in explaining Japanese expansion.

Source L        As the Japanese military expanded further into China after 1931, with
                increasing costs, Japan was obliged to buy increasing amounts of raw
                materials from the US, which meant that they had to remain to maintain
                reasonable relations with the US.

Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that Japan’s political and economic policies, which
                supported military expansionism, damaged foreign relations. They may
                cite, for example, international reaction to the 1931 invasion of Manchuria
                and the involvement of the Lytton Commission, with the subsequent
                withdrawal of Japan from the League of Nations. 1936 saw the signing of
                the Anti-Comintern Pact. Further detail of the 1937 Sino-Japanese War
                could also be discussed. Mention could be made of the Non-Aggression
                Pact (1940), the Japanese joining of the Tripartite Pact (1941) and the oil
                embargo imposed on Japan by the USA and other countries.

        ● The source provides a balanced view of the success and failure of Martin Luther
            King.

     Limitations:
        ● As the authors’ intent is to provide a broad overview of American history, the
             account may lack sufficient depth when considering the career of King.
        ● The source does not provide much detail on other actors that influenced Martin
             Luther King’s career.

Indicative content

Source M          Written in the aftermath of the Selma campaign, King talks of his triumph at
                  Selma but also highlights that there is still much to be achieved, such as
                  ending segregation in housing.

Source N          The photograph highlights King’s success in bringing together black and
                  white people; old and young; men and women for the March on Washington
                  in 1963.

Source O          The source praises King for influencing Kennedy, for the March on
                  Washington, which led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and for the
                  Selma march, which led to the passing of the Voting Rights Act. However,
                  the source also states that King suffered failure in the South.
                                             – 22 –                           8823 – 5301/5302M



Source P          The source describes King’s inspirational and organisational skills. It argues
                  that the actions of King led to the decline of Jim Crow in the South. The
                  source also argues that King failed in his actions in Chicago.

Own knowledge Candidates may give further details on the early career of King and his
              success with regards to the Montgomery bus boycott, which showed the
              importance of black economic power and the effectiveness of non-violent
              direct action.
              Candidates could argue that the setting up of the Southern Christian
              Leadership Conference (SCLC) by King was very important in drawing
              attention to the Jim Crow abuses in the South.
              Candidates may suggest that the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to King
              in 1964 was significant in bringing world-wide attention to the civil rights
              movement.
              Candidates could argue that the contribution of King was not as important as
              the work of the NAACP, other civil rights organisations and leaders, or the
              role played by both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations in the success
              of the civil rights movement. They could further argue that King failed to
              realise his ambitions during his lifetime. Candidates could further argue that
              the role of the media in highlighting racial abuses played a more important
              role in the success of the civil rights movement.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

17. (a) What, according to Source Q, were the issues involved in the establishment of
    the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR)?                        [3]
          ● The UN placed the ICTR in Tanzania to guarantee impartiality.
          ● The maximum sentence the ICTR could impose was life in prison.
          ● The ICTR sought also to try members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).
          ● The tribunal did not meet the expectations of the Rwandan people and would
             serve only to appease the conscience of the international community.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source R suggest about the role played by the UN regarding the
           Rwandan genocide?                                                          [2]
           ● The violence included burning houses and attacking the inhabitants when they
             fled.
           ● When violence started, the UN ignored or failed to respond effectively to the need
             for help for Rwandan victims.
           ● Rwandans tried to escape the violence and seek refuge by themselves because
             they had no support from the UN.

           The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in
           their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
           required. Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

18. With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations
    of Source S for an historian studying the international impact of the ICTR.       [4]

     Value:
        ● The report was published by the United Nations, the organization that created the
            ICTR.
        ● As it was written in 2018, three years after the ICTR closed its doors, it has the
            benefit of hindsight.
        ● The source provides awareness of the tribunal’s main achievements in 21 years of
            work.

     Limitations:
        ● As the report was created by the organization that created the ICTR, it may be
             subjective.
        ● The source is limited because it only highlights the achievements of the ICTR.
        ● The source does not include any reference to the weaknesses of the tribunal’s
             performance.

The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or
limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origin, purpose and content should be used
as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the value and limitations. For [4] there
must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or the limitations.

candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive
and no set answer is required.

   Comparison:
       ● Both sources summarize the impact of the ICTR in its 21 years of work.
       ● Both sources maintain that the ICTR dealt with those responsible for carrying out
           the genocide.

   Contrast:
        ● Source S argues that the ICTR brought to trial (indicted) 93 individuals who were
            found responsible for the violation of human rights, whereas Source T states that
            none of them belonged to the RPF, the governing party of Rwanda.
        ● Source S describes how the ICTR established a credible international criminal
            justice system; Source T, by contrast, considers that the lack of connection
            between the processes and the Rwandan people affected by the genocide was
            frustrating to them.
        ● While Source S emphasises that the ICTR was the first international tribunal to
            deliver verdicts in relation to genocide, Source T contends that individuals indicted
            (brought to trial) did not receive appropriate sentences.
        ● Source S maintains that the wide range of persons indicted (brought to trial) by the
            tribunal was a success, whereas Source T argues that the lack of RPF members
            indicted (brought to trial) fuels the official government narrative that only
            recognises Tutsi as victims and Hutu as perpetrators.

Indicative content

Source Q          The source identifies the points of contention between the UN and the
                  Rwandan government about the establishment of the ICTR, taking into
                  account the location, the kind of criminal sanctions and the persons that
                  could be indicted.

Source R          The source indicates that the UN, the same institution that would organize
                  the ICTR, was completely indifferent to Rwandans’ requests for help during
                  the genocide. It also shows that the international community did not offer the
                  Rwandan people any kind of support or humanitarian aid.

Source S          The source maintains that there is a synthesis of the ICTR’s achievements
                  related to the quantity of persons found responsible for the Rwandan
                                           – 27 –                         8823 – 5301/5302M


                 genocide and the body of law about genocide that developed. The tribunal
                 also established the relationship between violence against women and
                 genocide, and delivered sentences against members of the media for fuelling
                 violence.

Source T         The source argues against the ICTR’s success, by considering the moderate
                 sentences and the frustration of Rwandan people who could not follow the
                 processes due to its distant location, as well as the lack of RPF members
                 indicted (brought to trial) and the promotion of the official narrative.

Own knowledge Candidates may explain that the lack of Rwandan confidence in the UN at
              the time of the ICTR creation was related to its lack of action to prevent the
              genocide, although the international organization had been warned about the
              preparation of a massacre. They may offer further references to the
              Rwandan government (the RPF), that wanted to avoid trials against the
              members of this party who participated in the genocide, and how the ICTR
              finally agreed because the tribunal needed the collaboration of the Rwandan
              government to develop the trials. Candidates may also offer an analysis of
              the legal innovations of the tribunal in identifying violence against women as
              a means of carrying out genocide, as well as the behaviour of media such as
              the Radio Télévision Libre de Mille Collines in inciting murders.
              Candidates may also develop the official narrative related to genocide in
              Rwanda and evaluate if the ICTR made any contribution to social
              reconciliation in the country, taking into account the role played by local
              gacaca courts.
