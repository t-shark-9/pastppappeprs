Source B                Adapted from: “The great uncoupling: one supply chain1 for China, one for
                        everywhere else” by Kathrin Hille, The Financial Times, 6 October 2020.

Many manufacturers are being forced to rethink their presence in China. “In the past, there would have
been one massive plant in China for the whole world. But that globalization is gone,” says a Taiwanese
investment banker and adviser on deals which have contributed to loosening global supply chains from
China. “It will be more costly, and it will be less efficient. But it is the way that politics is pushing us.”
Foxconn, the Taiwanese company (worth US$178 billion) which makes the iPhone and which has a
workforce of close to 1 million in China, says it expects manufacturing to fragment into a China supply
chain and several others for the rest of the world. “The past model, where manufacturing is concentrated
in just a few countries like a world factory, will no longer exist,” the chairman said at a conference in
June. “What we think is more likely in the future are regional production networks.” Western companies
have also come to fear that making equipment in China might put data security and privacy at risk.
“If you supply Google or Facebook, you need to show that it’s a non-China product,” says the chief
executive of the consultancy, Silk Road Associates.

However, trade experts caution that the shift of global supply chains away from their sole reliance on
China will take a long time. Although China’s share of global exports markedly dropped in 2019 because
of a trade war2, the country’s share of global exports hit a new historic high this year.

Source C                Adapted from: “Multinational enterprises in the global economy: Heavily
                        debated but hardly measured”, a policy note produced by the Organisation for
                        Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international organization
                        whose members are countries with advanced economies and whose aim is to
                        encourage economic growth around the world, 2018.

Multinational enterprises (also known as multinational corporations or MNCs) are attracted to countries
because of different reasons: access to large and growing markets of consumers, access to natural
resources or specific technologies/knowledge or specific financial and tax legislation etc. Virtually all
governments are keen to attract MNC investment as these promote growth and employment by creating
new jobs, realising new investments and bringing in new technologies. MNCs account for half of global
exports and about one-fourth of global employment.

The contribution of MNCs to world gross domestic product (GDP)3 is estimated to be 28 %. Of this,
parts of the company located abroad (foreign affiliates) account for one third of production and MNC
headquarters and domestic plants in the home country account for the rest. Foreign affiliates are
an important part of MNC activities. Almost all of the production of foreign affiliates worldwide is
“controlled” by a small group of OECD economies and most significantly the United States of America,
the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Yet, despite MNCs’
acclaimed importance, empirical data is not widely available and only a few states have kept data
on MNCs’ production in their home country.

Source D                Adapted from: “Ethical Audits and the Supply Chains of Global
                        Corporations (MNCs)”, a research report by The University of Sheffield, 2016.

In recent years, incidents such as the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh in
2013 and the exposé of slavery and human trafficking in the Thai shrimp industry in 2014, have focused
attention on the supply chains of global corporations (MNCs).

Multinational corporations have embraced corporate social responsibility4 goals and ethical audits
(inspections) as an opportunity to preserve their business model and take responsibility for supply chain
monitoring out of the hands of governments. However, corporations are still failing workers and the
planet. Labour abuses, poor working conditions and environmental degradation within global supply
chains remain widespread. Auditors can usually only inspect areas that suppliers choose to show
them and are often only able to speak to workers they happen to see. Deception in the audit regime is
widespread and known to corporations. Many corporations design audit programmes that only inspect
suppliers where the final assembly of products takes place. Evidence from food, clothing and other
industries indicates that the most exploited workers (eg forced and child labour) tend to be found in
sites with complex subcontracting arrangements. The audit regime, with the involvement and support of
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), is reducing the role of states in regulating corporate behaviour
and re-orientating global corporate governance towards the interests of private business and away from
social goods.
