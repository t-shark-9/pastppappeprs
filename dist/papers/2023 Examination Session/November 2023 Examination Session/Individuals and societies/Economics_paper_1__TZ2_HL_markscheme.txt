maximum marks as indicated.

1.     (a)   Explain how a system of tradeable permits could be used to reduce externalities
             caused by high levels of carbon emissions.                                                [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: tradeable permits, externalities.
             • Explanation: of how a system of tradeable permits establishes a cap on carbon
               emissions and distributes permits to firms to allow them to produce carbon
               emissions up to the level set by their permits. They can then sell unused permits to
               the market for permits. Firms unable to keep emissions within the levels set by their
               allocation of permits need to purchase more permits. Lower carbon emitters thus are
               given a financial advantage. The cap can be reduced over time to reduce carbon
               emissions.
             • Diagrams: candidates may use a market failure diagram to illustrate the impact on
               firms of being required to produce at a more socially efficient output. Candidates
               may choose to represent the carbon market with a simple supply and demand
               diagram.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the view that providing a subsidy is the best way
      to encourage an increased use of clean technologies.                                     [15]

       Answers may include:
      • Terminology: subsidy.
      • Explanation: that subsidies increase supply, resulting in lower prices and higher
         equilibrium quantity.
      • Diagram: to show the effect of a subsidy on the market for clean technologies.
      • Synthesis (discuss): the importance of PED, opportunity cost issues, externality
         issues, equity issues and efficiency issues. Consideration of alternative policies
         such as carbon taxes and tradeable permits. Candidates may take a market failure
         approach, with the use of clean technologies as an example of a positive production
         externality where MSC is less than MPC and thus the market economy is producing
         less than is socially optimum, under allocating resources in the production of this
         good. Consideration of what the “best” policy is.
      • Examples: of real-world subsidies for clean technologies.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already

2.     (a)   Explain the limitations of using the consumer price index (CPI) to measure the rate of
             inflation.                                                                                    [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: consumer price index (CPI), rate of inflation.
             • Explanation: that the consumer price index measures what the average consumer is
               buying. Different groups of people buy different things. It is inaccurate to use this so-
               called average consumer to calculate how much government might intervene to
               support pensions or welfare as prices change. Consumption patterns differ by age,
               gender, geographical location, income levels. Prices might rise but quality may have
               improved. New products, even when widely used, take time to appear in the CPI.
               The weights used only adjust slowly and do not reflect where consumers act to
               substitute more expensive products.

NB Unfortunately, this question did not include the “Using real-world examples” prompt in the

students responding to the question.

(b)   Using real-world examples, examine the view that there is a possible trade-off between
      unemployment and inflation.                                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: unemployment, inflation.
      • Explanation: that in the short run there is a possible inverse relationship between the
        rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment, thus a higher inflation rate can be
        associated with a lower unemployment rate and vice-versa.
      • Diagram: AD/AS diagram to examine a trade-off. Short-run and long-run Phillips
        curve.
      • Synthesis (examine): argument that the trade-off between the unemployment rate
        and the inflation rate in the short-run Phillips curve implied a choice for
        policymakers. However, the inverse relationship breaks down in the long run
        according to some interpretations: thus, the only impact of an increase in AD is to
        increase the rate of inflation while real output and the rate of unemployment are
        unchanged.
      • Examples: of situations of where a trade-off between unemployment and inflation is,
        or is not, observed.

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: exchange rate, floating exchange rate.
             • Explanation: that a floating exchange rates value is determined by changes in the
               demand and supply of the currency. Factors that could lead to a change in demand
               and supply for a currency value might include changes in exports and imports, FDI
               flows, portfolio investment, relative real interest rates, speculation, relative growth
               rates and remittances.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the impact of a falling exchange rate on a country’s rate
      of unemployment and on its current account balance.                                       [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: unemployment, rate of unemployment, exchange rate, balance of
        payments on current account.
      • Explanation: of how a falling exchange rate might increase the competitiveness of
        exports and decrease competitiveness of imports which might help lower
        unemployment. The impact on the balance of payments might be to raise export
        revenues and decrease import revenues but this would depend on elasticities of
        imports and exports.
      • Diagram: to illustrate a falling exchange rate caused by demand or supply factors.
      • Synthesis (discuss): the impact of a falling exchange rate might raise employment
        independently of whether exports and imports are inelastic or elastic because
        volumes of domestic production are likely to grow, however investment in capital
        might substitute additional demand for labour as scale is increased. Imported cost-
        push inflation might raise costs and raise unemployment. The impact on the current
        account of the balance of payments is dependent on elasticities of imports and
        exports. Candidates might use the J-curve effect and Marshall-Lerner condition to
        explain this.
      • Examples: of countries where a falling exchange rate has been experienced.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already

      A maximum of [9] should be awarded if only unemployment or current account
      balance in the question item is addressed.

   1–3     • The response indicates little understanding of the specific demands of the question.
           • Economic theory is stated but it is not relevant.
           • Economic terms are stated but they are not relevant.
           • The response contains no evidence of synthesis or evaluation.
           • A real-world example(s) is identified but it is irrelevant.

   4–6     • The response indicates some understanding of the specific demands of the question.
           • Relevant economic theory is described.
           • Some relevant economic terms are included.
           • The response contains evidence of superficial synthesis or evaluation.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified.

   7–9     • The response indicates understanding of the specific demands of the question,
             but these demands are only partially addressed.
           • Relevant economic theory is partly explained.
           • Some relevant economic terms are used appropriately.
           • Where appropriate, relevant diagram(s) are included.
           • The response contains evidence of appropriate synthesis or evaluation but
             lacks balance.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified and partly developed in the context of

           • The response contains evidence of effective and balanced synthesis or evaluation.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified and fully developed to support
             the argument.
