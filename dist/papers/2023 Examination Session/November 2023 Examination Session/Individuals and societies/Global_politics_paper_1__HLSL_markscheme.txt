Unit 1     Power, sovereignty and international relations

Bulleted lists in this markscheme indicate likely points that candidates may include in their answer: they
are not exhaustive, and examiners should credit other valid points not listed.

     Function and impact of international organizations and non-state actors in global politics

1.    Outline the main points illustrated in source A.                                            [3]

      Answers may include the following:
      • Source A shows a comparison of MNCs vast contribution to the global economy
        in 2006 and 2016, across sectors.
      • Source A shows a big shift towards MNCs in the IT sector.
      • Source A shows an overall increase in market value by MNCs over time.
      • Source A shows that only three of the MNCs in the top ten in 2006 are in the top ten
        by 2016.
      • Source A shows how the national ownership of MNCs has shifted over time, with a
        significant increase in USA companies in the top ten by 2016.
      • Source A shows an overall decrease in the number of companies representing the
        energy sector.
      • Source A shows an overall increase in IT companies in top 10.
      • Source A shows that (any sector indicated in the key/legend) moved up/moved down/is
        not present in 2016.

      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3]. Other relevant points not listed can
      also be rewarded.
                                                  –4–                                        8823 – 5951M


2.   With explicit reference to Source B and one example you have studied, explain why
     multinational corporations (MNCs) may make individuals vulnerable.                                 [4]

     Answers may include, but are not limited to:
     The source does not directly refer to individuals, so some inference about possible impacts
     on individuals is necessary.
     • Source B shows that MNCS i.e. Apple have considerable workforces (1 million in China)
        and that political and economic drivers and responses can impact on many individuals as
        workers / employees.
     • Source B suggests that MNCs integration into a global economy and changes in global
        supply chains such as regionalisation can rapidly impact on workers because of the scale
        of MNCs’ investment and the unpredictable nature of their operations and supply chains
        across different states.
     • Source B shows that MNCs can undermine people’s livelihoods if the supply chain shift is
        due to issues which are outside workers’ control, i.e. ideas of trust and product reliability
        (data security and privacy) raised by Western companies.

     Valid examples from own knowledge may include, but are not limited to:
     • Negative aspects of MNC’s impact on individuals, i.e. indirectly through tax abuse and
       avoidance of social investment; and through practices of deunionization.
     • Individuals could be vulnerable as MNCs collect personal data and this might pose a
       security risk.
     • Examples may include harmful working conditions and abuse of migrant workers,
       especially in states with little welfare support or protection of workers’ rights. Own
       examples can include specific harm to workers, such as women or children, to
       communities through pollution of their environment or depletion of their natural / finite
       resources (e.g. water and bottling plants for soft drinks) or impact on sustainability, e.g.
       contamination by agribusiness or control over seeds and harvests.
     • Other harmful examples might include IT and social media corporations and issues of
       data control and manipulation of news, i.e. associated harms to democracy (campaigning)
       and the shielding of criminals and their identities (terrorists and online abusers) and
       companies ignoring regulations and weakening public confidence in government.
     • MNCs may prioritize profits and by outsourcing production promote negative aspects,
       such as child labour.
     • MNCs, such as Amazon and Walmart, have been accused of not paying enough attention
       to the safety of their workers and paying a too low minimum wage.

     Other relevant points not listed can also be rewarded. Candidates are not expected to make
     four separate points in order to achieve full marks. For each valid point a maximum of [2]
     may be awarded, up to a total of [4]. If there is no reference to another example studied
     award a maximum of [3].
                                                 –5–                                      8823 – 5951M


3.   Compare and contrast what Source C and Source D reveal about how multinational
     corporations (MNCs) function.                                                                   [8]

     Potential points of comparison:
     • Both sources emphasize multinational corporations’ (MNCs) role as major employers
       across the globe. Source content to support points should be included.
     • Both sources show how globalisation is facilitated by their actions. Source content to
       support points should be included.
     • Both sources show that MNCs are functioning as political actors. Source C emphasizes
       links to major powers and source D shows their impact on state behaviour.
     • Both sources suggest that MNCs may function with little scrutiny or oversight. Source C
       shows a lack of data available to states and source D shows that deception may occur in
       terms of auditing. In both cases states may be withholding information.

     Potential points of contrast:
     • Source C emphasizes the power held by a select number of states (OECD economies) in
       controlling the foreign affiliates of MNCs. Source D suggests that states are weak in terms
       of regulating MNCs. MNCs can cause harm to workers within states and the most
       vulnerable workers are often exploited (human trafficking, unsafe factory buildings).
     • Source C shows how much multinational corporations (MNCs) are associated with
       economic growth and employment. In contrast, source D shows that such employment
       may hinder development for many, as states are unable to successfully monitor the
       exploitation of workers or degradation of their environment.
     • The sources show a different viewpoint of how MNCs impact the environment and
       resource use. Source C talks of the opportunity provided by MNC access to a state’s
       natural resources and Source D makes reference to environmental degradation by MNCs.
       Source C is written by a trading organization, and measures the economic impact of
       MNCs. Source D is a more critical report and highlights the social impact of MNCs. This
       point is only relevant if accompanied by source content.

     If the view of only one source is discussed award a maximum of [4]. For a response which
     focuses significantly on one source with only minimal reference to the other source, award a
     maximum of [5]. For responses that discuss the sources separately, rather than in a running
     comparison, award a maximum [6].

     Award [2] per effective point of comparison up to a maximum of [8]. For an [8] response
     expect detailed comparison but do not expect all of the points above, and allow other valid
     points.

4.   Using all the sources and your own knowledge, examine the claim that multinational
     corporations (MNCs) are now of central importance to global politics.                         [10]

     Question 4 is assessed according to the markbands that follow, in conjunction with these
     marking notes.

     Source material may include, but is not limited to:

     Source A
     • Shows MNCs significant contribution (in hundreds of billions of US$) to global capital
       across a range of sectors from energy to IT, reflecting material power and reach.
     • Shows how MNCs now reflect the digital age of globalisation through the dominance of IT,
       showing their embeddedness in many societies.

     Source B
     • Shows how economically powerful MNCs are, i.e. significant millions of workers are
       employed by MNCs who may shift from a global base (China) to regional suppliers. State
       investment—and employment—is potentially dependent on, and therefore potentially
       undermined, by global MNCs and their vulnerability to shifts in politics including the
       fracturing of supply chains.
     • As a counter claim, Source B shows that MNC’s ability to operate in a country can be
       affected by global politics. Relations between China and the USA, and the Chinese
       government's actions concerning data privacy are limiting where an MNC can purchase
       technology or equipment from.
     • Shows how the interconnectedness of MNC’s global value chains makes individuals
       across the globe vulnerable to events and circumstance beyond their control.

     Source C
     • Shows that the contribution of MNCs to World GDP is significant—estimated to be 28%.
     • As a counter claim, a majority of the world’s GDP contribution is not made by MNCs.
     • Shows how significant foreign direct investment by MNC/MNEs is particularly in LDCs.
     • Shows that MNCs account for half of global exports.
     • Shows that MNCs are providing up to one quarter of employment in the world.
     • Shows how some of the world's most powerful economies ‘control’ / are tied to MNCs
       which suggests powerful interests at work.
     • Suggests that the home economy is a key part of MNCs global output, showing how
       interconnected both states and non-state actors are in the global economy.

     Source D
     • States that MNCs and other non-state actors are reducing the role of states in regulating
       corporate behaviour, and this may present a continual threat to state income and the
       rights of citizens as the economy expands.
     • Shows multiple ways in which MNCs shape people’s experience of employment, i.e. risk
       and exploitation.

Own knowledge may include, but is not limited to:
 • Answers may argue that the importance of MNCs depends on the positive or negative
    experience for the state and their citizens. They might also cover MNC’s positive and
    negative impacts on global politics and the global economy, and show awareness of
    their considerable growth and impact within states and on local economies. Examples
    might be given of MNCs significant contribution to investment, research and
    development and training and education. Other examples may include the degree to
    which states concede to MNCs ie 'sovereignty bargains' with the creation, for instance,
    of Special Economic Zones.
 • Examples may include the impact of MNCs on developing states in terms of market
    dominance and the squeezing out of local firms.
 • Examples may show that MNCs have considerable power in terms of technology and
    legal resources and that even powerful states may find it hard to regulate and monitor
    them (e.g. social media giants).
 • Examples may also focus on states and individuals increasing their dependence on
    technology and communication—hence, the significance of these markets and their
    supply chains compared to more traditional forms of state power.
 • Answers may draw upon the increasing rhetoric or reality of trade wars and distrust or
    competition between states which places economic actors centre stage.

If only source material or only own knowledge is used, the response can only be awarded a
maximum of [6]. To achieve the maximum [10], responses must refer to all four sources.

Do not expect all of the above, and reward other relevant points not listed.
