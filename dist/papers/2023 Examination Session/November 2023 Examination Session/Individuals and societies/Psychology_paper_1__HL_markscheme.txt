                                               Section A

Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Describe the role of one hormone in the study of human behaviour, with reference to one
     relevant study.                                                                                    [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of the role
     of one hormone in human behaviour.

     Responses should make a clear link between the role of the hormone(s) and human
     behaviour. Examples of how hormones influence human behaviour could include, but are not
     limited to:

     •   Radke et al.’s (2015) study investigating the effects of testosterone on
         aggression
     •   McGaugh and Cahill’s (1995) study on adrenaline and memory
     •   Newcomer et al.’s (1999) study on cortisol and memory
     •   Baumgartner et al.’s (2008) study on the role of oxytocin on trust
     •   Ronay and von Hippel’s (2010) study on testosterone and risk taking.
     If a candidate describes the role of more than one hormone, credit should be given only to the
     first hormone described.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes the role of one hormone without making reference to a study, up to a
     maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes a relevant study without describing the role of the hormone in the
     study of human behaviour, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

     Responses referring to research conducted on animals are acceptable as long as they are
     linked to human behaviour.
                                                   –5–                                       8823 – 5701M


Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   With reference to one relevant study, describe the effect of emotion on one cognitive process. [9]
     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.
     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of the effect of
     emotion on one cognitive process with reference to one relevant study.
     Responses may focus on any cognitive process that is affected by emotion, for example, memory
     or decision-making.
     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Brown and Kulik’s (1977), Neisser and Harsh’s (1992) studies related to flashbulb memory
     • Yuille and Cutshall’s (1986) study on emotion and accuracy of flashbulb memories
     • Nutt and Lam’s (2011), Fisher and Craik’s (1977) studies of state-dependent memory
     • Bechara et al.’s (1999); Denes-Raj and Epstein’s (1994) studies of emotion and decision-making
     • McGaugh and Cahill’s (1995) study on the role of emotion in the creation of memories.


     If a candidate addresses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to
     the first cognitive process described.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate addresses the effect of emotion on one cognitive process without including
     a relevant study, a maximum of [5] should be awarded for the response.

     If a candidate describes a relevant study but does not describe the effect of emotion on
     one cognitive process, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.
                                                   –6–                                       8823 – 5701M


Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   Describe one research method used in one study related to cultural origins of behaviour and/or
     cultural origins of cognition.                                                                    [9]
     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.
     The command term “describe" requires candidates to give a detailed account of one
     research method used in one study related to cultural origins of behaviour and/or cultural origins
     of cognition.
     In order to address the cultural origins of behaviour and/or cognition, candidates may describe
     research on cultural dimensions, enculturation, acculturation, or globalization.
     Relevant research methods may include, but are not limited to:
     • Naturalistic observations: Fagot (1974)
     • Quasi-experiments: Berry (1967) on conformity; Cole & Scribner (1974) on chunking in
       memory; Kearins (1981) on memory
     • Questionnaires: Parker et al (2001) on abnormal behaviour; Kulkofsky et al. (2011) on flashbulb
       memory.


     If a candidate refers to more than one research method, credit should be given only to the
     first research method.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study.

     If a candidate describes a research method without making reference to a study, up to a
     maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without describing a research method, up
     to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or
issue being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating
the question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining
the problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.


 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1     Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.


    2     Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and
understanding that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.


 Marks Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2    The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper
          understanding.
   3–4    The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks
          detail. Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper
          understanding.
   5–6    The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and
          understanding. Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                                     8823 – 5701M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.


    Marks Level descriptor

      0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


     1–2   Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected
           serves to repeat points already made.

     3–4   Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly
           explained. Research selected partially develops the argument.

     5–6   Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
           thoroughly explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the
           argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate
critical thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research
used to support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or
  explanations
• areas of uncertainty.
These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition,
students could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-
developed evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic
judgement of their achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                                       8823 – 5701M




 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
         discussion, if present, is superficial.

   3–4   The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion
         of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

   5–6   The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking.
         Evaluation and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.


E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A
good response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.


 Marks Level descriptor

    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1    The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
         throughout the response.

    2    The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                              Section B
4.   Discuss how animal research may provide insight into human behaviour.                     [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the contribution of
     animal research in the understanding of human behaviour.
     Responses may highlight that animal research has been a major contributor to our understanding
     of many aspects of human behaviour such as:
     • attachment: for example, Harlow (1958, 1971, 1975)
     • health behaviour: Alexander's (1981) Rat Park study of addiction; Friedman (1995) on ghrelin
        and obesity
     • learning and memory: for example, Meaney's (1988) study on the role of glucocorticoids in
        memory; Rogers and Kesner's (2003) study on the role of acetylcholine in the formation of
        spatial memory
     • mental health disorders: for example, Shmelkov et al. (2010) on the SLITRK5 gene and OCD;
        Seligman (1970) on helplessness in depression
     • sensory processes: for example, Held and Hein's "Kitten Carousel" (1963), Blakemore and
        Cooper's (1970) studies on perception
     • stress: for example, Selye (1956, 1976), Brady's "Executive Monkey" (1959).


     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • alternatives to animal research
     • justifications for using animals over human participants in research
     • key differences between animal and human physiology and behaviour
     • methodological considerations and generalizability of animal research
     • operationalization of variables in animal research (e.g. studies of mental disorders
       in animal research)
     • the issue of reductionism.
                                                – 11 –                                  8823 – 5701M


5.   Evaluate one or more studies regarding the positive and/or negative influence of
     technologies on cognitive processes.                                                          [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of one or more studies investigating the positive and/or negative
     influence of technologies on cognitive processes.

     Candidates may refer to studies investigating one or more specific cognitive processes
     (such as memory, thinking and decision-making, perception, attention and/or language)
     or studies which focus on cognitive processes in general. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

     Studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Sparrow et al.’s (2011) study on transactive memory
     • Rosen et al.’s (2011, 2013) studies on the effect of multi-tasking on memory recall
     • Mueller and Oppenheimer’s (2014) on computer-assisted notetaking and memory
     • Storm et al.’s (2016) study on the Google effect
     • Blacker et al.’s (2014) study on the effect of video games on visual working memory
     • Swing et al.’s (2010) study on the effect of screen time on attention
     • Tun and Lachman’s (2010) interview investigating computer use and cognitive performance
     • Uttal et al.’s (2013) meta-analysis of studies on spatial skills.

     Evaluation points may include, but are not limited to:
     • balance between ecological and internal validity
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and
       applied
     • issues of research bias
     • generalizability of research
     • strengths and weaknesses of the research method
     • implications of the findings.
     Candidates may evaluate one study to demonstrate depth of knowledge or
     evaluate more than one study to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                      – 12 –                                      8823 – 5701M

6.   Discuss how globalization may influence behaviour                                                   [22]
     .
     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.
     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     influence of globalization on behaviour.
     Behaviour in this instance may include attitudes, identities or any other accepted
     behaviour. Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:

     • Ogihara & Uchida (2014) on the effects of globalization on subjective well-being
     • Norasakkunkit & Uchida (2014); Becker et al. (2002) on the effects of globalization on
         mental health
     •   Buchan et al. (2009) on globalization and cooperation
     •   Adams (2003) on cultural values in the USA and Canada converging over time
     •   Gupta’s (2011) research on the effect of globalization in consumer behaviour
     •   Jensen, Arnett and McKenzie’s (2011) research on globalization and cultural identity.

     Candidates may discuss acculturation to the global culture or the role of contact with
     other cultures as a means of changing local culture; however, it is not relevant to discuss
     acculturation research based on immigrants moving to a new culture and the level to
     which one assimilates to the culture of a new country.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     •   methodological difficulties in measuring and testing the effect of globalization.
     •   the inability to establish a cause-and-effect relationship
     •   studies of the effects of globalization are relatively recent, that is, not replicated
     •   implications of the findings
     •   the difficulty of generalizing the findings of such studies
     •   methodological issues with the research methods utilized.
     •   cultural considerations in the effects of globalization
     •   an emic versus etic approach.
