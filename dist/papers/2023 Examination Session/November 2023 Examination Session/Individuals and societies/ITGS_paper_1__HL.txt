Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Smart lamp posts

     The city of Hong Kong, in China, has installed smart lamp posts (see Figure 1). The lamp
     posts include LED lighting, sensors that monitor the environment, and cameras that take
     images of the surrounding area. The data collected is transmitted to a data centre that is part
     of a cloud computing network. This is part of a strategy to use digital technologies to improve
     the physical quality of life.

                                       Figure 1: A smart lamp post




           [Source: © Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. GovHK (www.gov.hk).]

     (a)   (i)     Identify two sensors the smart lamp posts could use.                                         [2]

           (ii)    Outline one reason why encryption is used to transmit the data from the smart
                   lamp posts to the data centre.                                                               [2]

           (iii)   Outline one reason the Hong Kong authorities are using cloud computing to store
                   the data collected by the lamp posts.                                                        [2]

     (b)   Explain three technical requirements that will need to be met to enable the smart lamp
           post system to function effectively.                                                                 [6]

     (c)   To what extent will the introduction of smart lamp posts lead to an improvement in the
           environmental conditions within a city?                                                              [8]
                                                    –3–                                           8823 – 5511


2.   No more snow days

     Around the world, extreme weather can prevent schools from opening. Examples of extreme
     weather include snow in Canada, rain in Oman, and typhoons in Japan.

     In 2020 and 2021, many schools implemented a distance learning programme so they did
     not need to add days to the school year to make up for lost learning. Schools were given
     funding to upgrade their information technology (IT) infrastructures so students and staff
     would be able to study and work from home.

     Some schools have used this funding to introduce a virtual private network (VPN), and others
     have used it to increase their cloud computing capability.

     Students and staff are required to agree to an acceptable use policy before they are allowed
     to access a school’s network.

     With the movement towards online learning, teachers have also been asked to teach
     synchronously and asynchronously.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two types of software required for distance learning.                        [2]

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why a school would introduce an acceptable use policy.           [2]

           (iii)   Outline one advantage for users if a school introduces a virtual private
                   network (VPN).                                                                        [2]

     (b)   Two strategies for distance learning are synchronous teaching and asynchronous teaching.

           Analyse these strategies.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   Many schools are considering moving to a one-to-one mobile device programme where
           each student has access to one device.

           Two options for implementing a one-to-one mobile device programme are:
           y schools owning devices that are issued to students
           y students owning their own devices and using them in the school (also called a
             bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy).

           Evaluate these options.                                                                       [8]




                                                                                                  Turn over
                                                   –4–                                            8823 – 5511


3.   Digital documentation

     Governments currently use paper documents, such as a passport or driving license, to
     authenticate a citizen’s identity.

     Some governments, however, are allowing citizens to create a digital ID that they can use as
     proof of identity. This digital ID can be securely stored in a digital wallet app* on smartphones
     and other digital devices (see Figure 2).

                                      Figure 2: Using a digital ID




     Some governments are also considering extending their digital services and moving
     them completely online. These services could include digital medical records, digital tax
     information, digital driving licenses, and digital car registration documentation.

                                                Section B

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Gait recognition biometrics

     Scientists have developed gait recognition systems that have been used to provide an
     athlete with information about their gait* (see Figure 4). Each athlete has a unique gait.

                                Figure 4: Gait information from an athlete




     The data collected is input into a neural network for processing and pattern recognition,
     enabling the athlete’s performance to be analysed.

     This gait analysis can be used by national athletics organizations to identify strengths and
     weaknesses in the gait of their athletes. Using this information, coaches can develop a
     training plan to improve an athlete’s performance while changing as little as possible in the
     athlete’s gait.

* gait: the manner or style of moving

     (a)   (i)     Identify two input devices used to capture data about an athlete’s gait.              [2]

           (ii)    Identify two forms of biometric identification other than gait.                       [2]

           (iii)   Identify two characteristics of a neural network.                                     [2]

     (b)   (i)	Explain two reasons why a feasibility study would be carried out before gait
                analysis was considered.                                                                 [4]

           (ii)    Explain one reason why a national athletics organization would employ a
                   systems analyst.                                                                      [2]

     (c)   Gait recognition systems that use neural networks and pattern recognition can be used
           to analyse an athlete’s performance.

           Discuss the decision by national athletics organizations to use gait analysis as a tool to
           improve the performance of their athletes.                                                    [8]
                                                  –7–                                           8823 – 5511


5.   Patient diagnosis using expert systems

     MYCIN was one of the first expert systems to use backward chaining to help determine if a
     patient had an infection, working back through several steps to determine the type of bacteria
     causing the infection and which antibiotics to use.

     For example:
     • The patient has a bacterial infection.
     • The patient has a fever.
     • The patient is also experiencing severe stomach upset.
     • Therefore, the patient has typhoid (a bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi).

     Expert systems will be developed in the future using the system development life cycle
     (SDLC). The SDLC includes a design phase and a testing phase.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two components of an expert system.                                        [2]

           (ii)    Identify two elements of the design phase in the system development life
                   cycle (SDLC).                                                                       [2]

           (iii)   Identify two reasons why alpha testing is used in the development of a new
                   expert system.                                                                      [2]

     (b)   (i) 	Distinguish between the use of backward chaining and forward chaining to
                 determine the type of infection a patient has.                                        [2]

           (ii)    Explain two reasons why prototypes are used in the development of a new
                   expert system.                                                                      [4]

     (c)   To what extent should doctors use expert systems for diagnosing patients?                   [8]




                                                                                                Turn over
                                                  –8–                                            8823 – 5511


6.   Assistive robots

     Care homes* in Ireland plan to use a variety of assistive robots to support staff. These
     assistive robots use depth cameras, natural language processing and vision sensors to
     interact intelligently with care home residents. Two types of robot are being considered:
     Stevie and Ameca (see Figure 5 and Figure 6).

                   Figure 5: Stevie                                 Figure 6: Ameca




     Ameca and Stevie have face and voice recognition. This means they can understand
     someone who is speaking to them, reply to commands, and interact with care home residents.

     Ameca is an example of an android and has been developed by a company called
     Engineered Arts. The project manager, Morgan Roe, who is overseeing the development of
     Ameca, explained that the android has 17 motors inside its head that control its movements
     and expressions. Ameca’s facial expressions are surprisingly lifelike. Morgan is aware that
     the project development team should avoid the uncanny valley.

           (ii)    Explain one advantage of using supervised learning to develop the natural
                   language processing capabilities used by Stevie to interact with care
                   home residents.                                                                        [2]

           (iii)   Explain one disadvantage of using supervised learning to develop the
                   natural language processing capabilities used by Stevie to interact with care

     (c)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using an android robot like Ameca to
           support care home residents.                                                                   [8]
