                                                  Section A
      1. (a) Define the term price skimming.             [2]

 Price skimming is setting prices high when introducing a new product to the market. This strategy
typically works only for a limited time, as competitors will respond to the new product with innovations
to their own products. As competitors introduce new products in response, demand for the original
company’s product (the company price skimming) falls, and prices must be lowered.

N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

 N.B. simply stating “after a period of time the prices are lowered” is not enough for the second mark.

  Award [1] for a basic definition conveying the idea that price skimming involves setting a high price for
 a new product. Award an additional [1] for extra relevant information, such as the idea that the product
 is unique or differentiated from competitors’ products. Award a maximum of [2].


(b)     In Table 1, calculate the values of X, Y and Z (no working required).                     [3]

X = $2200 ($ 000) Accept $2,200,000

Y = $1000 ($ 000) Accept $1,000,000

Z = $1050 ($000) Accept $1,050,000

Accept:
X = 2200 or 2 200 000
Y = 1000 or 1 000 000
Z = 1050 or 1 050 000

Award [1] for each correct answer up to a maximum of [3].

(c) Using relevant information from Table 1, construct a fully labelled profit and loss account for DD,
for the year ending 31 December 2022.                                                                 [3]

Profit and loss account for DD for the year ending 31 December 2022 (all figures in $000)

                    Sales revenue                                    4650
                    Cost of goods sold                               2300
                    Gross profit                                     2350
                    Expenses                                         1300
                    Net profit before interest and tax               1050
                    Interest                                          10
                    Net profit before tax                            1040
                    Tax                                               140
                    Net profit after interest and tax                 900
                    Dividends                                         30
                    Retained profit                                   870


Award [3] if profit and loss account is constructed following a generally accepted format and is correct in
all respects.
                                                     –7–                                         8823 – 9229M



Award [2] for a largely accurate profit and loss account but with one error of mathematics or labelling or
two errors of order.

Award [1] if the candidate shows some understanding of what a profit and loss account is, but the actual
account constructed is not in a generally accepted format and has numerous errors.

N.B. a dollar $ symbol must be somewhere in the response, either in the heading (e.g. “figures in
$000s.”) or in the profit and loss account itself. Accept if candidates write $4650 or $4 650 000, etc..

N.B. if the profit and loss account does not have a heading to the effect of “for the year ending 31st
December 2022”, award a maximum of [2].

N.B. a heading such as “as of 31 December 2022” or “at 31 December 2022", or one that says merely
“profit and loss account” (or something to that effect) is inaccurate.

N.B. candidate own figure rule (OFR) applies. Many candidates will probably rough out a profit and loss
account on scratch paper to produce answers for (b) and then neatly reproduce the profit and loss account
on the examination paper. If a candidate makes a mathematical error in (b) and makes the same error in
(c), apply the OFR.


(d) Referring to the information in Table 1 and Table 2, explain the change in DD’s liquidity between
2021 and 2022. [2]

Award [1] for a candidate using Table 1 to explain the change in DD’s liquidity.

E.g. from table 1 cash had fallen by $5000 from 2021 to 2022 and therefore DD has less of the most
liquid of assets.

E.g. from table 1 there has been a significant increase in stocks (from $300 000 to $350 000) and as
stocks are the least liquid asset, then DD’s liquidity has decreased.

Award [1] for a candidate using Table 2 to explain the change in DD’s liquidity.

E.g. from table 2 the fall in the acid test (quick) ratio to less than 1 means that DD is now illiquid /
does not have enough liquid assets to meet its current liabilities.

The current ratio has increased a little meaning that for every $1 of current liabilities the firm has $1.6
of current assets. An acceptable ratio that will allow for the availability of sufficient working capital to pay
off the short-term debts.

Accept any other relevant explanation.

NB to achieve [2] both Tables 1 and Table 2 must be used.
                                                   –8–                                       8823 – 9229M


   2. (a) Define the term strategic alliance.    [2]

A strategic alliance is an arrangement between two or more companies to undertake a mutually
beneficial project while each retains its independence. No new business is created.

Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding, stating the agreement
between two or more companies to benefit from a project.

Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer
above and that includes reference to companies remaining independent.

(b) Calculate, for MZ, the break-even quantity/point for 2024 (show all your working).           [2]

Fixed costs = $ 60 000 + $ 80 000 + $ 20 000 = $ 160 000

Variable costs per unit = $800 + $200

Contribution per unit = Price per unit – variable costs per unit = $ 3 000 - $ 1 000 = $ 2 000

Break-Even quantity/point = Fixed costs / Contribution per unit = $ 160 000 / $ 2 000 = 80 motorcycle
transmissions (units)

Award [1] for correct working and [1] for the correct answer. Award a maximum of [2].

N.B. Do not penalize candidates who omit the word units/motorcycle transmissions.

(c) Construct a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for MZ, for 2024.
           [4]
                                                      –9–                                         8823 – 9229M


References:

TR = Total revenue

TC = Total cost

FC = Fixed costs

BEP = Break-even point

Award marks as follows:

[1] for both appropriately labelled axes. The y-axis must include both costs and revenue. The x-axis can
be any suggestion of quantity: units, motorcycles.

[1] for accurately drawn and labelled total cost line.

[1] for accurately drawn and labelled total revenue line.

[1] for indication of break-even point. OFR applies from part b. To get [1] for the break-even point, the
candidate must write “break-even point” or “BEP” somewhere near the break-even point or have an
arrow from their words to the BAEAP. Accept break-even quantity.

Award a maximum of [2] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight edge, or is not to scale.
If a candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0]

    (d) Explain the impact on MZ’s margin of safety if motorcycle transmissions are sold for
        $2000 per unit and all costs remain the same.            [2]

Considering that the margin of safety (for Price = $3 000 per unit) is 80 motorcycle transmissions (that is
because the forecasted output for 2024 is 160 motorcycle transmissions and the break-even output for
price $3 000 is 80 motorcycle transmissions. So, 160 – 80 = 80 motorcycle transmissions).

If the price falls to $2 000 per unit, with fixed and variable costs remaining the same, the margin of
safety would disappear (it will fall by 80 units or reduce to zero) because according to the stimulus
the forecasted sales for 2024 are 160 motorcycle transmissions and the new break-even point
(considering the new price $2 000) will be also 160 motorcycle transmissions in 2024. So, the new
margin of safety will be = 160 – 160 = 0 motorcycle transmissions.

Award [1] for stating that the margin of safety falls and [1] for stating that it falls by 80 or to zero. Up to a
maximum of [2].
Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR).

                                            Section B

3. a. Define the term variable costs.                                                             [2]

Variable costs are recurring costs that change with output or activity. When sales or production
increases, variable costs increase as well.

N.B. No application required. Do not credit examples.

Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
If a candidate says "variable costs are costs that vary,” award [0]
Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
Award [2] for a definition that conveys full understanding. To receive [2], the candidate must specify
that variable costs change with output or activity.

(b) Using Table 5, construct a product position map/perception map of the three existing
pet salons.                                                                                         [4]




N.B. if a candidate uses the word “quality,” rather than “reputation,” accept.

Award [1] for some understanding of a product position/perception map.

Award [2] for a correctly drawn product position/perception map with axes properly labelled.

Award [3] for a correctly drawn product position/perception map with axes properly labelled and has
placed two of the three businesses in the correct place on the map.

Award [4] for a correctly drawn product position/perception map with axes properly labelled and has
placed the three businesses in the correct place on the map.

N.B. The axes can be reversed (the Y axis could be price and the X axis could be reputation).

Accept salon A if placed on or near to the reputation axis as this represents midway between high
and low on the price axis.

Accept abbreviations for labels so long as clear.

(c) Explain two problems that Anna may encounter when starting a new business. [4]

Common problems that new business encounters include:
• Difficulty recruiting suitable employees as hers is new with no track record;
• lack of finance - again new with no track record;
• lack of identity or reputation in the marketplace - Anna has limited resources for promotion -
  Anna is possibly a sole trader;
• limited initial customer base (the market is very competitive) ;
• owners have many demands on their time - Anna is possibly a sole trader;
• lack of experience of those opening the business - Anna has no managerial experience;
• poor market research - Anna’s lack of financial resources may suggest this is true.

Accept any other relevant problem that a new business may encounter.

N.B. if Anna opens as an independent business, she will have to establish an identity in the
marketplace (which would be less of an issue if she opens as a PB franchise).

Award marks as follows:
Mark as 2+2.
Award [1] for identification of a common problem that a business may encounter and an additional
[1] for an explanation and application to the stimulus. Award a maximum of [2].
[2] can not be awarded per problem if the response lacks either explanation and / or application.
For example:
For an identification or a description of a problem with or without application [1].
For explanation of a problem with no application [1].
For explanation of a problem and application [2].
Maximum award overall: [4].

(d) Recommend whether Anna should open her pet salon as an independent business (Option 1) or
as a PB franchise (Option 2).                                                           [10]

    Both options have advantages and disadvantages.

    Option 1: advantages
    • Anna is fully her own boss, which appeals to her;
    • Anna has full decision control over what she does;
    • she retains all revenue;
    • forecasts are favourable. Anna does not “need” to be a franchise.

    Option 1: disadvantages
    • Many new businesses face a range of problems. She will have no support from a
      franchiser. She will be all on her own;
    • she is entering a competitive market;
    • Anna has no managerial experience.

    Option 2: advantages
    • Anna will be able to get equipment and supplies cheaper, presumably because the
      franchiser enjoys purchasing economies of scale;
    • as a national chain, the PB brand is well known;
    • PB will pay for national and regional promotion;
    • franchisor offers support and guidance.

    Option 2: disadvantages
    • Anna wants to be her own boss. Operating a PB franchise, she will lose some control
      over her business;
    • she has to pay a one-time fee to buy a franchise fee and, ongoing, 5% of her revenue;

• the extant pet salon franchise in the market has a better reputation than PB, even though
  its prices are comparable;
• Anna will need to pay for local promotion – although not as much as Option 1.

4. (a) Define the term niche market.                                                                 [2]

   A niche market is a specific unique market, typically a subset of a larger market, with
   specific wants and needs. Niche markets are typically small and often products sold in niche
   markets are more expensive than those outside the niche are. Customers in niche markets are
   typically passionate about the products and are thus willing to pay a premium.

   N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.
   Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.
   Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.
   Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer
   above.

(b) Explain why WJ regularly needs more working capital.                                             [4]

  According to the stimulus, WJ has a long working capital cycle. The working capital cycle refers
  to the process, involving time and funds, whereby a business purchases supplies, converts
  them into finished goods inventory, sells the inventory, and receives payment for them. As a
  manufacturer, WJ purchases raw materials on credit, converts the raw materials into finished
  goods, and then sells to wholesalers on credit. This process ties cash up. Though the credit
  WJ receives provides them with resources, those resources are presumably tied up in non-
  cash assets (inventory and debtors’ accounts) for a period of time longer than the credit terms
  WJ receives. One supplier’s shortening of credit terms (from 60 to 30 days) has made the
  issue of working capital worse. WJ’s sales are increasing, which means that it needs more and
  more capital invested in current assets.
  With every dollar of sales growth, WJ needs more working capital. For many companies, and
  especially those like WJ with rapidly increasing sales, profits are not enough to finance this
  ever-expanding need for working capital.

  Award [1] for only a partial/unclear understanding of the working capital.
  Award [2] for a clear explanation of the working capital and for linking it to the concept of working
  capital cycle.
  Award an additional [2] for a sound and thorough application to the stimulus.
  Award a maximum of [4] in total

  For [4], a candidate must indicate some understanding that the working capital cycle consists of
  inventory turnover, debtor turnover, minus creditor turnover.

(c) With reference to WJ’s new competitors, explain the terms “penetration pricing” and
“loss leader”.                                                                                     [4]

  Penetration pricing occurs when one company, trying to gain market share, enters a market
  with lower prices than its competitors to lure customers away from those competitors. For
  years, WJ, an established business in the eco-friendly camping gear market, was able to
  charge a premium for its camping gear. Now, however (“the market is changing”), new entrants
  into the eco-friendly market are trying to “buy” market share by offering their equipment at prices
  lower than WJ’s.
  A loss leader strategy occurs when a company sells one of its products at a price well below
  market – typically at a loss – to attract customers to buy other typically related, complementary,
  profitable products. One of WJ’s competitors was selling a tent at a price that, Cameron
  suspected, was below what it cost them to make it. However, this approach makes customers
  aware that the competitor is now in the eco-friendly camping equipment market, and customers
  might buy other, profitable camping products from the competitor.

  Mark as 2 + 2.

  Award [1] for providing a basic definition of penetration pricing and a further [1] for a
  development with respect to WJ and/or its competitors. Award a maximum of [2].

  Award a maximum of [4] in total.

(d) Recommend whether Cameron should choose Option 1 or Option 2.             [10]

Option 1 has several advantages. First, going public would raise WJ’s profile, something it may
need as more companies move into the eco-friendly camping equipment market. With the new
modern sustainable factory, WJ can continue to make sufficient eco-friendly camping equipment to
meet market demand. The new factory, built with new sustainable features, can further enhance
WJ’s brand-focused environmental friendliness. By manufacturing its products themselves, WJ
can ensure product quality and control all of its practices.
Disadvantages: However, going public is expensive. Cameron would no longer be the majority
shareholder and would have to answer to his shareholders in a way he had not previously had to
do. As a publicly traded company, WJ would lose some its cachet to its niche-market following.
Further, the capital raised would be insufficient to cover all of WJ’s capital requirements, and so it
would have to take on additional bank debt, which would come with interest expense and have to
be repaid.
Option 2 has several advantages. Cameron would not have to take WJ public and would thus
retain his 70% (controlling) interest in the company. The pressure of rising working capital
requirements would be reduced substantially, as WJ’s inventory turnover time would be reduced
considerably: it would receive goods from is overseas manufacturers, buy them on credit, and
immediately sell the inventory to wholesalers. WJ would be lowering its fixed costs substantially.
Option 2, however, also has disadvantages. Managing an extended supply chain is outside of
Cameron’s area of expertise. Turning over manufacturing to manufacturing suppliers in developing
countries could tarnish WJ’s brand if those companies did not themselves follow sustainable
practices or other practices that developed countries generally want (no child labour, for example).
WJ would also have less control over quality.

Accept any other relevant advantages and disadvantages to either option.

    (b) Using the Ansoff matrix, explain two of ME’s growth strategies.                                  [4]




    The strategies could be:
•   Product development: ME continuously developed new products sold to existing markets like
    the traditional burger, roasted potatoes, etc.
•   Market development: ME opened outlets in different geographical locations/ towns near by using
    the current/ same products
•   Market penetration: Selling the same products/ the same markets/customers, ME spend money
    on ATL promotion to attract more customers into their current outlets.
•   Related diversification: new plant based/healthy drink or even the movement to vegan burgers,
    assuming new segments were targeted with new product provided full explanation that ME’s target
    health-conscious drinkers/active drinker

    N.B. Do not penalize if the matrix is not drawn but candidates are expected to show understanding of
    the model and refer to the types of products/types of markets using the terminology above.

Maximum award overall: [4].

(c) Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for ME of using a loss leader pricing strategy for
the new product that will be launched in 2024.                                                   [4]

Possible advantages:
Given the increased competition in a mature saturated market and the concern about the future, a
loss leader strategy may attract more people to the outlet. A low price is likely to encourage
customers to try the new product and hopefully brand loyalty can be developed.
While purchasing the drink at a very attractive and competitive price, they are likely to purchase
some complementary products available in the outlet that are currently facing competition.
Possible disadvantages:
Given the current fall in profit, ME may quickly descend into a loss-making position overall. The
new drink may not attract the expected customers as it is said that the market for plant base
burgers is also reaching maturity/ saturation.
This strategy may be suitable for a short term only and may be unsustainable in the
medium/long term. If ME will increase the price after a certain period, customers may resent the
price increase and stop purchasing the product and search for an alternative among the
competitors.

Accept any other relevant advantage/disadvantage with appropriate application to the type of product
and to the nature of the strategy itself.

(d) Using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, evaluate ME’s core product range.       [10]




An overall evaluation of the management of the product portfolio/range should be provided.

•   Traditional beef burger is a dog that moved to this position after being a cash cow. The product
    is no longer profitable and the market is not growing (loss-making product);
•   Roasted organic potatoes is a cash cow;
•   Organic, low-fat burgers is a saturated/mature cash cow that is moving quickly towards the
    dog position. It does not make profit; it only breaks even;
•   Vegan, plant-based burgers is also a mature cash cow. More profitable than the organic
    burger but profit is levelling off;
•   Vegan pancake is a dog. A loss-making product. Probably went straight from a question marks
    position to being a dog.

A new plant-based drink product is still being developed and therefore is a cash drainer. Its future
is unknown.

On the positive side, ME introduced new products in short intervals. ME‘s managers clearly
displayed awareness that new products should be introduced to ensure a balance range. ME
captured the new social trends and moved into organic and vegan products. Some were
successful and clearly while being cash cows provided ME with the required cash to further
develop new products as well as cash to support the new product along the product life cycle to
reach maturity. All but one product did reach maturity/saturation.
ME management, being worried about the fall in profit as of 2020 and the future financial position
of ME, decided to introduce a new plant-based product to possibly fill a current gap in the
product range.

Disadvantages: However, now the product portfolio is largely unbalanced. ME has not got any
questions marks or stars, products in the introductory and growth stages. The dogs are cash
drainers and the cash cows, apart from the potatoes, are not very profitable or just break even. It
does not come as a surprise that the management in 2020 is worried about ME’s financial future. It
said in the stimulus that the profit is falling significantly. The most recent product introduced was
a failure.
                                               – 19 –                                     8823 – 9229M


There is no guarantee that the new drink be a success. There are many competitors in the
market. Even if the product will be different and exciting for the customers, the likelihood is that the
other competitors will follow soon. ME is unlikely to be able to patent a plant-based drink.
Moreover, the new drink will need financial support during the introductory and growth phase.
The use of a loss leader strategy is likely to make ME’s financial future in danger despite raising
revenue due to the low price. This pricing policy can only be sustainable in the short run.
Overall, in the short term the management of ME is right to be concerned. The product ranges are
currently not well managed.

Perhaps, more than one product should be developed every year or at shorter interval to reduce
the financial risk. Perhaps more products should be introduced imminently rather than relying on
a drink only.

Accept any other substantiated/justified judgement.

N.B. Ideally, candidates should place the products in the appropriate places on the BCG. However,
candidates may only describe/explain the positioning of each product on the model/matrix in terms of
market growth and market share.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further guidance below.

                                                Section C
Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on pages 4–5.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization on
      operations management strategy.                                                                   [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of culture on
      ethics.                                                                                           [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
      change in human resource management.                                                              [20]

N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still expected that
Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the second concept (the one
being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to be based
on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the
candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be
met for that mark to be awarded.
• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable by a
candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily reach high
levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
• Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
• Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept may be
more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1 + 1 arguments are expected per concepts.
• Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept – therefore
accept 2 + 2 arguments for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are all one-sided
then this would be unjustified.

Criterion D

• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located between the

                                                    – 21 –                                  8823 – 9229M



Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager. However,
this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
• For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
• The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with specific
explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Please do not use the adjective ‘inappropriate’ in the descriptor for [2]. If inappropriate award [1].

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A and B and in
the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to questions 6, 7 and 8.
When this happens please award marks as follows:
Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant if the
organization is fictitious.
Criterion B: 0 marks – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”
Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is fictitious.
Criterion D: mark as normal.
Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be relevant
if the organization is fictitious.
