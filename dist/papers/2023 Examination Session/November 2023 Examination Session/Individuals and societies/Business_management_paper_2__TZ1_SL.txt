Answer one question from this section.
1.   Dryed Ltd. (DD)
     Dryed Ltd. (DD) manufactures electric kettles. In the final quarter of
     2021, DD invested in new production facilities in its factory to produce
     a new and improved kettle. This kettle, using 25 % less electricity than
     competitor products, went on sale in January 2022.
     Because competitors would take 12 months to launch a similar product,
     DD adopted a price-skimming strategy for the new kettle. However,
     sales of the new kettle in 2022 were 15 % lower than DD had forecast.
              Table 1: Selected financial information for DD for the years ending 31

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Anna’s pet salon

     In 2024, Anna Holborn plans to start a new business: a pet
     grooming salon. Although Anna has no managerial experience,
     she is eager to work for herself. In Anna’s city, three pet salons
     already exist. The market is very competitive.

                        Table 5: Selected data on the three existing pet salons

               Salon              Prices            Reputation out of         Independent or
                                                      four stars (★)             franchise

           A                Medium              ★★★                         Franchise

           B                Low                 ★                           Independent

           C                High                ★★                          Franchise

     Anna is considering two options for opening her salon:
     y Option 1: Open it as an independent business, called AH Salon.
     y Option 2: Open it as a franchise of Paws Boutique (PB), a nationwide chain of pet grooming
       salon franchises that currently has no franchise in Anna’s city.
                 Table 6: Anna’s forecasted initial costs of starting a pet salon as an
                  independent business (Option 1) or as a PB franchise (Option 2)

                                              Option 1: As an             Option 2: As a PB
                                           independent business               franchise

               Equipment                             $15 000                  $12 000

               Grooming supplies                     $10 000                  $10 000

               Initial local promotion                $5000                     $2000

               Legal fees                             $2000                     $4000

               Purchase of franchise       Not applicable                     $10 000

               Total                                 $32 000                  $38 000

     If Anna buys a PB franchise, she must pay 5 % of revenue to the franchiser. The franchiser
     will pay for regional and national – but not local – promotion. Anna must purchase equipment
     from the franchiser. In other cities, PB franchises are rated medium in terms of price and ★★
     in terms of reputation.
     Anna has limited financial resources. She has prepared a forecast for the first year. She
     forecasts, as a PB franchise, an average of 200 pet grooming services per month at a price
     of $30. As an independent business, she forecasts that sales would be 10 % lower. For both
     options, fixed costs, including her salary, would be $2800 per month. Variable costs would be
     $5 per pet grooming.

4.   WindJam (WJ)

     In 1998, major camping equipment manufacturers considered eco-friendly products a niche
     market. Cameron Harris saw an opportunity, however, and founded WindJam (WJ), a private
     limited company that manufactures eco-friendly camping equipment. Cameron owned 100 %
     of WJ’s shares. WJ’s vision statement is, “Promoting environmental experiences while
     protecting the environment.”

     WJ’s eco-friendly camping equipment is expensive. Since 1998, the popularity of eco-friendly
     products increased, and WJ’s sales have grown every year.

     In 2014, WJ sold new shares to family members. With a long working capital cycle and
     increasing sales, WJ needed more working capital. This need was heightened when one
     supplier reduced its credit terms from 60 days to 30. The funds from the sale of the new
     shares increased WJ’s working capital. Cameron now owned 70 % of WJ.

     Initially, WJ faced limited competition, but the market began to change. Many large
     manufacturers are now developing eco-friendly camping equipment. Some large
     manufacturers use a loss leader pricing strategy, whereas other large manufacturers use a
     penetration pricing strategy. One competitor has also offered tents at prices that, Cameron
     suspected, were lower than production costs.

     In 2023, WJ must compete more effectively. Cameron has two options:
     y Option 1: Convert WJ to a public limited company, which could raise $10 000 000. With
        additional finance in the form of a bank loan, this amount would be enough to build a modern,
        sustainable factory and fund additional working capital. Cameron’s ownership of the company
        would fall to 30 %.
     y Option 2: Outsource all manufacturing to developing countries, where costs are lower. The sale
        of WJ’s existing factory could be used for additional working capital.

     (a)   Define the term niche market.[2]

     (b)   Explain why WJ regularly needs more working capital.                                        [4]

     (c)   With reference to WJ’s new competitors, explain the terms “penetration pricing” and
           “loss leader”.                                                                              [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether Cameron should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]

5.   Mattie Eats (ME)

     Mattie Eats (ME) is a small fast-food chain selling a range of products. Between 2017 and
     2021, ME expanded into small local towns.

               Table 7: Information on ME’s core products in the local fast-food market

     Year of         Core product          Other information about the product and the markets
     launch

      2017       Traditional beef         Was very profitable. Currently has a low market share
                 burgers                  in a declining market. It is a loss-making product. Social
                                          marketing by the government reduced demand.

      2018       Roasted organic          Currently very profitable, with a high market share. Market
                 potatoes                 growth is low.

      2019       Low-fat, 100 %           Was a very successful product. Has a high market share,
                 organic beef burgers     but the market is maturing/saturating rapidly. The product
                                          breaks even.

      2020       Vegan* burgers           A commercially successful product. Has a high market
                                          share in a mature/saturated market. Profit is levelling off.

      2021       Vegan pancakes           Has a very low market share in a highly mature/saturated
                                          market. It has not been a commercial success.

     Overall ME has been profitable, but its profits started to fall in 2020. The chief executive
     officer (CEO) is concerned about the future.

     The competition in the vegan fast-food industry is intense. Consumers see the products as
     undifferentiated and demand value for money. Last year, ME increased its above-the-line
     promotion to attract more customers.

     In 2024, ME will launch a 100 % vegan drink aimed at health-conscious consumers. A loss
     leader pricing strategy will be used.



* vegan: food and other products that do not contain animal products, including meat,
  dairy, and eggs

     (a)     Define the term social marketing.                                                             [2]

     (b)     Using the Ansoff matrix, explain two of ME’s growth strategies.                               [4]

     (c)     Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for ME of using a loss leader pricing
             strategy for the new product that will be launched in 2024.                                   [4]

     (d)     Using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, evaluate ME’s core product range.           [10]
