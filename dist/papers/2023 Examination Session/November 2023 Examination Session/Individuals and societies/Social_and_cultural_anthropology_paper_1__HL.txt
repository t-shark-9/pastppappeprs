Read the passage.

Passage adapted from Thibault, H. 2021. “Are You Married?”: Gender and Faith in Political Ethnographic
Research. Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 50(3).

     I conducted fieldwork in northern Tajikistan in 2010 and 2011. I was interested in the post-Soviet
     religious revival following the country’s independence in 1991 and the impact of the Soviet legacy
     on the place of religion in Tajik society and on conservative Muslims. I used participant observation
     and formal interviews with ordinary citizens, believers, nonbelievers and clerics.

 5   I witnessed everyday violence that occurs outside formal institutions. On two occasions, Iskandar,
     a conservative Muslim whom I knew well, got into trouble with the police. The first time, his wife
     Mera called me because Iskandar was being detained by the police for allegedly performing the
     nikoh, a religious marriage that fulfils Islamic obligations but is not recognized officially. After being
     questioned for hours and “beaten with words,” they released him without charges. Iskandar was
10   not overly upset because he was used to police harassment. The second incident was in my
     apartment. I was hosting them for dinner when a policeman visited for the routine check of my
     papers. He was shocked to see me with them because of our conservative appearance. Mera
     wore a hijab [Islamic head scarf] and a long robe, and Iskandar had a long bushy beard. I usually
     dressed more conservatively when I met them, with a modest dress and a scarf that covered
15   my hair. The policeman asked for their papers too and an argument broke out because Iskandar
     had written something in Arabic in his passport. The conversation was tense but brief and the
     policeman left, still confused about the presence of such friends. After he left, we joked about how
     in Tajikistan the police are associated with trouble, not safety.

     The policeman’s reaction highlighted the tensions between state and religion in Tajikistan. He was
20   shocked that a foreigner like me was hanging around conservative Muslims like them. “How could
     I possibly be friends with such ‘fanatics’?” he asked me later, expressing a distrust of religious
     people. He was also upset that Iskandar had desecrated [disrespected] his passport with religious
     scripture, violating the secular character of the national identity.

     In fieldwork terms, as a single foreign female in my thirties, it was easy to make contacts and get
25   access to men and women, even within conservative circles. I was treated as an “honorary male”,
     making social conventions inapplicable toward me. However, I was also seen as a “gendered,
     embodied, sexualized and emotional being”, and in Tajikistan it was unusual for a woman my age
     to be unmarried. Furthermore, divorce and polygyny* were common, and being single facilitated
     interaction with men since they perceived me as “available” and as a potential partner.

30   One time I met Iskandar at the bazaar, and he proposed that I get married to his friend I had met
     a few days before. I was used to hiding my reaction to such remarks but this time my shock was
     obvious. “How can I possibly marry someone I have met only once?” I cried. He paused and then
     asked: “Is this really uncivilized for you?” I explained that in my culture, people do not normally
     marry someone they barely know. Iskandar’s persistent attempts to get me married were a way to
35   remedy my “unfortunate” celibacy, and also showed that he did not see cultural differences as an
     obstacle to marriage. He considered me as subject to the local habitus; he expected me to conform
     to local norms. Arranged marriages are the norm in Tajikistan and many young couples do not
     know each other well before the wedding.
                                                   –3–                                             8823 – 5801


     This and similar anecdotes reveal something about the practice and conception of religion and its
40   priority over other identity markers. For strict Muslims, ethnicity was a social construct that did not
     matter. For example, when I mentioned to them that I should learn Tajik, they replied that Russian
     was enough for me to do research in Central Asia and that I should learn Arabic instead, “the
     language of the Prophet”. On the other hand, religion was something far more significant for the
     establishment of interpersonal relations and the fact that I was not Muslim did not seem to matter
45   because they assumed that I would convert to Islam.



* polygyny: marriage in which two or more women share a husband


Answer question 1 and question 2.

1.   Define the term cultural relativism and describe how it can be understood and applied in
     the context of the passage.                                                                          [4]

2.   Explain how the key concept of power helps you understand the ethnographic data
     presented in the passage.                                                                            [6]


Answer either question 3 or question 4.

3.   Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of social relations or identity is
     evident in this passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you have
     studied. Make reference to theory in your answer.                                                  [10]

Answer question 5.

5.   To what extent is knowing others possible? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of

                                                      Section B

Answer question 6.

6.   With reference to either stimulus A or stimulus B and your own knowledge, discuss the
     defining features of anthropological ethics.                                                                          [10]


Stimulus A

     By the end of 2017, approximately 31 million children were living in a country other than the
     one where they were born (UNICEF). Many migrant children arrive at destination countries as
     part of a diasporic family, entirely alone or travelling with persons other than their parents. What
     does informed consent mean in practice when researching migrant children who are separated
     from their parents in this way? This became an issue in my fieldwork as consent was explained
     through the gatekeepers involved, who were youth workers and social workers. Elements such
     as ideals, cultural values, personal and professional behaviour played a role in shaping all of the
     field relationships. I provided information about the project, upon which consent would be based,
     directly to gatekeepers. The children, however, only received the information about the project
     indirectly, raising questions about their voluntary participation. Nonetheless, it is important
     to acknowledge the positive role played by these gatekeepers, including their openness and
     honesty regarding whether the study would benefit these children.

Stimulus B

The Visible Voices project included workshops in the Rocinha favela (slum neighbourhood) in Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil, where residents could learn to take photographs and make films about self-identified
issues in relation to public health, as part of a collaborative ethnographic project.

The photo shows one of the local residents, a young woman, standing using a camera facing the
photographer who took the photo of her. The photo was taken inside what seems to be a classroom in a
school. It also includes a second young woman smiling (also one of the local residents) sitting in one of
the school benches, next to the first woman and also facing the photographer.
