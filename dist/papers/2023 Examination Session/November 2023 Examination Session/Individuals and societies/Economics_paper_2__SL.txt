Answer one question.

1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Overview of Poland

     1   Poland, a Central European country, has experienced strong economic growth for many years,
         particularly after 2004, when it joined the European Union (EU). However, there are concerns
         for its future. Government spending will need to be increased significantly, mainly due to the
         healthcare and pension costs of an ageing population.

     2   The ageing population and the growing economy will cause a shortage of workers in the labour
         market, adding to inflationary pressures. The central bank, National Bank of Poland (NBP), has
         maintained an inflation target of 2.5 % for several years. Despite this, inflation reached 7.4 %
         in 2021, higher than the average EU rate of 4.9 %. Therefore, in early 2022, the NBP raised its
         interest rate to 2.75 %.

     3   The exchange rate for the zloty (Poland’s currency) is a floating exchange rate, although
         the NBP occasionally intervenes in the foreign exchange market. Exports have become more
         diversified, but they are still mostly low-tech and medium-tech products, which are mainly
         exported to other European countries.

     4   Shortages of skilled labour may slow down the implementation of new “greener” technology.
         Education and training need to be improved to help workers adjust to new technologies in
         the renewable energy sector and other “green” sectors. The inadequate digital and transport
         infrastructure, combined with low research and development spending in the private sector, also
         restricts innovation. Therefore, the adoption of new technologies depends on imports of high-
         tech capital from countries such as Germany, Japan and the United States (US).

     5   Over 90 % of Poland’s electricity is produced from fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas), whereas, on
         average, EU countries rely on fossil fuels to generate only 68 % of their energy. Coal-fired power
         plants, which generate about 80 % of Poland’s electricity, often do not meet EU regulations on
         emissions and emit excessive amounts of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants. Therefore,
         air pollution is a serious problem throughout Poland and the mortality rate due to air pollution is
         38 per 100 000 people, compared with the EU average of 20 per 100 000 people.

Text B — Environmental policies

     1   Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants have been introduced. For
         example, new government programmes and regulations are reducing air pollution from heating.
         Grants and loans are available for buying non-polluting heaters and installing renewable energy
         systems. The use of coal in electricity generation is gradually being decreased and the share of
         renewables is expected to rise to over 20 % within 10 years. Moreover, the first nuclear power
         plant will be operating by 2033.

     2   However, the overall level of emissions is rising. Therefore, the World Bank is recommending
         awareness campaigns, subsidies and increased regulations. More government support for
         energy efficiency measures (for example, modernizing electricity grids) and renewable energy
         projects is necessary. Such measures would also act as a fiscal stimulus, due to the required
         increase in government spending.

(Question 1 continued)

   3    Carbon taxes are relatively low and not very effective in reducing energy consumption.
        Exemptions from carbon taxes are given to farmers and low-income households, because they
        spend proportionately more on fuel. In addition, some subsidies are given for fossil fuel use.
        High taxes on cars and electricity would raise revenues that could help to finance environmental
        projects, but they would need to be accompanied by support for those on low incomes.

Text C — Public transport

   1    As incomes have grown, the number of passengers using public transport has decreased, while
        the number of cars has increased. Consequently, the amount of emissions per person due to
        transportation has more than doubled in 20 years. Furthermore, the structure of vehicle taxes in
        Poland does not encourage the use of hybrid and electric cars, unlike the tax structure in most
        high-income countries.

   2    Policies to improve the quality and availability of public transport are needed, because
        consumers will not respond significantly to lower prices. A single public transport ticket in
        Poland’s capital city is 4.40 zloty and the price elasticity of demand for urban public transport
        services is estimated to be only -0.38. Increasing investment in public transport would also
        promote worker mobility and productivity growth.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Senegal and its natural resources

     1   Senegal is a country in West Africa with a stable democracy. Its main industries are extraction
         of minerals and fuels, construction, fishing and tourism. About 25 % of exports are minerals
         and fuels.

     2   In 2019, large oil and gas deposits were discovered offshore. Imports of machinery needed
         for extraction caused an increase in the current account deficit. From 2022, after oil and gas
         production starts, exports are expected to increase. However, profits and interest payments will
         have to be paid overseas to lenders and firms which invested in the oil and gas industry.

     3   Although minerals and fuels represent a large part of gross domestic product (GDP), they
         do not provide much employment. Furthermore, these industries contribute only about 5 %
         of government tax revenue. The low tax collection is due to tax concessions granted to the
         multinational companies (MNCs) which do the extraction. These MNCs are needed because,
         at present, neither the government nor local companies have the technology and expertise to
         extract the minerals and fuels.

     4   Senegal is not self-sufficient in food. A large amount of rice is imported because domestic rice is
         usually more expensive than imported rice. The government is trying to promote agriculture and,
         in 2015, imposed a tariff of 10 % on rice imports.

     5   Sustainable management of common pool resources (common access resources), such as
         forests and fisheries, is difficult. The water supply (from rivers and underground) is a common
         pool resource, which is often used unsustainably by farmers to irrigate their rice fields. This
         results in a negative externality, namely depletion of the water supply, which causes problems
         for villagers who need water.

Text E — Poverty and inequality in Senegal

     1   According to the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), 28 % of Senegalese are deprived
         in over half the indicators (such as nutrition and sanitation) and are considered to be living in
         severe poverty. Over 50 % of Senegalese are deprived in more than a third of the indicators.

     2   During the last 10 years, poverty has been reduced and unemployment has fallen. However,
         inequality between urban and rural areas persists. The minimum hourly wage in the non-
         agricultural sector is 317 West African CFA francs (Senegal’s currency), which is almost 50 %
         higher than that for the agricultural sector. Despite increases in agricultural productivity, farmers
         are still vulnerable to weather shocks such as drought and floods. Many regions are in a poverty
         trap because households cannot invest much in physical capital or human capital.

     3   School attendance is free and compulsory for children up to 16 years old, but there are
         hidden costs, such as expenditure on school materials and transport, and opportunity costs.
         Consequently, while primary school enrolment is over 80 %, secondary school enrolment is less
         than 40 %.

     4   Moreover, there is significant gender inequality. The completion rate for girls in secondary
         education is lower than for boys. Secondary education is particularly important for girls because
         it provides skills for the job market, leading to higher future earnings. Moreover, girls with more
         education have lower fertility rates.

(Question 2 continued)

Text F — Taxation policies in Senegal

   1    The total tax revenue is equal to 15 % of GDP in Senegal, whereas it often exceeds 20 %
        of GDP in similar economies. Therefore, in a study on Senegal, the International Monetary
        Fund (IMF) recommends increased taxes, under certain conditions. Firstly, the rise should be
        equitable and the taxation structure should be effective. Secondly, the extra revenue should
        be used for more spending on infrastructure, health and education and for transfer payments,
        which can increase growth. For example, cash transfers of just US$200 each to Senegalese
        farmers also raised output, because the money was used to buy fertilizers.

   2    However, increases in certain taxes can reduce output and increase inequality. Senegal’s tax
        revenue mainly comes from indirect taxes and corporate income taxes, because it is difficult
        to collect personal income taxes in the large informal economy. The IMF study shows that an
        increase in indirect tax has the lowest negative effect on growth but widens inequality, especially
        between rural and urban areas. In contrast, an increase in corporate income tax would narrow
        the urban–rural income gap and would not reduce incentives or output significantly.
