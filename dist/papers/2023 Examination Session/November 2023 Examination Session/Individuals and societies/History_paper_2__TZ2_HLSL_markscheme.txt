           substantiated assertions.
    0      Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Examine the impact of changes in social structures and systems on two societies, each chosen
     from a different region.

     Candidates will consider the impact of changes in social structures and systems on two societies.
     The two societies must be from different regions but they may or may not have been
     contemporaneous. The impact of changes may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
     societies, or they may prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both societies will be a
     feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer
     to the impact of changes to the role of women, such as during the Tang dynasty when female
     enslavement became the norm. The impact of changes in class structure may be examined, for
     example the multiplication of Indian castes, and the introduction of the Tokugawa class system in
     Japan, or there may be a focus on the assimilation of migrant populations such as the Vikings into
     parts of western Europe and the Rus into Muscovy. The impact of changes in the pattern of
     landholding pattern and obligations associated with it may be examined, such as the European
     feudal system or the impact of Aztec settlements as they transitioned from being migrant to
     permanent, around Tenochtitlan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

2.   Evaluate the impact of two key individuals on cultural and intellectual developments in the period
     750–1400.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of two key individuals on cultural and intellectual
     developments in the period 750-1400, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two
     individuals may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been
     contemporaries. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both individuals, or they may
     prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both will be a feature of the response. A
     comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may evaluate Chaucer’s influence on
     the English language, Dante’s pioneering of the use of the vernacular or Hildegard of Bingen’s
     impact on music. There may be evaluation of the patronage of Mansa Musa, who established a
     centre of Islamic learning in Mali, Wenzong’s codification of literature, artworks and calligraphy, or
     Caliph al-Mansur's introduction of foreign scholarship to the Arab audience. Both importance and
     limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –5–                                      8823 – 5305M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   Evaluate the importance of the short and long-term causes of two wars.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of two medieval wars weighing up the importance or otherwise
     of the long and short-term causes. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate the importance of the long and the
     short-term causes in Europe and the Middle East of one or more of the Crusades. Causes may
     include Papal concerns over feuding among nobles; access of pilgrims to Christian sites in
     Jerusalem; access to land, resources and trade. The relative importance of issues of succession
     upon the death of Tezozomoc and the emergence of the Aztec Triple Alliance as causes of the
     Tepanec War may be evaluated or the importance of rival claimants to the title and lands of the
     Great Khan, among other causes of the Toluid civil war. The relative importance of the long and
     short-term causes of the Norman invasion of England may be evaluated with issues such as
     succession to the English throne and the weakness of the English monarch weighed against the
     ambitions of the Duke of Normandy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.

4.   “The most significant effect of war was demographic change.” With reference to two wars, to what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits, or otherwise, of the statement that the most significant effect of
     war was demographic change. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and may or
     may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Consequences may extend beyond the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     consider the demographic impact of the Crusades upon Europe and/or the Middle East where, for
     example, there was a significant increase in Christian settlements. The effect of the Hundred Years
     War leading to a decline in the population of France would also be relevant. In Asia, the extension
     of the Mongol Empire affected the population of China with some regions being subject to a decline
     in population. Similarly, the effect of wars led to the abandonment of cities and the decline of the
     Mayan Empire. While other relevant effects such as shifts in borders or change of ruler or religion
     may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in question. Candidates
     may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                  –6–                                     8823 – 5305M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   “Rulers were rarely successful in achieving their aims.” Discuss with reference to two rulers, each
     chosen from a different region.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that rulers were rarely
     successful in achieving their aims. The two rulers must be from different regions but they may or
     may not have been contemporaries. Achievements and failures may extend beyond the timeframe
     but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of the two rulers, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both
     rulers will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may discuss rulers such as Louis XI of France and Charlemagne who were
     overwhelmingly successful both militarily and in promoting domestic prosperity. Itzcoatl too laid the
     foundations of the Aztec Empire and presided over the construction of a new capital city. Others,
     such as Harun al-Rashid and Emperor Huizong had mixed records, both established vibrant
     cultural centres but failed to stifle internal and/or external threats. Candidates may agree, partly
     agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

6.   Compare and contrast the methods of government and administration of two rulers.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the methods of
     government and administration of two rulers, referring to both throughout. The two rulers may or
     may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaries. For
     comparison, candidates may refer to the importance of legal reform to rulers such as Emperor
     Frederick I and Henry II of England. Both Emperor Hongwu and Genghis Khan established a
     meritocratic civil service. Basil II and Genghis Khan both strove to contain the power of noble
     families, either by the redistribution of noble estates or the awarding of positions of honour
     according to bravery and loyalty rather than hereditary title. In contrast, there is little record of
     Timur setting up institutions of state as he relied on terror and military prowess. Both similarities
     and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.
                                                  –7–                                    8823 – 5305M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Examine the impact of changing patterns of trade on the economies of two countries.

     Candidates will consider the interrelationship between changing patterns of trade and the
     economies of two countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region. A
     comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may examine the impact of the spice
     trade upon the economy of the Netherlands and how this shifted the focus of trade away from
     Europe as well as significantly increasing the wealth of the country. There may be an examination
     of the impact upon Venice of the Portuguese trade with Africa and the Orient, and how this
     contributed to the decline of the Venetian economy. The deleterious impact upon the Spanish
     economy of the influx of gold and silver from the Americas may be examined. In India, the
     establishment of the English East India Trading Companies and the impact this had upon local
     economies may be examined. An examination of the impact of indentured labour and the slave
     trade upon the economies of the Thirteen Colonies would also be relevant as well as the impact
     the slave trade had upon the Kingdom of Allada, for example. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence

8.   Discuss the cultural and intellectual impact of two key figures, each chosen from a different region.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the cultural and intellectual impact of
     two key figures. The two key figures may or may not be from the same region and may or may not
     have been contemporaries. Their impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly
     linked to the issue in the question. Candidates may discuss Li Shizhen (1518-1593) who was
     renowned for his medical texts, especially concerning inoculations and treatment of smallpox.
     Wang Yangmin (1472-1529) had a significant impact on philosophy with his emphasis on “innate
     knowledge” leading, ultimately, to a rejection of Song/Ming ideologies. In the Americas, the
     influence of Bartolome de Las Casas may be discussed as he worked to institute and protect the
     rights of the indigenous population as embodied in the New Laws of 1542. Machiavelli (1459-
     1527), diplomat, philosopher and historian was influential far beyond Florence and the court of the
     Medicis. His book, “The Prince”, influenced ruling dynasties throughout Europe. Ottoman
     astronomer Taqi-al-din (1526-1585) was a renowned engineer and inventor as well as a
     philosopher and theologian. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                                     8823 – 5305M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    “The nature of rule was the main reason for the ascendancy of states.” Discuss with reference to
      two states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the nature of rule was
      the main reason for the ascendancy of states. The two states may or may not be from the same
      region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Reasons may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may prioritize their discussion of
      one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may discuss the ascent of Peter the Great’s Russia that was
      founded on reforms of government while remaining heavily dependent on the leader’s personality.
      The ascent of Tokugawa was supported by powerful shoguns and daimyo, efficient administration
      and lucrative taxation. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

10.   “Issues of succession were the main cause of internal conflict.” Discuss with reference to two early
      modern states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that issues of succession
      were the main cause of internal conflict. The two states may or may not be from the same region
      and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Causes may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the two states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
      both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may discuss a series of disputed successions which blighted the later Mughal Empire
      and the imperial reigns of Kangxi (the Nine Lords’ War) and Yongzheng. Civil War, fought between
      half-brothers who claimed succession, weakened the Inca Empire in the face of Pizarro’s threat.
      Alternatively, The English Civil War was fought over constitutional and religious issues. While
      other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                                   8823 – 5305M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the impact of technological developments on the outcome of two wars, each chosen from
      a different region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of technological developments on the
      outcome of two wars. The two wars must be chosen from different regions but they may or may not
      have been contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may evaluate the importance of technology on the defeat of the Spanish Armada with
      reference to the development of naval tactics and the fast re-loading of cannons deployed by the
      English fleet. There may be an evaluation of the deployment of smaller but better-trained armies by
      Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years War, along with the application of technology such as
      the use of muskets, making armies more mobile. The impact of technology, such as the use of
      gunpowder and musketry, was significant to the outcome of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec
      Empire. The importance of rocketry used by the Mughal army in the Siege of Bidar during the
      consolidation of the empire, may be evaluated. While other relevant factors such as skillful
      strategy; effective leadership; the weakness of enemies may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

12.   “Peacemaking that followed wars was rarely successful.” With reference to two wars, to what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that peacemaking that
      followed wars was rarely successful. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and
      may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. The consequences of peacemaking may
      extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. In
      China, the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), went some way to regularizing relations between China and
      Russia but was followed in 1727 by the Treaty of Kiakhta, that encouraged religious and cultural
      exchanges as well as addressing issues such as trade that had continued to imperil peacemaking.
      The Treaty of Nasuh Pasha between the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Persia was signed in 1612,
      although disputes over the payment of tribute led to the renewal of warfare. Meanwhile, the Treaty
      of Westphalia (1648), may be seen to have brought a period of peace and stability to Europe
      following the Thirty Years War. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement,
      but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence
      and sound argument.
                                                  – 10 –                                  8823 – 5305M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the impact of technological developments on industrialization in two countries.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of technological developments on industrialization
      in two countries, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two countries may or may not be
      from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries, or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one of them. However, both countries will be a feature of the response. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may appraise the impact of
      developments in transport, such as railways and canals, in transporting raw materials and finished
      products. New technology, such as the cotton gin and the steam engine, gave impetus to the
      Industrial Revolution and enabled mass production. The use of new technology in agriculture
      increased yield and helped to feed the new industrial towns. Both importance and limitations must
      be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

14.   Discuss the social impact of urbanization on two countries.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact of urbanisation on two
      countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not
      have been contemporaneous with each other. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      both countries, or they may prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both countries will
      be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may
      discuss problems related to public health and poor housing, or, more positively, in the long term,
      improved access to healthcare and education. There may be discussion of how poor urban social
      provision may have impacted on levels of poverty, crime and social disunity. Commonly,
      urbanization has led to depopulation of the countryside and so impacting rural communities and
      family structure. There may be discussion of living conditions in suburbia, for example, compared
      to inner cities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –                                  8823 – 5305M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Evaluate the importance of political ideology in the rise of two independence movements, each
      chosen from a different region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the role of political ideology in the rise of two independence
      movements weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two movements must be from different
      regions, but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Importance may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of two movements, or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one of them. However, both movements will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may evaluate the role of Ho Chi Minh’s communism in
      Vietnam, the role of socialism and Pan-Africanism in Ghana, Marti’s passion for social justice in
      Cuba, or Jinnah’s conversion to ‘two-religions-two nations’ in Pakistan. Both importance and
      limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While
      other relevant factors such as leadership and the role of colonial powers may be referred to, the
      bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

16.   “Non-violent methods were more effective than violent methods in achieving independence.”
      Discuss with reference to two states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that non-violent methods were
      more effective than violent methods in achieving independence. The two states may or may not be
      from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states, or they may prioritize their discussion of
      one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may discuss the initially disappointing results from non-violent
      methods in India, noting that independence, while accompanied by violence, was achieved, in part,
      due to the economic weakness of Britain. Violence was centrally important to Bolivar’s victories in
      South America and to the achievement of independence in Greece and Algeria. Despite military
      victory over the Spanish, Filipino independence was eventually granted peacefully by the US. In
      Kenya, the violence associated with the Mau-Mau movement and its suppression may be
      discussed along with non–violent methods and the leadership of Kenyatta in achieving
      independence. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and
      sound argument.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)


17.   “Economic forces were the most important influence on the development of democratic states.”
      Discuss with reference to two states, each chosen from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced response to the statement that economic forces
      were the most important influence on the development of democratic states. The two democratic
      states must be from different regions but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with
      each other. Candidates may discuss how the economic impact of the First World War, along with
      reparation payments, made for a rocky start to Weimar Germany whilst the perceived stability of
      the “Golden Years” contributed to its democratic development prior to its demise due, in part, to the
      Great Depression. During the post-war occupation of Japan, the liberal economic policies of the
      “New Dealers” may be discussed and linked to the push for greater democracy. In post-war Italy,
      the impact of the Marshall Plan may be discussed as a factor that contributed to the “economic
      miracle” of the 1950s and the steadying of post-war democracy. In Argentina, economy crises
      threatened democracy, that evolved only upon their resolution. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, such as governmental institutions or political representation, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

18.   “Policies towards women were rarely successful in achieving their aims.” Discuss with reference to
      two democratic states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced response to the statement that policies towards
      women were rarely successful in achieving their aims. The two democratic states may or may not
      be from different regions and may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. Candidates
      may discuss women being given the right to vote in Japan in 1945 and being free to marry without
      the permission of the male patriarch of the family. However, full economic and social equality
      remained elusive. In the US the Equal Pay Act of 1963 may be seen to have had some success
      and various ERA measures were adopted by many, but not all, states. In South Africa, legislation
      was passed to ensure equal pay for women and protection against domestic violence but with
      limited success. In the UK, the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1970 and paid maternity leave
      became law in 1994. In India, the Sati Prevention Act was passed in 1987, although this was
      perceived by some as government interference with religious belief. Candidates may agree, partly
      agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Evaluate the impact of war on the emergence of two authoritarian states, each chosen from a
      different region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of war upon the emergence of two authoritarian
      states weighing up its importance, or otherwise. The two states must be from different regions, but
      they may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may evaluate the impact
      on the emergence of Fascist Italy of the “mutilated peace” and public anger over the high number
      of war casualties. The emergence of Lenin and the Bolshevik state may be linked to the March
      Revolution that was rooted in economic crises exacerbated by the First World War. For Nazi
      Germany, defeat in the First World War gave rise to the myths of the “stab in the back” and the
      “diktat”, that were central to the emergence of the NSDAP. In China, the impact of the Sino-
      Japanese War and the civil war that brought victory to the CCP may be evaluated. The 1948 Arab-
      Israeli conflict damaged the reputation of King Farouk of Egypt, leading to his overthrow and the
      emergence of the FOM and Nasser. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

20.   Evaluate the impact of foreign policy on the maintenance of power in two authoritarian states.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of foreign policy in the maintenance of power in
      two authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be from different regions and may or may
      not be contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may evaluate the impact of Hitler’s foreign
      policy on his maintenance of power in Nazi Germany and may argue that the failure of Operation
      Barbarossa led to his downfall. In Fascist Italy, Mussolini’s brutal Pacification of Libya, the invasion
      of Ethiopia and Italy’s involvement in the Spanish Civil War may have helped him maintain power
      but failed military campaigns led to his overthrow in 1943 and demise in 1945. For Egypt under
      Nasser, the nationalisation of the Suez Canal was a major success and, despite involvement in the
      North Yemen civil war and defeat in the Six Day War, he remained president until his death in
      1970. For China, the impact of Mao’s foreign policies such as involvement in the Korean War; the
      Sino-Soviet Split; and rapprochement with the US may be evaluated. While other, relevant factors
      such as the use of force or propaganda may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   Compare and contrast the short-term causes of two civil wars.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the short-term causes
      of two civil wars, referring to both throughout. The two civil wars may or may not be from the same
      region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Causes may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Comparison and contrast may refer to types of short-term causes. Ideology was a factor in Spain,
      where the radicalism of the left-wing government contributed to the CEDA’s right wing backlash;
      the Russian Civil War was caused by remnants of Tsarist support, resistance to policies such as
      land reform and opposition to the imposition of communist rule. Economic causes of civil war were
      also influential, such as hyperinflation in mid 1940s China, whilst the withdrawal of colonial powers
      and the emerging rivalry of the Cold War were factors in both Vietnam and Korea. Factionalism in
      the army and among tribes was a short-term factor in North Yemen. Both similarities and
      differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

22.   Discuss the short-term political impact of two wars, each chosen from a different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the short-term political impact of two
      wars. The two wars must be from different regions, but they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of two wars, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may discuss the impact of the First
      World War on the balance of power, and instability, in Europe, or the Soviet takeover of Eastern
      Europe after the Second World War that coincided with the beginnings of the Cold War. The
      Falklands/Malvinas War resulted in the fall of the Argentine junta and a strengthening of the
      domestic position of Margaret Thatcher. There may be discussion of the flight of Jiang to Taiwan
      after the communist victory in China, which also had political repercussions on the political
      landscape in the US. The First Gulf War saw the survival of Saddam, the restoration of Kuwaiti
      independence, and autonomy for Kurdistan. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   Discuss the social and cultural impact of the Cold War on two countries, each chosen from a
      different region.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social and cultural impact of the
      Cold War on two countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region and may or
      may not be contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the ideological impact of Cold War rivalry on society and culture in the
      USSR where much was made of public access to “high cultural” such as theatre, ballet and
      orchestral concerts, as well as sporting prowess in events such as the Olympics. The social impact
      was evident such as travel restrictions, limited access to foreign news and an emphasis on the
      external threat posed by ideological enemies. In the US, the McCarthy era led to the boycott of
      Hollywood writers and actors, whilst there was CIA funding for abstract art and Encounter
      magazine. Meanwhile, fear of nuclear war led to the building of bomb shelters and the inculcation
      of drills in schools and society at large. In Cuba, the impact of the Cold War led to greater
      dependency on the USSR and an obligation to follow its cultural and social guideline The cultural
      and social impact of the Cold War on scientific education, as well as the teaching of History, in
      specific countries may be discussed. Candidates may also discuss the environmental impact of
      nuclear testing on society. Candidate's’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

24.   “Superpower rivalry increased as a result of Cold War crises.” With reference to two crises, each
      chosen from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that superpower rivalry
      increased as a result of Cold War crises. The two crises may or may not be chosen from a
      different region and may or may not be contemporaneous with each other. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the Cuban Missile Crisis
      when superpower rivalry increased during the crisis but decreased subsequently with
      agreements reached over the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Cuba and Turkey and
      limits placed on the atmospheric testing and, later, the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
      The Berlin Blockade increased tension over the application of post-war agreements and
      exacerbated rivalry leading to deeper divisions between the US and the USSR. Arguably,
      the Berlin Crisis of 1958-61 and the building of the Wall led to a more stable Berlin, and so
      relieved pressure in one of the most dangerous pressure points of Cold War rivalry.
      Although the Hungarian Revolution and the Suez Crisis may have worsened relations
      between the superpowers and their allies, suggesting a possible decrease in tension,
      nevertheless, these two crises also heightened superpower rivalry. Candidates may
      agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
