Paper 2 assessment criteria

Criterion A — Focus on the question
[2]
To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being
raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or
breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are
showing that they understand the issues or problems.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1       Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2       Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding
[6]
This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific
areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is
targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
  1–2
            Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

            The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks
            detail.
  3–4
            Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper
            understanding.

            The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
  5–6
            Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–                          8823 – 9301/9303M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer
[6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research
to support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research
are appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is
relevant and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points
relevant to the answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0      Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

           Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
  1–2
           Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

           Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  3–4      partly explained.
           Research selected partially develops the argument.

           Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  5–6      thoroughly explained.
           Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                   –5–                          8823 – 9301/9303M


Criterion D — Critical thinking
[6]
This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate
critical thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research
used to support that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition,
students could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a
well-developed evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic
judgement of their achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
  1–2
            Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

            The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
  3–4
            Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

            The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
  5–6
            Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.


Criterion E — Clarity and organization
[2]
This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A
good response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
    1
            throughout the response.

    2       The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.
                                                    –6–                          8823 – 9301/9303M


Abnormal psychology

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review that
     addresses various aspects of validity and/or reliability of diagnosis.

     Relevant classification systems in the discussion of validity and reliability of
     diagnosis include, but are not limited to:
     • Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM)
     • Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD)
     • International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

     Examples of research that could be used include, but are not limited to:
     • Nicholls et al.’s (2000) studies of inter-rater reliability
     • Seeman’s (2007) literature review on the reliability of diagnosis
     • Wakefield et al.’s (2007) study on the validity of diagnosis
     • Silverman et al.’s (2001) study on test-retest of anxiety symptoms and diagnosis
     • Rosenhan’s studies of diagnostic validity.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological difficulties of conducting research on validity and/or reliability of
        diagnosis
     • cultural, gender and/or ethical considerations related to research into validity
        and/or reliability of diagnosis
     • biases related to diagnosis
     • how the findings of the research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings.

     Candidates may address validity or reliability in diagnosis to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may address both to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
     approaches are acceptable.

     Validity and/or reliability must be considered in context of diagnosis not treatment.
     However, relevant discussion of implications for treatment is creditworthy.

     Findings of the study/studies need to be used to assess the extent to which
     diagnosis is valid and/or reliable. If studies are presented in a vague and general
     manner which does not support the response then the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C: use of research to support answer.

     • Marsala’s (1979) study on cultural conceptions of mental health
     • Kleinman’s (1982) study on culture and depression
     • Brown and Harris’s (1978) study on social origins of depression in women.

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into the biological
        approach and sociocultural approach to understanding etiology
     • the issue of reductionism versus holism
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty (including research methods used and data uncertainties)
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence.

     If the candidate provides only an implicit contrast, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [2] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded
     marks according to the best fit approach.

     If the candidate provides only a discussion of one approach to understanding the
     etiology of abnormal psychology, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of
     [3] for criterion B and. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks according to the
     best fit approach.

     Discussion points related to culture and treatment may include but are not limited
     to:
     • culture-bound disorders
     • accessibility of treatment
     • interpretation of the symptoms
     • cultural norms
     • gender differences within different cultures
     • different cultural approaches to treatment
     • etic versus emic approaches to treatment
     • cultural acceptance of treatment.

     Candidates may address one disorder to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may address
     more than one disorder to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are
     acceptable.

     • cognitive skills (such as intelligence and problem-solving)
     • self-regulation skills
     • positive views of self
     • motivation to be effective in the environment
     • genetic influence.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Masten and Coatsworth’s (1998); Pettit et al.’s (1997) studies on positive relationships of
       at least one supportive parent or caregiver
     • McRae et al.’s (2012) study on the ability to monitor and assess negative thoughts and
       replace them with more positive ones
     • Karreman and Vingerhoets’s (2012) study on the role of attachment style on resilience
     • Ozbay et al.’s (2008) study on the link between seeking social support and resilience
     • Leontopoulou’s (2010); Southwick et al.’s (2005) studies on how prosocial behaviour and
       altruism are associated with resilience
     • Russo et al.’s (2012); Feder et al.’s (2009) studies on a range of human genes linked to
       resilient phenotypes
     • Koluchova’s study (1972).

     Critical discussion may include but is not limited to:
     • variable-focused approach versus person-focused approach in the study of resilience
     • implications for promoting resilience in child rearing
     • possible gender difference in emotional regulation/cognitive reappraisal
     • methodological and ethical considerations
     • alternative factors and/or explanations.

     Candidates may offer content concerning negative factors influencing the
     development of resilience - e.g. the impact of poverty, malnutrition or abuse on
     further development and argue that this has a negative impact on resilience. This
     approach is acceptable as long as it is clearly linked to the development of
     resilience.

     Candidates may address one factor to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may
     address more than one factor to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
     approaches are acceptable.

       influence a child’s attachment pattern
     • Van Ijzendorn and Kroonenberg’s (1988) study on how cross-cultural patterns
       of attachment influence development
     • Pratt and Norris (1994) – positive attachment in early relationships leads to
       positive reports on current social relationships
     • Rossi and Rossi (1990) – people who grew up in cohesive families tended to
       establish positive relationships with their own partners.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • cultural considerations
     • the role of deprivation in attachment
     • short-term versus long-term effects in attachment
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into
        attachment.

     Responses referring to research with animals, such as Harlow’s studies with
     rhesus monkeys, are relevant but must be linked to attachment and development.
     Relevance of such studies for human development will be reflected in discussion
     under criterion D.
                                                – 11 –                        8823 – 9301/9303M

     It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address other relevant factors in order
     to respond to the command term “to what extent”.

     Candidates could choose to discuss the extent to which dispositional factors or
     health beliefs affect one, or more than one health-related phenomena. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may address a small number of dispositional factors and/or health
     beliefs in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may address a larger
     number of dispositional factors and/or health beliefs in order to demonstrate
     breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

8.   Discuss one or more ethical considerations in research related to health problems.    [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of
      ethical considerations in research related to health problems.

      Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
      • protection of participants
      • issues of consent/assent
      • debriefing
      • right to withdraw from a study
      • use of deception
      • confidentiality
      • anonymity.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Speisman et al.’s (1964) study on cognitive appraisal and stress (difficulty in
        withdrawing, deception, undue stress and harm)
      • Cohen’s study on stress and illness (deception, right to withdraw, undue
        stress and harm)
      • Koch et al.’s (2008) study on stress and obesity (informed consent, research
        on minors)

        deception)
      • Joseph’s (2015) study on consumption of fast food (informed consent)

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • the considerations of conducting research in a different culture
      • why deception is used
      • the difficulties of ensuring confidentiality
      • the role of informed consent
      • decisions as to why certain ethical guidelines were/were not followed
      • changes over time in adherence to ethical standards/guidelines.

      Candidates may address one ethical consideration to demonstrate depth of
      knowledge     or may address more than one ethical consideration to
      demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

      While the response may include some description of studies, the main focus of the
      response should be on the ethical considerations. If a candidate describes and discusses
      studies but does not focus on ethical considerations the response should be awarded up
      to a maximum of [2] for criterion D. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
      according to the best fit approach.

      If a candidate solely focuses on ethical issues in research related to mental
      health issues with no explicit link to health problems the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [2] for criterion B. All remaining criteria should be
      awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

9.   Discuss the effectiveness of one or more health promotion programmes.                      [22]

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to make a considered review of the
     effectiveness of health promotion programmes. The effectiveness relates to the success
     rate of any health promotion programme.

     Health promotion programmes are an attempt to promote health behaviour. Health
     promotion programmes are those initiatives designed to assist people in gaining control
     over and improving their own health. These may be public or a government programmes, or
     may be privately sponsored. In addition, these programmes may be developed on an
     individual, local, national, or international level.

     Examples of health promotion programmes may include, but are not limited to:
     • food labelling programmes
     • stress reduction programmes such as MBSR or yoga
     • health education campaigns such as the TRUTH anti-tobacco campaign
     • NHS’s ‘Healthy Child Programme’; keeping children healthy and safe (UK)
     • public health campaigns designed to change beliefs and attitudes
     • NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (UK)
     • taxes and/or subsidies upon products such as sugar, tobacco or alcohol
     • National Tobacco Campaign (Australia).

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Peckmann and Reibling’s (2006) study of the effectiveness of fear campaigns
     • Yee et al.’s (2006) study of effectiveness of strategies to change behaviours related to
       obesity
     • Sly et al.’s (2002) survey on community based anti-smoking promotion among teens
     • Holm’s (2002) survey on the efficiency of health campaigns
     • Schum and Gould’s (2007) study of why health campaigns are effective
     • Morris and Wilson (2005) ‘Investigating smoking behaviours and attitudes of nurses and
       nursing assistants using the Health Belief Model’
     • Prochaska and Di Clemente’s (1983) ‘Longitudinal research on the effectiveness of the
       Integrative Model of change for smoking behaviour’
     • Marlatt and Gordon’s (1985) ‘Relapse prevention: maintenance strategies in the
       treatment of addictive Behaviors’
     • Huhman et al.’s (2007) evaluation of a national physical activity intervention for children:
       VERB campaign.

     Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and ethical considerations related to the research into the
        effectiveness of health promotion programmes
     • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
     • implications of the findings
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts (that is, health promotion programmes)
     • the productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
     • assumptions and biases
     • areas of uncertainty
     • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
     • alternative theories/explanations
     • comparing and contrasting different health promotion programmes
                                           – 15 –                      8823 – 9301/9303M


Candidates may discuss one health promotion programme in order to demonstrate depth of
knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of health promotion programmes in order to
demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

If a candidate evaluates health promotion programmes in general with no reference to their
effectiveness the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [2] for criterion D. All
remaining criteria should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   Discuss the role of communication in personal relationships.                              [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
      role of communication in personal relationships.

      Communication plays a relevant role at all stages of the development of personal
      relationships (formation, maintenance, and dissolution). Examples of theories and
      models explaining the role of communication in relationships may include, but are not
      limited to: social penetration theory, approaches based on the concept of attributional
      styles and approaches based on the concept of patterns of accommodation. Some
      aspects of similarity attraction theory such as beliefs, values and attitudes are
      conveyed by communication.

      Candidates may address specific types of personal relationships (eg romantic, peer,
      parent–adolescent) or personal relationships in general. Both approaches are
      equally acceptable.

      Examples of studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Fincham’s (2004) study of the role of communication in marital satisfaction
      • Gottman and Levenson’s (1986) study on the role of communication of emotions
        in relationships
      • Burgoon et al.’s (2000) study of the use of mindfulness and interpersonal
        communication
      • Ying et al.’s (2015) study on parent–adolescent communication to build trust
      • Levenson and Gottman’s (1983) study on the relationship between marital
        dissatisfaction and negative affect
      • Tannen's work regarding male/female communication.

      Critical discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations in relation to the role of communication
         in personal relationships
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
      • implications of the findings
      • assumptions and biases in research related to the role of communication in
         personal relationships
      • areas of uncertainty
      • alternative theories/explanations.

      Candidates may discuss a small number of factors that explain the role of
      communication in relationships in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge or may
      consider a larger number of factors in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
      Both approaches are equally acceptable.

11.   Evaluate one or more studies related to prejudice and/or discrimination.                    [22]

      Refer to the Paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
      studies related to prejudice and/or discrimination. Although a discussion of both strengths
      and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      Candidates may evaluate studies that attempt to explain prejudice, discrimination, or both.

      Candidates may evaluate studies focusing on any aspect of prejudice and/or discrimination
      including the origins, development, effects of and/or the effectiveness of efforts to reduce
      prejudice and/or discrimination.

      Relevant studies include, but are not limited to:
      • Nosek, Banaji and Greenwald (2007), on implicit cognition and schema processing in
        relation
        to prejudice
      • Harris and Fiske (2005), on the possible biological factors involved in prejudice and
        discrimination against the outgroup
      • Darley and Gross (1983), on the possible role of social cognition in estimations of
        another person's success
      • Fein and Spencer’s (1997) study on prejudice as self-image maintenance
      • Sherif’s (1961) Robbers Cave study investigating “realistic conflict theory”
      • Tajfel’s (1970) experiments on intergroup discrimination based on the “minimal group
        paradigm”
      • Reynolds and Klik (2016) on new developments in prejudice reduction from its neural
        basis and impact on well-being.

      Evaluation of the selected studies may include but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations
      • cultural and gender considerations
      • contrary findings
      • the applications of the empirical findings
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted
      • implications of the findings.

      If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
      should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

      Candidates may evaluate one study in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may
      evaluate a greater number of studies in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
      approaches are equally acceptable.

      In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, in criterion A we assess to what extent is the
      response focused on the question. Responses that are generic, lack a focus on the specific
      question and seem as pre-prepared essays of relevance to the general topic (but not to
      evaluation of one or more studies) should be awarded [0] for this criterion. If the response
      identifies which studies will be evaluated but there is also extra information that is not
      relevant or necessary for the specific question then [1] should be awarded. Responses that
      are clearly focused on evaluating one or more studies should be awarded [2].

      Marks awarded for criterion B should refer to definitions of terms and concepts. Overall this
      could include some knowledge of topic but more specifically knowledge and understanding
      related to research methods and ethics of chosen studies.
                                            – 18 –                        8823 – 9301/9303M


Marks for criterion B should be awarded as follows:
• 1–2 General knowledge of topic (prejudice and/or discrimination)
• 3–4 Knowledge of general research terms and concepts is provided but lacks detail.
  Some minor errors might be present
• 5–6 Relevant knowledge of specific research methods material is utilized and concepts
  are defined within the context of the specific study.

Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of as study/studies and
assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question - this doesn't
have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
study/studies.

12.   To what extent is the understanding of social responsibility (by-standerism, prosocial
      behaviour) influenced by biological factors?                                                  [22]

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
      biological factors in the understanding of social responsibility.

      It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address cognitive and/or sociocultural factors
      influencing the understanding of social responsibility in order to respond to the command
      term “to what extent”.

      Responses may refer to biological factors and/or theories related to prosocial behaviour
      including, but not limited to:
      • Dawkins’ selfish gene theory
      • Kin selection theory

      Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
      • Dawkins (1976) on evolutionary explanation for social responsibility
      • Hamilton (1964) on Kin Selection theory and social responsibility
      • Simmons et al. (1977) on Kin Selection theory and kidney donation
      • Batson et al. (1981) on limitations of Kin Selection theory
      • Axelrod and Hamilton (1981) on reciprocity and social responsibility
      • Trivers (1971) on reciprocity altruism theory
      • Latané and Darley (1968) on by-stander behaviour
      • Schaller and Cialdini (1988) on negative-state relief model and social responsibility
      • Miller et al. (1990) on culture and social responsibility.

      Responses referring to research with animals are relevant but must be linked to social
      responsibility in humans (altruism, helping behaviour). Responses that do not explicitly
      make any link to human behaviour should be awarded up to a maximum of [3] for
      criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks according to
      the best-fit approach.

      Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological and ethical considerations
      • how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied
      • implications of the findings
      • cultural and gender considerations
      • nature and nurture
      • free will vs. determinism
      • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
      • assumptions and biases
      • areas of uncertainty
      • supporting and/or contradictory evidence
      • comparison and/or contrast of non-biological and biological factors
      • practical applications (ways of promoting prosocial behavior).
