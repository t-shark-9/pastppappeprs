Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

  Marks    Level descriptor
           • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.

              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
           • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and

              relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
           • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   Discuss the role played by missionaries and pilgrims in connecting west and east along the Silk
     Road.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the role of missionaries and pilgrims in
     connecting west and east along the Silk Road. Their role may predate the timeframe or may
     extend beyond it, but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     offer equal coverage of missionaries and pilgrims, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of
     them. However, both will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be
     used. Candidates may discuss the role of Nestorian Christians in spreading the Syriac language
     into central Asia, or the flourishing of Muslim cultural traditions along the Silk Road. There may be
     discussion of the lasting influence of the 7th century Tang Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzeng, whose
     account of his trip to India remained the basis of Chinese knowledge of Central Asia and India until
     being superseded by Ibn Battuta. Pilgrimage centres often served as market towns, and
     missionaries travelled with merchants, offering divine protection and encouraging the formation of
     religious communities. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response
     will remain on the issue raised in the question. and candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

2.   Evaluate the economic and cultural impact of the reign of Tamerlane (Timur) on the Silk Road.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic and cultural impact of the reign of Tamerlane
     (Timur) on the Silk Road, weighing up its importance or otherwise. Impact may extend beyond the
     timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of economic and cultural impact, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of
     them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or
     may not be used. Candidates may evaluate campaigns, such as those against the Mongols and
     the Golden Horde, which Timur fought to protect the Silk Road, which resulted a vibrant trade with,
     for example, India and China and through Transoxiana. Consequently, there was a great deal of
     cultural transmission between China, the Middle East and Persia, and the sufficient wealth to fund
     the spectacular beautification of Samarkand. However, many cities were flattened in the process of
     conquest, and Timur’s establishment of his Pax Mongolica proved short-lived. Both importance and
     limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While
     other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
     in the question.
                                                 –5–                                    8823 – 5308M


Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   “Replacing court government was the most important development in the expanding role of the
     samurai.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that replacing court
     government was the most important development in the expanding role of the samurai. Candidates
     may refer to the ways Minamoto’s power depended on the samurai so he protected and built up
     their influence. In the area of law and politics the samurai exercised real power locally and the
     samurai filled important regional posts as constables or military governors and land stewards.
     Gradually the samurai took the lead in developing the law of the nation. Candidates may challenge
     the assumption in the question and argue that other factors were equally/more important. It could
     be argued that their military role was more important as the samurai were an essential component
     of Japanese armies in the medieval period. Candidates may also consider the spiritual and cultural
     role of the samurai to be of more importance. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
     the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

4.   To what extent were the Mongol invasions the most serious challenge facing the Kamakura
     Shogunate?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the Mongol invasions were
     the most serious challenge facing the Kamakura Shogunate. Candidates may refer to the Mongol
     attacks in 1274 and 1281 which initially highlighted Japanese military weaknesses. Japan was
     forced to adapt and increase their military to respond to these invasions. The Japanese developed
     new tactics and weaponry and also constructed large forts and defensive walls. Candidates may
     argue that it was only the kamikaze storms that saved Japan from two Mongol fleets. The ‘divine
     wind’ led to the sinking and destruction of the entire Mongol Fleet. Candidates may argue that the
     Kamakura Shogunate also faced internal threats. There were several revolts which the bakufu
     often found difficult to suppress, partly because of the remoteness of the uprisings. There were
     also clashes between samurai clans. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                  –6–                                     8823 – 5308M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   To what extent were the voyages of Zheng He (Cheng Ho) successful?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the voyages of Zheng He
     (Cheng Ho) were successful. Candidates may refer to the scale and impact of these seven
     voyages. On board the ships were soldiers, diplomatic specialists, medical personnel,
     astronomers, and scholars of foreign culture, especially Islam. Candidates may discuss how these
     voyages built strong diplomatic ties. Foreigners were impressed with the apparent wealth of China
     and tributary relationships were formed. There were strong trading links established as Chinese
     merchants set up trading centres in areas visited during the voyages and Zheng also removed
     much of the threat from piracy in the region. There was also the acquisition of extensive scientific
     and geographical knowledge. Candidates may argue that there were also failings regarding the
     voyages including the outbreak of conflict in several places including Sri Lanka and Sumatra. The
     main criticism of the voyages was their cost. To maintain a fleet of over 3,500 ships meant money
     was taken from other areas - notably their defence of the north against the Mongols. Candidates
     may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

6.   To what extent did the policy of “turning in” benefit Japan?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the policy of ‘turning in’
     benefited Japan. Candidates may refer to how the shogunate enforced the sakoku policy in order
     to protect Japan from colonial or religious influences. Despite a policy of isolation, trade did
     continue with the Dutch, Koreans and Chinese and the shogunate ensured that trade did not suffer
     too much during this period. As a result of this policy Japan was also able to protect its own
     resources, such as silver and copper, from being exploited by the colonial powers. Through Dutch
     Learning, the Japanese were able to keep abreast of western developments in technology and
     medicine. However, candidates may argue that Japan’s economic development was limited by
     numerous trade restrictions such as trade being restricted to four gateways within Japan.
     Candidates may also discuss other benefits of ‘turning in’ including the preservation of Japanese
     culture and a long period of peace. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
     suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                  –7–                                     8823 – 5308M


Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   “Akbar’s greatest achievements were in religious and cultural policy.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Akbar’s greatest
     achievements were in religious and cultural policy. Achievements may extend beyond the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of religious and cultural policy, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of
     them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or
     may not be used. Candidates may discuss the impact of Akbar’s increasingly tolerant religious
     polices, fostering inter-faith debate and harmonious relations with Hindus, but at the cost of some
     Muslim rebellion. There may be discussion of his cultural policies: the combination of Hindu and
     Muslim architecture at Fatehpur Sikri, the promotion of western artistic techniques to create a
     distinctive Mughal painting style and his commissioning of the Book of Akbar. His legacy was,
     however, adversely affected by the succession of his incompetent sons. While other, relevant,
     factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

8.   “Internal forces were more important than external forces to the decline of the Mughal Empire.”
     Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that internal forces were
     more important than external forces to the decline of the Mughal Empire. Causes of decline may
     predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of internal and external forces, or they may prioritize their
     discussion of either of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A
     comparative approach should be used. Candidates may discuss weak successors who failed to
     tackle intrigue, faction and revolt; they may discuss the consequences of Aurangzeb’s reversal of
     Akbar’s religiously tolerant policies, financial collapse, and the corruption of the mansabdar system
     which, coupled with commanders’ mutual suspicion and pusillanimity, corrupted the military.
     External threats came from the increasingly dominant Marathas, the Iranian leader Nadir Shah,
     and the British. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
     remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
     the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                                      8823 – 5308M


Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Evaluate the economic, social, and cultural effects of the French colonial system in Indo-China by
      1914.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic, social, and cultural effects of French colonial
      rule in Indo-China by 1914, weighing up their importance or otherwise. Consequence/results (etc)
      may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic, social, and cultural effects, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of one or two of them. However, all three aspects will be a feature of
      the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may evaluate the
      effects of French fiscal policies, such as fees for industrial licenses and monopolies and taxation
      paid only by the Indo-Chinese. Land distribution which favoured the Catholic church, and Chinese
      participation in the rice trade, caused suffering among local share-croppers. The effects of the
      education policies on an emergent middle class, the popularisation of Romanised script, and the
      social impact of economic policies, such as high taxation, the monetization of the rural economy
      and the enforcement of monopolies, at the expense of rural autonomy, may be evaluated. Both
      importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus
      on each. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.

10.   Discuss the significance of Rizal and Bonifacio to the development of nationalism in the
      Philippines.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the significance of Rizal and Bonifacio
      to the development of nationalism in the Philippines. Significance may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the two men, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
      both will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may discuss Rizal’s journalism and novels, such as ‘Touch me Not’, which highlighted
      the injustices suffered at the hands of the Spaniards and Catholic friars. His further promotion of
      moderate social reform (despite his disavowal of violence) led to his trial, execution and martyr
      status. Bonifacio was an associate of Rizal, but founded the armed movement Katipunan. Also a
      journalist, he led the call for revolution and became a military commander, but was eventually
      embroiled in a factional dispute which also led to his trial and execution, this time at the hand of
      Aguinaldo. Rizal was essentially a peaceful reformist. Bonifacio was a passionate warrior and
      revolutionary. Candidates may argue that it should be Bonifacio who should be regarded as more
      significant because Rizal was all theories and no action. However, it could also be argued that it
      was Rizal who inspired Bonifacio. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. and candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                                       8823 – 5308M


Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   Evaluate the significance of the Battle of Plassey (1757) to the expansion of the British East India
      Company.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of the Battle of Plassey (1757) to the
      expansion of the British East India Company weighing up its importance or otherwise. Factors
      affecting significance may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may refer to the struggles of the East India Company with Siraj-ud-
      Daulah to establish its presence in Bengal before 1759, and evaluate the impact of Plassey in
      smashing his power and installing a puppet ruler. Evaluation may focus on the need for further
      victories, over the French and Dutch, before Clive was secure as Governor. Only then could the
      Company, having secured imperial tax revenues and military supremacy, embark on the formation
      of a huge civil and military administration which was the basis for future expansion. Candidates
      may also evaluate the importance of other wars, such as the Anglo-Maratha and Anglo-Mysore
      Wars. Both significance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal number of/focus on each. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

12.   Discuss the reasons for, and consequences of, the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839–42).

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and consequences of,
      the First Anglo-Afghan War (1839-1842). Causes may predate the timeframe and consequences
      may extend beyond the timeframe but both must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons and consequences, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of either of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to exaggerated British fears of the expansion of Russian influence
      into Afghanistan, and an Islamic alliance of the Persians with the Afghan ruler, Dost Mohammed,
      which would have threatened northern India. There may be discussion of the role of an over-
      confident Indian Governor-General, Lord Auckland, who seemed determined to counter threats by
      force, even though the Persian threat had evaporated. The immediate results of war were an initial
      British victory followed by humiliating defeat and bloody retribution. Although Dost Mohammed was
      restored, stability proved temporary as the British invaded again in 1878. The Russian threat never
      materialised. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   “Qianlong’s rule greatly weakened the Qing dynasty.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Qianlong’s rule greatly
      weakened the Qing dynasty. Consequences of his rule may extend beyond the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to early military
      triumphs at the expense of neighbouring states, and the formation of the “New Territory” of
      Xinjiang. They may consider the impressive cultural flowering, especially of the visual arts, and the
      compilation of the vast Complete Library of the Four Treasures. However, there may also be
      consideration of censorship and book destruction during Qianlong’s rule, the increasing paralysis
      of a cumbersome bureaucracy and the corruption of the youthful favourite Heshen, coupled with
      widespread abuse of the tax system. Serious revolts, such as the White Lotus Rebellion,
      characterised Qianlong’s later years; although they were defeated, dissatisfaction with the
      government had become endemic. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.


14.   “Political tensions during the Bakumatsu period (1853–1868) were the main reason for the fall of
      the Tokugawa Shogunate.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that political tensions
      during the Bakumatsu period (1853-1868) were the most important reason for the fall of the
      Tokugawa Shogunate. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss the tensions relating to the confused
      succession and ensuing power struggle after the crisis induced by Commodore Perry. They may
      discuss the complexities of balancing the bakufu, daimyo and samurai, and the emergence of anti-
      western domains such as the Mito. There may be discussion of tensions resulting from
      inconsistent, weak leadership; following the forthright tactics of Ii Naosuke, who purged his
      enemies and imprisoned Togukawa Nariaki, and Ii’s subsequent assassination, more moderate
      policies followed. The threat from the Choshu could have been stamped out in 1864. However, in
      alliance with the Satsuma, they defeated the bakufu forces. While other, relevant, factors may be
      referred to, most notably the western threat, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   Discuss the political and economic reasons for the emergence of a labour movement in Australia.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the political and economic reasons for
      the emergence of a labour movement in Australia weighing up their importance. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of political and economic reasons or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one. However, all aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to political
      influences such as the arrival of British Chartists, French Socialists and Irish Republicans to the
      goldfields in the 1850s and the development of a ‘digger’ philosophy. The ‘diggers’ aspired to be an
      equal society where there would be no masters and servants. Candidates may discuss how the
      miners revolted against the Miner’s License and after a series of meetings and revolts managed to
      get the license system abolished. Trade Halls Councils were established throughout Australia and
      the miners played a key role in the development of these. Candidates may also discuss the impact
      of immigration on the emergence of a labour movement. In the 1870s and 1880s the miners began
      protesting against the arrival of Asian labourers who worked for lower wages and poorer working
      conditions. Their protests led to restrictions being placed on immigration which demonstrated their
      growing influence with the authorities. Candidates may discuss how at the start of the 20th Century
      the labour movement looked to become more unified and the 1912 General Strike in Brisbane
      demonstrated this. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

16.   Evaluate the significance of Gallipoli to the growth of national identity in either Australia or New
      Zealand.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of Gallipoli on the growth of national identity
      in either Australia or New Zealand weighing up its importance. Candidates may refer to the legend
      of the ANZAC spirit at Gallipoli. Although there was no military victory, the ANZACs displayed
      endurance, initiative and ‘mateship’ and these qualities came to be seen as the ANZAC spirit.
      Candidates may argue that the significance of the Gallipoli spirit was exaggerated for the political
      purpose of creating a national identity. Candidates may discuss the wider context of the First World
      War as a reason for the growth of national identity. At this time Australian and New Zealand foreign
      policy was determined by the British Crown. The casualty rates for ANZAC soldiers were high –
      60,000 Australians and 16,000 New Zealanders were killed leading many to question the reasons
      for their involvement in this conflict. Candidates may discuss factors prior to the First World War
      that helped to create national identity. These could include the development of the Federation
      Movement in Australia and the establishment of Dominion status in Australia (1901) and New
      Zealand (1907). Dominion status essentially gave both nations sovereignty regarding domestic
      affairs but as the First World War demonstrated foreign/defence policy was still under British
      control. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal focus on each.

Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   “The desire for reform was the most important cause of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the desire for reform was the
      most important cause of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. Causes may predate the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may consider increasing
      Chinese awareness of western political developments and reform in Japan, which increased desire
      for reform. Sun Yixian, the most influential leader in 1911, had been influenced by efficient colonial
      administration of Hong Kong, and democracy and a modern legal system in Hawaii, in drawing up
      the reformist Three Principles of the People. Limited reform of education and the military had only
      heightened awareness of the need for change among the educated elite. Candidates may
      consider, however, that reforms already carried out had been unpopular, as they had led to high
      levels of taxation, and that the trigger for revolution had been uneven levels of compensation for
      railway nationalization. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

18.   To what extent was Korea modernised under Queen Min’s leadership?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Korea was modernised
      under Queen Min’s leadership. Consideration of the impact of Queen Min’s leadership may extend
      beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may consider the modernizing administrative reforms, resulting in new foreign, commercial and
      defence ministries, modernization of military weaponry and methods, and the ensuing conservative
      insurrection. There may be consideration of educational reform, where change was of limited
      impact and duration. Under US guidance the army (but not the navy) was brought up to regional
      standards, while the economy was significantly modernized by the emergence of the first
      commercial companies, new international telegraph lines, the import of steam engines and new
      agricultural techniques. Modern manufacturing was yet to commence, however. The modernizing
      influence of missionaries, especially in relation to human rights and the role of women, may also be
      considered. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound
      argument.
                                                  – 13 –                                    8823 – 5308M


Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   To what extent were Gandhi’s aims for the Indian independence movement achieved by 1947?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Gandhi’s aims for the Indian
      Independence movement were achieved by 1947. There may be consideration of Gandhi’s
      achievement in making the independence struggle a genuinely mass movement shortly after 1919.
      His initially successful advocacy of satyagraha, as seen in the Salt March, forced the British to take
      notice of Indian resentment following their treatment after World War One. However, such tactics
      brought only limited reward as progress was very slow despite, or because of, the Round Table
      Conferences, the Simon Commission and the Government of India Act. Gandhi appeared
      powerless to prevent the emergence of the Two-State solution espoused by Jinnah, and the
      response to Gandhi’s Quit India Movement, which was opposed by the Muslim League and Hindu
      nationalists, was disappointing. The violence of war-time and that which accompanied Indian
      independence was in sharp contradiction to Gandhi’s aims. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

20.   Evaluate the reasons for religious conflict in post-independence India.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for religious conflict in post-independence India,
      weighing up their importance or otherwise. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. For example, candidates may refer to long-term
      factors such as the British ‘divide and rule’ policies after 1857, and factors which pre-dated
      partition, such as the increase in Muslim separatism, and the role of leaders of the Muslim League
      and Bengal. Candidates may appraise the role of the British, who left India in a manner guaranteed
      to escalate religious conflict. The boundary settlement could not neatly follow patterns of Hindu and
      Muslim settlement, and there were no effective preparations to counter the inevitable tensions
      which were to accompany partition which was carried out ahead of schedule. There may be
      evaluation of the impact of mass migration, for example of Hindus from Punjab into Delhi, which
      forced many Muslims to be displaced. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated
      but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                  – 14 –                                  8823 – 5308M


Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Evaluate the impact of the Paris peace conference (1919) and the Washington Naval Conference
      (1921–1922) on Japan.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Paris peace conference and the
      Washington Naval Conference on Japan, weighing up their importance. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of the Paris Peace Conference and Washington Naval Conferences or they may
      prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both conferences will be a feature of the response. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the fact that Japan was
      one of the ‘Big Five’ at Versailles and would also become a permanent member of the council both
      of which suggested Japan was becoming a recognised world power. However, when Japan
      proposed the Racial Equality Clause this was rejected which led many in Japan to resent western
      attitudes towards them. Japan was invited to attend the Washington Conferences with the US and
      UK and a shipbuilding ratio of 5:5:3 was agreed upon. Candidates may argue that Japan’s
      involvement in the conference is evidence of their growing status but that the restrictions on their
      shipbuilding compared to the UK and US was an insult to Japan. Candidates may argue that these
      conferences demonstrate the conflict that was growing within Japan between the ultra-
      nationalists/militarists with those that wanted Japan to pursue democracy

22.   “The US occupation (1945–1952) transformed Japanese society.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the US occupation
      transformed Japan’s society. Candidates may refer to how the emperor lost his ‘god-like’ status
      and Shintoism was banned, although it could be argued that in reality Emperor Hirohito was still
      revered by the Japanese people. Japan’s new constitution led to significant changes in how society
      was governed and structured. For example, women gained equality and could vote but in reality,
      little changed for the majority of women. Candidates may argue that US occupation led to a fairer
      distribution of Japan’s wealth due to land reform and the removal of the zaibatsu. However, many
      of these developments were undone with the Reverse Course after 1950. Candidates may discuss
      the Americanisation of Japanese society. Education was based on the US system and many
      aspects of Japanese culture (sport, film, music) were influenced by the presence of US troops.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   “The May Fourth Movement was the main reason for the rise of national identity in China between
      1910 and 1924.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the May Fourth Movement
      was the most important factor in the rise of national identity in China between 1910 and 1924.
      Candidates may refer to the significance of the May Fourth Movement. The movement had been
      inspired by the ideas developed during the New Culture Movement, but it was the reaction to the
      Versailles Treaty that led to mass support for large demonstrations and boycotts. The Chinese
      people were infuriated by the loss of the province of Shandong to Japan, and Versailles showed
      how vulnerable they were as a nation. Candidates may argue that events prior to May Fourth were
      as important in the rise of national identity. Sun Yat-sen and his 3 Principles promoted nationalism
      and a republic was established following the 1911 Revolution. It could be argued that Yuan
      Shikai’s leadership betrayed the aims of the revolution as he closed the national assembly and
      ceded control of areas of China to Japan by agreeing to the 21 Demands. Following Yuan’s death,
      China experienced a warlord era and candidates may argue that the desire to end warlordism was
      a key factor in the rise of nationalism. By 1924 the CCP and GMD formed the First United Front to
      fight the warlords and unify China. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence and sound argument.

24.   To what extent did economic and political factors lead to the defeat of the nationalists
      (Guomindang) in the Chinese Civil War (1946–1949)?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that economic and political
      factors led to the defeat of the Nationalists (Guomindang) in the Chinese Civil War. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of economic and political factors, or they may prioritize their assessment
      of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      Guomindang’s (GMD) poor management of the economy which led to high inflation. The GMD also
      misappropriated loans/aid from the US so this financial support failed to give the GMD any
      advantage over the CCP. Politically, the GMD lacked appeal amongst the Chinese peasantry.
      During the Nanjing Decade, the GMD had done little to address the long-term suffering of the
      peasants so most supported the CCP. The GMD forces had taken the brunt of the fighting in the
      Sino-Japanese War and experienced heavy losses. This resulted in low morale amongst the GMD
      army with many of their soldiers deserting to join the CCP. Candidates may argue that the
      strengths of the CCP led to the defeat of the Nationalists. The CCP leadership, propaganda,
      military tactics and support from the peasantry may be addressed. Candidates may agree, partly
      agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Section 13: Impact of the Second World War on South-East Asia

25.   “The weakness of the colonial powers led to Japan’s initial victories in South-East Asia (1940–
      1942).” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Japan’s initial
      victories in South-East Asia (1940-42) were the result of the weakness of the colonial powers.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to British pre-occupation with the European theatre which meant
      that they devoted insufficient resources to South-East Asia; they were also over-confident of the
      security of Singapore, which was inadequately defended. The Dutch and French had been over-
      run by the Nazis, and therefore failed to defend their colonies. The role of the Vichy regimes in
      French colonies may be discussed. While other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. There may be discussion, for
      example, of Japan’s lead in naval aviation, the meticulous planning of operations in Indo-China and
      Malaya, and the enlarged agricultural and industrial base which was established by control over
      Taiwan, Korea and Manchuria. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement,
      but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

26.   Discuss the role of resistance and collaboration in the Dutch East Indies/Indonesia during the
      Second World War.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the role of resistance and collaboration
      in the Dutch East Indies/Indonesia during the Second World War. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of resistance and collaboration, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may refer to the Islamic Acehnese revolt which was defeated in November
      1942, the failed attempt to establish an Islamic state in South Kalimantan in 1943, the Pontianak
      Incidents of 1943-44 which incited brutal retribution, and the underground, Dutch-sponsored
      Marxist resistance of Amir Sjarifuddin, who was arrested in 1943. There may be consideration of
      the collaboration of Sukarno after Japanese expansion halted and the Japanese policy of favouring
      Indonesian independence. During 1943 and 1944 volunteer forces were formed to protect
      Indonesia against invasion by anti-Japanese forces and to mobilise in favour of Japanese
      interests. Together with Hatta, Sukarno and the Japanese collaborated in forming a Committee for
      Preparatory Work for Independence which prepared a draft constitution, which paved the way for
      independence after the war ended. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Evaluate the economic and political impact of the Great Leap Forward on China by 1966.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic and political impact of the Great Leap Forward.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and political impact, or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer
      to the objective of the Great Leap as being the rapid development of China’s agricultural and
      industrial sectors. There was to be a focus on steel production and large-scale projects. The
      creation of these State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) brought industry under government control.
      Workers were to be provided with food, accommodation, health and medical benefits. However,
      these millions of new state workers put huge pressure on the government. Projects such as the
      Backyard Steel Campaign, may have increased the revolutionary spirit, but much of the steel was
      of such poor quality it was useless. Despite numerous disasters there was an increase in
      manufacturing production in some areas, such as tractor production. Candidates may also discuss
      the economic and political impact of collectivisation. The creation of large communes, some with
      up to 5,000 households in them, brought farms and peasants under closer government control.
      The pressure to increase grain yields to unrealistic levels led to officials failing to report low yields
      and famine and the deaths of millions of Chinese. Candidates may discuss the political significance
      of the Lushan Conference which led to Mao standing down as Chairman of the Party. Candidates
      may argue that the emergence of Deng and Liu saw China experience a period of political and
      economic stability. The launch of the Cultural Revolution by Mao to regain control of the party may
      be considered by candidates as a longer-term political impact.

28.   Examine the reasons for changes in Sino-American relations between 1949 and 1976.

      Candidates will examine the reasons for changes in Sino-American relations between 1949 and
      1976. Candidates may argue that during the first years of the Peoples Republic of China, relations
      with the US reached a low point. Candidates may refer to the legacy of the Chinese Civil War
      during which the US gave billions of dollars in loans/equipment to the Guomindang and then
      recognised Taiwan as the Republic of China. Tensions over Taiwan would remain an issue
      throughout this period with China criticising US military presence in the Taiwan Strait. In 1949
      China invaded Tibet resulting in the deaths of thousands which led to US condemnation of China’s
      actions. During the Korean War, 3 million Chinese volunteers served in Korea and successfully
      pushed UN/US forces back across the 38th Parallel. This conflict would see Chinese and US
      soldiers fight each other directly. Candidates may argue that relations between the two nations
      remained volatile throughout the 1950s. Candidates may argue that the 1970s saw a change in
      relations as Ping Pong Diplomacy led to the establishment of diplomatic ties between both
      countries. In 1972 Nixon visited China and signed the Shanghai Communiqué which stated that
      both countries would work towards normalising their relations. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Evaluate the economic and political impact of the Korean War on the Korean peninsula.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the economic and political impact of the Korean War on the
      Korean Peninsula. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and political impact, or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to the devastation caused by the conflict. Nearly 3 million people were killed,
      virtually all of Korea’s major cities were destroyed and Korea’s agriculture and industry was
      decimated. Both North and South Korea would rely on aid for their economic recovery. North Korea
      received industrial machinery from the USSR and China and the US provided essential food and
      medical provisions to South Korea. Although this aid did stabilise South Korea’s economy,
      candidates may argue that it left South Korea totally dependent on the US. Politically, the war left
      the Korean Peninsula divided at the 38th Parallel. Attempts to negotiate a peace treaty failed, so
      an uneasy truce continued to exist between the two nations. South Korea remained a close ally of
      the US and there remained a heavy US military presence of approximately 30,000 troops.
      Candidates may discuss how China and North Korea signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation
      and Mutual Assistance in 1961. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

30.   “The failures of Sihanouk’s rule were the main reason for the rise of the Khmer Rouge.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the failures of Sihanouk’s
      rule were the main reason for the rise of the Khmer Rouge. Candidates may refer to Sihanouk’s
      relations with foreign nations. From 1955 he accepted US aid and agreed to put Cambodia under
      the protection of SEATO but a year later he signed a Friendship Treaty with China. Sihanouk
      became increasingly suspicious of US interests in Cambodia and began to sympathise with
      Communist groups. In 1964 Sihanouk signed a secret deal with North Vietnam allowing them to
      create a supply route (Sihanouk Trail) through Cambodia. Three years later his allegiances
      switched as he grew increasingly infuriated by the Chinese Cambodians who appeared to be
      instigating revolution. As a result, he adopted a policy of rapprochement towards the US and
      suggested he could accept US military presence in Cambodia to pursue the Viet Cong. Sihanouk
      was out of the country when Lon Nol seized power. Sihanouk gained support from the North
      Vietnamese and Chinese to re-establish himself as leader. Sihanouk was popular in the towns and
      his open support for the Khmer Rouge strengthened their position. Candidates may argue that
      Sihanouk’s changing relations with the US, China and North Vietnam brought Cambodia into the
      Vietnam War which in turn led to support for the Khmer Rouge. Candidates may also challenge the
      assumption in the question and discuss other reasons for the rise of the Khmer Rouge which may
      include long term peasant poverty, Khmer Rouge ideology and US bombing of Cambodian cities.

      Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947.

31.   “Political tensions were the main reason behind Bangladeshi independence in 1971.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that political tensions
      were the most important reason for the demand for an independent Bangladesh. Reasons may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may discuss the dominance of West Pakistani leaders such as Ayub Khan when the
      East was more populous. There may be discussion of the aftermath of the 1970 elections when
      Western politicians, led by Bhutto, manoeuvred to prevent the victorious Awami League’s Mujibur
      Rahman taking office. The botched response to the Bhola cyclone, which devastated Bengal,
      heightened the crisis; Operation Searchlight, which stamped down hard on protest, was the last
      straw. Other issues, such as the Bengali hostility to Urdu as the official language and their
      preference for a secular state, economic disparities, and Western domination of the military may be
      discussed. While these other, relevant, factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement, but their opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

32.   To what extent was Indira Gandhi successful in responding to social and economic challenges in
      India?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Indira Gandhi was
      successful in responding to social and economic challenges. Results may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of social and economic challenges, or they may prioritize their assessment of
      either of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may consider Gandhi’s “Green Revolution” and the extent to
      which India became self-sufficient in food, the impact of successive five-year plans, which
      addressed the challenge of economic growth, and the successful response to the challenge of
      inflation. Nationalisation of banks made banking facilities and loans to small businesses more
      widely available. The challenge presented by the impoverished agricultural sector was addressed
      by land distribution, whose results may be assessed. The first National Policy on Education aimed
      to establish compulsory education to 14 and to promote the Hindu and English alongside regional
      languages. Gandhi’s limited response to the challenge of women’s rights may also be considered.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   Evaluate the impact of immigration on either Australia or New Zealand between 1945 and 2005.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of immigration on either Australia or New Zealand
      between 1945 and 2005. Candidates may refer to the significance of the ending of the Immigration
      Restriction Act (1973) in Australia which effectively ended the ‘White Australia’ policy. Events such
      as the Vietnam War, Cambodia Genocide and the Tiananmen Square protests led to a significant
      increase in Asians migrating to Australia throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s the
      Australian government adopted a more hard-line approach to immigration. The increase in skilled
      labour helped Australian businesses to overcome labour shortages. Asian immigrants in Australia
      also helped to build close business ties with Asia. The Galbally Report (1978) helped to address
      issues relating to immigration and multi-culturalism by providing more support to immigrants.
      Candidates may choose to discuss the impact on New Zealand. In the years following the Second
      World War, immigration schemes sought to attract British and Dutch immigrants. By the 1970s,
      New Zealand relaxed its restrictive policies to attract migrants from Asia and by 2003 nearly 7% of
      the population identified as being of Asian ethnicity. In 1971, the Office of the Race Relations
      Conciliator was established with the aim of promoting positive race relations and addressing
      complaints of discrimination. Candidates may argue that the culture of both New Zealand and
      Australia have been shaped by multi-ethnic migration, including business, the arts, cuisine, sense
      of humour and sport. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal number of/focus on each.

34.   Discuss the reasons for, and results of, the emergence of independent Pacific Island states.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and results of, the
      emergence of independent Pacific Island States. Candidates may focus on one Pacific Island State
      in depth or offer a broader assessment of two or more states. Either of these approaches is valid.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the reasons and results, or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to how most of the Pacific Islands had
      achieved some level of independence by 1980, although some nations chose to maintain ties with
      larger nations. Candidates may argue that it was largely external factors that led to independence
      as the nature of the island societies meant that mass nationalist movements did not exist. Pressure
      and support from the United Nations was a key factor in these nations gaining independence. Most
      of the colonial powers were supportive of self-government or independence although there was
      some resistance from the French government. Candidates may discuss how one of the results was
      the difficulties in establishing effective governments in the newly formed independent states. These
      newly emerged countries often felt pressured to allowing more powerful nations to gain influence
      over them. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
            India) (1980–2005)

35.   To what extent has globalization had a positive impact on economic growth? Discuss with
      reference to two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that globalization had a positive
      impact on economic growth. Candidates may offer equal coverage of their chosen countries, or
      they may prioritize their assessment of one. However, both countries will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to how
      globalisation has increased the international exchange of goods, technological developments and
      information. Globalisation has decreased the cost of manufacturing which means goods can be
      offered at a lower price. Consumer benefit from these lower prices and they also have access to a
      wider variety of goods. It could be argued that an economic benefit of globalisation is that
      companies have moved to low-cost locations which has increased economic opportunities in low-
      income nations. Candidates may argue that globalisation has had a negative impact on economic
      growth. Workers in the developing world face exploitation by companies as they are not protected
      by the same rights/laws as those in high income countries. Workers in the developed world must
      compete with lower-cost markets for jobs and this can lead to unemployment. Candidates may
      agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.

36.   To what extent has religion been a cause of conflict in society up to 2005? Discuss with reference
      to two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India).

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that religion has been a
      cause of conflict in society up to 2005. Candidates may offer equal coverage of their
      chosen countries, or they may prioritize their assessment of one. However, both countries
      will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to tensions between Chinese communities and the authorities in
      Malaysia, as they did not want to become part of a Muslim state. The Free Aceh
      Movement emerged in the 1970s and led to armed conflict and a death toll of
      approximately 12,000 by the 1990s. Religious violence broke out in Indonesia in 1998 with
      violence between Muslims and Protestant Christians. Five thousand were killed and
      hundreds of thousands displaced. Violence flared in the majority Muslim provinces of
      southern Thailand between 2001 and 2004, due in part to government soldiers and the
      police’s harsh treatment of Muslim militant protesters. Candidates may also discuss
      religious tensions between Muslims and Buddhists in Myanmar. Candidates may choose
      to discuss whether religion was really the cause of the conflict identified. Candidates may
      agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
