1.     (a)   Explain the difference between price elasticity of demand and income elasticity of
             demand.                                                                                   [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: price elasticity of demand (PED), income elasticity of demand (YED).
             • Explanation: that price elasticity of demand measures the relationship between a
               change in the price of a good and a change in quantity demand and can be
               measured by % change in QD / % change in price. The PED value of goods and
               services means they can be elastic, unitary or inelastic. Explanation that income
               elasticity of demand measures the relationship between a change in income and
               demand and can be measured by % change in QD / % change in income. The YED
               value of goods means they are normal, luxury, necessity or inferior.
             • Diagram: demand and supply diagram and/or Engel’s curve to show goods and
               services with different PEDs or YEDs.

             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only PED or YED in the question item is
             addressed.

(b)   Using a real-world example, evaluate the view that an understanding of price elasticity
      of demand can be useful for firms trying to increase total revenue.                        [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: total revenue, price elasticity of demand.
      • Explanation: of how the increase in the price of a good which is price inelastic leads
        to an increase in total revenue because the price of a good increases by
        proportionately more than the decrease in quantity demanded. An explanation of
        how the decrease in the price of a good which is price elastic leads to an increase in
        total revenue because the price of a good decreases by proportionately less than
        the increase in quantity demanded.
      • Diagram: a demand and supply diagram to show the impact on total revenue of an
        increase or decrease in the price of a good which has price inelastic or elastic
        demand.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): might include consideration of situations where an increase in
        the price of a good with price elastic demand or decrease in the price of a good with
        price inelastic demand leads to an increase in total revenue. For example, when the
        demand for a good is affected by the changing price of complements or substitutes.
        An evaluation might also include the difficulty of measuring PED and the way PED
        increases in the long run.
      • Examples: real-world examples of where PED has been used by firms to increase in
        total revenue.

2.     (a)   Explain how an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in interest rates might
             affect macroeconomic equilibrium in the short run in an economy.                       [10]

             Answers may include:
             • Terminology: consumer confidence, interest rates, macroeconomic equilibrium in the
               short run.
             • Explanation: that an increase in consumer confidence will lead to an increase in
               consumption and cause an increase in aggregate demand and the macroeconomic
               equilibrium will lead to higher price level and real GDP and an increase in interest
               rates will lead to a decrease in consumption and investment which decreases
               aggregate demand and cause the macroeconomic equilibrium to lead to a lower
               price level and real GDP.
             • Diagram: AD/AS diagrams showing the effect of an increase in consumer
               confidence and an increase in interest rates on macroeconomic equilibrium in the
               short run.
             A maximum of [6] should be awarded if only consumer confidence or interest rates in
             the question item is addressed.

      Answers may include:
      • Terminology: economic growth, economic well-being.
      • Explanation: that economic growth leads to a rise in economic well-being as
        household incomes rise, unemployment decreases, investment increases and more
        tax revenue is generated to improve public services.
      • Diagram: AD/AS diagram or PPC diagram to show economic growth.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): might include consideration of the negative impact economic
        growth can have on economic well-being such as environmental costs, inflation and
        the widening in income inequality. Evaluation might also include a discussion of
        other factors that contribute to economic well-being that do not arise from economic
        growth such as leisure time, political stability and crime.
      • Examples: real-world examples of where economic growth does or does not lead to
        a rise in economic well-being.

             • Terminology: trade protection, government revenue, employment.
             • Explanation: that the imposition of tariffs as trade protection can increase

      • Terminology: trade protection, imported goods.

           • Economic terms are stated but they are not relevant.
           • The response contains no evidence of synthesis or evaluation.
           • A real-world example(s) is identified but it is irrelevant.

   4–6     • The response indicates some understanding of the specific demands of the question.
           • Relevant economic theory is described.
           • Some relevant economic terms are included.
           • The response contains evidence of superficial synthesis or evaluation.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified.

   7–9     • The response indicates understanding of the specific demands of the question,
             but these demands are only partially addressed.
           • Relevant economic theory is partly explained.
           • Some relevant economic terms are used appropriately.
           • Where appropriate, relevant diagram(s) are included.
           • The response contains evidence of appropriate synthesis or evaluation but
             lacks balance.
           • A relevant real-world example(s) is identified and partly developed in the context of
