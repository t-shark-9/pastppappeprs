Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3
             Basic grammatical structures are used.
             Language contains errors in basic structures. Errors interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task.
             Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
    4–6
             complex structures.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    7–9      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
  10–12
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type, appropriateness
of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

 You have recently joined a fitness centre and are very satisfied with the facilities and the
 instruction. You want to recommend it to teenagers living in your city. Write a text in which you
 present the fitness centre and explain why you recommend it.

 Article                            Email                           Review


Criterion B:

• The response should focus principally and clearly on one fitness center to be recommended for
  its satisfactory services.
• Two aspects are required in the question: “present the fitness center” and “explain why you
  recommend it”. There does not need to be equal space devoted to each of the two, but neither
  should be left minimal (in a single sentence) or completely ignored; otherwise, no more than the
  4-6 band should be awarded since the task has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• “Present the fitness centre” aspect may include: location, facilities available, cost,
  lessons/sessions offered, etc. “Why you recommend it” might include reference to friendliness of
  staff, professional instructors, general hygiene, frequent offers, etc.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:

Generally appropriate       Article          The text type is suitable for sharing information with a
                                             mass audience, but it is not necessarily used to share
                                             personal reactions. The choice may be considered
                                             appropriate if it clearly addresses a teenage audience
                                             living in your city with a clear expression of personal
                                             reactions.

                                             individual or a small group. It is not usually used to
                                             communicate with a mass audience.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register
• Persuasive tone.

Task 2

 You have seen a video about a new robot dog that you think could improve some people’s lives.
 You want to share your thoughts about this robot with others who share your interest in
 technology. Write a text in which you describe the robot dog and explain how it might be used to
 help people.

 Article                            Blog                            Flyer


Criterion B:

• Clearly refers to the video seen to trigger the response if the blog is chosen.
• Two aspects are required in the question: “describe the robot dog” and “explain how it might be
  used to help people”. There does not need to be equal space devoted to each of the two, but
  neither should be left minimal (in a single sentence) or completely ignored; otherwise, no more
  than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• Some scripts might extensively explain the disadvantages of robot dogs. This should be marked
  down under 'relevance'.

Generally appropriate       Article          The text type is suitable for sharing information, but it
                                             is not typically used to communicate a personal view.
                                             The choice may be considered “appropriate” if it
                                             approaches the topic in a less personalized way and
                                             clearly indicates the audience is “people interested in

                                             to provide personal views to a targeted audience
                                             (‘others who share your interests’).

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal register (with probably few flashes of formality)
• Enthusiastic tone

Task 3

 You believe that the increase in online shopping is threatening the existence of smaller shops
 and markets in your neighbourhood. You want to raise awareness of this issue amongst the
 local community. Write a text in which you outline why the closing of smaller shops and markets
 is a problem and offer some practical solutions to avoid this from happening.

 Flyer                             Blog                             Review


Criterion B:

• The focus of the question is “the closing of smaller shops and markets” not “online shopping”
  per se. The latter, however, can and is expected to be used as a reason for the threat present
  but not the focal aspect of the question.
• Two aspects are required in the question: “outline why the closing of smaller shops and markets
  is a problem” and “offer some practical solutions to avoid this from happening”. There does not
  need to be equal space devoted to each of the two, but neither should be left minimal (in a
  single sentence) or completely ignored; otherwise, no more than the 4-6 band should be
  awarded, since the task has only been “generally fulfilled” at best.
• It is expected that the “practical solutions” be plural ie there should be 2 or more distinguishable
  solutions offered. If there is really only one solution, and this is very general and superficial,
  script will be marked down.

                                             interest. The choice may be considered “appropriate”
