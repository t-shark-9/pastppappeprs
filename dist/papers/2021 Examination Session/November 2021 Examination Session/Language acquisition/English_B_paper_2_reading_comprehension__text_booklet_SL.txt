                        A Car Park Becomes a Shelter for the Homeless
   1     Homelessness is increasing in Australia and is
         an everyday sight in large cities like Sydney and
         Brisbane. Homeless statistics show that 1 in every
         200 Australians have nowhere to sleep on any
         night. Yet a safe place to sleep is very important           Non-essential image removed
         to a person’s good health. Beddown founder,                     for copyright reasons
         Norm McGillivray, imagined that an underground
         car park, usually empty at night, could become a
         safe place to sleep for people in Brisbane who are
         living on the streets.

   2     [–3–]

         The aim of the organisation is to make use of spaces that are busy during the day but are
         vacant at night. Beddown uses them as accommodation for people who are homeless.

   3     Once a car park empties for the night, Beddown volunteers set up inflatable mattresses with
         bed linen and pillows for each homeless person. Beddown also works with other charitable
         organisations that provide a laundry service and showers, food and drink and clothing.

   4     A range of specialist service providers such as doctors, nurses and dentists also give their
         services for free.

   5     [–4–]

         The organisation, Beddown, has become a partner with Australia’s largest car park owner
         responsible for over 600 car parks across Australia and New Zealand. Beddown has recently
         finished a 14-night experiment in a Brisbane car park. Every night volunteers turned the space
         into a shelter for 15 men and women without a place to sleep. These men and women were
         given toiletries, takeaway food donated by a local restaurant, and access to dentists and their
         services. The volunteers were delighted because they saw the same 15 people return there
         each night.

   6     [–5–]

         Norm McGillivray considers that the experiment in the Brisbane car park has been a success
         and now wants to expand the operation. He is also hoping that in the future, government and
         commercial sponsors will give their financial support to it.

                                Color blind boy sees color for first time
   1     This is the emotional moment in a home
         video, when an “extremely” color blind boy
         put on new glasses which allowed him to
         see color for the first time.
                                                                      Non-essential image removed
   2     Jonathan Jones, 12, was dumbstruck after                        for copyright reasons
         his principal, who is also color blind, let him
         borrow his unique glasses during science
         class in Cottonwood, Minnesota last week.

   3     As soon as Jonathan puts the glasses on, he appears to be immediately taken aback. He
         initially smiles and laughs after putting the glasses on, but he breaks down moments later.

   4     He then walks around the classroom with a huge smile on his face, exploring the now-vivid
         hues around him.

   5     “I was feeling joy and happiness that I could finally see all this color…and a little bit of sadness
         I couldn’t see color my whole life,” Jonathan told ABC news.

   6     The boy’s mother, Carole Walter Jones, wanted to share this moment and so she posted
         the video online showing Jonathan seeing color for the first time. As a result of the interest
         generated, she started a GoFundMe* campaign so that she could purchase a pair of unique
         glasses to enable Jonathan to continue to see color. The glasses reportedly cost $350.

   7     However, so many people were moved by the video of Jonathan that the GoFundMe campaign
         actually ended up amassing more than $ 25,000 as of Monday morning.

   8     Carole wrote: “We have been overwhelmed by how many kind, generous people have wanted
         to help him get a pair of his own color blind glasses.

   9     “We’ve had multiple pairs donated to Jonathan and will use 100 % of donated funds to purchase
         color blind glasses for those who can’t afford them.

 10      “One wonderful glasses manufacturer will be matching every pair purchased with a free pair,
         which will double the number of people we can help,” Carole continued.

 11      For Jonathan, with a new pair of glasses comes a new view of the world.

 12      He said his favorite color is now blue and he is excited to visit the Caribbean with his family this
         winter so he can see the ocean in all its azure glory.

                                       4 Ways to Spot Greenwashing




         Finding the truth behind labels on your favorite beauty product or health food isn’t always
         easy. Now that the marketplace is seeing more environmentally-friendly products, companies
         are using just about every expression possible to convince consumers to buy their products.
         “Greenwashing” is a term that’s used to describe when companies use misleading marketing
    5    terms to persuade potential customers that their products are safer, or more natural than they
         really are. But, how can you spot it?

         Follow Your Nose
         Avoid buying products that have a strong scent and list “fragrance” on the ingredient list.
         Fragrances are protected by trade secrets and can contain hundreds of chemicals. Any
  10     company which doesn’t fully disclose the contents of their fragrances should not label their
         products as “natural”, or “organic”. Please note that companies can use essential oils to scent
         their products, but they should label them accordingly.

         Organic Marketing Claims
         Double-check the ingredient list of products to confirm how much of the product is actually
  15     organic. Since organic foods are healthier, many people assume that all organic products
         are healthier, but that’s not always the case. Beauty products may use certified organic raw
         ingredients (like coconut oil), but the rest of the ingredient list could be full of artificial chemicals.

         Excessive Packaging
         How green can your company really be if the carbon footprint of each product is excessive?
  20     Case in point, one company I love makes plant-based protein. Their veggie burger looks
         delicious but is packed in excessive plastic, paper and cardboard. Being “green” isn’t just about
         what’s inside the box, it’s also about how the product is stored and shipped.

         Trust The Research Findings
         For beauty products, check to see how they rate on the handy Skin Deep database created by
  25     the Environmental Working Group. This scores common beauty products, helping consumers
         to effortlessly navigate a complicated marketplace and understand what is safe and what is not.
         You’ll notice several brands that are marketing themselves as “natural” have items that rank
         7–10 on the hazard scale. I aim only to buy those that score 3 or less.

         I hope these simple tips help you. Feel free to ask me questions if you’re particularly stumped,
  30     and always hold companies accountable for truth and transparency in their labeling.
