       Marks         Level descriptor

          0          The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

         1–2         The response demonstrates a limited understanding of the chosen option
                     without addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the
                     examples.
                     The argument has limited focus, coherence and development.

         3–4         The response demonstrates limited understanding of the contexts and
                     background knowledge pertinent to the chosen examples.
                     The argument has focus but has limited coherence and is not developed.

         5–6         The response demonstrates an understanding of the chosen option by
                     addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples in a
                     limited way.
                     The argument has focus and coherence but is not developed.

         7–8         The response demonstrates an understanding of the chosen option by
                     addressing contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples.
                     The argument has focus and coherence, and is developed.
