                        Why university students love living with seniors




                                      Image removed for copyright reasons




   1     Tafadzwa Machipisa is a 27-year-old student from Zimbabwe studying medicine in Canada. She
         lives with 73-year-old Constance Jain. They are part of a co-housing program at the university
         that places students in the homes of seniors.

   2     There is a lot of laughter in Constance’s cozy home and her roommate, Tafadzwa, is the reason.
         Constance explains that Tafadzwa is very easy to get along with and that they have a lot in
         common: South Africa, for example. Tafadzwa was a student in Cape Town* and Constance
         travelled there many times with her husband.

   3     It seems like they’ve been friends for years despite the fact they’ve only known each other
         about 12 months — and were born 46 years apart. The two women were brought together by
         a housing program that matches university students with seniors living by themselves in the
         community. The program connects students who can only pay a low rent with seniors who have
         an empty furnished room. It gives seniors a little extra income and both the student and the
         elderly person benefit from the companionship.

   4     It is very important for seniors like Constance to be independent but some company is good,
         too, because it means her home doesn’t feel so empty anymore. “It’s comforting to hear the
         door open and to hear her voice,” said Constance. Tafadzwa adds with a laugh, “It’s strange to
         say, ‘My roommate, who is 73!’”

   5     Before students are accepted into the program, they are asked questions on a variety of topics,
         including their personal habits, their willingness to do chores around the house, and how
         far they’re willing to live from the university.

   6     As for the seniors, they must have a spare bedroom, home insurance and be willing to share
         common areas such as the kitchen or bathroom.

   7     The co-housing program began last year. 40 applications were received, and 10 students were
         placed with seniors. The number of applications is up this year.

                        A Car Park Becomes a Shelter for the Homeless
         Homelessness is increasing in Australia and is
         an everyday sight in large cities like Sydney and
         Brisbane. Homeless statistics show that 1 in every
          200 Australians have nowhere to sleep on any
     5   night. Yet a safe place to sleep is very important
         to a person’s good health. Beddown founder,            Image removed for copyright reasons
         Norm McGillivray, imagined that an underground
         car park, usually empty at night, could become a
         safe place to sleep for people in Brisbane who are
    10    living on the streets.

         What is “Beddown”?

         The aim of the organisation is to make use of spaces that are busy during the day but are
         vacant at night. Beddown uses them as accommodation for people who are homeless.

         Once a car park empties for the night, Beddown volunteers set up inflatable mattresses with
    15   bed linen and pillows for each homeless person. Beddown also works with other charitable
         organisations that provide a laundry service and showers, food and drink and clothing.

         A range of specialist service providers such as doctors, nurses and dentists also give their
         services for free.

         The Beddown experiment

    20   The organisation, Beddown, has become a partner with Australia’s largest car park owner
         responsible for over 600 car parks across Australia and New Zealand. Beddown has recently
         finished a 14-night experiment in a Brisbane car park. Every night volunteers turned the space
         into a shelter for 15 men and women without a place to sleep. These men and women were
         given toiletries, takeaway food donated by a local restaurant, and access to dentists and their
    25   services. The volunteers were delighted because they saw the same 15 people return there
         each night.

         What’s next?

         Norm McGillivray considers that the experiment in the Brisbane car park has been a success
         and now wants to expand the operation. He is also hoping that in the future, government and
    30   commercial sponsors will give their financial support to it.
