Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed
but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or
significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks
allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be
rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   Evaluate the impact of the Sassanians on the ‘Abbasid dynasty.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Sassanians on the ‘Abbasid dynasty.
     Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may evaluate the impact of an evolving Persian political culture. Persians
     replaced Arabs in many political positions and Persian administrative methods were employed.
     Persian traditions were used for court ceremonial and government structures and the Persian
     tradition of a standing army was introduced to bolster the ruler’s power. Another impact is that the
     caliph adopted the Persian tradition of emphasizing the religious basis of his power and used
     theologians to support this view. Persian literature and poetry became widespread. In 946, the
     Persian Buyeh family removed all power from the caliph and reduced him to a figurehead.
     However, candidates may note that the Shi’ism of the Persians never replaced the Sunni
     Orthodoxy as the official religion of the empire. Arabic remained the language of government and
     many Arabs held high positions in government. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   To what extent can Harun al-Rashid be considered a successful ruler?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Harun al-Rashid was a
     successful ruler. Examples of successes or otherwise may extend beyond the timeframe but must
     be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to his establishment of
     the House of Wisdom and the creation of the Golden Age. He expanded the territory of the empire
     to its greatest extent and developed diplomatic relations with China and the Holy Roman Empire,
     as economic development and trade reached their apex. However, his reign also experienced
     numerous uprisings against the empire, which resulted in the loss of control over North Africa. In
     addition, he was not able to eliminate the challenge to his authority from the Umayyad dynasty in
     Spain. His failure to create an effective succession plan led to civil war between his sons and a
     significant weakening of the ‘Abbasid Empire. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   “The impact of the Fatimid conquest of Egypt was mainly economic.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the impact of the
     Fatimid conquest of Egypt was mainly economic. Examples of impact may extend beyond the
     timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
     the Fatimid development of agriculture and industry in Egypt. Low tariff policies encouraged trade
     and created enormous wealth. The cultivation of cash crops and flax was encouraged and these
     were traded for goods from across the region, as Cairo and Alexandria became the most important
     commercial centres in the Mediterranean. However, the conquest of Egypt also had a strong
     political impact as it raised the prestige and military power of the Fatimids and supported their
     claim to the caliphate. Egypt became a strategic base for the expansion of Fatimid missionary
     efforts in Africa and Asia, and Egypt's wealth allowed the creation of a university and support for
     intellectual and cultural developments, which raised Fatimid prestige. It may be noted that political,
     religious and intellectual developments were made possible by economic development in Egypt.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


4.   Examine the contribution of religious relations to the maintenance of power of the Fatimid Empire.

     Candidates will consider the interrelationship between religious relations and the Fatimid Empire’s
     maintenance of power. Candidates may refer to Fatimid toleration of the Sunni majority in their
     empire. This created internal peace, as did their harmonious relations with Christians and Jews.
     The employment of individuals by merit and not religious faith was crucial to maintaining and
     expanding power, both politically and economically. The Fatimids prospered by maintaining good
     commercial relations with Italy and Constantinople and welcoming foreign merchants to the empire
     regardless of their faith. However, increasing conflict with Sunni powers such as the Seljuks began
     to weaken their power outside Egypt, and caused them to be attacked and defeated by Saladin.
     Conflict with the Crusaders and the schism within the Isma‘ili community contributed to their
     collapse. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.
                                                    –6–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   Evaluate the reasons for the success of the First Crusade (1096–1099).

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the success of the First Crusade. Reasons
     may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may evaluate the military and logistical assistance provided by the Byzantine Empire,
     the military skills of the Crusaders, particularly in siege warfare, and the quality of military leaders
     in developing strategy and tactics. In addition, the high morale of the Crusaders, inspired by
     religious dedication, allowed them to persevere and overcome the numerous hardships
     experienced during the campaign. The financial assistance and transportation provided by Genoa
     and other Italian cities was crucial to success. The internal weakness of the ‘Abbasid Empire and
     conflicts between individual Muslim states and rulers also played a key role, as opposition to the
     Crusaders was greatly weakened. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Evaluate the impact of the Hospitallers and Templars on the Crusades.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Hospitallers and Templars on the Crusades,
     weighing up the strengths and limitations of their contributions. Impacts may extend beyond the
     timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate
     the provision of military support to the Crusader states, which often lacked adequate military
     forces, and the garrisoning of castles that protected trade and pilgrim routes. The military orders
     also provided medical care for soldiers and support for the poor. Their ability to raise funds in
     Europe and to recruit volunteers to serve in the Holy Land provided long-term support to many of
     the Crusader states and the Crusading movement. Candidates may argue that their extensive
     military experience and discipline was a valuable addition to Crusading armies and individual
     rulers. Their religious zeal and unbending attitude towards Muslims did create friction and led to
     unnecessary strife and conflict. Their refusal to follow the orders of other military leaders
     contributed to the defeat at Hattin and the loss of Jerusalem. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
     will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Evaluate the reasons for the rise of the Ottomans in Anatolia.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the rise of the Ottomans in Anatolia, weighing
     up the importance or otherwise of these factors. Reasons may predate the timeframe but must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate the significance of the
     power vacuum created by the collapse of the Seljuks, the economic strength of the Ottomans
     based on their fertile lands and control of trade routes, which allowed them to recruit larger armies
     and purchase the latest technology, and the expanded power resulting from their conquests in the
     Balkans. The strength of Ottoman leaders was an important factor, particularly their willingness to
     use new technology and tactics. External factors may be evaluated as the Ottomans received aid
     from the Genoese, who wished to trade. Tamerlane’s conquests failed to destroy them and created
     an opportunity for expansion when his empire collapsed and the Byzantine Empire was losing
     power in Anatolia. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the contribution of the Ottomans to Islamic culture.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the contribution of the Ottomans to Islamic culture, weighing
     up the strengths and importance or otherwise of this contribution. The results may extend beyond
     the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     evaluate religious contributions in which Sunni orthodoxy was strengthened and Shi’ism
     suppressed. Sufism was expanded under the Ottomans, who supported and popularized this
     spiritual, mystic movement. The dervish movements were encouraged in order to liberalize
     religious practice and loosen prohibitions on coffee, tobacco and music, thus making Islamic
     culture less austere. The Ottomans promoted a sense of Muslim power and superiority and
     supported strong resistance to Western ideas and culture. In literature, they expanded printing,
     particularly in Arabic, and promoted Persian styles in literature and poetry. They made the Ottoman
     world more cosmopolitan by introducing Greek, Anatolian and Asian styles into architecture, music,
     art and literature. Their extensive trading networks brought a range of influences from the Orient in
     food, dress, and scientific and technical knowledge. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Examine the significance of trade routes to the rise and decline of the Ghana Empire.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between trade routes and the
      rise and decline of the Ghana Empire. Factors considered may predate the timeframe but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      rise and decline, or they may prioritize their coverage of either. They may examine the
      advantageous location of the empire, which was situated at the nexus of a complex series of trade
      routes linking North Africa with the goldfields to the south. The empire was enriched by taxes
      levied on goods such as gold, salt, copper, and leather goods, leading to urbanization and the
      development of a sophisticated market economy. Over time, new kingdoms rose and encroached
      on these trade routes, threatening its economic lifeblood. The discovery of rich new goldfields in
      neighbouring states meant that trade routes shifted to these new centres of supply, bypassing the
      Ghana Empire and contributing to its eventual implosion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   “The most important factor in the rise of the Mali Empire was its military organization.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important factor in the rise of the Mali Empire was its military organization. Candidates may
      refer to Sundiata Keita, the warrior-prince who founded the empire by building a powerful army and
      achieving military victories over his rivals. Sundiata’s army was highly organized and armed with
      poison arrows, javelins, stabbing spears and chain armour. His elite cavalry divisions, known as
      farari, were particularly effective in battle. War canoes were used to expand territory along the
      Niger river and its tributaries. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the decline of
      the Ghana Empire, which created a power vacuum and new opportunities for expansion, and the
      significance of the trade in gold and salt, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –9–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Evaluate the importance of social and political organization to the rise of the Sotho.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of social and political
      organization to the rise of the Sotho, weighing up the strengths and limitations of both factors.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and political organization, or they may prioritize
      their evaluation of either. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to the role of Moshoeshoe as a leader and diplomat. He offered sanctuary to groups fleeing
      the Difaqane, used the pitso to consult with Sotho elders before making important political
      decisions, and preserved Basotho independence by combining resistance with wily diplomacy with
      the Boers and the British. Social traditions, such as initiation ceremonies and age grades, were
      promoted as a way of strengthening cultural identity. Moshoeshoe encouraged the activity of
      French missionaries, who brought with them education and healthcare. Other relevant factors may
      be addressed, such as economic factors, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “The main effect of the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate was economic change.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      main effect of the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate was economic change. Candidates may refer to the
      results of the political centralization which followed the creation of a single caliphate by Usman dan
      Fodio. Centralized power led to a more integrated and diversified economy, with cash crops like
      cotton and indigo introduced alongside the more traditional agricultural practices of pastoralism
      and food production. Islamic scholarship helped create an educated and efficient bureaucracy,
      paving the way for an urban economy and the emergence of a new class of traders and
      merchants. Neighbouring states paid tribute, swelling the coffers of the caliphate. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example religious changes and spread of jihad, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   “The growth of the Atlantic slave trade was mainly an extension of existing practices of slavery in
      African societies.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the growth of the Atlantic slave trade was mainly an extension of existing practices of slavery
      in African societies. Candidates may discuss that slavery was a long-standing institution in many
      parts of West Africa and that it had contributed to the success of empires such as Mali and
      Songhai. The legacy of animosity created by the existing trade meant that some African groups
      were prepared to act as middlemen for the Europeans by procuring slaves from the interior.
      Candidates may discuss other ways in which European slavers were adept at exploiting divisions
      and rivalries among Africans. Candidates may disagree with the statement by arguing that other
      factors were more important causes of the expansion: the demand for labour in the sugar
      plantations of the New World; advances in maritime technology; or the demand in African societies
      for goods such as cloth, beads, gin, and firearms. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Evaluate the role of humanitarian factors in the decline of the East African slave trade.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of humanitarian factors in the
      decline of the East African slave trade, weighing up the importance or otherwise of these factors.
      Candidates may argue that the decline came from pressure exerted by abolitionists in early
      nineteenth century Britain, or the decision of the British to abolish the trade across their empire in
      1807 and the institution of slavery itself in 1833. They may highlight the role played by Christian
      missionaries and explorers, such as David Livingstone, and argue that it was the introduction of
      colonial rule that brought an abrupt end to the trade in many areas. Similarly, humanitarian factors
      lay behind British Consul John Kirk’s decision to force Sultan Barghash to close the slave market in
      Zanzibar in 1873, a key development in the decline of the East African slave trade. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, such as the falling demand for slaves in the Ottoman Empire, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   “Strategic factors were the most important reasons for the partition of Africa.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that strategic factors were the most important reasons for the partition of Africa. Candidates may
      discuss the significance of South Africa during the early period of the partition, where Britain was
      determined to extend and strengthen its control of the subcontinent. This was due to the strategic
      importance of this region on the sea route to its empire in India. Concerns over the security of the
      Suez Canal zone led to Britain’s military occupation of Egypt in 1882. The fallout from this
      development contributed to the breakdown of the “gentleman’s agreement” with France in West
      Africa, accelerating the colonization of this region. Similarly, colonial activity in East Africa may
      have been prompted by competition between European powers to control the headwaters of the
      Nile river. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example national rivalry and economic
      causes, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   “The Berlin West Africa Conference had little impact on the partition of Africa.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Berlin West Africa Conference had little impact on the partition of Africa. Candidates may agree
      with the statement by arguing that the partition was already well underway in many parts of the
      continent prior to Bismarck’s decision to hold a conference in 1884. They may argue that the
      conference focused mainly on relatively minor issues such as territorial and commercial disputes
      between Leopold and other powers in the Congo basin, and these rivalries had little to do with the
      deeper causes of the partition. Candidates may disagree with the statement by referring to
      Bismarck’s use of the conference as a means of promoting and legitimizing Germany’s claims to
      colonies in Africa. This elicited a response from the other powers, who rushed to exclude Germany
      from other parts of the continent. Candidates may also refer to the agreements reached in Berlin
      regarding the need for effective occupation and argue that this may have precipitated a “second
      scramble”. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   “Strong African states resisted imperialism while weaker states collaborated.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that strong
      African states resisted imperialism while weaker states collaborated. Candidates may agree with
      the statement by referring to factors such as centralized political structures, large professional
      armies and access to modern weaponry. All of these made possible the resistance of stronger
      states, such as Menelik’s Ethiopia or Cetshwayo’s Zulu Kingdom. Conversely, they may argue that
      weaker states recognized the futility of resistance and had little choice but to come to terms with
      the colonizer. Alternatively, candidates may disagree with the statement by referring to weak states
      that resisted, or strong states that collaborated. Examples may include Buganda, which
      collaborated with Britain to gain political and economic advantage through the exercise of
      subcolonialism; or the doomed, desperate resistance of groups such as the Herero and Nama.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


18.   “The most important reasons for British intervention in the Asante Wars (1873, 1896, 1900) were
      economic.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the most important reasons for British intervention in the Asante Wars were economic.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to economic factors such as the British desire to control the
      goldfields of Asante. As well as gold, Asante produced large quantities of rubber and cocoa, and
      the British were determined to break its monopoly of the lucrative trade between the coast and the
      hinterland. Candidates may discuss strategic factors including their support of the Fante, the
      traditional foe of Asante, or their wish to exclude France and Germany from the region. Candidates
      may also discuss more specific factors, such as the Asante incursion into British territory in 1873,
      the refusal of the Asantehene to submit to British protection in 1896, or the Golden Stool incident in
      1900. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Compare and contrast the impact of settlers in one British colony and one Portuguese colony.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of settlers in one British colony and one Portuguese colony, referring to both
      throughout. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may note that the settler presence often led to political
      radicalization, with settlers demanding residential segregation and the economic subordination of
      Africans. They may refer to resulting tensions between colonial officials and settler groups, or to
      ways in which the settler presence delayed the march to independence. Candidates may refer to
      more specific developments, such as the roles played by settler communities in the causes and
      course of the liberation wars in Mozambique and Angola, in the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya, in the
      creation of the Central African Federation, and in the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in
      Rhodesia.


20.   “The impact of colonial administration was entirely negative for the Senegalese.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the impact of colonial administration was entirely negative for the Senegalese. Impact may
      extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to issues raised in the question.
      Candidates may discuss enduring poverty in colonial Senegal, especially in rural areas, where
      authorities failed to diversify or develop an economy based mainly on peasant cultivation of cash
      crops. Alternatively, they may discuss that colonial authorities did introduce basic healthcare and
      western education, though provision was sparse and low in quality. Some members of the African
      elite had access to tertiary education in France. Candidates may argue that citizenship rights were
      available to Africans in the four communes, or that the preservation of chiefly authority meant that
      the impact of colonial administration was in any case minor in many areas. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Compare and contrast how independence was achieved in Tanganyika and South-West Africa.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the achievement of independence in Tanganyika and South-West Africa, referring to both countries
      throughout. For comparison, candidates may note the dominance of a single nationalist movement
      in each country (TANU and SWAPO respectively), which provided a focal point for opposition.
      Similarly, the two movements were dominated by a single charismatic leader, Julius Nyerere in
      Tanganyika and Sam Nujoma in South-West Africa. Candidates may also note pressures for
      independence in both colonies resulting from their special status as UN Trust Territories. For
      contrast, they may highlight the differences between Tanganyika’s peaceful achievement of
      independence and South-West Africa’s prolonged armed struggle. They may also argue that the
      struggle in South-West Africa was complicated by the presence of South Africa as a racist
      occupying power, a factor that contributed to the later achievement of Namibian independence.


22.   Evaluate the contribution of political parties to the achievement of independence in French West
      Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of political parties to
      the achievement of independence in French West Africa, weighing up their importance or
      otherwise. Candidates may evaluate the importance of the Rassemblement Democratique Africain
      (RDA), a grouping of parties from all parts of French West Africa, which ensured that nationalism
      developed a strong cross-regional character. This party, which included political heavyweights like
      Felix Houphouet-Boigny and Leopold Senghor, sat in the French parliament and worked closely
      with French Communists, leading to some support for independence in the metropolis. They may
      evaluate other parties such as Sekou Toure’s Democratic Party of Guinea, which voted against
      plans for an independent regional community in 1958, thus hastening independence from France
      but scuppering proposals for a post-independence federation. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the willingness of the French government to smooth a path to
      independence by enacting legislation such as the Loi Cadre of 1946 or the 1958 Constitution.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   “Rising nationalism was the main reason for the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th
      century.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the view that rising nationalism was the
      main reason for the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. Reasons may predate
      the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      discuss the rise of nationalism caused by the French Revolution, which inspired subject groups
      within the Empire such as the Greeks to revolt, and European powers such as Russia to expand at
      the expense of the Ottomans. Other reasons may include the increased Western control of trade
      routes from Asia and Africa, which reduced Ottoman economic power, and Western advances in
      science and technology that gave them a powerful military advantage over the Ottomans.
      Candidates may discuss the Ottoman failure to modernize their government, economy, education
      system and military, which made them much weaker than the Western powers, who were
      expanding aggressively. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   To what extent was fear of Russian expansion the main reason for Ottoman entry into the First
      World War?

      Candidates will consider the merits of the suggestion that fear of Russian expansion was the main
      reason for Ottoman entry into the First World War. Candidates may refer to Ottoman territorial
      losses to Russia in the 19th century, which caused fear of Russian ambitions. Ottoman weakness
      in the Balkan Wars emphasized how vulnerable they would be to future Russian aggression. Entry
      into the war on the German side gave them a chance to defeat Russia. Their failure to reach a
      diplomatic agreement with the Triple Entente made the Ottomans fearful that the Triple Entente
      would give their territory to Russia as a reward for participation in a European war. Candidates
      may argue that extensive German military and economic support to the Ottomans prior to the war
      had solidified relations and caused the Committee of Union and Progress to become pro-German.
      Improvements in the Ottoman army made them more confident in confronting Russia, as did
      German naval support in the Black Sea. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, the mandate system in Syria and Lebanon.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between the reasons for and the results of the
      mandate system in Syria and Lebanon. Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons and
      results or they may prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both reasons and results
      will feature. Candidates may examine the Sykes–Picot agreement which assigned Syria and
      Lebanon to France. France acquired the mandates leading to economic and strategic advantages,
      and this balanced British power in the region. Creating the mandates allowed France to deny self-
      rule to the Arabs, which was consistent with their colonial policy in Africa. For results, candidates
      may examine French expansion of Lebanon at the expense of Syria and their favouring of the
      Maronite Christians in Lebanon. This led to constant unrest and outbreaks of rebellion in Syria and
      Lebanon, which caused the French to grant limited self-rule in both colonies but not independence.
      French favouritism of Christians caused sectarian violence in Lebanon. The French did introduce
      modern administration and legal systems. They built infrastructure in both mandates and improved
      the education system, but economic development was limited. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


26.   To what extent were attempts at modernization in Iran or Saudi Arabia or one North African state
      successful?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that attempts at modernization
      in Iran or Saudi Arabia or one North African country were successful. Candidates may refer to
      developments in economic and industrial development, evidence of new technology in
      transportation, infrastructure and communication, as well as changes in social structure, family life,
      women's rights, religion and education. The degree of modernization may be assessed with
      respect to changes in political and legal systems, as well as relations with other countries.
      Candidates may consider attempts at modernization from their chosen country that span across
      several changing governments in the country. Political reform may also be considered where
      appropriate. The degree to which new ideas and ideologies were accepted may also be
      considered. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   “The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was more successful than the
      Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that ECOWAS was more successful than SADCC. Successes or failures may extend beyond the
      timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of ECOWAS and SADCC, or they may prioritize discussion of either. However,
      both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the success of ECOWAS in
      achieving economic integration, or to its military interventions in civil wars which promoted regional
      stability. They may also address rivalries and divisions among its members, problems that also
      beset SADCC. Candidates may refer to SADCC’s contribution to the achievement of majority rule
      in South Africa, or to South African intervention in civil wars in Angola and Mozambique prior to
      1994, a factor that weakened its members and undermined its effectiveness as an organization.


28.   Examine the consequences of siding with the United States or the Soviet Union for two African
      countries during the Cold War.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the decisions of two
      African states to side with the United States or the Soviet Union during the Cold War and the
      consequences for these countries. Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue of siding with a superpower. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of the two countries or they may prioritize their examination of either. However, both will
      be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to financial aid provided by the superpower,
      which promoted economic development, or they may stress that this aid was highly conditional and
      often came in the form of military equipment. These factors could strengthen military juntas,
      perpetuate corruption and/or dictatorship, and exacerbate civil conflict. Candidates may also point
      out that siding with one superpower typically led to destabilization by the other, or that accepting
      superpower backing often entailed involvement in wars by proxy. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Compare and contrast the nature of segregation and apartheid policies.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the policies of segregation and apartheid, referring to both throughout. There does not need to be
      an equal number of points on each. For comparison, they may refer to the oppressive and
      discriminatory nature of the two systems, each of which was designed to achieve the political and
      economic domination of white over black. Among other things, each system aimed to achieve
      residential segregation of the races and enforce a colour bar in the workplace. For contrast,
      candidates may argue that apartheid policies were more radical and systematic in their scope and
      implementation than segregation. Apartheid sought to extend legislation to areas not covered
      under segregation laws, such as public amenities and sexual relations. Candidates may argue that
      unlike segregation, the policies of Grand Apartheid were introduced in an attempt to engineer the
      complete separation of the races.


30.   Evaluate the contribution of township unrest in the 1980s to the end of the apartheid system.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of township unrest to
      the end of the apartheid system, weighing up its strengths and limitations as a factor. Candidates
      may refer to the immediate response to township unrest of the government. President P W Botha
      declared a state of emergency and announced the creation of a multi-racial tricameral parliament,
      which, it may be argued, was a first step towards reform of the system. Candidates may also
      evaluate the general sense of crisis which now pervaded the apartheid system, or to the damage
      inflicted by the unrest on an already beleaguered economy. They may argue that unrest
      contributed to the emergence of new political actors, such as the United Democratic Front and
      COSATU. In the absence of the banned ANC, these groups provided a focus for further resistance
      and helped draw international attention to apartheid. Other factors may be evaluated, for example,
      the global economic boycott of South Africa, or debates for reform within the ruling National Party,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   “Anti-colonialism was the most important reason for the creation of the African Independent
      Churches.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that anti-colonialism
      was the most important reason for the creation of the African Independent Churches. Candidates
      may refer to political movements for independence which supported their creation and the desire to
      create independent churches that would be free of European church hierarchies. There was a
      desire to create a new style of church which would integrate Christian and African tradition. African
      churches could also help Africans adapt to modern views which were alien to their traditions. The
      creation of African churches was inspired by the Protestant traditions of schism and independence
      which allowed considerable individuality in the application of Christian values. The movement to
      create African churches also grew because it served the needs of Africans and could be adapted
      to reflect the views of individual countries or ethnic groups. Other relevant factors such as the work
      of missionaries or geo-political events may be discussed but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by relevant
      evidence.


32.   With reference to two African countries, evaluate the impact of technological developments on
      society.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of technological developments on two African
      countries, weighing up the strengths and limitations or otherwise. The impacts may extend beyond
      the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of both countries or they may prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both
      countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may evaluate the impact of technology on
      industries, employment, urbanization and economic systems. They may address the impact of
      information technology on education, new political ideas, lifestyles and family life, or stress the
      importance of developments in transportation on trade and the environment. Candidates can
      evaluate both positive and negative impacts. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
      indicated, but there does not have to be an equal focus on each. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate the impact of the Six Day War on Israel and Arab states up to 1978.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Six Day War on Israel and Arab states,
      weighing up the importance or otherwise of this impact. Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe
      but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate increased
      Israeli territory and improved strategic position, the problems created by large numbers of Arab
      refugees inside Israel, increased security for Israel after the defeat of opponents, increased
      guerrilla attacks on Israel and the creation of the PLO as a political and military opponent, and
      increased international opposition based on the fate of the Palestinians and the Sinai region.
      Impacts on Arab states may include the sense of humiliation and enmity amongst Arab states after
      the defeat; the collapse of Nasser and Egypt as the leading Arab power and the emergence of
      Saudi Arabia as the new power; new governments in Egypt and Syria with close ties to the Soviet
      Union; determination by Arabs to avenge the loss leading to the Yom Kippur War and a further
      Arab defeat. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


34.   To what extent were the economic and social policies of Nasser successful?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the economic and social
      policies of Nasser were successful. Candidates may refer to his land reform policies, which
      transferred wealth to middle- and low-income farmers; the Aswan Dam which increased arable
      land but decreased fertility and damaged the environment; industrialization policies based on state
      ownership, which created rapid growth but were inefficient and caused increased debt and a poor
      credit rating for the state. The nationalization of the Suez Canal was a major economic initiative,
      but its impact was lessened by wars with Israel, which caused it to be closed. Nasser increased
      employment for many young people in government service, but lack of funds created debt and high
      levels of inflation, as did his high military spending. His overall inability to expand the economy led
      to widespread unemployment and social unrest. His social policies were successful in expanding
      education, improving working conditions, and achieving greater equality and more rights for
      women. The influence of religion was reduced as society was made more secular. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

35.   Evaluate the impact of military rule in two African countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of military rule in two
      African countries, weighing up its strengths and limitations. The evaluation of impact may extend
      beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of positive and negative impacts or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one of them, but both aspects must be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to positive
      impacts such as the restoration of internal peace; the eviction of unpopular governments or leaders
      and the creation of stability, which might foster economic growth, trade and investment. Negative
      impacts such as reductions in freedom and civil rights, elimination of democratic institutions,
      increased ethnic divisions and corruption may be referred to. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   Evaluate the impact of neo-colonial economic exploitation in two African countries.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of neo-colonial exploitation in two African
      countries. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised
      in the question. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated, but there does not have to
      be an equal focus on each. Candidates may refer to limitations such as loss of control over natural
      resources, tax revenues and trade terms and the activities of foreign enterprises. In addition, they
      may address the loss of local industries and reductions in living standards and working conditions.
      Governments may have been pressured into alliances, trade pacts or diplomatic positions, and the
      internal political system or leadership may have been influenced or altered. Positive impacts may
      include the possibility of foreign investment, which developed infrastructure, training facilities and
      industries, contributing to future growth. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
