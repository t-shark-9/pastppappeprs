Answer one question from this section.

1.   PB Ltd

     Phoebe Bowen, a young entrepreneur, started her own clothing company, PB Ltd, on
     1 January 2019. On the same day, PB Ltd purchased fixed assets for $20 000. The estimated
     useful life of the assets is six years.

     At the end of 2020, Phoebe’s newly appointed accountant said that Phoebe had omitted the
     depreciation of the firm’s fixed assets from the accounts. Table 1 shows selected financial
     information from the final accounts of PB Ltd for the years ending 31 December 2019 and
     31 December 2020.

2.   Sock Paradise (SP)

     After conducting primary market research, Pam opened Sock Paradise (SP), which sells
     colourful socks. SP operates a retail stall in a large department store and sells online through
     its own website.

     Table 2 shows selected financial data for SP for 2020.

                               Table 2: Selected financial data for SP for 2020

           Annual fixed costs of stall rental and operation                    $50 000

     At the end of 2020, the department store told Pam that it would increase rent by $14 000 per
     year starting on 1 January 2021. Pam forecast total sales for 2021 as 18 000 pairs of socks;
     other costs and prices were forecast to remain unchanged.

                                              Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Healthy Nation (HN)

     Healthy Nation (HN ) is a pharmaceutical organization that used to operate in the public
     sector, selling its medicines (drugs) to hospitals at very low prices.

     With increasing government funding over several years, HN increased the number of
     employees in its Research and Development Department, which was staffed by scientists,
     and in the Manufacturing Department. However, both departments were inflexible and
     inefficient. Resources were significantly under-utilized, and innovation limited.

     HN ’s structure used to be hierarchical, with a very long chain of command and channels
     of communication. Senior management made the decisions and set the production levels.
     Consequently, the scientists in the Research and Development Department never developed
     decision-making skills, and development of new medicines was slow. In 2021, after many
     years of losses, the government sold HN to a profit-maximizing global pharmaceutical
     manufacturer, Global Pharma (GP).

     To improve productivity, efficiency and flexibility, the management of GP reorganized HN as a
     shamrock organization by:
     y outsourcing the production function to a well-known manufacturer
     y retaining the Research and Development Department, along with its scientists and support staff,
        and employing additional staff when required.

     In addition, two major changes were announced:
     y Establishing performance-related pay for the scientists based on a new appraisal system to
        increase productivity levels.
     y Using an expensive external company to provide cognitive training to the scientists to develop
        innovative decision-making and improve teamwork.

     These changes have proved to be very unpopular, and the scientists in particular are
     resisting the changes and the short time frame in which they will be implemented.


     (a)   Define the term public sector.                                                              [2]

     (b)   Explain one benefit and one limitation for GP resulting from the implementation of the
           shamrock organization structure for HN.                                                     [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for GP resulting from the introduction of
           cognitive training for HN ’s scientists.                                                    [4]

     (d)   Discuss two human resource strategies that GP could use to reduce the scientists’
           resistance to the changes.                                                                [10]

4.   Smith’s Foods Ltd (SF)

     Charles Smith and seven friends started a private limited company, Smith’s Foods Ltd (SF ),
     to produce ready-made healthy meals for people with diabetes*. Using a cost-plus (mark‑up)
     pricing strategy, SF ’s mission is to make inexpensive, widely available meals that help
     diabetics manage their carbohydrate intake accurately.

     Despite reliance on inexpensive social media marketing, SF grew rapidly. Due to this rapid
     growth, however, the quality of its products deteriorated, and a number of its meals were
     found to contain different quantities of carbohydrate than those stated on the packaging.
     Negative comments appeared on SF ’s Instagram page. Charles responded quickly to
     reassure customers and offered refunds. SF ’s response led to the company receiving an
     industry award for ethical behaviour.

     Charles introduced flow production to reduce the cost of SF ’s meals, which changed SF ’s
     scale of operations and increased its gearing ratio. However, Charles had little business
     experience of using flow production and problems emerged.

     External stakeholders began to look into SF ’s operations. One supermarket chain, Good
     Foods (GF ), contacted Charles and offered to take over SF, keeping Charles on the board of
     directors. This takeover would allow SF ’s meals to be produced at a lower cost and reach a
     wider target market. GF would also finance research and development into new meals with
     more carefully controlled carbohydrate levels.

     However, SF would close. Negative publicity would be considerable. The remaining
     shareholders have threatened to launch a new business, creating their own brand of meals
     for people with diabetes in direct competition with GF.



* diabetes: a medical condition that causes a person’s blood sugar level to become
  too high. People with diabetes need to be mindful of the amount of carbohydrates
  (which includes sugar) they include in their diet.


     (a)   Define the term cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy.                                     [2]

     (b)   Explain two benefits for SF of using social media marketing.                              [4]

     (c)   Explain one benefit and one cost to SF of using a flow production method.                 [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether Charles should accept GF ’s offer of a takeover.                        [10]




                                                                                             Turn over

5.    Office Supplies (OS)

      Office Supplies (OS) is a family-owned private limited company that, for 40 years, has
      operated three retail office supply stores in a small city. OS offers a wide range of office
      products (such as computer paper and stationery) and office machinery (such as computers
      and printers). When each store opened, OS purchased the buildings using long-term loan
      capital. OS ’s objective is to have enough profit to finance the company’s working capital and
      pay annual dividends.

      OS has no clear marketing strategy. Traditionally, OS competed with several other office
      supply stores operating in the same city. The market was not competitive, however, and most
      customers went to the nearest office supply store. OS ’s prices were comparable to those of
      other retail office supply stores, and the company did little promotion.

      Nationally, the retail office supply store industry is declining. Many retail office supply stores
      have had to close, and new competitors have entered the market, many of which benefit from
      some or all of the following:
      y Specialization in particular office products
      y Economies of scale leading to more competitive prices
      y Greater convenience, including e-commerce with door-to-door delivery

      Like other physical retail stores, OS has seen its sales decline. Gross and net profit
      margins have fallen. Last year, to ensure enough funds for capital expenditure and revenue
      expenditure, OS ’s board of directors chose not to pay dividends. OS also anticipates the
      need for additional finance next year. OS ’s board is considering changes to the company’s
      marketing mix in response to new competitors.


      (a)     State two marketing objectives that a company might have.                                    [2]

      (b)     With reference to OS, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of operating as a
              private limited company.                                                                     [4]

      (c)     With reference to OS, explain the difference between capital expenditure and revenue
              expenditure.                                                                                 [4]

      (d)     Discuss possible changes to any two elements of OS ’s marketing mix.                        [10]
