1.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the reasons why some national governments introduce
           trade restrictions.                                                                    [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Trade restrictions include tariffs, quotas, sanctions, etc. The most likely foci are
           protectionism and resource nationalism (in relation to, for example, rare earths).
           Contemporary examples could include the USA, China or Bolivia.

           Emphasis should be placed on the reasons why national governments seek to
           restrict trade with some or all nations. These may include:
           • the perception that it is economically advantageous to do so (imports may
              threaten a country’s domestic industries and economic growth)
           • evidence that other countries are not “playing by the rules” (eg, Chinese
              government support/subsidies for industries runs afoul of WTO free trade
              rulings) – this may apply to particular sectors only, however
           • political reasons / trade embargoes (eg, USA with Cuba, Iran; sanctions)
           • the perception that benefits of free trade do not outweigh harm done to
              deindustrialized regions and communities
           • the political manifestos of elected leaders and parties (possibly in relation to
              populist or nationalist agendas, and re-shoring promises).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured response based around different categories of reason/rationale (there
           may be economic, social, political gains). Another approach might be to analyse,
           in turn, the differing strength and/or scale of trade restrictions (ranging from
           complete embargo to highly-targeted actions eg tariffs on solar panels or
           processors).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of one or two generalized reasons.
           Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either two or more reasons why national governments may restrict trade (eg
             protectionism, geopolitical reasons, sanctions)
           • or a wider variety of contexts (eg varying industrial sectors, varying scale or
             strength of restrictions).

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Discuss the local and global challenges that are being created by new
      communications technologies.                                                          [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.
      New communications technologies may include:
      • broadband internet and 4G/5G wireless connections
      • social media platforms
      • remotely operated drones and networked 3D printers.
      • online application of artificial intelligence (AI)

      A spectrum of local and global challenges exists, ranging from localized social
      challenges of digital exclusion through to global security concerns linked with new
      communications technologies (viruses and cyber-attacks).

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • uneven patterns and trends in communications infrastructure and use (4.3)
      • threats linked with the shrinking world (4.3)
      • cultural imperialism linked with the diffusion of ideas (5.2)
      • perceived geopolitical threats to state sovereignty (5.3)
      • examples of places where internet freedoms have been restricted (5.3)
      • hacking, identity theft and surveillance freedom issues (6.1)
      • disruptive innovations, including drones and 3D printing (6.1)
      • societal and economic risks stemming from global interactions (6.1).

      Credit may be given for an evaluation of the benefits of a technology - provided
      this is connected logically to a discussion of that same technology’s challenges.
      Do not credit an account of a technology which is focused solely on its benefits.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement that discusses the relative importance of different threats and
      challenges. Another approach might be to critically discuss how different places
      and stakeholders have been unevenly affected (eg issues of digital exclusion for
      rural societies). Another approach might be to discuss interactions between
      different technologies creating heightened threats and challenges (eg role of AI in
      disseminating “fake news” via social networks).

      For 5–8 marks, expect some outlining of two relevant challenges. Response is
      either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together three well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse ways in which international economic migration has been
           affected by political decision making.                                                [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Political decision making encompasses the actions and laws of national
           governments (both host and source regions), along with other international
           frameworks for the regulation of economic migration, such as EU or Mercosur
           free migration and employment rules. International migration flows include those
           between close neighbours (such as the US and Mexico) but also much longer
           distance movements. The effects are likely to be explored mainly in terms of the
           size of flows but there are other possible dimensions (gender, age, skills, etc).

           Do not credit analysis of remittance flows as this is not asked for.

           Possible effects on migration attributable to governance at varying scales include:
           • individual host country rules and laws for economic migration
           • MGO (eg EU) migration rules and decision of national governments to
             participate in multi-scale governance
           • possible role of source country government actions, decisions and conditions
           • the consequent size and other characteristics (eg gender, skills)
             of international/global migration flows
           • global governance of migration (UN frameworks – global compact for
             migration).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis which clearly separates decision making about
           voluntary and forced migrants. Another approach might be to analyse political
           decision making at a range of scales (national government, MGOs, UN).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of one or two links between government
           policies and international migration flows. Response is either partial, narrow or
           lacks supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either two or more ways in which international migration has been affected by
             host country government decision making
           • or political decision making in contrasting places (eg host and source country)
             or at varying scales (state governments and MGOs).

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “The economic gains associated with global development outweigh any cultural losses.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                 [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.
      Global development may be seen as a holistic set of economic and societal changes.
      Development processes operating at national scales collectively
      comprise “global” human development, helped in part by transnational initiatives
      like the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
      Economic gains may be measured collectively (global and national GDP per
      capita data) though these maybe unevenly spread between and within countries.
      Cultural losses may include harm to indigenous culture. Perspectives differ on
      this and not all losses may be seen as such by all people.
      Economic losses and environmental changes should not be over-credited
      because the material is likely to be of marginal relevance to the task set.
      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • global economic growth, new superpowers and lending institutions (4.1)
      • the growth of global trade and connectivity (4.2)
      • links between human development and social changes (gender equality) (5.1)
      • microfinance and economic growth (5.1)
      • cultural diffusion between places (5.2)
      • changing cultures and cultural landscapes (5.2)
      • concerns with migration and cultural change (5.3)
      • anti-globalization / tribalization movements that value national self-
        determination ahead of economic connectivity (6.1)

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement that discusses the extent to which economic gains exceed non-
      economic losses in different places. Another approach might be to discuss the
      distribution of who gains most (and has lost most) at transnational, national or
      more local scales (eg, powerful global elites may make disproportionately large
      economic gains while losing relatively little culturally). Another approach might be
      to critically discuss varying perspectives on what constitutes a cultural loss.

      For 5–8 marks, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is
      either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the links between cultural diversity and cultural hybridity.        [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Cultural diversity refers to a heterogeneous population and the presence of
           different religious, linguistic, ethnic groups in a particular place, whereas cultural
           hybridity refers to a “mix” (or melting pot) of cultural forms, including globalized
           products, art forms and landscapes. The two may be linked insofar as cultural
           diversity (the presence of multiple cultural traits and traditions) creates the potential
           for mixing and hybridity in the absence of constraints (such as apartheid-style
           segregation of ethnic groups).

           Possible analytical themes include:
           • different aspects of cultural diversity, including the traits of language, religion,
             food, music etc
           • places where cultural diversity is high, including global hubs / world cities
           • different instances of cultural hybridity, including music, languages
           • cultural hybridity as a by-product of economic strategy, ie glocalization of
             products by TNCs
           • the growth of cultural hybridity in some culturally diverse places on account of
             more groups mixing with one another.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of different facets of cultural diversity and hybridity
           (food, music, etc). Another approach might be to analyse ways in which diversity
           and hybridity are linked in particular places and contexts.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some outlining of cultural diversity and/or cultural
           hybridity. Response is either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either different examples of cultural diversity and cultural hybridity
           • or how the two concepts are linked (how diversity gives rise to hybridity).

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “The largest transnational corporations (TNCs) have greater global power than
      national governments.” Discuss this statement.                                            [16]
      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to
      the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.
      The largest TNCs are global-scale businesses spanning all industrial sectors
      (from agribusiness to technology, eg Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google aka
      FANG). Global power is a broad concept encompassing both hard and soft
      forms of domination, ranging from military power to cultural and ideological influence
      (hegemony). The world’s national governments belong to countries ranging in
      scale from small island territories and city-states to large industrialized superpowers
      (USA). Many have significant military and economic strength. Some small countries
      may have great global influence but in narrow ways.
      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • global core and periphery patterns (1.1)
      • powerful countries and global groups (4.1)
      • roles of countries and TNCs in global networks and flows (4.2)
      • FDI and outsourcing by TNCs, including detailed examples (4.2)
      • TNCs and their social responsibility frameworks (5.1)
      • cultural landscape and built environment changes (5.2)
      • campaigns against TNCs by citizens (5.3)
      • tax-avoidance strategies of TNCs (6.1)
      • role of national governments in global risk management (6.3).

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of these themes in a
      well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement that examines the exercise of power at varying scales (eg TNC/state
      government influence over global, regional or more local issues). Another
      approach might be to critically examine how power remains concentrated in
      particular places in many different countries (state capitals, global hubs). Another
      approach might be to discuss how far either TNCs or national governments can
      drive different processes such as human development or global political, culture
      and normative changes.

      For 5–8 marks, expect some outlining of two relevant themes. Response is
      either partial, narrow or lacks supporting evidence.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.
