The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of
responses we may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible
answers should be appropriately rewarded if relevant.

1.       Define the term agency and describe how it can be understood and applied in the
         context of the passage.                                                                         [4]

         This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and
         understanding of the term “agency”, and apply it in relation to the text. Candidates may
         write in terms of any of the following guidelines, but other definitions or applications will
         also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the passage.

         Possible ways of defining the term:
         • Agency is the capacity of social actors to act freely in relation to social constraints.
         • Agency is the capacity of human beings to act in meaningful ways that affect their
           own lives and those of others.
         • Agency may be constrained by class, gender, religion and social and cultural
           factors.
         • Agency is the capacity to create, change and influence events.

         Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

 Marks Level descriptor

     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


     1–2     The response demonstrates a basic knowledge and understanding of the concept.

             There is a partial application of the concept in relation to the text.

     3–4     The response demonstrates sound knowledge and understanding of the concept; the
             concept is described in detail.

             The concept is clearly applied in relation to the text.

         Possible examples of description and application:
         • Artists and designers reinventing images and practices.
         • The public sharing of material which was previously regarded as private.
         • The way followers attribute agency to spirits.
         • Some may identify how certain followers are opposed to such freedoms and wish to
           assert a normative way of practicing the cult.

         Other appropriate applications should be credited.
                                                     –4–                 N21/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.       Analyse the ethnographic data presented in the passage using the concept of
         materiality.                                                                                 [6]

         This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
         ethnographic text using the key concept of materiality to help make sense of the
         ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
         understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the
         context of the passage, developing an analysis with reference to the ethnographic data
         of the extract.

         Possible ways of defining the key concept:
         • Objects, resources and belongings have cultural meaning and are embedded in all
           kinds of social relations and practices.
         • Some anthropologists think that human experience can be understood through the
           study of material objects.

         Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

         Possible examples and ways of analysing:
         • The images on Maria Lionza herself as The Queen and The Indian.
         • Other images on altars and how they convey a narrative of ongoing oppression.
         • How digital technology and smartphones have become important for practitioners,
           and how they have triggered changes in religious practice.
         • Controversy over use of chemicals in ritual.
         • Photographs.

         Other appropriate examples and ways of analyzing should be credited.

 Marks Level descriptor

     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


     1–2     The response offers a common-sense or superficial understanding of the key concept.

             There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some ethnographic
             examples are presented but these are only partially relevant.

     3–4     The response demonstrates an understanding of the key concept and establishes its
             relevance to the text.

             There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are some
             inconsistencies.

             Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the analysis.

     5–6     The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept, discussing this
             in the context of the text.

             There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a detailed
             interpretation of the ethnographic data.

             Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.
                                                  –5–                 N21/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of change or culture is
     evident in this passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you
     have studied.                                                                             [10]

     Candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other
     contexts and to draw explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must
     demonstrate an understanding of how either the key concept of change or culture
     relates to this ethnographic context. Either of the key concepts on which such
     comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any
     anthropological issues raised by the text.

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates
     should be able to establish a relevant comparison with any other group or society
     based on either of these concepts. The response should be structured as a
     comparison, highlighting similarities and differences. Candidates must situate the
     comparative case in terms of place, author and fieldwork context.

     For change, possible ways of defining the key concept include:
     • The alteration or modification of cultural or social elements in a society.
     • Change may be due to internal dynamics within a society, or the result of contact
       with another culture, or a consequence of globalization.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.

     Possible examples from the text about change may include:
     • The initial transformation from pre-colonial indigenous beliefs and practices via
       Catholic and African influences into a transnational cult
     • Focus on how change has come about in the cult as a result of digital technology
       and pressure from other religious movements and the state
     • The public sharing of private images
     • The use of social media to facilitate practice by followers living abroad
     • Contrasting views which try to assert an orthodoxy in the face of change.

     Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

     For culture, possible ways of defining the key concept include:
     • Culture refers to organized systems of symbols, ideas, explanations, beliefs and
       material production that humans create and manipulate in the course of their daily
       lives.
     • Culture includes the customs by which humans organize their physical world and
       maintain their social structure.
     • More recent approaches to culture recognize that cultures are not static,
       homogenous or bounded but dynamic and fluid.
     • Culture refers to the shared social construction of meanings, but simultaneously
       culture is often also a site of contested meanings.
     • These recent formulations of the concept recognize that culture may be the subject
       of disagreement and conflict within and among societies, and this disagreement may
       include the definition of culture itself.

     Other appropriate definitions should be credited.
                                            –6–                 N21/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Possible examples from the text about culture may include:
• Candidates may choose to focus on the cultural world in which the followers of
  Maria Lionza live and the way in which this is (re)created and manipulated.
• The use of altars to display a worldview which is then manipulated by ritual.
• The pre-colonial roots attributed to the cult and an ongoing narrative of oppression.
• The syncretic nature of the cult.
• Material culture.
• The contested meanings and practices of ritual.
• Questioning the concept of culture as “shared meanings and practices”.
• The shift from private to public.
• Openness to change and new technology.
• The transnational dimension of the cult.

Any other relevant point of comparison from the text may be used.

4.       Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in
         this passage to the approaches to research used by one other anthropologist you have
         studied. Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.               [10]

         Here, candidates are expected to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis
         on the methodological and theoretical perspectives of the ethnographer as the focus on
         which such comparisons should be established.

         By "approaches to research" the question essentially refers to the research methods
         used by the anthropologist to gather data.

         Possible comparative examples regarding approaches may include:
         • the use of a range of visual media to both research and present his data
         • that the anthropologist’s website produces collaborative material
         • a strong emic voice
         • the anthropologist’s identity as a practitioner may be discussed in terms of its impact
           on access, representation, and ethical issues.

         Any other relevant point of comparison used from the text should be credited.

         Identification of ethnographic material includes: fieldwork location(s), fieldwork
         context(s)*, group(s) studied, and ethnographer(s).

         *fieldwork context refers to when the fieldwork was carried out regardless of the
         publication date of the material.

             The identification of ethnographic material is missing.

     3–4     Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented and although this is in limited
             detail, its relevance is established.

             The response is structured as a compare and contrast, but this is not balanced and
             lacks detail.

             The identification of ethnographic material is partially complete.

     5–6     Comparative ethnography or approaches are presented; relevance is established and
             explained.

             The response is clearly structured as a compare and contrast; however, either comparison
             (similarities) or contrasts (differences) are explained in detail, but not both.

             The identification of ethnographic material is mostly complete.
                                                  –8–                  N21/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M
