                                                Section A

Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Accessing online media

     Rajesh frequently travels for his job and has found that he is unable to watch his favorite
     films and TV channels when abroad (see Figure 1). He has been informed that he can
     subscribe to an internet protocol television (IPTV) service or use a virtual private network
     (VPN) to stream or download this content.

                                Figure 1: An example of blocked content




                                      THIS TV CHANNEL OR FILM IS
                                        NOT AVAILABLE IN YOUR
                                          CURRENT LOCATION




     (a)   (i)     Identify two hardware devices that Rajesh could use to view his internet protocol
                   television (IPTV) channels.                                                               [2]

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of an IP address.                                            [2]

           (iii)   Rajesh is downloading a film for offline viewing. The download speed is 80 mbps.

                   Calculate the amount of data, in megabytes (MB), that will be downloaded in
                   10 minutes.                                                                               [2]

     (b)   (i)     Explain why Rajesh downloaded the films rather than streaming them when he
                   was travelling.                                                                           [4]

           (ii)    Rajesh has been told that subscribing to an internet protocol television (IPTV)
                   service may compromise his anonymity.

                   Distinguish between anonymity and privacy.                                                [2]

     (c)   To what extent is it acceptable for Rajesh to use services like a virtual private network
           (VPN) to access content that may be blocked in the country he is visiting?                        [8]




                                                                                                    Turn over

2.   Singapore shipping

     SingShip is a cargo shipping company based in Singapore. It transports goods between ports
     in Southeast Asia. The company is planning to expand its services to 10 more destinations.

     In SingShip’s head office, staff use a range of software, such as word processing, databases
     and spreadsheets (see Figure 2).

(Question 2 continued)

     (b)   (i)     Distinguish between data validation and data verification.                         [2]

           The product development life cycle (PDLC) was used to develop the database
           for SingShip.

           (ii)    Explain one advantage for SingShip of using a development methodology, such
                   as the product development life cycle (PDLC).                                      [2]

           (iii)   Explain one disadvantage for SingShip of using a development methodology,

     (c)   The head of IT at SingShip has recommended that all the information stored by
           the company in various spreadsheets should be integrated into a single
           relational database.

           Evaluate this decision.                                                                    [8]

3.     Smart farming

       A government in East Africa is using the expertise of scientists at a university in the region to
       promote the culture of smart farming and increase the productivity of farmers (see Figure 3).

                             Figure 3: An example of farming in East Africa




       The new smart farming system uses a mobile app1 that connects to a data logger2 using
       Bluetooth technology (see Figure 4).

                                    Figure 4: Example of a data logger




       The data collected by the app is sent to the university by lossless compression.

                                                 Section B

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Smart warehouse

     Greenwood Industries’ current warehouse uses a smart storage solution.

     The smart warehouse uses robots that automate the picking process. An expert system
     enables the robots to use the most efficient route for picking products (see Figure 5).

                      Figure 5: The Greenwood Industries smart storage solution




     In the future, the system could use fuzzy logic to determine the most appropriate container to
     use for shipping based on the type, number, size and weight of the product.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of a robot.                                             [2]

           (ii)    Identify two input devices the warehouse robots might have.                          [2]

           (iii)   Identify two characteristics of fuzzy logic.                                         [2]

     (b)   Greenwood Industries is considering using either a direct changeover method or a
           phased changeover method for the introduction of the next smart system.

           Analyse these options.                                                                       [6]

     (c)   Greenwood Industries is considering introducing artificial intelligence (AI) in the
           warehouse, rather than using the existing expert system, to select the most appropriate
           route for picking products.

           Discuss the implications of introducing an AI system to select the most appropriate
           route for picking products.                                                                  [8]

5.   Airport expert systems

     The managers at Kamchatka Airport have introduced expert systems to improve the
     efficiency of their airport. The expert system uses a decision tree* to assign gates to arriving
     and departing flights. This information is displayed on a flight information screen (see Figure 6).

           Figure 6: Flight information screen at Kamchatka Airport showing airplane gates

     The assigning of airport gates needs to be completed within a short time frame, as aircraft
     are constantly taking off and landing. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the form of either
     neural networks or machine learning could also be used to solve this scheduling problem.

(Question 5 continued)

     (b)   (i)    Assigning a gate for each airplane requires consideration of the following factors:
                  y Is there an airplane currently at the gate?
                  y Can the gate accommodate the size of the airplane?
                  y Is there a ground crew available to manage the arrival of the plane?

                  Using the information above, copy and construct a decision tree that can be
                  used as part of an expert system to determine if a gate is available for an
                  incoming airplane.                                                                    [2]

6.   Artificial intelligence (AI) predicts earthquakes

     Scientists at universities are developing a machine-learning system to detect the warning
     signs that an earthquake is likely to occur. Using pattern-recognition algorithms similar to
     those in image and speech recognition, the system would be able to predict earthquakes
     a few days before they occur. Using machine learning, researchers will be able to run
     earthquake analysis 500 times faster than they could previously.

     It is also possible to use machine learning to predict where the aftershocks* of an earthquake
     may occur (see Figure 7).

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of pattern recognition.                                   [2]

           (ii)    Outline one reason why it might be difficult to collect accurate data that can be
                   used for predicting earthquakes.                                                       [2]

     (b)   The scientists can choose to use either a PERT chart or a Gantt chart as a project
           management tool to develop the artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict aftershocks.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using machine learning to predict
           natural disasters like earthquakes.                                                            [8]
