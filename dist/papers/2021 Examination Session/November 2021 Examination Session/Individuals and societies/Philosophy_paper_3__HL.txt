Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

Compare and contrast the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the text below, with your
own experience and understanding of what is involved in doing philosophy [25 marks].

                                               What is philosophy?

               Professional philosophers find it difficult to define philosophy. The meaning of “philosophy”
        is “the love of wisdom”, which covers just about everything; philosophy encompasses the study
        of science, and art, and language – for most subjects there will be a “philosophy of” that subject.
               In philosophy, we learn to identify, and think carefully about, our most basic ideas and
    5   theories – those that support all the questing for knowledge we do in other subject areas.
        We look behind our everyday concerns to examine the systems and structures which support
        our thinking and to test their soundness.
               Because of this distinctive approach it is often easier to capture the nature of philosophy
        by providing examples of “doing philosophy” rather than defining its field of study. This helps
   10   us to appreciate how philosophy has a distinctive contribution to make to our knowledge and
        understanding of the world.
               In studying philosophy, we learn to take a step back from our everyday thinking, and to
        explore the deeper, bigger questions which underpin our thought. We learn to identify hidden
        connections and flawed reasoning, and we seek to develop our thinking and theories so that
   15   they are less prone to such errors, gaps and inconsistencies. This is a vital contribution to
        human knowledge.
               Studying philosophy sharpens your analytical abilities, enabling you to identify and
        evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in any position. It also hones your ability to construct
        and articulate cogent arguments of your own. It prompts you to work across disciplinary
   20   boundaries, and to think flexibly and creatively about problems which do not present immediate
        solutions. Because philosophy is an activity as much as a body of knowledge, it also develops
        your ability to think and work independently.
               Different schools of philosophy have argued for systems which colour every aspect of
        human life in highly contrasted ways. You will view the universe and the place of humanity
   25   within it differently if you are an atheist rather than a theist; if you believe that all our knowledge
        is derived from experience rather than from a combination of experience and reason; or if you
        believe that our will is completely determined by causal laws rather than capable of its own
        free action. Even if you suspend judgement on such issues your study of them will leave you
        enriched with an understanding of the complexity of the physical and human sciences which
   30   students of other disciplines may lack.
               Knowing about the great philosophical thinkers of the past and their theories is naturally
        a crucial element and as in any discipline, it is important to develop a thorough understanding
        of key topics. However, philosophy is much more than the history of ideas. How you analyse
        the theories discussed, and how you structure your own arguments in response. […] you
   35   are learning to do philosophy, not just learning about it, and you can best do this by actually
        venturing your own arguments [...] you need to develop your ideas not in a vacuum, but
        informed by the philosophical theories of others – you should try to philosophize, not just to
        learn about philosophers. This is the key distinguishing feature of doing philosophy – success
        consists not just in absorbing knowledge, but in developing and demonstrating your own critical
   40   understanding of, and interaction with, the issues in question.
                                                   –3–                                           8821 – 5603


               The stress is on philosophy as an activity and a process rather than just on the product.
         You learn the philosophical virtues of unearthing and examining hidden assumptions; of
         detecting conceptual confusions and clarifying them; of revealing and resolving contradictions;
         and so on.
    45         Often there are no perfect solutions to philosophical problems. Some answers may be
         better argued for, or better equip us to deal with other issues, but none hold a permanent, fixed,
         uncontested place in the thinking of all philosophers. So we need to understand that philosophy
         has the potential to change the way we think about ourselves, the world and everything in it.
         This involves challenging ideas and theories to see how they work, or might even be developed.
