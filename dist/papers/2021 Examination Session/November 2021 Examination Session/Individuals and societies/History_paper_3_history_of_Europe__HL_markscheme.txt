Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   Evaluate the effectiveness of Henry II’s policies in England and Ireland.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of Henry II’s policies.
     Candidates may outline the issues that Henry was trying to resolve; these could include the
     reassertion of royal authority and later to improve the legal system and administration of England.
     There may be some evaluation of his conflict with the Church. In Ireland his aim was to extend
     English control to provide an inheritance for John; strong Royal power was established in the east
     although some native kings remained. In England, he succeeded in controlling the barons,
     demolishing unlicensed castles and building new royal castles. His justiciars and sheriffs extended
     his control of law and order in England and he was very successful in restoring royal finances. He
     was less successful in controlling the Church after Becket’s murder: he had to concede on the
     legal notion of “benefit of clergy”. However, he did keep significant control of Church appointments.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


2.   Evaluate the success of Richard I and John against the French in Normandy.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the relative success of both kings
     against the French. Both were trying to maintain Angevin power in the Duchy of Normandy. There
     may be some evaluation of methods used, such as Richard fighting a war of attrition and securing
     regained territory by building fortresses such as Chateau Gaillard. He also used diplomacy to gain
     allies such as the Count of Flanders. By the time of his death, he had regained most of the territory
     that had been lost to France. However, it could be argued that he did not regain all of the territory
     and Phillip’s military threat remained strong. Initially, John was able to come to terms with Phillip
     and accepted his conquest of the Evrecin. However, John’s subsequent actions, such as his
     marriage to Isabella of Angouleme, led to renewed conflict. His treatment of Arthur of Brittany
     destroyed the alliance with Flanders. His misrule in the Duchy and the cost of war alienated the
     Norman barons. After the battle of Bouvines in 1214, Angevin power in Normandy was destroyed.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   To what extent did Christian doctrine and teaching contribute to the growth of anti-Muslim hostility?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     Christian doctrine and teaching contributed to the growth of anti-Muslim hostility. Candidates may
     refer to the growing hostility noticeable during the Crusades in many letters, comments and
     polemical texts produced by the Church that described Muslims as heretics, as divine punishment
     and/or as the enemies of the Christian world. The intellectual activity in universities also involved
     discussions of the Quran to show what the Christian considered errors and tricks. Candidates may
     also consider the teaching activities of priests and monks who spread those ideas in different
     European cities. Candidates may challenge the question, arguing that Christian doctrine and
     teachings did not reach a majority of the population. They may also argue that the Crusades and
     the desire to gain power and resources were the main reasons for the hostility, not necessarily
     Christian doctrine. Candidates may point out that many Christian and Muslim communities
     coexisted for a long time and many Christian kings established diplomatic relations with Muslim
     authorities regardless of the Church’s complaints. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   Evaluate the impact of the persecution of Jews on intellectual and cultural life.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the persecution of Jews
     on intellectual and cultural life. Candidates may refer to the consequences the persecution had in
     the life of many Christian courts, where some Jewish ambassadors, physicians, astronomers,
     writers and musicians were expelled. Candidates may also highlight that due to the persecution
     many Christian kingdoms lost Jewish accountants and tax collectors who worked for the crown,
     offering their knowledge in mathematics. The persecution of Jews also provoked the expulsion of
     multilingual people required to translate the ancient works and those from the Arabic world. Other
     factors may be addressed, for example the fact that the persecution especially targeted rabbis,
     philosophers and writers, leaving the Jewish communities without their intellectual guides.
     Candidates may argue that impact was limited, as the policies against Jewish communities were
     not always applied consistently. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   “Richard II was deposed in 1399 because of his poor governance.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that Richard II was deposed because of his poor governance. There may be reference to his
     mistakes such as the imposition of the Poll Tax (arguably he was still a minor at this point); his
     levelling of arbitrary fines; the redrafting of royal charters to increase his power was also
     unpopular. His reliance on favourites such as de Vere and his exaggerated view of the extent of his
     power caused discontent with the barons and Parliament. By 1386/87, there were attempts to
     remove his favourites such as de la Pole by the Lords Appellant, however, by 1389 Richard had
     reassumed control of the government. Subsequently his harsh treatment of the Lords Appellant
     with the deaths of Gloucester and Arundel and the exiling of Bolingbroke undermined support
     amongst the magnates. His seizure of the Lancastrian inheritance in 1399 led to Bolingbroke’s
     return with a small army. There is much evidence to support the statement, but it could also be
     argued that his failure in Ireland was the key factor that weakened his hold on the throne and
     contributed to Bolingbroke’s success. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   To what extent was diplomacy the main reason why Louis XI was able to extend French power?

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
     Louis XI was able to extend French power. To agree with the statement, it could be argued that
     Louis XI used diplomacy to isolate Charles the Bold from England (Treaty of Picquiny 1475) and to
     regain territory on the Somme (Treaty of Arras). Some candidates may argue that it was the strong
     centralized government established by Louis XI that reduced Burgundian influence in France, and
     Burgundian military failure (like the siege of Beauvais) also contributed to the extension of French
     power. Chance was also a factor in that the death of Charles the Bold at Nancy and Mary’s
     marriage to Maximilian led to Burgundy turning towards the Habsburgs and losing interest in
     France. Candidates might challenge the statement to some extent by arguing that in fact it was a
     combination of all the above factors that enabled the French to withstand Burgundian influence and
     eventually extend French power in border territories. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   “Lorenzo de’ Medici was the most significant patron of the arts in 15th-century Italy.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement with
     respect to the patronage of Lorenzo de’ Medici. To agree with the statement, responses may refer
     to the “Golden Age of Lorenzo” and make specific reference to artists he patronized like da Vinci,
     Michelangelo, Botticelli. He was also an important patron of literature, expanding the Medici library
     established by his father. He supported the development of Humanism, supporting many scholars
     in this area. His funding of many public projects also enhanced his reputation as a Renaissance
     man. Candidates may also argue that Ludovico Sforza, who was a patron of da Vinci and others
     such as Donato Bramante, was also significant. Sforza supported the completion of Milan
     Cathedral and the universities of both Milan and Pavia, making Milan an important intellectual
     centre. There may also be some discussion of papal patronage and patronage in other Italian cities
     such as Venice and Ferrara. Some candidates may also point out that recently, historians have
     argued that the importance of Lorenzo de’ Medici has been overstated. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   “Trade was the most important factor in the development of the Northern Renaissance in Burgundy
     and Germany.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
     trade in the development of the Northern Renaissance. To agree with the statement, it may be
     argued that trade between Italy and Northern Europe was the main means of disseminating ideas
     that emerged in Italy. There may also be discussion of the concept of cultural exchange. However,
     with regard to the Northern Renaissance some may argue that the Reformation and the weakening
     of feudalism were particularly important in the spread and acceptance of new ideas. This could be
     supported by referring to the fact that the Reformation led to major developments in art with the
     decline of religious paintings and the emergence of secular paintings and landscapes. There may
     also be some discussion of the increasing availability of books which helped spread understanding
     of ideas such as Humanism, as well as the importance of key thinkers such as Erasmus. Some
     may reach the conclusion that it was a combination of factors that stimulated the emergence of the
     Northern Renaissance and that no single factor was dominant. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                   N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “The quest for knowledge was the main motive for exploration in the 15th century.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the quest for knowledge was the main motive for exploration in the 15th century. Candidates
      may support the statement, arguing that some of the most important explorers were interested in
      collecting knowledge about lands, flora and fauna, and peoples living far away from Europe.
      Candidates may also discuss that many voyages of exploration were to establish, or not, the
      existence of a number of legendary places. Candidates may challenge the statement, stating that
      the search for luxury items such as silk and cotton, spices, jewellery and oriental goods was the
      main motive for the exploration. The need for food, raw materials and territory for an increasing
      population could be also considered as a motive. Candidates may also argue that exploration was
      triggered by political and economic competition among European kingdoms and/or the
      technological and scientific advances in navigation. Candidates may also highlight that other
      factors could have played a significant role as a motive for the exploration, such as the desire to
      spread Christian beliefs. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Examine the impact of the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) in reducing political conflicts in Europe.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Treaty of
      Tordesillas and political conflicts in Europe. Candidates may state that the Treaty of Tordesillas
      divided the newly discovered lands into distinct spheres of influence for each kingdom, enabling a
      clear partition. Candidates may also point out that the treaty helped to amend a series of Papal
      bulls that dissatisfied Portugal, thus improving its position and reducing conflict with Spain.
      However, candidates may argue that since the exploration continued the Treaty of Tordesillas had
      limited effect. Candidates may also refer to the fact that other European powers did not accept the
      treaty and pursued their own voyages of exploration and conquest, causing new disagreements.
      Candidates may also state that the Treaty of Tordesillas was not enough to stop the conflicts since
      new treaties, like the Treaty of Saragossa (1529), were needed. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –9–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (c1500–1563)

11.   Examine the role played by Frederick the Wise in the spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the role played by
      Frederick the Wise and the spread of Lutheran ideas in Germany. Candidates may examine the
      close relationship Frederick had with Luther as he protected him from the Pope and the Emperor.
      He took Luther into custody at Wartburg Castle and refused to send him to Rome to be judged.
      Candidates may also point out that Frederick the Wise supported Luther to enable him to continue
      his intellectual work and the translation of the Bible. Frederick the Wise also allowed Luther to be
      heard before the Diet of Worms in 1521 where he explained his ideas. Candidates may address
      other relevant factors, for example that Frederick the Wise was the founder and protector of the
      University of Wittenberg, an important intellectual centre for the Reformation movement.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


12.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the Roman Inquisition in support of the Counter Reformation.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the Roman
      Inquisition in support of the Counter Reformation. The Roman Inquisition was a system of tribunals
      developed by the Roman Catholic Church to prosecute those accused of crimes relating to
      religious doctrine or alternative religious beliefs. Candidates may evaluate its effectiveness in
      prosecuting heresy, Protestantism, sorcery, blasphemy, Judaism and witchcraft. Candidates may
      also discuss the effectiveness of the Roman Inquisition in the censorship of printed literature that
      promoted ideas hostile to the Church. Candidates may also evaluate the efficiency the tribunals of
      the Roman Inquisition had in geographical terms. They may consider the relations the Holy See
      established with different rulers, who allowed the Inquisition to act in their territories, in regions
      under papal jurisdiction and/or specially influenced by Rome such as Italy and Malta. Candidates
      may also measure the limited effectiveness the Roman Inquisition had in northern Europe where
      the spread of Protestantism was wider. Candidates may also argue that Roman Inquisition policies
      were more focused on pre-emptive control than punishment. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Compare and contrast the nature of the rule of two absolutist monarchs.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the rule
      of two absolutist monarchs; these can be contemporary absolutist monarchs from different
      countries, or they may choose to focus on two monarchs from a single country. When discussing
      the nature of their rule, areas to consider may be the extent to which these monarchs harshly
      treated potential critics or the extent to which they relied on the support of key institutions such as
      the Church to maintain their rule. There may also be reference to the extent to which the monarchs
      taxed their subjects in order to support extravagant lifestyles or to fund reforms. Depending on the
      chosen exemplars, there may be consideration of the use of the army to maintain control. Some
      candidates may discuss how absolutist monarchs used their power to modernize their state, for
      example Peter the Great, whereas others such as Louis XV did little to modernize France. There
      may or may not be a balance of similarities and differences. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Examine the impact of monarchical patronage on the Baroque movement.

      The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between monarchical
      patronage and the Baroque movement which impacted many areas of the arts including
      architecture, art, music, dance. Some may argue that monarchical patronage was immensely
      important particularly for Baroque architecture, citing Louis XIV and Versailles, Frederick II’s palace
      of Sans Souci, or in Russia the Peterhof and Winter Palace as classic examples of Baroque
      architecture. Monarchs also supported the making of furniture in the Baroque style as well as the
      manufacture of porcelain to furnish their palaces. Similarly, monarchs throughout Europe were
      important in supporting the careers of Baroque composers such as Bach, Handel and Purcell
      amongst others. However, some argue that in the case of architecture particularly, the Church was
      equally important. There may be reference to the large number of Baroque churches to be found
      throughout Italy from Venice (Santa Maria della Salute) to southern Italy (Palermo Cathedral).
      Similarly, in Spain the Church’s response to the Reformation saw the building of churches in the
      Baroque style to inspire awe and devotion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported with appropriate evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   Discuss the reasons why France became a republic, with reference to the period 1789–1792.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the key reasons
      that France became a republic by 1792. Candidates should consider the original demands of
      1788/89 which were for reform of the monarchy and constitutional system. The National Assembly
      formed after the Tennis Court Oath was largely moderate. Some may discuss the importance of a
      radical populace, especially in Paris, where demands for an improved standard of living had led to
      the storming of the Bastille. The impact of the behaviour of Louis XVI could be discussed; he
      reluctantly signed the 1791 Constitution and the flight to Varennes increased support for
      Republicanism. Another factor increasing support for Republicanism was the emergence of radical
      groups, especially the Jacobins, whose support base were the sans-culottes of Paris. The
      continuing economic crisis and the unstable currency (the assignat) and fear of foreign invasion
      (Brunswick Manifesto) also increased support for a republic. The Jacobins staged a coup in August
      1792 and a republic was declared in September 1792. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   “Napoleon I’s domestic policies had a significant impact on French society.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement suggesting that
      Napoleon I had a major impact on French society. Candidates may argue that he built on the
      Revolution and brought about significant administrative change in France; establishing the Bank of
      France and the départements system all contributed to a more stable society. Some might also
      argue that the Code Napoleon and the educational reforms (lycées) all had a major impact on
      society, removing the last remnants of the Ancien Régime. To disagree with the statement, it could
      be argued that the Code was patriarchal and that education reforms did little for the poor or
      women. With the formation of the Empire, a new elite was established with titles (many for
      members of his own family or his generals) and honours which mirrored the past. Arguably, the
      social structure in Napoleonic France was rather like the past but with a more effective central
      power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   “Napoleon III’s foreign policy was a complete failure.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement about the
      problems of Napoleon III’s foreign policy. Candidates may choose to discuss his foreign policy
      aims. These could include the overthrow of the Vienna Settlement, restoring France’s great power
      status, extending French territory in Europe and overseas and some military glory. It could be
      argued that he was quite successful in the 1850s, citing the Crimean War and Treaty of Paris,
      intervention in Italy and some expansion in the Middle East and Far East. However, some might
      argue that Italian unification alienated Austria and weakened French influence in the
      Mediterranean. Britain was also suspicious of France’s ambitions in the Middle East and Russia
      was angry over his support of Polish nationalism. The policies of the 1860s were more clearly
      unsuccessful; the Mexican adventure alienated Austria. France gained nothing from the Austro-
      Prussian War despite the Biarritz meeting. His ambitions in Europe (Luxemburg) alienated Britain.
      The declaration of war against Prussia led to the collapse of his empire. By 1870, France was
      isolated in Europe and the Vienna Settlement remained largely intact. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Examine the reasons why the Third Republic was able to survive crises in the period 1871–1890.

      The question requires that candidates examine the various crises and identify the key reasons why
      they were resolved. One key reason was the support of moderate politicians for a moderate
      republic. Thiers was willing to act ruthlessly to suppress the Commune: he moved the government
      to Versailles to protect it and sent in government troops. He also worked to prevent a restoration of
      the monarchy; this was prevented because Chambord refused to abandon the Bourbon flag. By
      1875, the Wallon Amendment ensured that France remained a Republic. There were further right-
      wing threats, for example from the republic of Dukes, from Boulangism and after the Wilson
      Scandal. In each of these cases, the threat was resisted by unity between moderates and the left.
      Some may argue that the Republic survived because politically it was relatively stable, the same
      cohort of politicians made up the frequently changing governments who were able to resolve
      threats. It could also be argued that as a nation the population was largely conservative and
      wanted continuity and stability. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   “Social and economic factors were the main reasons for the growth of the Chartist movement.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the various
      reasons for the growth of Chartism including social and economic factors. To agree with the
      statement candidates may examine the various phases of the growth of Chartism and argue that
      they coincided with economic problems and a decline in living standards. Candidates may discuss
      that unemployment was often an immediate cause for Chartist protests but there were also social
      factors such as appalling working conditions (Newport Rising) and anger at the impact of the 1834
      Poor Law Amendment Act. The fact that Chartism declined in the 1850s as Britain became more
      prosperous and the positive impact of some of Peel’s reforms could also support this opinion.
      Candidates may argue that political factors were more important during the first phase of Chartism
      as support grew because of disappointment with the 1832 Parliamentary Reform Act, as is
      reflected by the demands in the Charter. The collapse of Trade Unionism after the Tolpuddle
      Martyrs in 1834 and trial of union leaders in Glasgow 1837 meant that many trade unionists joined
      the Chartist movement, and this could be seen as a political factor. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the impact of social reforms on Victorian society c1840–c1900.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of various social reforms on
      Victorian society. Social reforms could include reforms to improve working conditions in various
      industries, education reforms and reforms that improved health and housing conditions.
      Candidates may evaluate key legislation when discussing the impact of reforms. These could
      include the various Mines and Factory Acts throughout the period, the Public Health Act 1848,
      Sanitation Act 1866, the Artisans Dwellings Act 1875 and two acts to deal with working class
      housing in 1890 and 1900. Various education acts could be evaluated; Forster’s Act 1870,
      Sandon’s in 1876 and Mundella’s in 1880 Some may argue that social reforms led to a steady
      improvement in living and working conditions and better public health by 1900. There was
      sanitation and clean water supplies in urban areas. Most children attended elementary school and
      there was some improvement in working conditions. Others might argue that the impact was quite
      limited and that by 1900, 30% of the population were still living in poverty and poor housing. The
      Booth and Rowntree Reports support this evaluation. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   “Cavour’s political skills were the most significant factor in the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy
      by 1861.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      Cavour’s political skills in establishing the Kingdom of Italy. Candidates may discuss Cavour’s
      policies in Piedmont and how he diplomatically strengthened the state and gained allies (Pact of
      Plombieres). He used his political skills to convince the Central Duchies to vote to join Piedmont.
      He realized that Piedmont would have to unite with Southern Italy and the Papal states to prevent
      a republic or foreign intervention to protect the Papacy. Candidates may argue that his willingness
      to do so when he would have possibly preferred a strong Northern Italian kingdom was significant
      in the formation of Kingdom of Italy. Others might argue that it was the actions of Garibaldi in Sicily
      and Naples that was the major factor in establishing the Kingdom of Italy. His successful expedition
      to Sicily and the threat to the Papal States caused Cavour and Victor Emmanuel to consider the
      idea of greater unification. It could be argued that Garibaldi abandoned his hope for a republic
      because of the opportunity to establish a unified Kingdom. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   To what extent did the establishment of the Zollverein lead to the decline of Austria and the rise
      of Prussia?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      Zollverein led to the decline of Austria and rise of Prussia. To agree with the statement, candidates
      may refer to Prussian dominance in the Zollverein; this led to closer links with other German states
      and a reduction in Austrian influence. Prussia became the obvious leader for those nationalists
      wishing for a Kleindeutschland. To partially agree with the statement, candidates may argue that
      Austria was protectionist and unwilling to join the Zollverein, but also that internal problems within
      the empire, such as Italian and Hungarian nationalism, distracted Austria from the German
      Confederation. Candidates may state that Prussia was potentially stronger than Austria. Prussia
      had gained major resources because of the Vienna Settlement, whereas Austria had little industry
      and limited potential for industrial growth. It could also be argued that Prussia had been willing to
      accept Austrian influence in the Confederation, but that changed during the 1850s, as Bismarck
      became an advocate for Kleindeutschland. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and be supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   To what extent had Russia’s economy been modernized by 1914 under Alexander III and
      Nicholas II?

      The question requires the that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Russia had a modern economy by 1914. Candidates may argue that both Tsars continued the
      process of economic modernization begun by Alexander II. There could be discussion of policies to
      expand industry (Witte and Stolypin), expand the railways and stabilize the currency. Attempts
      were made to increase agricultural production by such policies as the reduction of the Poll Tax and
      Stolypin’s Agrarian Reforms, but production levels remained very low by 1914. When considering
      other areas, such as railways, candidates may point out that there was slow growth up to 1890
      then rapid expansion, but Russia still lacked a system that covered the whole country. Russia was
      still behind other major powers in terms of production levels (steel production in 1910 was 3300
      tons). Industries such as textiles (40% of industrial output) were important and industry relied
      heavily on foreign investment. Candidates may argue that while there was significant industrial
      growth, the economy remained unbalanced and reliant on a weak agricultural sector which was
      70–80% of economic activity. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   “The causes of the October/November Revolution were the same as those of the February/March
      Revolution.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the causes of the two
      1917 revolutions were the same. To agree with the statement, responses should discuss similar
      causes, such as war weariness and continuing defeat; weak, ineffectual governments (comparing
      the Tsarist government with the Provisional Government); continuing economic crises and food
      shortages. Candidates may argue that the period between the two revolutions saw continued
      revolutionary unrest (July Days), with increasing support for revolutionary parties such as the
      Bolsheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries (SRs). To partially challenge the statement,
      candidates may discuss the differing nature of the two revolutions, with February/March being a
      spontaneous revolution when various demonstrations and strikes coalesced (International
      Women's Day, Putilov Steelworks strike and food protests); whereas October/November was a
      planned seizure of power by the Bolsheviks. It could also be argued that the aims of the two
      revolutions were different in February/March when there was a demand for moderate reform and
      effective government; whereas in October/November increasing support for the Bolsheviks
      indicated a demand for more radical change. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   Examine the influence of German foreign policy on the major European powers between 1890
      and 1908.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between German foreign
      policy and other European states. Major powers include Britain, France, Russia and Austria-
      Hungary. Candidates may examine how the change from Bismarck’s foreign policy to one of
      Weltpolitik influenced other powers. Candidates may examine how the unpredictable nature of
      German policy in the 1890’s drew Britain out of isolation (Kruger telegram, Naval Laws,
      colonialism) and into closer relations with France and Russia. German actions in Morocco
      strengthened this relationship. In the case of France, increased suspicion of Germany led to an
      alliance with Russia in 1894. France was also keen to seek agreement with Britain in 1904. In the
      case of Russia, the end of the Reinsurance Treaty led to the Dual Alliance. German support of
      Austria-Hungary in the Balkans drew Russia towards an alliance with Britain, as well as France.
      For Austria-Hungary, it could be argued that German support emboldened their Balkan policy
      (Bosnia 1908). Candidates may argue that a consequence of German foreign policy was that
      Europe was divided into two increasingly militarized blocs. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence.


26.   Examine the contribution of diplomatic failure in July 1914 to the outbreak of the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between diplomacy and the
      outbreak of war in 1914. Candidates may examine the events of 1914 and argue that diplomatic
      failure during the July Crisis led to war. Others may examine longer-term causes as well. There
      may be reference to the unpalatable Austrian ultimatum, the Blank Cheque and the telegrams
      between Kaiser Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II. There may also be an examination of Britain’s lack
      of clarity regarding the crisis, especially how far she would support France or keep promises to
      Belgium (Treaty of London). Other factors that led to war were the German desire for war before
      Russia had fully modernized her army. Candidates may refer to Austria also wanting a local war to
      weaken Serbia’s position in the Balkans. Other relevant interrelationships may be considered, for
      example that the Russian General Staff wanted full mobilization, leading to German mobilization
      and the implementation of the Schlieffen Plan. It could also be argued that the broader context of
      the Alliance system made war very likely and that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was the
      “spark” that led to war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be clearly presented and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

27.   “The Weimar Republic was able to overcome threats to its survival between 1918 and 1923
      because it had the support of the German people.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      the Weimar Republic survived the crises of its first five years. Candidates may argue that the
      republic did not have popular support, as many Germans disliked the Treaty of Versailles, and that
      the crises were attempts to destroy the republic (the Spartacist Revolt, Kapp Putsch and Munich
      Putsch). These crises should be discussed with reference to how they were survived for indications
      of support. For example, the army was willing to protect the republic from left-wing revolution (and
      the Freikorps were used to crush the Spartacists). To agree with the statement, candidates may
      argue that electoral support for moderate Weimar parties was greater than support for left and right
      parties that wanted to destroy the republic. Other evidence of popular support could be the general
      strike in Berlin that ended the Kapp Putsch. Candidates may also argue that the Weimar Republic
      could ultimately rely on backing from the Allies who did not want either a left-wing revolution or a
      possible restoration of the monarchy. Candidate’s opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   “Franco won the Spanish Civil War because of Republican disunity.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Franco won the Spanish Civil War because of Republican disunity. Candidates may refer to the
      lack of continuity in leadership because of tensions within the Popular Front. Giral, Caballero and
      Negrin were all prime minister for a short period. Divisions within the Republican side also
      undermined their military efforts (May Days, Barcelona). Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example that foreign intervention supporting Franco was a key factor. He had military support
      from Hitler and Mussolini and arguably the Non-Intervention Pact disadvantaged the Republicans
      as France and Britain upheld it. The limited military aid the Republic had, ended with the
      withdrawal of the International Brigades in 1938. Candidates may argue that Franco’s effective
      leadership was the main reason for victory. By April 1937, he had unified all right-wing parties into
      the FET y de las JONS and had the loyalty of his troops and the support of the Church.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Mussolini’s foreign policy between 1922 and 1941.

      The question requires that candidates should weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of
      Mussolini’s foreign policy between 1922 and 1941. Candidates may refer to Mussolini’s foreign
      policy falling into two distinct periods, with the 1920s and early 1930s being largely successful. The
      second and more aggressive period ultimately led to involvement in the Second World War and
      defeat for Italy. Successful policies were settling the issue of Fiume, treaties with Austria and
      Hungary, Locarno and forming the Stresa Front. Arguably the Corfu Incident was largely a failure
      as it raised tensions with other powers. From 1935 onwards, Mussolini’s foreign policy drew
      Mussolini closer to Nazi Germany. There could be an evaluation of the Abyssinian Crisis, the
      Rome–Berlin Axis and intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The Pact of Steel and the invasion of
      Albania tied Italy more closely to Germany. Entry into the war in 1940 and actions in Greece and
      North Africa were disastrous for Italy and contributed to Mussolini’s eventual overthrow in 1943.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported with appropriate
      evidence.


30.   Examine the reasons why the invasion of Poland in 1939 developed into a major European war
      by 1941.

      The question requires candidates to consider the interrelationship between the invasion of Poland
      and the expansion into a Europe-wide war by 1941. Candidates may examine why Britain and
      France declared war on Germany and also why Hitler did not believe in their guarantees to Poland.
      Candidates may refer to Hitler invading Poland because the Nazi-Soviet Pact meant that he would
      not have to face a war on two fronts. By 3 September 1939, three major powers were at war, but
      conflict was limited. There may be some examination of how conflict spread in 1940 with Blitzkrieg
      attacks on the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway and the fall of France. After Dunkirk, Britain
      continued to fight with aid from the US (“Cash and Carry” and Lend Lease), Britain's refusal to
      discuss peace meant that war continued. Candidates may refer to Italian campaigns in the Balkans
      which extended the conflict to the Mediterranean. Some may argue that early successes meant
      that Hitler felt confident enough to launch Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, thus facing a war on
      two fronts and hugely increasing the scale of the conflict. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   “The defeat of Trotsky was the most significant factor in Stalin’s rise to power up to 1929.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the defeat of Trotsky
      was the most significant factor in Stalin’s rise to power up to 1929. Candidates may refer to the
      rivalry that existed between Stalin and Trotsky, dating back to the Civil War; and Stalin’s perception
      that Trotsky was the most likely heir to Lenin and so the main obstacle to be overcome.
      Candidates may discuss the emergence of factions that began with Trotsky's opposition to the
      NEP, and how their later piecemeal defeat by Stalin led to his dominance of the Politburo.
      Candidates may challenge the statement by discussing other factors such as Stalin using his
      position as General Secretary of the Party to present himself as the favoured heir through the Cult
      of Lenin, he also had the support of the Lenin Enrolment. Other relevant factors may be discussed
      such as the popularity of policies like “Socialism in One Country”, that gained Stalin support among
      the workers in the cities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   “The failure of his domestic policies was the main reason for Khrushchev’s removal from power in
      1964.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the main reason for
      Khrushchev’s removal from power in 1964 was the failure of his domestic policies. Candidates may
      refer to Khrushchev’s failed agricultural policies such as the “Virgin Lands” project and the
      expansion of grain planting into unsuitable regions, leading to harvest failure necessitating the
      importing of grain from the US. Discussion may be made of Khrushchev’s focus on greater
      availability of consumer goods and the building of khrushchyovka that significantly increased the
      supply of housing but also provided private space for increased criticism of the state. Candidates
      may argue that of greater importance to his removal from power were Khrushchev’s controversial
      foreign policies that included: peaceful co-existence with the West; confrontation over Berlin;
      worsening relations with China; the placing of missiles on Cuba. Other reasons may include
      lingering resentment over Khrushchev’s suppression of the Anti Party Group and that his attempts
      to streamline the Party weakened his position. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   Evaluate the political responses to post-war economic challenges in France up to 1963.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the political responses to post-war
      economic challenges in France up to 1963. Candidates may refer to the impact of wartime
      occupation and liberation on industry and infrastructure and the response to the immense
      challenge of economic recovery. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the Monnet Plan with its
      elements of a planned economy and expansion of public ownership. The political response to the
      Marshall Plan and the subsequent marginalization of the French Communist Party may be
      evaluated. Candidates may argue that the political response to French dependence on German
      coal was the Schuman Plan that laid the basis for further European integration. An evaluation may
      be made of “Les Trente Glorieuses”, a period of rapid economic growth in post-war France that
      resulted in increased wages and a higher standard of living but also of inflation, a challenge to
      successive coalition governments that held power during this period. Also of relevance would be
      the economic challenges posed by the funding of colonial wars in Indochina and Algeria with links
      made to the re-emergence of De Gaulle and the establishment of the Fifth Republic. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   With reference to the period 1949–1990, examine the impact of social and cultural change in
      West Germany.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between society, culture and change in West
      Germany during the period 1949–1990. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and cultural
      change or they may prioritize one over the other. However, both aspects will feature in the
      response. For cultural change, candidates may examine the impact of post-war denazification on
      the work of such authors as Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass and the films of Reiner Werner
      Fassbinder. The social impact of anti-communism may also be examined, it led to the provision of
      health care, education and improved workers’ rights to demonstrate the benefits of a welfare state
      in a free-market economy. Candidates may examine the impact of immigration into West Germany,
      from East Germany during the 1950s and from countries such as Turkey throughout the period,
      noting the changing status of gastarbeiter to that of full citizens. The social and cultural changes of
      the 1960s, specifically the “68ers” with the emergence of radical groups such as the Baader
      Meinhoff Group, could be examined. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Evaluate the impact of repression and protest between 1945 and 1968 in one of the following
      countries: East Germany; Poland; Hungary; Czechoslovakia.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of repression and protest
      between 1945 and 1968 in one of the named countries. Candidates may refer to the Show Trials of
      1948 that were held in each of these countries and to consider the impact of such randomized
      repression on possible protest movements against the Soviet-backed authorities. In East Germany,
      the steady migration of skilled workers to West Germany during the 1950s may be evaluated and
      seen as a safety valve after the repression of the 1953 protests. In Poland and Hungary, the
      impact of the 1956 “Secret Speech” at the 20th Party Congress may be evaluated and its impetus
      for protest and reform balanced against subsequent repression. For Czechoslovakia, the Prague
      Spring may be evaluated with its aspiration for reform being met with repression. Common to all
      the named countries was the widespread use of secret police and the swift repression of all forms
      of protest, although candidates may discuss protest in the form of the covert distribution of illicit
      literature and radios being tuned into foreign broadcasts, for example the Voice of America.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


36.   Evaluate the response to political challenges in the post-communist era in one Central or Eastern
      European country (excluding Russia).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the response to political challenges in
      the post-communist era in one Central or Eastern European country, excluding Russia. Candidates
      may refer to the challenge of writing new constitutions to embrace democratic principles alongside
      the need to remove entrenched systems and politicians who remained in place after the transition
      from Communism. Candidates may evaluate responses to such challenges by referring, for
      example, to an end to press censorship; the establishment of rule by law; and opportunities for
      citizens to freely express their political views. In former Soviet republics, such as the Baltic States,
      the rights of Russian minorities needed to be addressed and candidates may evaluate the
      response to citizenship being linked, for instance, to language tests. The response to the recovery
      of the memory of events, suppressed by Communist regimes, may be evaluated with reference
      made to the erection or removal of statues, the memorialization of the oppressed and the
      establishment of “museums of the occupation”. Candidates may also evaluate political responses
      to the challenges posed by the replacement of state-owned industries with private enterprise.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
