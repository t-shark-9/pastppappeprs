                                               Section A

1.   (a)   State two features of a sole trader.                                                  [2]

           Award [1] for each feature identified – no reference to Jill’s gloves is needed:

                      ▪   Unincorporated/unlimited liability
                      ▪   No legal continuity
                      ▪   One owner of the business
                      ▪   Owner has full control
                      ▪   Sole trader enjoys all profits
                      ▪   No legal distinction exists between sole trader and the business
                      ▪   Sole trader has total responsibility for the business


           Do not award marks for advantages and disadvantages of operating as a sole
           trader (for example, a sole trader cannot sell shares to other people or to the
           public) or for the idea that the sole trader performs all of the business functions
           on their own, as often sole traders employ other people.

           Accept any other relevant feature of a sole trader.

           Award [1] for each feature of a sole trader stated up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for JG for 2022.               [4]




           Award [1] mark for correctly labelling both axes.

           Award [1] for a correct and correctly labeled total sales revenue line. If the
           candidates writes “revenue” instead of “total revenue”, accept.
                                                –5–                  N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



      Award [1] for a correct and correctly labeled total costs line.

      Award [1] for correctly identifying the break-even point.

      N.B. If the chart is not drawn to scale is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge,
      maximum award: [2].

      A candidate producing a chart that is not to scale may still receive marks for a
      correct and correctly labeled total revenue line and a correct and correctly labeled
      total cost line provided that

              the two lines’ points of intersection with the y-axis are correct (0,0) for the
               total revenue line and (0, 75 000) for the total cost line)
              the point of intersection of the total cost line is labeled $75 000.
              And the break-even quantity or revenue is specified.

      The maximum award for a break-even chart would still be [2] because the chart
      is not to scale.

(c) Calculate the level of profit if sales are 20 000 units in 2022 (show all your working).     [2]

              The level of profit if sales are 20 000 units in 2022 is
              TR = 20 000  $20 = $400 000
              TC = $75 000 [fixed costs]  ($15  20 000)
                  = $75 000  $300 000 = $375 000
              TR – TC = $25 000

      Award [1] for correct workings/steps but an incorrect answer from something
      such as a mathematical error.

      If candidates do not show any working and but correctly write $25 000, award [1].

(d)   Explain how the changes that Jill expects in fixed and variable costs in 2023
      would affect the total costs line of the break-even chart from your answer to (b).         [2]

      A candidate must refer to the total cost line in their response to receive marks.

      The increase in fixed costs would cause the TFC line to shift vertically upwards,
      award [1]. If a candidate writes something to the effect that the total cost line will
      now intersect the y-axis at $82 500, accept.

      The increase in variable costs would cause the TC line to become steeper
      (gradient would increase) award [1].

      Award a maximum of [1] if no other rewardable points are stated but candidate
      states that this will increase her break-even point or says something to the effect
      of “the total cost line goes up.”
                                                       –6–             N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)    State two features of a hierarchical organizational structure.                      [2]

            Features of a hierarchical organization include:
            ▪ Pyramidal with many layers (workers>supervisors>managers>senior
                managers>executives>CEO) or long chain of command or tall structure
            ▪ Usually a narrow span of control.
            ▪ Decisions flow from top down and information passes from the bottom up.
            ▪ Authority/decision making is centralized.
            ▪ Delegated authority, if any, is narrowly defined.
            ▪ Individuals in a hierarchical organization tend to have specialized skills.
            ▪ Decision making typically takes time or is not a quick process.

            If a candidate raises the issue of decision making, award [1] if they say that
           decision making typically takes time.

            However, if the candidate appropriately contextualizes their response, they can
            earn [1] for saying decision making can be faster. For example, if a candidate
            wrote something to the effect of “In hierarchical organizations where delegation
            occurs, decision making can be fast.”

            Accept any other relevant feature.

            Award [1] for each feature identified up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)    Calculating X and Y in Table 3, prepare a profit and loss account for WC for 2022
            (show all your working).                                                            [4]

            Gross profit (X) = $16 000 000
            Tax (Y) = $800 000

            If, in their workings, the candidate has dropped the 000s, accept X = $16 000 and
            Y = $800.

                         WC Profit and loss account for the year 2022

                   Sales Revenue                                 50 000

                   Cost of goods sold                            34 000

                   Gross Profit                                  16 000

                   Interest                                        2000

                   Net profit before tax                           4000

                   Tax                                              800

                   Net profit after interest and tax               3200
                                               –7–                  N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Award [1] for correctly calculating gross profit (X), [1] for correctly calculating (Y),
      [1] for the correct layout of a profit and loss account, and [1] for a correct
      heading. Maximum award: [4].

      N.B. In the heading candidates must say the name of the company (WC), the
      year, and profit and loss account (they may say income statement). If the
      candidates does not say “in 000s”, accept.

(c) Using Table 4, calculate WC’s net cash flow for 2022 (show all your working).                [2]

       Total receipts/inflow                 $48 000 000
       Total payments/outflows               $45 400 000
       Net cash flow                          $2 600 000

      If, in their workings, the candidate has dropped the 000s, accept Z = $2 600.

      An alternate method for calculating net cash flow is to use the following formula:

      Closing balance = net cashflow + opening balance
      $10 000 000 = NCF + $7 400 000
      $10 000 000 - $7 400 000 = $2 600 000.

      Award [1] for correct method and [1] for correct answer. Maximum award: [2].

(d)   Explain the difference between WC’s profit and its cash flow.                              [2]

      A candidate can earn [1] by defining profit (revenue minus expenses) and then
      explain that cash flow is the movement of funds such as external financing (an
      inflow) or debt service (an outflow) or some other specific examples of inflows or
      outflows.

      For a second mark [2], candidates must apply their response to the stimulus.
      Application must be more than nominal (just naming WC but otherwise providing
      a generic answer). Based up the stimulus, two opportunities exist for genuine
      application:
          The candidate refers to the $3 200 000 profit and the $2 600 000 cashflow
          The candidate refers to the product (dryers) when exemplifying how a
             timing difference can occur between sales and payment received (trade
             credit).

      An alternate way a candidate can earn [2] is by explaining that profit is typically
      calculated on an accrual basis (when revenue or expense actually accrues to the
      business) but does not reflect the actual movement of funds. On an accrual
      basis, WC had a net profit of $3 200 000. Cash flow reflects the actual movement
      of funds – when a business receives payment or makes a payment. In 2022, WC
      had receipts in excess of payments in the net amount of $2 600 000. This
      difference between profit and cashflow reflects a timing difference between the
      accrual of a revenue or an expense and the actual receipt or payment of funds.

      Award [1] for partial understanding and explanation and [2] for a complete
      understanding and explanation. A candidate does not have to use the word
      accrual, but they must convey some understanding of a timing difference
                                     –8–                 N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


between the profit and loss account and the cash flow. If the candidate does not
apply their response to the stimulus, the maximum award is [1].
                                                   –9–                      N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                                Section B

3.   (a)   Define the term market segment.                                                           [2]

           A market segment is a sub-group or portion of a whole market who share similar
           characteristics.

           For 2 marks candidates need to demonstrate that a market segment is

                  A part / portion of a whole market
                  Consumers in this segment share common characteristics

           Award [1] for a definition that shows some understanding of a market segment.

           N.B. If a candidate writes a response similar to the following, award [1]: A market
           segment is a group of people who share one or more common characteristics.



     (b)   Construct a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix for HP, identifying the correct
           segments for HP’s standard rooms and its HP upgraded rooms if Option 2 is
           chosen.                                                                                   [4]




           Award [1] for a diagram that has either the correct axis labels OR the 4 correct
           segments labelled [1].

           Award [2] for a diagram that is fully, correctly labelled [2].

           Award [1] for either stating that HP rooms are a STAR or by placing this in the
           STAR segment the diagram drawn.

           Award [1] for either stating that HP + rooms are a ? or a Problem Child or by
           placing this in the ? / Problem child segment in the diagram drawn.

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for HP of using secondary market
      research                                                                                [4]

      Application Advantage
       Get detailed stats on rival budget hotel chains
       80 % of budget hotel guests are price sensitive

      Application Disadvantage
       some of data not relevant eg data about 5-star hotels
       Hotel market is rapidly growing so may be out of date very quickly.

      Award [1] for identifying an advantage to HP from its use of secondary market
      research.

      Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage to HP from its use of secondary market
      research.

      In order to access the 3rd and 4th marks both answers must make use of the
      stimulus / be contextualised.

      Mark as [2+2].

(d)   Discuss whether HP should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                 [10]

      There is no “correct answer”.

      Option 1

      Pros
      This is very simple to implement and can be done very quickly. There will be
      additional costs as this price change will need to be heavily advertised to create
      customer awareness. Above and below the line advertising can be used.
      Advertisements on TV, in the press and on social media will need to be used but
      HP can also use its database of customers to send then direct mail. As most
      budget hotel customers are price sensitive then this is likely to increase demand
      It is likely that they will be able to raise occupancy rates above the 65 % rate and
      this can be achieved quickly.

      Cons
      How successful this option depends on how its main rival reacts. Kampfort may
      react by matching the price cuts that HP makes – if this happens then occupancy
      rates may only rise minimally – the price cuts may grow the market slightly. It
      could also lead to a price war – Kampfort Inns may even cut its prices below
      those of HP in which case HP occupancy rates may fall. However, it may have
      some impact on its profitability – occupancy rates must rise by more than 10 % if
      sales revenue is not to fall.

      Option 2

      Pros
      The upgraded rooms are more likely to appeal to business guests and they
      account for 15 % of its target market. Secondary market research data shows
      that 20 % of budget hotel customers are not price sensitive and therefore the
      upgraded rooms may appeal to this market segment.
                                        – 11 –               N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The upgraded rooms bring in more revenue per room per night as they are $20
per night more expensive than standard rooms – if they hit the target of 80 %
occupancy then revenue per night would increase (80  $20  600) = $960 000
per night.
The change differentiates HP from a major rival. This may allow HP to raise its
status as it now offers a better “product” at all of its hotels compared to the offer
of its rival.

Cons
This will have higher initial costs. Each upgraded room costs $1500, that is
$150 000 per hotel. It has 600 hotels so the total cost would be $90 million. This
is likely to be far greater than the promotion costs of option A.
There will also be lost revenue at each hotel whilst the 100 rooms are upgraded.
This will impact both profits and occupancy rates. Occupancy rates will fall initially
and as it will take 2 years for all the upgrades to be undertaken.

There is also the danger of brand cannibalisation – HP may find that occupancy
rates stay the same, with more customers staying in the HP+ rooms rather than
standard rooms – they would not achieve their target of 80 % occupancy rates
BUT sales revenue would increase.

If a candidate evaluates / addresses only one option, award a maximum of [5].

A balanced response is one that provides at least one argument for and one
argument against each option.

Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance as long as at
least two arguments are given for each option.

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in the answer.

4.   (a)   Define the term secondary sector.                                                       [2]

           This sector includes both construction and manufacturing. It uses resources from
           the primary sector to manufacture finished goods or process raw materials to be
           used for other secondary sector business. The secondary sector supports both
           the primary and tertiary sector.

           Award [1] for some understanding.

           Award [2] for a clear definition.

           Providing examples of secondary sector business alone is insufficient to receive
           marks. However, exemplification can strengthen a definition and be a basis for a
           second mark (if the definition was not fully complete).

     (b)   Explain two factors that might prevent TZ from increasing its gross profit margin.      [4]


           TZ will find it very difficult to reduce its cost of sales as raw material prices are
           dependent on the world price of coffee beans and TZ has no control over these
           prices (it is a price taker).

           TZ will find it very difficult to raise prices as TZ operates in a “very competitive
           market”

           To increase its gross profit margin TZ would need to either
            raise its price OR
            reduce its costs of sales.

           Mark as [2+2].

           Award [1] for stating a reason why TZ might not be able to increase its gross
           profit margin and an additional [1] for its explanation with reference to TZ. Award
           a maximum of [2].

     (c)   Explain, using the Ansoff Matrix, TZ’s proposed takeover of GG.                         [4]

           Candidates can be awarded up to 2 marks for demonstrating a knowledge of the
           Ansoff Matrix and a further 2 marks for applying it the stimulus

           Candidates do NOT need to draw the Ansoff Matrix, but marks can be awarded if
           they do and place the takeover of GG in an appropriate sector. However, such an
           answer without any commentary is restricted to a maximum of 2 marks

           There is no single correct answer

           Candidates can be rewarded application marks if they suggest the takeover is
           either:
            product development as coffee retailers look at their existing market and seek
              to gain their customers' loyalty with new and more exciting products, or
            market development as they take their existing product, coffee, and aim to
              extend to new niche markets (of their own creation) by educating their
              consumers to seek a new experience – or
            market penetration- It is a good example of a product extension strategy,
              adding value to a product for the consumer.

       Diversification – From a certain perspective, TZ’s proposed takeover of GC is
        a form of diversification, related diversification (though candidates are not
        required to use the word related).

      Award [1] if the answer demonstrates a weak grasp of the Ansoff Matrix.

      Award [2] if the answer demonstrates a sound grasp of the Ansoff Matrix.

      Award [3] if the answer demonstrates a sound grasp of the Ansoff Matrix and the
      candidate explains why it might be considered to be either PD, MD or MP using
      the stimulus.

      Award [4] if the answer demonstrates a sound grasp of the Ansoff Matrix and the
      candidate explains why it might be considered to be more than just one
      classification ie either PD or MD or PD or MP, MD or MP using the stimulus.

(d)   Recommend whether TZ’s directors should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                 [10]

      Option 1 Advantages
       Speed – once the deal is struck TZ will have expanded quickly
       Proven profitability GG made a profit of $120m in 2021 – is therefore less risky
        than Option 2
       This business has a well organised distribution channel and strong brand
        awareness in the USA and therefore is already well established.

      Option 1 Disadvantages
       TZ only has $400m in cash and the takeover price is $600m and therefore TZ
        will need external finance the purchase
       TZ will have to raise external finance, which means that its debt (and interest
        expense) will increase or some dilution of ownership will occur. .
       This option is only based in US – will the concept transfer to other countries
        and how much cost will be incurred to establish its brand overseas?

      Option 2 Advantages
       This can be seen as diversification, reducing risks as the market of jars of
        coffee has stagnated in many richer countries
       It already has experience of purchasing coffee beans on a large scale and can
        use the same suppliers for its new chain of cafes
       It has great potential as demand is growing in eastern Europe. Demand is also
        growing in emerging markets so the prospects for sales may be good.

      Option 2 Disadvantages
       TZ has no experience of running cafes selling coffee
       It will have to go head on with established brands (students are likely to name
        them eg Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts etc) and may find it hard to compete with
        the brand loyalties already established.
       Will not have the economies of scale that existing chains have
       Will take much longer – is only trialling this in 3 countries in EU
       If successful in these countries will it work worldwide? – cannot be certain as
        consumers in these countries may have different tastes or attitudes to rest of
        the world.

      In order to reach the top bands of the markscheme candidates must have a
      balanced view, made a judgement AND also used the data in Table 3 effectively
                                        – 15 –          N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Accept any other relevant evaluation.

The table below should be followed (along with the markbands on page 3).

These mark awards in the table below should be viewed as maximums. That is,
just because a candidate has one argument for option 1 and one argument
against does not mean that they will automatically get a 4. One strong argument
for one side and merely a weak or nominal argument for the other side might
result in a 3.

5.   (a)   State two marketing objectives that a company might have.                             [2]

           Marketing objectives include
            attract new customers
            enter new market
            improve brand loyalty
            increase awareness
            increase market share
            increase profit
            increase revenue
            increase sales
            retain existing customers

           Accept any other valid marketing objective.

           Award [1] for each objective identified up to a maximum award of [2].

     (b)   With reference to OS, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of operating
           as a private limited company.                                                         [4]

           Advantages of operating as a private limited company include:
            Compared to sole traders and partnerships, private limited companies typically
             can raise more capital.
            Control of the company cannot be lost to outsiders.
            Members of the board of directors, many/most of whom are major
             shareholders in the company, can make decisions with fewer concerns about
             shareholder and/or market reaction.
            Owners have limited liability.
            Private limited companies do not have to disclose fully their financial
             information.
            The business continues if one of the owners dies.

           For OS, one advantage to operating as a private limited company is that OS
           could make changes in dividend policy without affecting perceptions of the
           company in the marketplace. When OS realized that it needed to preserve cash,
           it suspended dividend payments for one year and said it possibly would for a
           second year. When a publicly traded company lowers or eliminates dividend
           payments to preserve cash, the share price typically falls, sometimes
           significantly, which can make capital sufficiency issues even worse.

           Disadvantages of operating as a privately limited company often include
            If a shareholder wants to sell their shares, finding a suitable buyer may take
              time.
            Often (though not always) private limited companies are relatively small
              organizations which possesses lesser expertise than large, publicly traded
              companies.
            Opening a private limited company takes time and has some legal expenses.
            Private limited companies cannot sell shares to the public, thus limiting the
              amount of capital than be raised.
            Profits have to be shared with more people/owners compared to a sole trader
              or most partnerships.

           OS is currently facing a difficult moment, as its industry is changing, a situation
           that has led to a decline in sales and a contraction of margins. As a private
           limited company, OS may not have the expertise to face this situation. Currently,
                                             – 17 –              N21/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      the company has no real marketing strategy and may not have the marketing
      expertise to make appropriate adjustments.

      Additionally, many potential adjustments OS may make will require capital, which,
      as a private limited company, OS has lesser access to than if it were public.

      Mark as [2 + 2].

      Award [1] for identification of an advantage and an additional [1] for an
      explanation thereof with application to the stimulus.

      Award [1] for identification of a disadvantage and an additional [1] for an
      explanation thereof with application to the stimulus.

      Maximum award: [4].

(c)   With reference to OS, explain the difference between capital expenditure and
      revenue expenditure.                                                                    [4]

      Capital expenditure refers to any expenditure for assets with a life of more than
      one year. The stimulus refers to three instances of capital expenditure in the
      company’s history: each time OS purchased a building location.

      Revenue expenditure refers to those expenses that will be accounted for fully in
      the year in which the expense occurs. In the case of OS, revenue expenditures
      mention in the case are expenditures for inventory.

      Mark as [2 + 2].

      Award [1] for an explanation of capital expenditure and an additional [1] for an
      explanation with application to the stimulus.

      Award [1] for an explanation of revenue expenditure and an additional [1] for an
      explanation with application to the stimulus.

(d)   Discuss possible changes to any two elements of OS’s marketing mix.                    [10]

      Ways that OS could modify its marketing mix to match and compete with the new
      competitors.
       Product: Changing its product range (either contracting or expanding its
        product range).
       Price: Adopting a different pricing strategy.
       Place: Modifying its distribution strategy to include e-commerce.
       Promotion: Initiate a more aggressive promotion strategy.

      For each of the four Ps, OS could make modifications. Modifying each has
      advantages and disadvantages. For example, contracting its product range could
      give the organization more focus and require lesser investment in stock. On the
      other hand, assuming that OS process its products properly, each inventory item
      makes some contribution to fixed costs. Further, any termination of a product line
      means that customers for that product, however few, will have to go to a
      competitor for that product.

      OS could modify its prices, particularly try being more aggressive with its pricing.
      Whereas that may attract more customers (advantage), margins will be thinner.

An ecommerce shift with a door-to-door aspect will change OS’ supply chain
considerably. Time and resources will need to be devoted to this task

There is a sense that OS is a traditional business and new aggressive forms of
pricing and promotion will be required. Will they know how to do the latter? Do
they need to introduce a social media campaign backed up with a membership or
loyalty programme?

Candidates are expected to provide a conclusion with a substantiated judgment.

Grade according to the mark bands found on page 3.

For one relevant modification to the marketing mix that is one-sided, award a
maximum of [3].

For two relevant modifications, but the discussion of both is one-sided, award a
maximum of [4].

For two relevant modifications, one treated in a balanced way and another in an
unbalanced way, award a maximum of [5].

For two relevant modifications, both treated in balanced ways, but no real
conclusion, award a maximum of [6]. Conclusions must be more than nominal
(for example, when a candidate opens a final paragraph with “In conclusion . . . “
but then has no real conclusion), award a maximum of [6].
