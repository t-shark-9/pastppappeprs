                                              Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   Jill’s Gloves (JG)

     Jill’s Gloves (JG) is a sole trader owned by Jill McAloon. The business makes and sells ski
     gloves. JG sells each pair of gloves for $20.

     Jill has forecasted sales in 2022 to be 20 000 units. She has also projected the fixed costs
     (Table 1) and variable costs (Table 2) for that year.

                                Table 1: Projected fixed costs for 2022

                                      Rent               $25 000

                                      Insurance          $10 000

                                      Salaries           $40 000


                    Table 2: Projected variable costs per pair of gloves for 2022

                                       Material             $11

                                       Packaging             $1

                                       Shipping              $3


     Jill expects a 10 % increase in her fixed costs and a 5 % increase in her variable costs in 2023.

     (a)   State two features of a sole trader.                                                         [2]

     (b)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart, to scale, for JG for 2022.                      [4]

     (c)   Calculate JG’s level of profit if sales are 20 000 units in 2022 (show all your working).[2]

     (d)   Explain how the changes that Jill expects in fixed and variable costs in 2023 would
           affect the total costs line of the break-even chart from your answer to (b).                 [2]




                                                                                                 Turn over

                                             Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   High Plains PLC (HP)

     High Plains PLC (HP ) owns 600 budget hotels. It operates in a rapidly growing market and
     has a 60 % market share of the budget hotel market.

     Recent secondary market research on the hotel industry revealed:
     y guests of luxury hotels are brand loyal
     y 80 % of guests of budget hotels respond positively to a price reduction
     y the budget hotel market is growing rapidly
     y detailed statistics and information on all hotel chains.

     HP ’s directors aim to increase occupancy rates in HP ’s hotels from the current 65 % to 80 %
     by the end of 2024. Each of HP ’s hotels has 400 rooms. People on business trips account for
     only 15 % of the hotels’ bookings.

     HP is considering two options.

     Option 1: Price discounts on 100 of the rooms in each of HP ’s hotels
     The discounts would undercut prices charged by its major competitor, Kampfort Inns (KI ), by 10 %.
     HP would also offer a price match guarantee, which means that it would match any lower price
     charged by KI for any room.

     Option 2: Upgrade 100 of the standard rooms in each of HP ’s hotels
     Upgraded rooms, called HP+, would have improved IT facilities, new décor, a coffee machine
     and a better shower. HP+ rooms would be $20 per night more expensive than standard
     rooms. Estimated upgrade costs are $1500 per room, and the upgrades would take two
     years to complete. The HP+ rooms are targeted both at the business traveller market
     segment and at customers willing to pay slightly more for an enhanced hotel experience.


     (a)   Define the term market segment.[2]

     (b)   Construct a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix for HP, identifying the correct
           segments for HP ’s standard rooms and its HP+ upgraded rooms if Option 2 is chosen.       [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for HP of using secondary market
           research.[4]

     (d)   Discuss whether HP should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]
                                                    –7–                                         8821 – 5014


4.   Trestle Z PLC (TZ)

     Trestle Z PLC (TZ ), a specialist coffee roaster, operates in the
     secondary sector. Its instant coffees are sold worldwide in a very
     competitive market. Consumers in this market have strong brand loyalty.

     Although demand for instant coffee has not grown in many richer
     countries, it is growing in emerging markets and Eastern Europe.
     TZ has no control over the price of its raw material (coffee beans),
     as prices are determined by world markets.

     The directors of TZ want to increase the company’s gross profit margin and net profit margin
     and grow the business. Table 5 gives selected financial information for the company for 2019
     and 2020.

                            Table 5: Selected financial information for TZ

                                                           2019      2020

                             Gross profit margin (%)         25        23

                             Net profits ($ m)             2300      1500

                             Cash ($ m)                     600       400

     TZ ’s directors are considering two options.

     Option 1: Take over a specialist coffee business
     TZ is considering taking over Green Glass (GG) for $600 million. GG owns 1000 cafés in
     the USA that sell speciality products at high prices. It also has an e-commerce subscription
     service that sells its coffee beans to consumers. In 2020, GG’s net profits were $120 million.
     GG has a well-organized distribution channel and strong brand awareness in the USA. TZ
     would operate the cafés using the GG branding.

     Option 2: Launch its own chain of cafés
     These cafés would compete against established chains of cafés serving the mass market.
     Initially, the launch would be in three EU countries but would then, if successful, be launched
     across the world. TZ would produce a range of freshly ground coffees for sale in the cafés.


     (a)   Define the term secondary sector.                                                            [2]

     (b)   Explain two factors that might prevent TZ from increasing its gross profit margin.           [4]

     (c)   Explain, using the Ansoff Matrix, TZ ’s proposed takeover of GG.                             [4]

     (d)   Recommend whether TZ ’s directors should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                       [10]




                                                                                                Turn over
                                                              –8–                                  8821 – 5014


5.    Office Supplies (OS)

      Office Supplies (OS) is a family-owned private limited company that, for 40 years, has
      operated three retail office supply stores in a small city. OS offers a wide range of office
      products (such as computer paper and stationery) and office machinery (such as computers
      and printers). When each store opened, OS purchased the buildings using long-term loan
      capital. OS ’s objective is to have enough profit to finance the company’s working capital and
      pay annual dividends.

      OS has no clear marketing strategy. Traditionally, OS competed with several other office
      supply stores operating in the same city. The market was not competitive, however, and most
      customers went to the nearest office supply store. OS ’s prices were comparable to those of
      other retail office supply stores, and the company did little promotion.

      Nationally, the retail office supply store industry is declining. Many retail office supply stores
      have had to close, and new competitors have entered the market, many of which benefit from
      some or all of the following:
      y Specialization in particular office products
      y Economies of scale leading to more competitive prices
      y Greater convenience, including e-commerce with door-to-door delivery

      Like other physical retail stores, OS has seen its sales decline. Gross and net profit
      margins have fallen. Last year, to ensure enough funds for capital expenditure and revenue
      expenditure, OS ’s board of directors chose not to pay dividends. OS also anticipates the
      need for additional finance next year. OS ’s board is considering changes to the company’s
      marketing mix in response to new competitors.


      (a)      State two marketing objectives that a company might have.                                   [2]

      (b)      With reference to OS, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of operating as a
               private limited company.                                                                    [4]

      (c)      With reference to OS, explain the difference between capital expenditure and revenue
               expenditure.[4]

      (d)      Discuss possible changes to any two elements of OS ’s marketing mix.                       [10]
