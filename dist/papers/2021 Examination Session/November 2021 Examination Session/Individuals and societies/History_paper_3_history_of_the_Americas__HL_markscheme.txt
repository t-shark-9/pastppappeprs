Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)
                                                  –4–                   N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M



1.   “Local authorities were more effective than state authorities in controlling the population.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that local authorities were more effective than state authorities in controlling the population.
     Candidates may refer to the close relations local authorities had with communities that allowed for
     a better imposition of their rule. Candidates may also highlight that local authorities usually took
     part in traditional practices, controlling rituals and generating strong bonds with the population.
     They may also discuss that local authorities had control over the resources and managed the
     payment of taxes to the state, fulfilling the role of important mediators. Candidates may challenge
     the statement considering that local authorities were part of state systems, therefore their actions
     were beneficial to the central powers. Candidates may also discuss that states successfully
     controlled the population with a net of their own authorities and armies sent to different
     communities and/or by submitting local authorities through rewards and promotions. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Evaluate the significance of unwritten language in two indigenous societies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of unwritten language
     in two indigenous societies. Unwritten languages played a significant role in indigenous societies
     that developed special systems to record the information. Candidates may refer to the significance
     of unwritten languages to build a sense of identity to communities and/or states. Candidates may
     also evaluate the religious value of a number of unwritten languages that were only known by the
     local religious leaders. Among the possible examples, candidates may evaluate Nahuatl, the
     language of the Aztec Empire widely used as a lingua franca in Mesoamerica, which was originally
     written with a pictographic script and served as a mnemonic to remind readers of texts they had
     learnt orally. Other examples candidates may refer to is the case of the Quechua language from
     the Inca Empire and the use of quipus to record numerical data. Candidates may also evaluate the
     Mayan hieroglyphic writing that contained more than 800 characters, including hieroglyphic and
     phonetic signs representing syllables. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Compare and contrast French and British exploration in North America.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     French and British exploration in North America. Candidates may state that France joined the race
     to explore the New World looking for colonial outposts to expand the trade networks. On the other
     hand, British exploration was commissioned in 1497 by Henry VII to John Cabot, who explored
     Maine and Nova Scotia, and opened for British fishermen the waters off the east coast. Candidates
     may compare and contrast the relations established with the indigenous peoples. France fostered
     good relationships with Hurons, Algonquians and native hunters since it was essential for a
     successful trade. In contrast, Sir Walter Raleigh’s attempts to establish a colony at Roanoke and
     have good relations with Croatans failed. Candidates may also compare and contrast the religious
     motives behind the exploration considering that the competition between Catholicism and
     Protestantism fuelled French and British colonization. Candidates may also state that, unlike
     France, British colonization efforts in the 1500s were devoted to the colonization of Ireland, and
     also against Spain. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not
     need to be an equal number of each.


4.   Evaluate the impact of Bartolomé de las Casas on the treatment of indigenous peoples in the
     Americas.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Bartolomé de las Casas
     on the treatment of indigenous peoples in the Americas. Bartolomé de las Casas proposed the
     recognition of indigenous people from America as free men, fought against their enslavement, and
     promoted the prohibition of new encomiendas. Candidates may state that las Casas had an impact
     on beginning a discussion about the Spanish dominion in America, being influential in the revision
     of legal codes, and in the creation of the New Laws (1542–43). Candidates may also evaluate the
     impact of las Casas’s plan for a peaceful colonization recruiting farmers as colonists, and his
     project to create “towns of free Indians” (communities of Spaniards and Indians), a proposal
     accepted by King Charles I. On the other hand, candidates may evaluate that even when his ideas
     were well received, his plans were not successful. Las Casas failed to recruit sufficient farmers for
     the “town of free Indians”. He also faced the opposition of the encomenderos and suffered attacks
     by indigenous peoples. Las Casas also failed to stop the progressive enslavement of the
     indigenous peoples. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –6–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   Evaluate the importance of the captaincy system to the political organization in Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of the captaincy
     system to the political organization in Spanish America. In colonial Spanish America, captaincies
     were districts that tried to expand and/or maintain the Spanish authority in isolated regions, usually
     under serious pressures from foreign invasion or local attacks. Candidates may refer to the role of
     those who served as captain general (a high military rank of general officer grade) and evaluate
     the importance of their specific duties and powers that varied according with the requirements of
     time and place. Candidates may consider that although they were under the jurisdiction of
     viceroys, their military responsibilities and their isolation made them virtual independent authorities,
     causing many conflicts and competitions. Candidates may also highlight their close relationship
     with the king and the Council of the Indies. As examples, candidates may refer to the captaincies
     of Santo Domingo, Guatemala, New Granada, Cuba, Venezuela and Chile. Candidates’ opinions
     or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Discuss the economic impact of mita and encomienda in Spanish America.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
     impact of mita and encomienda in Spanish America. Candidates may discuss the change the mita
     system underwent from its Andean origins to the Spanish system that exploited the silver mines
     and mills at Potosí, mobilizing over 11 000 natives each year and enriching Spaniards and the
     crown. Candidates may also discuss the economic impact the mita had in forcing indigenous
     peoples to participate in the colonial economy, subsidizing its production through low wages.
     Candidates may discuss that while some villages resisted the obligation, others paid colonial
     administrators to hire substitutes. However, most of them suffered depopulation since the mita
     endangered the lives of those who were forced to participate. The encomienda consisted of a grant
     by the crown to a conqueror, a soldier, an official, or others of a specified number of natives. The
     receiver of the grant could extract tribute from them in kind or in labour and was required to protect
     and instruct them in the Christian faith. Candidates may discuss that although the original intent of
     the encomienda was to reduce the abuses of forced labour, in practice it became a form of
     enslavement. The encomienda also allowed the Spaniards to gain control over the lands inhabited
     by indigenous communities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   “Religious syncretism greatly contributed to the survival of indigenous religions.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
     religious syncretism greatly contributed to the survival of indigenous religions. Candidates may
     support the statement, considering the number of elements from indigenous religions integrated
     into Catholicism, especially in popular beliefs. Candidates may also argue that syncretism allowed
     for the survival of native gods and goddesses, and local celebrations like the fertility celebrations
     for the Pachamama in the Andes. Candidates may challenge the statement, stating that the
     Catholic Church imposed limitations to syncretism since it only allowed those symbols and
     traditions from native belief systems that conformed with the Christian worldview. Candidates may
     also consider that the tolerance shown by the Catholic Church was a policy towards conversion
     that led to the final abandonment of the indigenous religions. Candidates may refer to religions like
     Voudun or Santería that were prohibited and their followers persecuted. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Examine the political impact of the Great Awakening c1720–c1760.

     The question requires that candidates consider the political impact of the Great Awakening
     between 1720 and 1760. The Great Awakening was a religious revival that impacted the British
     colonies in America. During the Great Awakening, Christian leaders often travelled from town to
     town, preaching about the gospel, emphasizing salvation from sins and promoting enthusiasm for
     Christianity. Candidates may examine the political impact of their attempts to unify the colonies,
     and the possible divisions the movement triggered between those who supported the movement
     and those who rejected it. Candidates may also consider the impact the Great Awakening could
     have had in the Revolutionary War, encouraging nationalism and individual rights. Candidates may
     also examine the impact of the Great Awakening in proposing a much more open and less vertical
     society, and the disagreements within the social elite. Candidates may also examine the political
     impact the Great Awakening could have in the American Revolution. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –8–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Examine the social impact of slavery in the New World.

      The question requires that candidates consider the social impact of slavery in the New World.
      Candidates may state that the trade of African slaves changed the demographic pyramid in many
      regions, supplanting indigenous populations that were expulsed or died. Candidates may also
      examine the long-lasting social division produced since then between rich white and poor black
      communities. Candidates may examine the development of new black identities in the New World
      from a combination of African traditions, European culture and experiences in the Americas. Other
      relevant interrelationships may be considered, for example the religious impact produced by the
      entry of African belief systems and its combination with Catholicism. Candidates can also examine
      the contribution and enrichment of cultural life, languages, dances, traditions. Candidates may also
      refer to the loss of languages and cultural practices experienced by many slaves who were
      baptized. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


10.   Compare and contrast the social structures on plantations in two of the following: West Indies,
      Brazil or the southern colonies of British America.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the social structures on plantations, referring to two of the examples given. Candidates may
      compare and contrast the nature of labour, products, role of women and the organization of
      plantations. Candidates may also consider the type of owners the plantations had, many of them
      being absent owners who lived in the cities. Candidates may also consider the treatment given to
      slaves. Usually, their families were split and their members sent to different plantations. Many
      women who were appointed as house slaves often gave birth to children of mixed race, who
      usually inherited their mothers’ status as slaves. They may also refer to the social stratification
      between wealthy white plantation owners and poor white and black labourers, a characteristic
      present in the southern British colonies, the West Indies and Brazil. Also, different kinds of labour
      were required on the plantations, creating a hierarchy between field slaves, craftsmen, house
      slaves, etc. Candidates may also compare and contrast the power gained by the owners of
      plantations that in some cases were free from the interference of colonial powers, like the
      fazendeiros in Brazil. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal number of each.
                                                   –9–                  N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   Evaluate the importance of foreign intervention in one independence movement in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of foreign intervention
      in one independence movement in the Americas. Candidates may refer to the different actions
      taken by foreign nations, considering their competition with colonial powers, like in the case of
      Britain and Spain, or Britain and France. Candidates may evaluate the political and ideological
      influence that many foreign ideas had (especially the ideas from the Enlightenment) that fuelled the
      independence movements in most of the nations in the Americas, as well as the aid given by
      foreign countries in terms of arms and soldiers. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example the economic interests behind foreign interventions, the need for new markets and
      commercial relations, and the potential for future investments in the region. Candidates may also
      evaluate those cases where foreign intervention led to crisis and the loss of territory. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   Examine the importance of Washington’s military contributions to the achievement of
      US independence.

      The question requires that the candidates consider the interrelationship between Washington’s
      military contributions and the achievement of US independence. Responses should assess the
      importance of his contributions to independence and not merely be a listing of his contributions.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of his battlefield experiences, his overall strategies and his
      preparations of the troops. The importance of his contributions began before the actual Declaration
      of Independence, as he was made Commander in Chief in June 1775. Candidates may refer to the
      importance of his actions in forcing the British evacuation of Boston, his ability to escape defeats,
      his victories at Trenton and Princeton in the early part of the war and the final victory at Yorktown.
      They may also refer to his ability to keep the army together, for turning it into a professional army
      and for raising their morale. Some could argue for the importance of other commanders, while
      focusing on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  – 10 –               N21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   “The outcome of the War of 1812 had a greater impact on the United States than on British North
      America.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the outcome of the War of 1812 had a greater impact on the United States than it did on British
      North America. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe of the war, but it must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. The candidates may offer equal coverage of both the
      United States and British North America, or they may prioritize their discussion of one or the other.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the war being
      seen by the United States as a second war of independence. The Americans felt they won the war
      and this created a great sense of nationalism, unity and expansionism. For British North America,
      the war protected their homeland from US expansionism and resulted in increased nationalism,
      unity among the provinces and closer ties to Great Britain. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Evaluate the causes of the Mexican–American War (1846–1848).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the causes of the Mexican–American
      War. The war between Mexico and the US took place between 1846 and 1848. As short-term
      causes, candidates may evaluate the attack carried forward by Mexico against a group of US
      soldiers in a disputed zone under the command of General Z Taylor. Candidates may also
      evaluate the role played by Texas after gaining its independence from Mexico in 1836 and the
      beginning of its annexation to the US. Candidates may also evaluate Mexico’s rejection of
      President Polk’s offer to purchase California and New Mexico, which resulted in the movement of
      US troops between the Rio Grande and Nueces River. Candidates may also evaluate President
      Polk’s support for the idea of “manifest destiny” that proposed the expansion of the US across the
      continent to the Pacific Ocean as an impulse to the war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 8: US Civil War: causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   “Economic differences between the North and the South were more significant than slavery to the
      outbreak of the Civil War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that economic differences between the North and the South were more significant than slavery to
      the outbreak of the Civil War. The candidates may offer equal coverage of both the economic
      differences between the regions and slavery, or they may prioritize their discussion of one or the
      other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the
      differences between the industrial North and the agricultural South and the resulting crises over
      national economic policies on tariffs, which increased sectionalism. Slavery was fundamental to the
      Southern economy and any limitation would endanger Southern prosperity. Slavery and its
      expansion were at the core of every disagreement between the North and South from the Missouri
      Compromise of 1820 to the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example cultural differences or states’ rights, but with a focus on the issue in the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


16.   Compare and contrast presidential and congressional plans for Reconstruction.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      presidential and congressional plans for Reconstruction, referring to both throughout. Presidential
      reconstruction was formulated by Lincoln, but carried out by Johnson, while congressional
      reconstruction plans were in the Wade–Davis Bill and carried out by the Radical Republicans.
      Candidates may refer to both plans dealing with the readmission of Confederate states, elimination
      of slavery, treatment of freedmen and the reunification of the country. Differences lay in the
      application of those policies. Presidential reconstruction was more lenient towards the seceded
      states, left much up to the states and was less well-defined regarding the rights of freedmen.
      Congressional reconstruction set stricter standards for readmission, required the acceptance of the
      13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, divided the South into military occupation zones and saw it as a
      national issue. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need
      to be an equal number of each.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   “Neocolonialism created a new form of dependency for modern nations.” Discuss with reference to
      two Latin American nations.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that neocolonialism created a new form of dependency for modern nations. Candidates may
      support the statement, considering that many Latin American nations fell under the influence of
      powers like the US and Britain soon after their independence. This dependency could be
      discussed as political and/or economic. Candidates may argue that many Latin American nations
      focused their economies on exporting food and raw materials, importing manufactured products.
      This produced a division that generated economic dependency. Candidates may also discuss that
      many foreign investments (banks, services, etc.) also generated new forms of dependency.
      Candidates may also highlight the role played by local elites who established close economic links
      with foreign powers allowing for neocolonialism. Candidates may challenge the statement,
      considering that Latin American countries were able to conduct diplomatic and commercial
      relations with a wide number of countries, leaving room for a more independent policy. They can
      also consider that the First World War led to some Latin American countries taking their own
      diplomatic decisions and imposed new economic patterns. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Compare and contrast the impact of internal migration on indigenous peoples in two countries of
      the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences of the
      impact of internal migration on indigenous peoples with reference to two cases. Candidates may
      compare and contrast the impact of migration on the family structure, considering those cases
      where the entire family migrated or only some of their members. Candidates may also consider the
      changes migration caused in traditional roles within the community, like in the case of local leaders
      and women. Candidates may also compare and contrast different cases where migration was due
      to the loss of territory, and/or the need to access the job market. In the last case, candidates may
      refer to the impact the new jobs had on indigenous communities and the need to develop new
      skills. Candidates may also address the cultural impact of migration on indigenous communities
      regarding the language, customs         and religion, as well as the actions taken to resist the
      migration, the loss of their lands, and the assimilation of new cultural patterns. Both similarities and
      differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   Discuss the causes of the Spanish–American War (1898).

      This question requires that the candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of
      the Spanish–American War. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the desire for Cuban independence, both
      by the Cubans and the Americans. Economic interests in the US supported the war in order to
      make Cuba more open to US business and trade. American imperialism, whether economic,
      political or military, can be seen as a cause. Candidates may also refer to “yellow journalism” in the
      US that fuelled American desires to protect Cuba from Spanish mistreatment and end the last
      vestiges of a colonial empire. The US declaration of war occurred after the sinking of the USS
      Maine and the Spanish DeLome letter, which belittled the US president. For Spain, the causes
      revolve around ending US influence in Cuba and keeping Cuba as their colony. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the domestic impact of the First World War on two countries in the Americas.

      This question requires that the candidates make an appraisal of the domestic impact of the First
      World War on two countries in the Americas. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe of the
      question but must be clearly linked to the First World War. Several countries could be chosen, but
      the US and Canada may be the most popular. The impact could be economic, political, social or
      military. Candidates may evaluate that for the US, impact initially included a divided population,
      neutrality, relief efforts for Belgium and loans to the Allies. Later, the impact included economic
      growth, governmental growth, more women in the workforce, a restriction on civil liberties and
      eventually passage of the 19th Amendment. The war also raised civil rights concerns for African-
      Americans. For Canada, candidates may indicate that the war caused military, industrial and
      agricultural aid to the Allies and a resulting growth in all areas. Despite the conscription crisis in
      1917 which divided English and French-Canadians, the country experienced national unity and
      pride in their accomplishments. Neutral Latin American nations experienced mostly economic
      impact. Capital and imports from Europe ended. Economic growth from exports occurred in some
      countries. Populations were divided in their support of the Allies or the Central Powers. Only Brazil
      and small Central American countries entered the war. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   “Discontent with Porfirio Díaz was the main factor in the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      discontent with Porfirio Díaz was the main factor in the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.
      Candidates may support the statement, considering that a number of policies taken by Díaz
      affected his government, such as the severe control over local and regional leaderships, the
      legislature, public employees and the press. Candidates may also refer to the fact that Díaz
      secured his power by catering to the needs of separate groups and playing off one interest against
      another as a cause of discontent. Also, the indigenous peoples, approximately a third of the
      population, were ignored. Candidates may also consider that Mexico’s wealth was not properly
      distributed throughout the country under Díaz’s administration, since most of the profits went
      abroad or were enjoyed by a few wealthy Mexicans. Candidates may also refer to the instruments
      of repression and control used by Díaz as another cause of discontent. Candidates may challenge
      the statement, highlighting the influence of groups with new political ideas such as the anarchists
      from Regeneration and/or refer to foreign interventions as a cause of the conflict, as in the case of
      the US. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


22.   Evaluate the achievements of Lázaro Cárdenas up to 1940.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the achievements of Lázaro Cárdenas.
      As achievements, candidates may evaluate the agrarian reform programme that successfully
      distributed land among peasants. Cárdenas also organized the National Peasant Confederation
      (Confederación Nacional Campesina) and extended the services of government banks so that
      peasants could borrow money. Another major policy was taken in 1936 when most of the country’s
      labour groups were organized into the Confederación de Trabajadores de Mexico. In 1938,
      Cárdenas also reorganized the government party, restructuring and renaming it as Partido de la
      Revolución Mexicana (PRM). The new scheme allowed mass groups to join the PRM. Candidates
      may also evaluate Cárdenas’s efforts to expropriate foreign-owned industries. In 1937, the
      government expropriated the nation’s principal railways, and in 1938 signed a decree nationalizing
      the country’s oil industry. Candidates may argue that Cardenas’s attempt at putting both of these
      industries under the control of their workers’ unions failed, and they were placed under
      autonomous public corporations that functioned as private industries. Candidates may also
      evaluate Cárdenas’s foreign policy regarding the conflict in Spain, the condemnation of
      dictatorships and the help given to exiled people. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   Evaluate the importance of popular mobilization and repression in one Latin American country
      during the Great Depression.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the importance of popular mobilization
      and repression in one Latin American country during the Great Depression. Likely choices could be
      Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, though any Latin American country is acceptable. Candidates
      may refer to popular mobilization movements in many Latin American countries that rose up in
      order to protect workers from the economic disparities caused by the Depression and the slow
      response of the government. Candidates may highlight that some of these movements can be
      seen as quite nationalistic, as seen in the popular support for Vargas in Brazil, Alessandri in Chile
      and Cárdenas in Mexico, all of which brought about significant political change. At the same time,
      repression occurred in many Latin American countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and
      Nicaragua. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the Great Depression on minorities in one country in the Americas.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the impact of the Great Depression on
      minorities in one country in the Americas. The impact could extend beyond the timeframe, but it
      must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. Candidates may evaluate that while the
      Great Depression affected everyone, it tended to be worse for minorities because of discrimination
      and segregation, and an already low standard of living. Candidates may demonstrate that
      minorities tended to be the first fired, and last to receive government benefits. In the US,
      sharecroppers (predominately African-Americans) and migrant workers (predominately Hispanic-
      Americans) were not included in the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The NAACP grew stronger and
      some African-Americans became more radicalized. Candidates may evaluate that in many Latin
      American countries, minority populations moved from remote areas to cities seeking work, where
      they often found mistreatment and discrimination. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   Compare and contrast the treatment of people of Japanese origin in two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the treatment of people of Japanese origin in two countries of the Americas. The comparison will
      depend upon the countries chosen, but in nearly all cases, the Japanese were restricted in
      movement and, in some countries, sent to internment camps. Candidates may refer to the
      Japanese losing their personal property and many of their personal possessions because of the
      relocation. Candidates may refer to US and Canadian camps and compare the conditions there.
      Japanese-Canadians tended to have worse conditions than Japanese-Americans. In Peru and
      other Latin American countries, many Japanese, but not all, were deported to the US for
      internment during the war. Argentina, Brazil and Chile did not relocate Japanese, though they were
      closely monitored. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not
      need to be an equal number of each.


26.   Examine the diplomatic effects of the Second World War up to 1945 in two countries of
      the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Second World
      War and diplomacy in two countries of the Americas. The most likely choices will be the United
      States and Canada, though Brazil, Mexico or Argentina might be chosen. Candidates may refer to
      the break in diplomatic relations with the Axis powers for most countries in the region. They may
      also refer to hemispheric cooperation agreements signed in 1939, 1940 and 1942, all of which
      were forerunners of the Rio Pact and eventually the Organization of American States (OAS). The
      US took actions against the Japanese in December 1941, allied with the Chinese and signed the
      Atlantic Charter. Candidates may refer to Canada’s immediate declaration of war on Germany, ties
      to the Allies and later to the US, and increased presence in diplomacy at the end of the war.
      Mexico and Brazil declared war on Germany in 1942, drawing both countries closer to the US.
      Argentina remained neutral until March 1945. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   Evaluate the impact of Fidel Castro on Latin America.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Fidel Castro on Latin
      America. Candidates may evaluate the impact of Fidel Castro’s rule, considering the expansion of
      Communism in Latin America and the role of local Communist parties. Candidates may also
      evaluate the expansion of guerrilla and urban terrorism and the extent of support they received
      from Castro. Candidates may also refer to the response of Latin American governments, since
      many strengthened their armed forces and joined US policies to counter guerrilla operations as a
      result of Castro’s rule. Many nations also witnessed the ascension of dictatorships as a response
      to the impact of Fidel Castro. Candidates may highlight that, on the other hand, some governments
      considered pursuing land reforms and other progressive policies to eliminate the causes of
      insurgency. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the impact Fidel Castro’s rule
      had on social aspects (like the treatment of opposition), on culture and art. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   Discuss the impact of liberation theology in Latin America up to 1980.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
      liberation theology in Latin America up to 1980. Liberation theology was a religious movement that
      sought to apply religious faith by aiding the poor and oppressed through involvement in political
      and civic affairs. In Latin America, liberation theologians specifically targeted the disparities
      between rich and poor in the social and economic orders within the nations’ political and corporate
      structures. Candidates may discuss that the movement gained strength in Latin America during the
      1970s when many countries were under the control of dictatorships. Since the movement stated
      that ministry should include involvement in political struggle, liberation theologians were often
      criticized as Marxists and persecuted. Candidates may also discuss one of the most radical
      aspects of liberation theology: the reorganization of church practices through the model of
      Christian base communities. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the fact that
      the movement faced the opposition of the US and the Vatican and this had an impact on the extent
      it gained. Candidates may refer to specific examples of priests involved in the liberation theology,
      such as: Gustavo Gutiérrez (Peru), Leonardo Boff (Brazil) and Juan Luis Segundo (Uruguay).
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   Evaluate the domestic policies of Nixon and Ford.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the domestic policies, weighing up the
      strengths and limitations, of Nixon and Ford. Candidates may refer to Nixon’s domestic program
      known as New Federalism, which advocated transferring some federal responsibilities to the
      states. Very little of this was actually done. Nixon had to deal with economic problems,
      environmental concerns, a divided country and social programs. He instituted wage and price
      controls, but inflation and unemployment both grew. Candidates may refer to Nixon’s impact on the
      environment, by creating the Environmental Protection Agency and passing the Clean Water and
      Clean Air Acts. Spending for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid all increased under Nixon.
      Regarding civil rights, integration in public schools increased under Nixon, though he allowed
      states to regulate their progress. Candidates may refer to his four Supreme Court appointments,
      which made the Court much more conservative, as a lasting legacy. Ford’s domestic policies are
      quite limited due to his two-year presidency. He struggled to improve the economy by instituting
      the Whip Inflation Now program and later enacted a tax cut. Ford attempted to move the nation
      beyond Nixon, Watergate and Vietnam, but was mostly ineffective. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   Discuss the causes and effects of the Quiet Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and
      effects of the Canadian Quiet Revolution. Causes may predate the timeframe, but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the beginnings of the
      Quiet Revolution in the election of Jean Lesage in 1960. Candidates could discuss the Catholic
      Church’s failure in education and health care, corruption in the Duplessis government, limited labor
      rights and the rise of Quebec nationalism as underlying causes. Effects could be the secularization
      of education, health care and social services as well as electoral reforms, such as lowering the
      voting age to 18, and economic reforms. Candidates may refer to the rise of French nationalism
      and the separatist movement. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Discuss the social and cultural impact of the Cold War on the Americas up to 1953.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
      cultural impact of the Cold War on the Americas up to 1953. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of social and cultural impact, or they may prioritize their discussion. However, both aspects will be
      a feature of the response. Social and cultural impact will be dependent upon the country chosen,
      but it must be related to the Cold War and during the time frame. Candidates may refer to a
      determination to stop communism and a fear of communist infiltration. For the US, this resulted in
      loyalty oaths, McCarthyism and a focus on the evils of communism in all forms of media. Movies
      and television glorified the US and stressed the benefits of democracy and capitalism. The Cold
      War also fostered the military-industrial complex and the growing fear of a nuclear war. In Canada,
      the Gouzenko Affair created similar results. Many Latin American countries ruled by US-supported
      dictators experienced severe repression aimed at eliminating communists, resulting in strong anti-
      American feeling and revolutionary activities. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


32.   Discuss the reasons for, and characteristics of, Eisenhower’s New Look foreign policy.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for and the characteristics
      of Eisenhower’s New Look foreign policy. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the reasons and
      the characteristics, or they may prioritize their discussion. However, both aspects will be a feature
      of the response. Candidates may refer to Eisenhower’s New Look foreign policy as a change from
      Truman’s direct-action policy in Korea. Reasons could include a desire to set a new course, to
      lower defence spending, to get more “bang for the buck” and to decrease reliance on conventional
      forces. Candidates may refer to the characteristics as increased reliance on strategic nuclear
      weapons, brinkmanship, massive retaliation, mutual assured destruction and the use of covert
      operations as seen in Iran and Guatemala. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   Evaluate the impact of Black Power on the civil rights movement in the United States.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the impact of Black Power on the civil
      rights movement in the United States, weighing up its strengths and importance. Candidates may
      see the impact as positive or negative or mixed, but they must support their answer with evidence
      from the period. Black Power is seen as starting with Stokely Carmichael, who grew tired of the
      slow progress made by Martin Luther King Jr, the beatings of the protesters and the actions of the
      Ku Klux Klan. Malcolm X’s philosophy of self-defence and meeting violence with violence, and the
      later formation of the Black Panthers, also contributed to the growth of Black Power. Candidates
      may refer to the resulting rifts within the civil rights movement and the loss of white support as
      negative impacts. Positive impacts could be that Black Power led to an increase in black pride,
      emphasizing black culture and African ties. The Black Panthers Ten Point Program emphasized
      education, self-reliance and economic justice programs, all of which appealed to young, urban
      blacks who had lost faith in King’s non-violent approach. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Evaluate the effectiveness of immigration reform in the United States.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of immigration reform
      in the United States, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates may refer to the
      Immigration Reform Act of 1965 as the first major attempt to end the restrictive immigration policies
      established in 1924, which had prioritized European immigration. This change allowed many more
      immigrants from Asia, Africa and Latin America, creating a more diverse United States. By the
      1980s, immigration, especially illegal immigration, had become a major political issue. Candidates
      may refer to the Immigration Reform Act of 1986 as a positive step, granting amnesty to illegal
      immigrants and enhancing border security. Immigration legislation and reform continued to be an
      issue throughout the 20th century, as many Americans saw it as a problem and a threat to their
      country. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   “Ronald Reagan’s domestic policies were largely successful.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the statement that Reagan’s domestic
      policies were largely successful. Candidates may refer to Reagan’s tax-cuts, increased military
      spending and supply-side economics. The 1980s were a time of economic growth and prosperity
      for most, but not all, Americans. Corporate investment increased, the tech-boom occurred and
      some industries experienced a rebirth. Candidates may refer to his ability to work with Democratic
      leadership, deregulation, decreased welfare programs and decreased support of affirmative action
      programs. Candidates may argue that Reagan’s policies were successful and restored confidence
      in the presidency and in America. Counter-arguments could be that Reagan created huge federal
      deficits, the success of the economy was based on deficit spending, and that the income gap
      increased. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


36.   Evaluate the impact of violent and non-violent movements in two Latin American countries.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of violent and non-violent movements in
      two Latin American countries, weighing up their strengths and limitations. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of violent and non-violent movements or they may prioritize their evaluation of one.
      The impact will be dependent upon the movements and countries chosen and may be positive or
      negative, successful or unsuccessful. Candidates may refer to the Landless Workers’ Movement in
      Brazil, the Zapatista Liberation Army in Mexico, the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo in Argentina, the
      National Liberation Army in Colombia or the peaceful protests that led to Pinochet’s downfall in
      Chile. In many cases, the Catholic Church and liberation theology promoted social movements.
      Candidates may argue that the non-violent movements were more successful in bringing about
      change, while violent movements met with strong government opposition and little civil support.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
