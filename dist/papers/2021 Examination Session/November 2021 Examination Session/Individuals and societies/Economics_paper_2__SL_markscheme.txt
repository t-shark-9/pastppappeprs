                        The idea that it is trade that is seen as unfair by one country,
                        leading to protectionism OR the idea that it is rising
                        protectionism.
               2        Accurate definition.                                                2
                        An understanding that the imposition of a trade barrier can
                        trigger off a series of retaliations by (a) trade partner(s).

           (ii)    List two functions of the World Trade Organization (WTO) (paragraph 2).          [2]

               Level                                                                     Marks

                     One function is listed.
               2     There is clear understanding.                                       2
                     A clear understanding is demonstrated by listing two of the
                     following functions of the WTO for its member countries:
                     • to set (and enforce) rules for international trade
                     • to provide a forum for negotiating trade liberalization
                     • to monitor further trade liberalization
                     • to resolve trade disputes
                     • to increase the transparency of decision-making processes
                     • to cooperate with other major international economic institutions
                         involved in global economic management to help developing
                         countries benefit fully from the global trading system.

     (b)   Using a tariff diagram, explain the likely effect on consumer surplus of a 25%
           tariff on all wooden furniture imported into the US (paragraph 5).                       [4]

                       For drawing a correctly labelled tariff diagram, with a horizontal
                       world supply line and another higher horizontal line to show the
                       effect of the tariff with the reduction in consumer surplus shaded
                       or otherwise indicated OR for an explanation that because of the
                       tariff, consumers pay a higher price and buy a smaller quantity
                       leading to a reduction in consumer surplus.
           2           There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.         3–4
                       For drawing a correctly labelled tariff diagram, with a horizontal
                       world supply line and another higher horizontal line to show the
                       effect of the tariff with the reduction in consumer surplus shaded
                       or otherwise indicated AND for an explanation that because of the
                       tariff, consumers pay a higher price and buy a smaller quantity
                       leading to a reduction in consumer surplus.

Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

Candidates may indicate the change in consumer surplus with shaded areas or
numbers/letters in the diagram (eg a loss of consumer surplus of P1P2AB in the
diagram below).

The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a tariff diagram. World supply must
be distinguished from domestic supply. If abbreviated, the world supply curve must
be labelled Sw or Sworld. A title is not necessary.

(c)      Using a foreign exchange diagram, explain the possible effect of China’s large
         current account surplus in 2007 on the exchange rate of China’s currency
         (the renminbi) (paragraph 6).                                                                    [4]

                     diagram, with the demand curve shifting right (or the supply
                     curve shifting left) and the equilibrium price of the renminbi rising
                     OR for an explanation that the surplus could mean an extra
                     demand for the currency due to more exports/greater inflows (or
                     a reduced supply of the currency due to fewer imports/fewer
                     outflows) which causes the exchange rate to rise/appreciate.

                     For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate/foreign exchange
                     diagram, with the demand curve shifting right (or the supply
                     curve shifting left) and the equilibrium price of the renminbi rising

         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

         For an exchange rate/foreign exchange diagram, the vertical axis may be
         exchange rate, price of renminbi in another currency, other currency/renminbi or
         other currency per renminbi. The horizontal axis should be quantity, or quantity of
         renminbi. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, evaluate
      China’s use of subsidies as a form of trade protection.                               [8]

      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly
      and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of trade protection, subsidy
      • an international trade diagram showing the effect of a subsidy on imports
        and/or on exports.

      Advantages of subsidies may include:
      • goods with external benefits such as solar panels may need to be subsidised
        to ensure the optimum quantity is produced (paragraph 2)
      • many other countries use subsidies and therefore China needs to use them to
        compete (paragraph 2)
      • China’s trade surplus has already been reduced and might become a deficit if
        subsidies for key export industries are not provided (paragraph 6)
      • prices of subsidised products will be lower for consumers
      • reduces inflationary pressures in the economy.

      Disadvantages of subsidies may include:
      • they increase the misallocation of resources in world trade (paragraph 2)
      • the complexity of supply chains makes it difficult to determine which firms are
         getting an unfair advantage (paragraph 6)
      • they give a disadvantage to firms in competition with Chinese firms
         (paragraphs 2 and 3)
      • they may lead to excess supply and dumping (paragraph 3)
      • they make the WTO less effective, because its rules with regards to subsidies
         at present are too limited (paragraph 3)
                                                   –7–                 N21/3/ECONO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           • subsidies are a key component of the trade war, which contributes to reduced
             global trade and investment flows (paragraph 1)
           • China's use of subsidies limits production in other South East Asian
             economies, negatively impacting their growth and development (paragraph 5)
           • the cost to governments of providing subsidies is high
           • the welfare loss due to subsidies
           • subsidies will reduce incentives for innovation/efficiency in domestic industry
             and long run competitiveness may deteriorate.

           Any reasonable evaluation.

      show the supply curve shifting right with the US dollar depreciating, which is equivalent
      to the won appreciating. If the explanation is correct, this can be fully rewarded.

      NB: the diagram may show the won initially depreciating due to declining demand
      and/or rising supply, with the demand curve then shifting right to reverse the
      depreciation. If the explanation is correct, this can be fully rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definition of depreciation
      • definition of exchange rate
      • definition of a managed exchange rate.

      Arguments for intervening to prevent depreciation may include:
      • possibly the won is already undervalued due to the downward trend from mid-
              2017 to mid-2019. It will become more undervalued if it depreciates again
              (paragraph 1 and Figure 1)
      •       it needs to consider that demand for exports now seems to be price inelastic,
              therefore a depreciation would reduce export revenues, despite the fall in price
              (paragraph 2)
      •       it needs to take action because exchange rate movements are affected by
              speculative financial flows as well as trade flows (paragraph 3)
      •       it needs to take action because the financial account has a large deficit while
              the current account has a huge surplus (paragraph 3)
      •       it needs to stabilize the foreign exchange market (paragraph 6 and Figure 1)
      •       if the exchange rate depreciates again, South Korea risks being accused by
              the US of unfair currency manipulation (paragraph 5).
      •       it needs to take action so that import prices do not rise / there is less
              inflationary pressure.

Arguments for not intervening to prevent depreciation may include:
• may be able to offset the decline in net exports by letting the exchange rate
   depreciate further (paragraph 1 and Table 1)
• macroeconomic indicators imply that a depreciation would benefit the
   economy and employment by promoting growth through cheaper exports
   (paragraph 4)
• although a depreciation might cause demand-pull (through a rise in (X-M)) and
   cost-push inflation (through a rise in import prices), present inflation rates are
   very low (paragraph 4)
• use of interest rates to stop outflows of portfolio investment affects both the
   financial account and domestic monetary policy (paragraph 4)
• market forces (rise in demand for semi-conductors, etc) may naturally cause
   appreciation (paragraph 6).
• may run out of reserves, if tries to prevent depreciation by selling its reserves
   (paragraph 6).

Any reasonable evaluation.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
includes a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Answers may include:
• definitions of aid, ODA (official development assistance), development.

Benefits of aid may include:
• needed for development because the government is not providing enough
  support (paragraph 2)
• EMDCs should provide aid because the impact of climate change (for which
  they are mainly responsible) falls more heavily on ELDCs and hampers their
  development (paragraph 3 or 4)
• can provide help in adapting to climate change (paragraph 5)
• project aid can increase employment/incomes and reduce the number of
  migrants (paragraph 6)
• humanitarian aid helps to prevent malnutrition which lowers productivity
  (paragraph 4 or 5)
• joint projects with NGOs and/or private sector firms can be effective
  (paragraph 5 or 7)
• funds from aid can break the poverty cycle
• loans are usually concessional and therefore repayments are less which
  means that there is more government expenditure available for development
  projects.

Limitations of aid may include:
• aid flows can be volatile and unreliable (Figure 2)
• aid is influenced by political considerations (paragraph 5)
• aid (tied) is sometimes directed towards military and policing projects rather
   than to reducing poverty (paragraph 5)
• remittances from migrants are much larger and can be of more direct use to
   families (Table 2, paragraph 1)
• assistance from NGOs may be more effective and reliable (paragraph 7)
• the coffee processors and retailers such as Starbucks may provide more
   useful assistance (paragraph 7)
• aid funds may be misused if there is not good governance (paragraph 2).

Any reasonable discussion.

   Alternatively, the explanation may refer to an increase in the Gini
   coefficient/index. If explained correctly, this may be fully rewarded.

   Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

   The two curves may be shown on one graph or may be shown on two graphs. If
   using two graphs, it must be clear that the curve for 2015 is closer to the line of
   equality than for 2019.

   The vertical axis should be labelled cumulative % of income, or % of income and
   the horizontal axis should be cumulative % of population/households or % of
   population/households. There must be a diagonal line, but it is not a requirement
   that it is labelled. There should be labels to indicate the difference between the
   two Lorenz curves. A title is not necessary.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly
      and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of infrastructure, development.

      Strengths of the policy may include:
      • it increases actual/real output (or real GDP) by shifting the AD curve
         rightwards
      • it increases potential output by shifting the LRAS curve rightwards/PPC curve
         outwards
      • it facilitates economic activity/the business environment and thus growth of
         GDP (paragraphs 2 and 3)
      • it will attract FDI, which has been declining (paragraph 1)
      • it is important for the growth of the manufacturing and service sectors
         (paragraph 6)
      • all the above will increase employment and incomes, which assist
         development
      • it will have positive externalities (eg railway lines), which assist development
         (paragraph 3)
      • the government considers that the resulting increased growth will enable the
         debt to be serviced through increased tax revenue, which will then allow for
         more government expenditure on development projects/welfare (paragraph 4).

Limitations of the policy may include:
• it widens the budget deficit because it requires government expenditure
   (paragraph 2)
• it has an opportunity cost, particularly affecting development, because the
   government is spending relatively less on other areas such as education and
   health (paragraphs 1, 4 and 7)
• it leads to an increase in national and international debt due to need for loans,
   many of which are non-concessional (paragraph 3)
• it increases the costs of debt servicing and outflows on the current account to
   pay interest (paragraphs 3 and 5), which reduce government expenditure on
   other items promoting development objectives
• it increases imports and therefore the deficits on the trade balance and current
   account, which will lower growth, harming employment and incomes
   (paragraphs 1 and 5)
• some projects may have negative externalities (eg dams and airports),
   harming development (paragraph 3)
• it has the effect of widening the income distribution, because growth and
   increased employment is concentrated in urban areas/manufacturing and
   service sectors (paragraph 6).

Any reasonable evaluation.
