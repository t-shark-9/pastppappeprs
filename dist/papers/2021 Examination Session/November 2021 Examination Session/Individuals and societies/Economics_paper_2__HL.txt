Answer one question either from Section A or from Section B.

                                                Section A
1.   Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.

                                               The strong Thai baht

     1   Thailand’s currency, the Thai baht, ended 2019 at its highest value in more than six years. With
         a 7.8 % gain against the United States dollar (US$), it was the currency that appreciated the
         most among major Asian currencies.

     2   The Thai baht’s appreciation was caused by several factors. Many foreign investors are
         attracted by Thailand’s economic stability, high levels of foreign reserves, low inflation rate and
         low unemployment (Table 1). However, the inflation rate is below the central bank’s target.

     3   Initially, the central bank of Thailand (BoT) was not too concerned, as the strong Thai baht was
         helping Thai importers and those who had foreign debts. Additionally, Thai producers could
         afford to import new technology and capital equipment. An appreciating currency could also help
         improve the country’s terms of trade.

     4   However, a strong currency can have severe consequences on an export-oriented country like
         Thailand. Exports account for 65 % of gross domestic product (GDP), and in 2019 exports
         declined by 7 %. Additionally, the tourism industry, which makes up approximately 20 % of GDP
         and accounts for 16 % of employment, started to express concern. Economic growth in 2019
         was 3 %, down from 4.1 % in 2018.

     5   Therefore, towards the end of 2019, the BoT implemented measures to prevent further
         appreciation of the Thai baht. The BoT reduced controls on capital outflows to make it easier
         for Thai citizens to move money abroad. Additionally, restrictions were placed on the amount of
         money foreigners could hold in Thai bank accounts.

     6   The BoT is considering further measures including the use of foreign reserves, a decrease in the
         interest rate, and imposing controls on capital inflows, to prevent speculative inflows. However,
         these controls may impact the country’s credibility and financial markets. Expansionary
         monetary policy may also increase household debt which, at 78.6 % of GDP, is among the
         highest in Asia.

     7   The BoT is concerned about using foreign reserves, as this may result in Thailand being labelled
         a currency manipulator* by the US. Currently, Thailand’s overall large current account surplus
         is the only requirement it meets to be labelled a currency manipulator. However, Thailand’s
         bilateral trade surplus with the US is currently US$19 billion, which means it is close to meeting
         a second requirement. Thailand wants to avoid being labelled a currency manipulator as the US
         may use trade protection in retaliation.


* currency manipulator: the US will label a country as a currency manipulator if the
  following three requirements are met (a country will be placed on a watchlist if they
  meet two of the requirements):
  1. The country is using its foreign reserves to change the value of its currency to
      gain an advantage
  2. The country has a bilateral trade surplus with the US of over US$20 billion
  3. The country has a current account surplus of more than 2 % of its GDP.

2.   Study the following extract and answer the questions that follow.

                     Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Indonesia

     1   The European Union (EU) and Indonesia are currently negotiating a free trade agreement (FTA).
         The agreement will aim to increase trade, avoid trade protection and expand foreign direct
         investment (FDI). Indonesia has the largest economy and population in Southeast Asia. The EU
         is Indonesia’s third-largest trading partner.

     2   The FTA could see the clothing and footwear industry in Indonesia increase by over 10 %.
         However, the labour-intensive manufacturing industry has historically been known for poor
         working conditions and low wages. On the other hand, increased output could decrease the
         high unemployment in Indonesia (currently at 12 %). The EU expects its car industry to benefit
         from the FTA. The agreement would encourage the EU to specialize in cars, and Indonesia to
         specialize in clothing, therefore both countries could benefit from comparative advantage.

     3   Since Indonesia’s main competitors already have trade agreements with the EU, establishing
         an FTA is a priority for the Indonesian government. The EU has a potential market of 510 million
         consumers, and may offer areas for growth during a time of lower global trade and uncertainty
         due to the trade war between the United States and China.

     4   However, recent trade issues between the EU and Indonesia have slowed down negotiations.
         The EU announced that palm oil biodiesel is unsustainable and will phase these fuels
         out by 2030. Experts say that palm oil causes excessive deforestation and contributes to
         climate change. Indonesia is the world’s largest exporter of palm oil.

     5   The EU has imposed tariffs on biodiesel exports from Indonesia, which may result in Indonesia
         losing a market worth over US$450 million. Palm oil represents 12 % of Indonesia’s total
         exports, contributes approximately 2.6 % to gross domestic product (GDP), and the industry
         employs more than 15 million people. The EU is Indonesia’s largest palm oil customer.
         Additionally, some EU manufacturing businesses are unhappy with the tariffs as they rely on
         palm oil to produce their products, such as processed foods.

     6   In response, Indonesia filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization (WTO), stating that the
         EU’s policy on biodiesel is unfair and is damaging the international image of palm oil. Indonesia
         claims it is committed to sustainable production practices and to protecting its forests.

     7   To make up for losing the EU’s market, Indonesia is actively exploring other markets to boost
         its exports of palm oil. Other countries like China, India and Russia have a more relaxed policy
         on palm oil and have growing demand for it. Indonesia has also retaliated to the tariff through
         an investigation into whether EU dairy products exported to Indonesia benefited from subsidies,
         and has recommended a 20 %–25 % tariff on EU dairy products.

     8   However, the EU has tried to lower tensions by offering a US$17 million grant to improve
         trade conditions and capacity in preparation for the FTA. Experts have said that the FTA could
         support the development of legal and sustainable palm oil production through supporting good
         governance and capacity building. Indonesia has stated it would welcome help to decrease any
         market failure caused by palm oil.

           advantage, explain why the EU would export cars to Indonesia and Indonesia

                                           Changing times for Vanuatu

     1   Vanuatu is an island nation in the west of the Pacific Ocean. The islands are isolated with 80 %
         of the population living in rural villages as subsistence farmers. In recent years, Vanuatu has
         experienced strong economic growth driven by tourism, construction and foreign aid. However,
         Vanuatu has a United Nations (UN) status as the world’s most vulnerable country to natural
         disasters, and this vulnerability is intensified through climate change. Furthermore, economic
         development in Vanuatu is constrained by lack of education, limited public sector capacity,
         poor infrastructure and low labour market participation rates of women and youth.

     2   Vanuatu currently faces growing income disparities between rural and urban areas. The poverty
         rate is currently at 3.8 % in the rural areas and 10.4 % in Port Vila, the capital city. Urbanization
         has led to large numbers of unskilled low-income workers concentrated in informal sectors in
         Port Vila. As a result, there is a shortage of housing, water and electricity services.

     3   The UN categorizes Vanuatu as a Least Developed Country, but it will be moving to the higher
         category of Developing Country by the end of 2020. This will mean that some special assistance
         such as access to development finance, trade and market access, and technology transfer will
         be slowly withdrawn. However, there will be benefits for Vanuatu as it will gain greater access to
         commercial lenders, foreign direct investment (FDI) and climate finance funds.

     4   To help with the transition to the new UN category, Australia and New Zealand are continuing
         aid projects to improve public sector capacity, increase economic participation of women
         and youth and improve access to electricity in Vanuatu. Moreover, Japan and China have
         significantly increased aid through grants and concessional loans. China is now the leading
         donor to Vanuatu.

     5   The Vanuatu government has targeted the development of human capital through education,
         healthcare and infrastructure. Most of the aid from China has been used to develop new airports
         and shipping ports. This infrastructure will further help producers to access export markets
         and gain economies of scale. However, government institutions need to be improved so that
         the benefits of export revenues are redistributed to those in need. Historically, the lack of good
         governance has led to misuse of funds.

     6   Economists believe the foreign aid spending could help attract FDI, which is important to help
         Vanuatu develop export markets in organic beef, sandalwood oil, tamanu oil and canarium
         nuts to provide areas for growth. Historically, growth was driven through import substitution by
         subsidizing manufacturing industries.

     7   Vanuatu is currently reforming the tax system to lower the reliance on indirect taxes and
         implementing a progressive tax system to increase government revenue. The increased tax
         revenue will also decrease Vanuatu’s dependence on foreign aid.

                                             New policies for Brazil

     1   From 2010 to 2014, Brazil experienced an economic boom with annual gross domestic product
         (GDP) growth of 8 %. During this time, the government spent heavily on social programmes
         (including cash transfers and pensions) that helped millions to get out of the poverty cycle. The
         poverty rate decreased from 22 % to 9 % and the Gini coefficient dropped from 0.581 to 0.515.
         However, the spending on social programmes resulted in fiscal deficits and a large public debt,
         which is currently 80 % of GDP.

     2   In 2015, Brazil entered a recession that lasted until 2017. During the recession GDP declined
         by an average of 3 % per year. By 2017, the number of Brazilians living in absolute poverty
         climbed by 13 %, inequality worsened, and unemployment was 12 %. From late 2017 to 2019,
         Brazil struggled to recover, with only approximately 1 % annual economic growth.

     3   Some economists blamed the slow recovery on the lack of investment in education and
         technology during the economic boom. According to those economists, investment in human
         and physical capital was necessary to improve productivity and decrease the reliance on the
         production of primary commodities. Historically, spending on education has not been effective in
         reaching the very poor.

     4   In 2018, a newly elected government, aiming to stimulate economic growth, introduced
         market-oriented policies. Since Brazil has a large economy, the new government believed that
         Brazil should take advantage of world trade and foreign investment to boost economic growth
         and achieve economic development.

     5   The new government aimed to increase the number of multinational corporations (MNCs)
         investing in Brazil through deregulation and trade liberalization. Furthermore, in 2020 several
         state-owned enterprises were privatized.

     6   Additionally, new labour market and tax reforms were introduced to create jobs, increase labour
         force participation and make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers. The reforms included
         increasing the retirement age and reducing transfer payments. However, trade unions claim that
         the reforms are unfair and will lead to the exploitation of workers.

     7   There is concern that deregulation, privatization and market liberalization will put pressure
         on Brazil’s environment, threaten sustainable development, and benefit only urban areas.
         In 2017, the government introduced “green GDP” as an official measure and committed to
         environmental protection goals. This is necessary because, for example, over 40 % of the
         population live in areas without access to a sewage system and manufacturing companies are
         dumping untreated wastewater in rivers, contributing to water pollution.
