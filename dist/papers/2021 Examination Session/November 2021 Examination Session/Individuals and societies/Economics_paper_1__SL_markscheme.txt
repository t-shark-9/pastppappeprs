Microeconomics

1.   (a)    Explain how a decrease in income might affect the demand for normal goods and
            the demand for inferior goods.                                                     [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of demand, normal good, inferior good
            • diagram(s) to show a how a decrease in income affects the demand for a
              normal good and an inferior good
            • explanation of how a decrease in income reduces the demand for normal
              goods and increases the demand for inferior goods
            • examples of normal goods and inferior goods.

            A maximum of [6] should be awarded if a candidate has only covered normal
            goods OR inferior goods.

(b)   Discuss the significance of income elasticity of demand for producers of primary
      products and producers of manufactured goods when incomes are rising.              [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of primary products, manufactured goods, income elasticity of
        demand
      • diagrams to show how the demand for primary products and for manufactured
        goods is affected by a rise in incomes
      • explanation of the impact on producers of how primary products tend to have
        a low YED because they are necessities (with few or no substitutes) for their
        buyers and demand for them changes less than proportionally when incomes
        change; explanation of the impact on producers of how manufactured goods
        tend to have a high YED because they can be luxury goods and demand for
        them increases more than proportionally when incomes increase
      • examples of primary products with a low YED and manufactured goods with a
        high YED
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of primary products that have a high YED
      and/or manufactured goods that have a low or negative YED, the YED of a good
      depends on the income level in the economy, the problems of measuring YED
      because other factors affecting the demand for primary products and
      manufactured goods apart from income are changing at the same time.

      A maximum of [9] should be awarded if a candidate has only covered producers
      of primary products OR manufactured goods.

              demanded from consumers, and a higher price to producers increases
              quantity supplied because it increases revenues and an opportunity cost to
              governments because of the expense of buying surplus production
            • examples of agricultural markets.

            consumers if the ceiling is managed through an effective alternative rationing
            system and how some consumers will gain significantly through a price ceiling
            even if others lose.

     (b)    Evaluate the view that fiscal policy is the best way to reduce unemployment.           [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of fiscal policy, unemployment
            • diagram to show how fiscal policy leads to a fall in unemployment
            • explanation of how expansionary fiscal policy leads to a rise in AD and real
              GDP, leading to a fall in unemployment as more workers are needed in
              production
            • examples of where fiscal policy has been used to reduce unemployment
            • synthesis or evaluation.

            Evaluation may include: consideration of the problems of using fiscal policy to
            reduce unemployment such as; budget deficit, inflation and it is not as effective at
            reducing unemployment that is not demand-deficient (structural, frictional). There
            could also be coverage of alternative policies such as monetary and supply side.

            • diagram to show how economic growth leads to a rise in income which could
              reduce poverty
            • explanation of how economic growth might lead to a rise in household income,
              which reduces absolute poverty
            • examples of countries where economic growth has reduced absolute poverty.

            NB Where a money value is given for absolute poverty there is flexibility on the
            value. Anything around $2 a day is acceptable.

     (b)    Evaluate the view that progressive income tax is the best way to increase equity
            in an economy.                                                                        [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of progressive income tax, equity
            • diagram to show the impact of progressive income tax on equity
            • explanation of how progressive income tax increases equity by taxing high-
              income people at a higher rate, which provides more funds for public services
              that can increase equity, such as education and healthcare
            • examples of progressive taxation to increase equity
            • synthesis or evaluation.

            Evaluation may include: consideration of the problems of applying progressive
            taxation if high-income people avoid paying or people do not expand their
            businesses and how this can reduce opportunities for people of low incomes.
            Answers might also include consideration of alternative policies to increase equity
            such as increased transfer payments and improvements to the functioning of the
            labour market.

            A maximum of [12] should be awarded if a candidate has not considered an
