Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02 command
terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be given.

Any part of an explanation or outline that is in brackets is not required for full marks, but may
appear in a response as an alternative or additional explanation.

The requirement for answers being given to two decimal places only applies to non-terminating
decimals. An accurate decimal answer is acceptable eg 2.0625 equals 33/16 exactly, so either
2.06 or 2.0625 should be rewarded.

Whenever relevant, carry over marks should be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put
OFR on the script where you are rewarding this. OFR may be awarded within a question part but
this generally applies to parts worth 3 or 4 marks only. In such cases the markscheme will
specify whether OFR will apply.


1.   (a)   Using the data in Table 1, state the reason why Firm A is operating in a perfectly
           competitive market.                                                                      [1]

           An answer which indicates that MR = P or AR = MR or that the demand curve faced by the
           firm is horizontal/perfectly elastic is sufficient for [1].

     (b)   On the following diagram, label Firm A’s cost curves. The use of figures provided
           in Table 1 is not required.                                                              [3]

(c)   Using the figures in Table 1 or the diagram in part (b),

      (i)     determine whether Firm A is productively (technically) efficient. You must
              give a reason for your choice.                                                   [2]

               1        Correct answer with incorrect reasoning.                       1
                        The firm is productively efficient.
               2        Accurate answer.                                               2
                        Since ATC = MC
                        OR (from diagram) ATC is at its minimum (so the firm is
                        productively efficient).

      (ii)    determine whether Firm A is allocatively efficient. You must give a reason
              for your choice.                                                                 [2]

                        descriptors below.
               1        Correct answer with no or with incorrect reasoning.            1
                        The firm is not allocatively efficient.
               2        Accurate answer.                                               2
                        Since AR(P) is not equal to MC, the firm is not allocatively
                        efficient.

      (iii)   determine whether Firm A is producing at the profit-maximizing
              (loss-minimizing) level of output. You must give a reason for your choice.       [2]

               Level                                                                   Marks

                        descriptors below.
               1        Correct answer with no or with incorrect reasoning.            1
                        The firm is not producing at the profit maximizing (loss
                        minimizing) level of output.
               2        Accurate answer.                                               2
                        Since MR is different from MC, the firm is not producing at
                        the profit maximizing (loss minimizing) level of output.

(d)    Using Table 1, calculate the monthly profit or loss Firm A is making at the current
      level of output, Q1.                                                                     [2]

      TR = 30 × 1500 = 45 000

      TC = 32 × 1500 = 48 000

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      π = 45 000 − 48 000

      = −$3000

      An answer of –$3000 or 3000 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      NB alternative calculation, which should be fully rewarded:

      π = (AR − ATC)Q = (30 − 32)1500 = −$3000

(e)   Using Table 1, calculate the total fixed costs incurred by Firm A at the current level
      of output, Q1.                                                                           [2]

      AFC = 32 − 28 = 4

      Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 × 𝑄𝑄 = 4 × 1500

      = $6000

      An answer of $6000 or 6000 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

(f)   Using your answer to part (e), calculate the average fixed costs if Firm A
      produces 2000 units of output per month instead of Q1 units.                             [1]

      6000
           =3
      2000

      An answer of $3.00 or 3 is sufficient for [1].

      OFR applies.

           • perfect information
           • perfect factor mobility.

(h)   Explain why a loss-making perfectly competitive firm will shut down in the long
      run but may not shut down in the short run.                                               [4]

          If a firm is making economic losses in the long run, it is not earning
          normal profits (or is not earning enough to stay in business). Award [1]
          if the answer refers only to factors not being fixed in the long run.

          OR if it is making losses in the short run, it may not shut down because
          its revenue may cover its variable costs and thus is able to make a
          contribution to its fixed costs.

          An alternative response should clearly show that, as a result of fixed
          costs, the firm makes smaller losses by continuing to operate instead of
          shutting down.

                 For an explanation that in the long run losses will force some firms to
                 exit the industry [1]; as a result, the market supply will decrease and/or
                 shift to the left [1]; the market price will then start to rise [1]; exit of firms
                 will continue until firms earn zero economic profits/normal profits or
                 losses are eliminated [1].


2.   (a)   Using the data in Table 2, calculate factor income sent (paid) abroad in 2019.                     [2]

           Identification of the value of the multiplier = 2.5 is sufficient for [1].

           An answer of $507.5 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           OFR applies if the multiplier is calculated incorrectly and the resulting incorrect
           number is applied correctly to calculate the new level of GDP.

           Accurate explanations may include:
           • Economic growth would lead to an increase in living standards, because
               growth tends to increase people’s incomes and/or leisure time.
           • Economic growth would decrease unemployment, because firms will need to
               hire more workers to increase output.
           • Economic growth could possibly decrease inequality in the distribution of
               income, because people who were unemployed will be finding jobs or
               because the government could embark on redistribution policies.
           • More resources become available to adopt cleaner technologies or there is
               more demand for a cleaner environment.
           • Higher tax revenue (as incomes and profits grow) provides more scope for
               government spending/repayment of debt.
           • If the growth is caused by an increase in LRAS, then inflationary pressure is
               lower/exports are more competitive.
            • Any other accurate explanation of a possible positive consequence

          A valid clearly outlined consequence
          Negative consequences may include:
          • Prices of agricultural products fluctuate and thus lead to volatility of
             export earnings and national income.
          • Income elasticity of demand for many such farm exports is often low so
             as incomes in advanced economies grow, demand for these exports
             grows more slowly.
          • The terms of trade for the economy could deteriorate, so the country
             needs to export a greater volume in order to finance required imports.
          • Specialization in a narrow range of agricultural products implies that the
             economy does not diversify into higher value-added manufactured
             goods / becomes vulnerable to external demand shocks or supply
             chain problems or to trade protection policies imposed by foreign
             governments.

          Accurate explanations include:
          • When an economy enters recession and workers become unemployed,
              they (automatically) receive unemployment benefits. Their (disposable
              income and thus) consumption expenditures do not decrease as much, so
              AD and national income do not decrease as much.
           • As incomes are rising during an expansion, income tax revenues
              collected rise faster. Thus, (disposable incomes and) consumption
              expenditures rise more slowly, so the increase in AD is slower than
              otherwise and national income does not increase as much, reducing
              inflationary pressures.

          be awarded [3] only.

                 The idea that the distinction relates to inflows and outflows of currency.
     2           Clear understanding.                                                               2
                 A credit item represents an inflow of currency (+ve item) into the
                 account/country, whereas a debit item represents an outflow of currency
                 (–ve item) from the account/country.

         (b)   State one example of a debit item from the financial account of the balance of
               payments.                                                                                     [1]

               Correct examples include:
               • (net) outward portfolio investment
               • (net) outward FDI
               • increase in forex reserves
               • (net) outflow of “hot money”.

               OR examples of any of the above, such as:
               Domestic residents purchasing foreign bonds / setting up a new company abroad
               or acquiring controlling percentage of shares of a foreign company / the central
               bank buying foreign currency / domestic residents buying foreign currency.

         (c)   Using Table 5, calculate the value of net current transfers for Laylaland in 2020.            [1]

               539 – 1397 = −858

               An answer of −$858 million or −858 is sufficient for [1].

         (d)   Using Table 5, calculate the net exports of goods and services for Laylaland in 2020.         [2]

               NX + Net Income + Net Current Transfers= −1865

               (Net Income= 412 − 1075 = −663)

               NX = 663 + 858 − 1865

               Any valid working is sufficient for [1]. Valid working may constitute identifying the three
               figures (663, 858, 1865) regardless of their +/- signs.

               NX = −$344 million

              Accurate explanations may include:
              • expenditure switching policies: trade barriers/protection (such
                as tariffs and non-tariff barriers) which will make imports more
                expensive / discourage imports, and thus increase net exports
                OR subsidies which will make exports more competitive and
                imports less attractive
              • weakening (depreciating) its own currency, which will make its
                imports more expensive and exports cheaper, which should
                increase net exports.
              • expenditure reducing policies, such as contractionary fiscal or
                monetary policies to reduce income growth and prices and
                thus consumption of imports. Lowering prices should also
                assist exports, which will increase net exports.
              • supply-side policies, eg deregulation, to increase
                competitiveness of domestically produced goods (lower
                production costs and prices), such as by introducing new
                technologies and by nurturing a more skilled work force, which
                will increase net exports.

              Any two methods which are well explained should be fully
              rewarded. These may be two separate supply-side policies or two
              separate expenditure switching policies (but not two types of trade
              protection) or two separate expenditure reducing policies.

            Proteinland.                                                                                   [1]

            For stating that the terms of trade have improved/risen/increased or that there
            has been a favourable movement [1].

    (l)     Explain how the increase in world demand for quinoa would likely affect the
            current account balance of Proteinland.                                                        [4]

    1            The written response is limited.                                                  1–2
                 For the idea that the current account balance would improve because of
                 increased (net) exports.
    2            The written response is accurate.                                                 3–4
                 For providing an accurate explanation that the increase in demand would
                 increase the price of quinoa [1] and increase (the quantity of) exports [1],
                 which would increase the export revenue [1] and improve the current
                 account balance (a deficit would decrease, or a surplus would increase)
                 [1].
                 NB A response which refers to PED/decrease in quantity may be
                 awarded a maximum of [3].
