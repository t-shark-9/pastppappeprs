27.   Why does the brain need a continuous supply of glucose?

      A.    Glucose stores in the brain are located behind the blood–brain barrier and are inaccessible
            to the brain cells.

      B.    Glucose is exchanged very slowly between the blood and the brain cells, so a continuous
            supply is needed.

      C.    The quantities of glycogen stored in the brain are not sufficient for the brain’s
            energy requirements.

      D.    High glucose levels in the brain impair its function.
