Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP2
Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  N21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                                  Section A
1.   (a)   (i)      State the trophic level of the zebra.                                          [1 max]

                    primary consumer/herbivore/second trophic level;

           (ii)     State how you could determine gross secondary productivity of the zebra.       [1 max]

                    measure the mass of food that the zebra eats and measure the mass of the
                    fecal loss;
                    GSP is the difference between food consumed & fecal loss/GSP = food
                    eaten – fecal loss;

           (iii)    Explain how the second law of thermodynamics applies to this food chain.       [2 max]

               i. second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy/disorder of a system
                  increases over time / conversions/transformations in energy aren’t 100%
                  efficient;
              ii. available energy is lost to environment between trophic levels;
             iii. energy is lost as heat from cell respiration;
             iv. often only 10% of available energy is passed on / 90% lost between trophic
                  levels / ecological efficiency is limited;
              v. not all parts of the grass/zebra are consumed/absorbed;

     (b)   State the type of relationship that exists between biting flies and the zebra.              [1]

           parasitism / predation / carnivory / disease vector;

     (c)   Zebra stripes may reduce the ability of the biting flies to land on the zebra.
           Describe how natural selection may have led to the evolution of zebra stripes in
           response to biting flies.                                                               [3 max]

               i.there was variation in the population / more or less stripes;
              ii.that variation arose randomly/through mutation;
             iii.biting flies are an environmental pressure / cause disease / natural selection;
             iv. having more stripes is advantageous where flies are present / zebras with
                 stripes are less prone to disease / are better adapted to survive (survival of
                 fittest);
             v. striped individuals have a reproductive advantage;
             vi. their offspring inherited the advantageous traits / stripes;

           Note: Award [2 max] if not related to biting flies.
                                                     –6–                  N21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Referring to the data in Table 1, calculate the Simpson’s diversity index (D)
           of the late successional stage. (Show your working).                                           [2]

                                                     N (N − 1)
                                                D=
                                                     ∑ n (n − 1)
                                            (360 × 359)                                     129 240
                                                                                  = = 4.96;
            ( 70 × 69 ) + ( 60 × 59 ) + ( 90 × 89 ) + ( 90 × 89 ) + ( 40 × 39 ) + (10 × 9 ) 26 040
           Note: Award [1] for correct answer; [1 max] if no working shown;
           Accept 4.96, 5.0 or 5.
           Accept any valid working.

     (b)   Define species diversity.                                                                      [1]

           species diversity is the function of the number of species/richness and their
           relative proportions/abundance/evenness (in an area);

     (c)   Explain why the diversity changes in the different successional stages.                    [2 max]

            Species diversity increases toward the later stage...
             i. because there is an increase in habitats;
            ii. as new species move or are transported into the area;
           iii. because primary productivity tends to increase as you move through the stages;
           iv. because nutrient cycling becomes more developed;
            v. because evenness/richness increases;

     (d)   (i)    State one method to determine the population size of the Keen’s mouse.                  [1]

                  Award [1] for stating appropriate method:
                  eg. capture–mark–release–recapture / Lincoln index;

           Note: Do not credit “full count/total census” or methods that would only give data of
           relative abundance eg. mouse droppings.


           (ii)   Identify two factors that could impact the accuracy of the method stated
                  in 2(d)(i).                                                                         [2 max]

             i. the number of trials carried out;
            ii. type of traps/bait used for catching mice;
           iii. type of marking used to identify captured mice (may increase predation);
           iv. time for mice to reintegrate after first capture;
            v. how easily mice become trap happy/trap shy (might skew results);
           vi. size of samples trapped;

           Notes: Allow error carried forward (ECF) if method for 2di is wrong.
           Both positive and negative impacts on accuracy would be acceptable although
           candidate does not need to specify which for full credit.

3.   (a)   (i)      Using Figure 3(a), identify the year in which the median prediction of the world
                    population will reach 10 billion.                                                       [1]

                    2055;

           (ii)     Outline one reason for the uncertainty in predicting the world’s population
                    in Figure 3(a).                                                                     [1 max]

                   i. different models/scenarios/fertility rates might use different figures in their
                      calculations;
                  ii. difficult to determine how the demographic policies of countries might change;
                 iii. factors outside our control eg. disaster / disease / war;

           Note: Do not credit vague statements about prediction being difficult. They should
           identify at least one specific factor that makes it difficult. (NB Migration is irrelevant
           because this is global population.)

     (b)   (i)      Using Figure 3(b), identify the region that has the most countries with a
                    decrease in the percentage change in population between 2010 and 2019.                  [1]

                    Europe and Northern America;

           (ii)     Outline two factors that could contribute to a reduction in population in the
                    countries in Figure 3(b).                                                           [2 max]

                i. increasing emigration due to war/natural disaster;
               ii. increasing emigration due to few job opportunities;
              iii. increasing deaths due to war/natural disaster/aging population;
             iv. high number of women in the workforce / high level of education of women
                   decreases fertility;
               v. access to contraception/family planning decreases fertility;
             vi. advanced healthcare decreases fertility;
             vii. a country’s anti-natalist population policy decreases fertility;

           Note: Accept any valid factor appropriately linked to low or decreasing fertility/high or
           increasing mortality/emigration.
                                               –8–                  N21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)     Discuss how a country’s stage in the demographic transition model (DTM) might
        influence its national population policy.                                                     [4]

        General statement: The DTM can...
        i. help a country to predict its future population growth based on current
           demographics / identify whether birth/fertility/mortality rates are
           increasing/decreasing / suggest appropriate policy to redress unwanted change;

        If in stages 1/2 it might implement programmes to improve living standards such as:
        ii. improve health care access/facilities;
       iii. vaccination policy to reduce child mortality;
       iv. invest in campaigns/education informing people on hygienic measures;
        v. fight poverty / improve economic development;
       vi. ask for international medical/economic aid;

        If in stages 2/3 it might implement programmes to slow population growth / achieve
        population stability such as:
      vii. anti-immigration policies;
      viii. policies that increase the empowerment/independence of women / raise minimum
            legal age of marriage;
       ix. increase access to contraception/sex education;
        x. support family planning programs (governmental or by NGOs);
       xi. put a limit in number of children per family (one-child policy);

        If in stages 4/5 it might implement programmes to increase population growth / stop
        population decline, such as:
       xii. pro-immigration policy;
      xiii. economic incentives for additional children / eg. baby bonuses / family allowances /
            tax deductions;
      xiv. social incentives for larger families, / eg. maternal and paternal leaves, flexible work
            schedules, public office for parents of more than 3 children, free schooling/nursing;

       Counterargument:
      xv. other factors than DTM may be more significant eg.
          cultural/religious/economic/political factors;

        Note: Responses must be linked to some aspect of the DTM to gain credit (i.e. the
        stage, or prevailing DR/BR)

                                              Section B
Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 24
with the guidance given below for each question.

4.   (a)   Identify four factors that make the use of the insecticide DDT controversial.       [4 max]

            DDT…
          i. is a very effective/affordable insecticide;
         ii. can help in the management of insect borne diseases/malaria/zika;
        iii. can help in the control of agricultural pests, improving harvests;
        iv. is a persistent (organic) pollutant / causes soil degradation/aquatic pollution;
         v. has negative effects on human health;
        vi. bioaccumulates in the bodies of organisms;
       vii. biomagnifies in food chains;
       viii. causes impact on non-target species/death of birds of prey/top carnivores;
        ix. reduces biodiversity;
                                             – 10 –               N21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain how human activities continue to affect stratospheric ozone.                     [7 max]

Introductory explanations:
     i. ozone depleting substances (ODSs)/CFCs disrupt (the dynamic equilibrium of)
        ozone formation;
    ii. ODSs are halogenated organic gases such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) / halons;
   iii. ...used as cooling agents (old refrigerators, air-conditioning units) / aerosol
        propellants (spray cans) / blowing agents (insulating foams) / fire-extinguishers /
        cleaning solvents (electronic equipment) / pesticides;

Activities that lead to increase/restoration of ozone:
 iv. pollution management may be achieved by reducing the manufacture and release of
      ozone-depleting substances;
  v. methods for this reduction include recycling refrigerants/developing alternatives to
      gas-blown plastics/ halogenated pesticides/propellants and aerosols/developing
      non-propellant alternatives;
 vi. the Montreal Protocol (on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1987)) (and
      subsequent updates) is an international agreement for the reduction of use of ODSs;
 vii. this is considered to be a very successful international agreement;
viii. national governments complying with the agreement made national laws and
      regulations to decrease the consumption/production of ODSs;

Mechanisms that lead to reduction/destruction of ozone:
 ix. UV light breaks apart the ODSs/CFCs and releases a halogen atom;
  x. … halogen atom breaks an ozone molecule apart and combines with an oxygen atom;
 xi. oxygen atoms combine with the oxygen from the halogen and release the halogen to
      start the process again;
 xii. … the halogen is considered a catalyst / why the reaction is cyclical;

Explanations of “continuing” effect on ozone:
 xiii. ODSs/CFCs have a very long lifetime in the atmosphere / there is a time lag from
       removal of ODSs to the end of ozone destruction;
 xiv. halogen atoms are removed very slowly from stratosphere; (Cl by a chemical reaction
       with methane forming hydrochloric acid)
 xv. an illegal market for ozone-depleting substances persists and requires consistent
       monitoring;
 xvi. some countries are still not complying with international agreements on bans;
xvii. HCFCs may have lower ozone depleting potential, but still destroy ozone (not phased
       out before 2020);
xviii. increasing GCC/GHGs affect polar weather conditions (increasing temperature
       difference between troposphere and cooler stratosphere), thus affecting the distribution
       of ozone (positively in 2019, negatively in 2020); (Note that this should be the only link
       with GCC accepted)


      Notes: Award [5 max] if there are no explanations of “continuing” effect on ozone.
      Accept CFCs as alternative to ODSs.

(c)   To what extent is the use of solid domestic waste (SDW) as an energy source
      beneficial to a society?                                                               [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

5.   (a)   Outline one method for measuring the impact of a build-up of dead organic
           matter in an aquatic ecosystem.                                                            [4 max]

         i. use of a biotic index/indicator species;
        ii. take samples from water source using kick samples/drag nets;
       iii. sort/identify species and count number of individuals;
      iv. calculate diversity index for samples;
        v. presence of indicator species that are particularly sensitive to pollution will indicate
            water is clean/unpolluted;
      vi. a biotic index is based on species tolerance, diversity and relative abundance;
      vii. impact judged by changes in diversity over a range of time or space;

           OR

      viii. measuring Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) / the amount of dissolved oxygen
            required to break down the organic material in a given volume of water through aerobic
            biological activity;
       ix. collect samples from the water source upstream, at source, downstream following a
            standard procedure;
        x. measure dissolved oxygen in collected samples;
       xi. place sealed samples in dark for five days and re-measure dissolved oxygen in
            samples / BOD calculated by the change in the dissolved O2 measurements over 5
            days (mg L–1);
      xii. repeat dissolved oxygen measurements after a suitable time frame (eg. 1 month);
      xiii. impact judged by changes in BOD over a range of time or space;

           Notes: Credit can be similarly awarded for impacts on other valid components of
           ecosystem eg. turbidity / dissolved O2.
           If candidate addresses more than one method then only give credit for most high
           scoring.

(b)   Explain how models of ecosystems might be used in species conservation.                 [7 max]

      Notes: Award [2 max] for valid named examples of ecosystem models eg. food chains
      / webs / pyramids / systems diagrams / flow charts / aquaria / zoos / microcosms /
      biodiversity indices / computer programmes / mathematical models.
      Credit can be given for any of the following ways in which models may assist
      conservation:

          i.   models of ecosystems can give holistic perspective on conservation;
         ii.   flows of energy and matter / box-and-arrow models can be used to identify key
               storages/processes for conservation;
        iii.   modelling may consider biodiversity measures to help in evaluating
               conservation;
        iv.    measures of genetic diversity help to determine breeding plans for species
               conservation;
        v.     physical models can help in studying abiotic needs of a species;
        vi.    modelling feeding interactions / predator-prey interactions allows
               conservationists to determine the needs of species;
        vii.   modelling feeding interactions can demonstrate possible trophic cascades and
               provide information about benefits of conservation;
       viii.   modelling biotic interactions can help identify potential threats/essential
               interactions to the conservation of a species;
        ix.    modelling energy/matter flows helps determine habitat needs/area for a
               species;
         x.    modelling is likely to be used in combination with field observations/community
               needs;
        xi.    modelling may miss emergent properties of a system and therefore not help in
               species conservation;
       xii.    modelling may not take account of human activities / unpredictable events;
      xiii.    modelling may not take account of rare events, such as natural disasters;
       xiv.    mathematical modelling may quantify population dynamics;
        xv.    ...thus allow predictions on probability of extinction/recovery;
       xvi.    microcosm may study effects of disturbance on species;
      xvii.    single species models may be too simplistic and fail to predict actual behaviour
               of ecosystem
      xviii.   zoos can be designed to reflect the specific features of an endangered species
               niche;

(c)   Discuss how the introduction and re-introduction of a species can affect an
      ecosystem.                                                                              [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology introduction of species as alien
         species; introduction of species that become invasive species; re-introduction of
         species that were previously removed from an ecosystem; restoration;
         competition; biodiversity; food chain interactions; resource partitioning and
         evolution of niche (fundamental vs realised); limiting factors/carrying capacity;
         extinction; trophic cascades and keystone species;
      • breadth in addressing and linking explains difference between introduction
         and re-introduction of a species; considers both positive and negative effects;
         impact on biodiversity; addresses cultural / societal perspectives; considers role
         of community / government / NGOs in success;
      • examples include both alien species and re-introduced species in a variety of
         habitats;
      • balanced analysis needs to consider value of both introduction and re-
         introduction and the benefits and challenges in the local communities and
         ecosystems; accidental or deliberate;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg. the introduction of a species can result in a range of
         impacts, including only minor changes in competition for indigenous species
         and realignments of realised niches through resource partitioning, to very large
         impacts through competition, loss of biodiversity and ultimately extinction of
         native species, eg. after the introduction of brown snakes into Guam or the
         American crayfish into UK freshwater systems. The re-introduction of a species,
         eg. wolves to Yellowstone National Park, also leads to increased competition
         and changes in distribution and population size of native species but can also
         lead to positive trophic cascades and an increase in biodiversity;

6.   (a)   Outline the albedo effect and its role in regulating the Earth’s global temperature.   [4 max]

          i. albedo is a measure of the reflectiveness of a surface / is greater from lighter-
             coloured/smoother surfaces;
         ii. high albedo means that solar radiation is reflected away from a surface/reducing
             temperature / low albedo means that solar radiation is absorbed by a
             surface/increasing temperature;
        iii. oceans/ice/clouds contribute significantly to Earth’s albedo;
        iv. the balance between the albedo of the Earth’s surfaces involves feedback loops;
         v. negative feedback loops reduce change (retain the balance in ratio of albedo) and
             maintain the global temperature;
        vi. eg. rise of global temperature  increased evaporation  increased cloud cover
              increased albedo and reflection of solar radiation  decrease in global
             temperature;
       vii. a change in the balance can result in a positive feedback loop which amplifies
             changes and results in a rise in the Earth’s global temperature;
       viii. eg. rise in global temperature  increase melting in ice caps  decrease in
             albedo  increase in solar radiation absorption  rise in global temperature;

           Note: Accept alternative feedback loops.

(b)     Compare and contrast the adaptation strategies to climate change for two
        societies.                                                                                [7 max]

        The following adaptation strategies can be credited provided it is clear whether they
        are common to both societies (compare) or are a point of difference (contrast).

           weather readiness…
         i. flood defences;
        ii. increase resilience of ecosystems, eg. flood retention in mangroves/marshes;
       iii. support water saving/reduction schemes (for droughts);
      iv. planting of crops in previously unsuitable climates;
        v. tree plantings, shady areas, reflective construction materials, green roofs, and the
            ecological management of rainwater;
      vi. produce plans for heatwaves;
      vii. develop rapid response teams;

       health…
  viii. vaccination programmes;
   ix. reduce water and air borne diseases;

       education…
    x. include climate change in educational curriculum;
   xi. provide information to citizens about risks;
  xii. capture indigenous knowledge for benefit of all;
  xiii. invest/support scientific research into climate change monitoring and adaptation;

       infrastructure and economy…
  xiv. desalinization plants;
  xv. diversification away from climate sensitive industries;
  xvi. increase resilience of communities through economic development;
 xvii. increased resilience of buildings and infrastructure (to heat waves, flooding);
 xviii. legislation and planning to consider climate impacts;
  xix. monitoring, forecasting and early alert systems;

        Award [3 max] if strategies are simply described but not clearly compared or
        contrasted between two named societies.

(c)   Discuss whether biodiversity loss or climate change is a greater threat to human
      societies                                                                             [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology biodiversity (habitat, species,
         genetic); climate change; threats to ecosystems from biodiversity loss;
         threats to ecosystems from climate change; impact of these on human
         societies; threats to food production from both; extinction; hotspots;
         sustainable development goals;
      • breadth in addressing and linking tipping points; positive and negative
         feedback loops; regime shifts/alternative stable states; possible use of
         solutions to address challenges of each threat (mitigation, adaptation,
         conservation strategies); benefits of biodiversity; ecosystem resilience;
         ecosystem stability; biome shift; loss of keystone species; conservation,
         EVSs; uncertainty of GCC impacts/modelling;
      • examples of scale of biodiversity loss; impacts to food
         webs/productivity/ecosystems; examples of climate change impacts on
         ecosystems/society/economics/energy production (at both global and local
         scale); examples of causes of biodiversity loss and of climate change;
      • balanced analysis two-way (bidirectional) interaction of climate change and
         biodiversity loss; contrast efficiency/difficulty of conservation/management
         strategies to mitigation/adaptation strategies (in the context of different
         EVSs); political implications (national & international agreements, role of
         NGOs); compare present rate and scale to past events; contrast local to
         global scale;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg. I believe climate change is a bigger threat to human
         societies as it will result in biodiversity loss in more systems than areas
         which could gain in biodiversity and result in multiple impacts on human
         health, human populations from severe weather, however without building
         ecosystem resilience through preserving biodiversity, climate change will be
         even more of a threat to human societies;

7.   (a)     Identify four strategies that can be used in the sustainable management of wild
             fisheries.                                                                                 [4 max]

         i. use of quotas / international regulations against overfishing/by-catch/fishing
             endangered species;
        ii. designation of marine protected areas (exclusion zones) / restriction of fishing
             zones;
       iii. restrictions/bans on types and size of fishing gear (including mesh size / bottom
             trawling / drift nets/ cyanide/dynamite fishing);
       iv. restrictions on time/season/size/age allowed to fish;
        v. monitoring illegal fishing through technology/permits/licenses;
       vi. research and support of calculation of maximum sustainable yield;
      vii. labelling schemes to provide consumers with information on sustainability of fish;
      viii. campaigns to reduce consumption of wild caught fish / promotion of aquaculture;


     (b)     Evaluate the sustainability of two water management strategies to improve
             access to freshwater resources in a society.                                               [7 max]

              Examples of strategies [2 max]:
           i. reservoirs; dams; rainwater harvesting; water diversion projects; international sale of
              water resources; desalination; artificial glaciers; cloud seeding; water
              conservation/grey water reuse; restoration of wetlands; prevention of water pollution;
              pumping of aquifers;

            Evaluation may include factors such as…
        ii. impact of cost on economic sustainability of population;
       iii. demand placed on human / physical resources;
       iv. climate impact – carbon negative/neutral/positive;
        v. impact on ecosystem resilience;
       vi. impact on biodiversity;
      vii. interference with natural cycles;
      viii. limiting geographical/climatic factors;

             The following examples of water management strategies and their evaluation show
             how credit can be given for any appropriate strategy.

             Example 1: Rainwater harvesting;
             Positive:
             does not impact natural water cycle / replenishment rate / impossible to reduce natural
             income;
             free natural capital;
             useful for watering plants/irrigation / washing / fire protection / (thus) reduces
             consumption of groundwater/other freshwater resources;

             Negative:
             availability restricted temporally and spatially (unequal distribution of rain /
             unpredictable supply);
             usually not safe for drinking;
             can’t satisfy needs of irrigation of commercial agriculture;
                                      – 19 –              N21/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Example 2: Desalinization;
Positive:
sustainable if energy required produced by photovoltaic cells;
sea water is more available than freshwater;
provides accessible/safe drinking/irrigation water;
salt may be used for producing useful chemical products (sodium hydroxide,
hydrochloric acid);
reduces pressure on freshwater reserves that need protection;

Negative:
requires huge amounts of energy / increase GCC if fossil fuel used;
not available in landlocked countries;
building of facilities result in environmental damage/pollution;
disposing of salt (brine) poses environmental hazards/pollutes ocean / salt is
contaminated so can’t be eaten;
high cost to build and operate that may be economically unsustainable;

Notes: Award [1 mark] for each appropriately identified strategy for improving
access to freshwater up to [2 max].
Do not accept simplistic statements not clearly linked to sustainability, eg. cheap /
efficient / doesn’t need elaborate equipment/scientific expertise.
Accept statements such as “its cost is too great to be economically sustainable / its
cost may divert economic resources away from habitat/species protection / resource
requirement maybe unsustainable for LEDCs”.
Award [5 max] if only positive OR only negative evaluation OR only one strategy
evaluated.
Award [1 max] for each clear negative or positive evaluation of each factor.

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with

      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology environmental value systems;
         ecocentric/anthropocentric/technocentric; sustainability; sustainable
         development; environmental indicators; ecological footprint; natural capital &
         income; aquatic and terrestrial food production; soil; biodiversity;

      • breadth in addressing and linking inclusion of both aquatic and terrestrial
         systems; variety of systems in different climates; variety of factors affecting
         sustainability (sub-topic 5.2);
      • examples of food production systems in terrestrial systems and aquatic
         systems;
      • balanced analysis includes ecocentric, anthropocentric and technocentric
         solutions and a mix of terrestrial and aquatic systems; and evaluation of their
         relative impact on sustainability;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg. an ecocentric approach to food production may be the
         most sustainable with minimal input of pesticides, fertilizers and small-scale
         production but the addition of some low technological solutions such as
         monitoring of climate and drip irrigation with an anthropocentric addition of
         setting limits to the use of pesticides and fertilizers and incentives to reduce
         climate change will be the most successful approach;

      Note: IB considers anthropocentrism as “humans sustainably managing global
      system” (through regulations/policies/incentives etc) rather than the common
      dictionary definition that it means simply “humans are the central/most significant
      entities in the world” leading to an understanding of the EVS as cornucopian
      (which it isn’t necessarily). Responses addressing anthropocentrism should be
      evaluated in this light.
