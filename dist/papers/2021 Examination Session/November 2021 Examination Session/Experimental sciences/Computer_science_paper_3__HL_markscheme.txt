Subject details:              Computer science HL paper 3 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.


General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
  got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.

• Question 4 is marked against markbands. The markbands represent a single holistic criterion applied
  to the piece of work. Each markband level descriptor corresponds to a number of marks. When
  assessing with markbands, a “best fit” approach is used, with markers making a judgment about
  which particular mark to award from the possible range for each level descriptor, according to how
  well the candidate’s work fits that descriptor.

General guidance

 Issue             Guidance
 Answering         • In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity      • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses        eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 prescribed in       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 the questions     • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
                     explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                     This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation
                     etc.

           Offspring 1
           PMX algorithm randomly selected sub-sequence of P1 is copied into the first
           offspring;
           P2 contributes the remaining cities to the first offspring;
           To ensure that P2 cities are not duplicated, they are mapped against P1;

           Offspring 2
           The remaining cities in P1 (i.e. not copied to offspring 1) are copied into the second
           offspring;
           P2 contributes the remaining cities to the second offspring;
           To ensure that P2 cities are not duplicated, they are mapped against P1;

           Award [1] for this alternative offspring 2 solution if offspring 1 is correctly described

3.   Award [6 max].
     A heuristic is an algorithm that does not guarantee an optimal solution;
     Instead, a stopping criterion is determined before running;
     Heuristic sacrifices accuracy (optimization) for speed;
     Heuristics use randomness to escape local extrema / for exploration;
     Unlike heuristics, brute-force does not build off previous success/is entirely
     explorative and novel;
     Given enough processing power/time, a brute force approach will always produce
     an optimal solution;
     A brute-force approach is not suitable / heuristic only suitable approach for non-
     polynomial (computationally intractable) problems;
     The number of different permutations if the number of cities is high will make the
     problem difficult to solve computationally;
     In some situations, an optimal solution may be necessary ethically (e.g. where
     people’s;
     lives are at risk) / In other situations, a non-optimal solution can be used;
                                                                                                       [6]

4.   Award [12 max].

     Roulette wheel selection
       • Effective with large-sized problems.
       • Low fitness parents of the population have a chance for be selected.
       • This is important in hill climbing/avoiding local minima.
       • When a population contains only individuals with scores of large, nearly equal
           values, the selection probability of all individuals becomes nearly identical.
       • Other types of selection may be more suitable for smaller search spaces.
       • Prevents overly quick convergence.
       • Populations must be sorted on every cycle.

     Cyclic crossover (CX)
        • Allows for two parents chromosomes/cities to be combined/preserved.
        • And not be duplicated during crossover.
        • Ensures diversity of chromosomes/cities from parents.
        • Accelerates the search process in genetic algorithms.

     Population size
        • It is difficult to decide upon a population size.
        • Too large a population will increase the likelihood of a near-optimal solutions but
           will increase the length of time to run through a generation.
        • A large enough population may have enough diversity to arrive at a near-optimal
           solution without any mutation.
        • Too small a population may mean that you may never arrive at a near-optimal
           solutions;
        • Because there is not enough variation in the parents.
        • This may require you to increase the mutation rate, which will add greater
           variation.
        • But may also not arrive at a near-optimal solution.

     Initial routes
         • A random generation of cities would not be an optimal initial population.
         • Some form of optimization of the initial population could be done.
         • A scale map of the cities could be created and people attempt an optimal route
              by drawing the path between.
         • These human attempts at the optimal solution could be used for the initial
              population.
         • Along with some random routes to ensure variation.

     Mutation rate
        • Typical mutation rate is around 1%.
        • A higher value will result in a more random population.
        • Too high and the population will not evolve towards a near-optimal solution.
        • Too low and there may not be enough diversity in the population to find a near-
            optimal solution.
        • Mutation allows you to escape from local minima optimisation.

     Stopping criterion
        • A set number of iterations (generations). This could be based on run for 100
           iterations or run for a set period of time. This solution would rely on chance for
           estimating the number of iterations required to ensure convergence.
        • A set number of iterations (generations) when the best route does not change.
           For example, if after 100 generations the value doesn’t change for another 30
                                              –8–                N21/4/COMSC/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


          generations (ie, 30%) then the algorithm stops. This would increase the likelihood
          of convergence.
    •     Set a target distance for the route and run the algorithm until that distance is
          reached.

 Conclusion
   • A final measured conclusion is included in which the candidate links together the
       various points in evaluating the probability of success.
