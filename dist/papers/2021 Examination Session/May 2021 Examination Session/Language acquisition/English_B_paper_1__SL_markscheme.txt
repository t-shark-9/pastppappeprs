Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3
             Basic grammatical structures are used.
             Language contains errors in basic structures. Errors interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task.
             Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
    4–6
             complex structures.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied.
    7–9      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
  10–12
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of
           the task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type, appropriateness
of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

 You have come up with an idea for a game that introduces players to the culture or landmarks of
 a country or region. You want to convince a big company to develop it. Write a text in which you
 describe the game and explain why you think it will be a success.

 Brochure                          Official report                  Proposal

Criterion B:
• The focus of the question is on the game itself and how it will help players know the culture or
  landmarks of a country/region. It is expected, though, to have some scripts catering for a
  detailed description of a landmark and how it reflects the culture of the region/country intended
  OR including cost, people involved, advertising the game, etc. to convince the company. This is
  permissible as long as the two aspects of the question “describe” and “explain” are fully
  developed and linked to the cultural aspect.
• “How it will be a success” is expected to be principally linked to introducing players to the culture
  or landmarks. Some scripts, though, might link this aspect to how enjoyable or accessible (thus
  successful) the game is to players. This is permissible as long as the cultural aspect is not
  ignored or minimally introduced.
• The two aspects of the question: “describe” and “explain” may be presented in an overlapping
  manner. Thus, it may not be expected to have scripts addressing each aspect separately as
  long as the script clearly addresses both and supports ideas effectively.


Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                            Text type         Rationale
Appropriate                 Proposal          The text type is suitable for making a proposal, to be
                                              read by a specific person or entity, such as ‘a
                                              company’.
Generally appropriate       Brochure          The text type is suitable for providing information in a
                                              persuasive way but it is typically produced for general
                                              mass audience. The choice may be considered
                                              “appropriate” if the response makes clear that the
                                              target audience is a company.
Generally inappropriate     Official report   The text type is typically used to report on a topic in
                                              an objective way, and upon request. It is not usually
                                              written proactively to persuade an individual or entity.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Formal register
• Serious and persuasive tone – probably excited as well

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

 Online learning is becoming popular these days and seems to help students to succeed in
 school. However, you feel that the local government is not doing enough to give all students
 access to it and you want to voice your opinions. Write a text in which you explain your views
 and suggest what the local government should do.

 Brochure                          Letter to the editor             Proposal

Criterion B:
• The opinions voiced in the letter need to be clearly focused on “the government not doing
  enough to give all students access to online learning”, not whether online learning has been
  handled successfully by the government or not OR other aspects of online learning irrelevant to
  “access”. It is expected that some scripts refer to the positive side of the experience, which is
  permissible provided the aspects of the question are fully developed without any loss of focus.
• Two elements are required in the question: “explain the views” and “suggest what the local
  government should do”. There does not need to be equal space devoted to each of the two, but
  none of them should be left minimal (in a single sentence) or completely ignored.
• It is expected to have more than one suggestion offered. However, should the script introduce
  one single suggestion only, this should be fully developed and well-supported with examples
  and details.
• “Access to online learning” could include devices, equipment, Internet cost, Wifi availability,
  budget, resources, etc. “Explain your views” could include benefits, steps to follow, what the
  government did/hasn’t done, what the source of the problem is, research findings, etc. All ideas
  need to be clearly linked to the idea of “access” to the Internet.
• The response could be written from a student's, teacher's, parent's etc., perspective.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                            Text type        Rationale
Appropriate                 Letter to the    The text type is suitable for the purposes of voicing

Generally appropriate       Proposal         The text type is suitable for provoking action, but it is
                                             typically written for a specific person or entity. The
                                             choice may be considered “appropriate” if the
                                             response makes clear that the text is to be read by the
                                             local government.
Generally inappropriate     Brochure         The text type is typically used to provide information
                                             about something. It is not usually used to voice
                                             opinions.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.

Register and tone:
• Formal to semi-formal register.
• Serious, friendly and persuasive tone

Task 3

    You went to the opening of a museum last weekend. The museum is the first of its kind in your
    city and you want to inform students about it. Write a text in which you explain what the museum
    is about and highlight its most special features.

    Article                         Brochure                         Official report

Criterion B:
•     It is not necessary that the writer refers to an actual museum. What is expected is reference to
      any name (real or made up) and a brief mention of why it is the first of its kind in the city.
• It is expected that the “specific features” be plural i.e. there should be 2 or more distinguishable
  features. If there is really only one feature, and this is very general and superficial, script will be
  marked down.
• It is expected to have “why it is one of its kind” as one feature. This is permissible as long as it is
  well-developed. Other aspects that might be explored under “features” are: special location,
  fees, decoration, etc.
• Two elements are required in the question: “explanation of what the museum is about” and
  “highlighting its most specific features”. There does not need to be an equal space devoted to
  each of the two, but none of them should be left minimal (barely mentioned in a single
  sentence) or completely ignored.
• The two aspects of the question: “what the museum is about” and “features” may be presented
  in an overlapping manner. Thus, it may not be expected to have scripts addressing each aspect
  separately as long as the script clearly addresses both and supports ideas effectively.


Criterion C:

                                                The choice may be considered “appropriate” if the
                                                response makes clear that the target audience is
