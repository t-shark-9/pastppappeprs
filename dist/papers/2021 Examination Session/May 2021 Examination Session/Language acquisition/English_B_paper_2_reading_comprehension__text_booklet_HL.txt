             No exams, no uniform and no football team:
                 Inside the best school in the world
   1      Welcome to High Tech High, where classes are just as likely to be making skateboards as
          studying maths, yet 95 % go on to university.

   2      A group of casually dressed teenagers are
          chattering about their upcoming lessons. The
          walls around them are hung with artwork.
          Subject boundaries are fluid. Maths and physics          Non-essential image removed
          are taught as one. English and history share
          time. An art and physics scheme resulted in a
          school full of life-size wooden staircases which
          led nowhere.

   3      High Tech High has achieved fame thanks to a documentary called Most Likely To Succeed,
          which showed the life of the school and has been screened around the world.

   4      At this school, written exams have been replaced by projects that are displayed to an
          audience of parents, alumni and locals. The teens don’t carry satchels of books and the
          corridors are locker-free. But everywhere there’s an air of purpose and good fortune.

   5      This is a school that gets results for its pupils. Pupils are not elite: 15 % have special
          educational needs, 50 % are low-income and 44 % of the graduates are the first in their
          family to go on to higher education.

   6      High Tech High was envisioned by Larry Rosenstock, who rethought schooling for the
          21st century. He looked at all the elements of a child’s education and he posed the question:
          How can a system of education that was set up to produce workers for the factories of the
          19th and 20th century be relevant to young people today?

   7      In previous generations, workers sat in rows in offices or stood in line by conveyor belts*.
          They needed to learn discipline, patience and an understanding of hierarchy. In the
          21st century, employment already looks quite different. With less job security and a
          fast-changing job market, workers need to learn flexibility, resilience and teamwork. In
          addition to academic skills, there will also be more focus on technology, politics and
          language.

   8      The school teaches children aged 14–18. The youngest and most senior years share the
          ground floor, with the elders acting as positive role models for the newbies.

   9      The school’s approach to teaching and learning reflects Rosenstock’s approach. He
          discovered that if children made things as they learnt, their comprehension of the topic was
          improved. Deeper learning is based on encouraging critical thinking, learning to collaborate,
          and effective presentation skills.


* conveyor belts: a continuously moving strip of rubber or metal which is used in
  factories for moving objects along

            An Extract from Boyhood: Scenes from provincial life
         He is healthy, full of life and energy, yet seems always to have
         a cold. In the mornings he wakes up tight-throated, red-eyed,
         sneezing uncontrollably, his body-temperature soaring and
         plunging. “I’m sick,” he croaks to his mother. She rests the back
    5    of her hand against his forehead.

         There is one more difficult moment to get through, the moment
         when his father says, “Where’s John?” and mother says, “He’s
         sick,” and his father snorts and says, “Pretending again.”                Non-essential image removed
         Through this he lies as quiet as he can, till his father and his
  10     brother are gone and he can at last settle down to a day of
         reading.

         He reads at great speed and with total absorption. During his
         sick spells his mother has to visit the library twice a week to
         take out books for him: two on her cards, another two on his
  15     own. He avoids the library himself in case the librarian asks
         questions when he brings his books to be stamped.

         He knows that if he wants to be a great man, he ought to be reading serious books. He ought to
         be like Abraham Lincoln or James Watt, studying by candlelight while everyone else is sleeping,
         teaching himself Latin and Greek and astronomy. He has not abandoned the idea of being a
  20     great man; he promises himself he will soon begin serious reading; but for the present all he
         wants to read are stories.

         If his father likes Shakespeare, then Shakespeare must be bad, he decides. Nevertheless,
         he begins to read Shakespeare, in the yellowing edition with the tattered edges that his father
         inherited, trying to discover why people say Shakespeare is great. Besides Shakespeare, his
  25     father owns the poems of Keats. His mother owns the poems of Rupert Brooke. These poetry
         books have pride of place on the mantelshelf in the living-room.

         One day his father comes to his room with the Wordsworth book. “You should read these,” he
         says, and points out poems he has ticked in pencil. A few days later he comes back, wanting to
         discuss the poems. “The sounding cataract haunted me like a passion,” his father quotes. He
  30     refuses to meet his father’s eye, to play the game. It is not long before his father gives up.

         He is not sorry about his churlishness. He cannot see how poetry fits into his father’s life; he
         suspects it is just pretence. When his mother says that in order to escape the mockery of her
         sisters she had to take her book and creep away in the loft, he believes her. But he cannot
         imagine his father, as a boy, reading poetry, who nowadays reads nothing but the newspaper.

  35     He watches his father reading the newspaper. He reads: flipping through the pages, cracking
         and slapping the pages as he turns them. When he is done with reading he folds it into a narrow
         panel and does the crossword puzzle.

                Inside the world of India’s cyborg artists
         One evening, Harshit Agrawal started thinking about The Anatomy Lesson of
         Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, an oil on canvas masterpiece painted by Rembrandt in 1632.

         Rembrandt’s painting was done at a time when medical
         technology was nascent and the general public saw it with
   5     fear and fascination. The portrait planted germs of an idea
         in Agrawal’s mind.

         Agrawal started trawling the web for images and videos of        Non-essential image removed
         human surgeries being performed. He was getting out of
         the artists’ frame of mind to slip into the engineer’s mind.

  10     In the next few days between his day job as a human-
         computer interaction designer, the feverish 26-year-old
         curated a dataset of 60 000 images of human surgery, fed
         it to an algorithm he patched together on remote servers
         somewhere on the cloud, and waited for the machine to do its magic. Agrawal’s labour of love
  15     was a set of disquieting images he named: “The anatomy lessons of Dr Algorithm”.

         Welcome to the world of Cyborg Artists, where emerging artists use artificial intelligence (AI)
         to create art. Fewer than 100 such artists exist in it and just a handful of them are in India.
         AI-powered art is all the buzz in the art world these days and that makes Agrawal special and
         his set of images an early work.

  20     “There’s an interesting back and forth between an artist and a technologist,” Agrawal says.
         “You have to think possibilities and how that may translate into an algorithm and the data that
         feeds into it.”

         According to Cyborg Artists, art is being challenged. “We call this the ‘photography moment’
         of our time since this is the second existential crisis that art is facing,” says Raghava KK,
  25     artist and curator of Nature Morte, a contemporary art gallery where Agrawal’s work was
         showcased.

         Photography challenged the purpose of art at a time when artists mostly used real-life
         imagery. Early photographs mimicked art: perfect symmetry, portraits and so on. Later on,
         however, photography became an art form of its own and, in turn, influenced artists.

  30     Like Agrawal, Raghava is a Cyborg Artist. Raghava’s early works involved using a tablet
         computer as a medium, but he has focused on using AI for the last few years. It all started off
         as a fun project. At first, it was mostly technologists rigging up their own algorithms, but then
         came artists who were comfortable with technology. The movement is now on the cusp of a
         major expansion with more and more artists starting to use the medium.

  35     Raghava’s work is underpinned by a belief that the definition of what it means to be human
         needs to change. This is also the genesis of a thesis these artists have begun to propose:
         a new way of thinking about human evolution. “We’re already augmented humans. We’re not
         just humans. We think of ourselves as cyborgs,” Raghava comments over filter coffee at his
         family home in Jayamahal.
