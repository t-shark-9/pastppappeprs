         in the fall. Talented students from grade 2* to college
         star in it.

    5    Performance dates are scheduled for October 10–                   Non-essential image removed
         October 27 and the show will be presented at
         ENCORE! Theatre. Ticket prices are $26.00. There are
         discounts for youth and seniors.

         The musical is based on the novel Matilda by Roald
   10    Dahl. The young actors bring the story to life with their
         energy. The show, full of dances and songs, is a treat for the ears and eyes, brain and heart. It

         Matilda the Musical has won 47 international awards and continues to please audiences of all

   15    Matilda is a five-year-old little girl with astonishing intelligence and magical powers. Her
         parents, however, laugh at her love of reading and passion for learning. On the other hand, her
         schoolteacher, Miss Honey, appreciates her extraordinary personality and intelligence.

         Matilda’s school life isn’t easy. The school’s cruel headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, hates children
         and just loves inventing horrible punishments for those who don’t follow her rules. But Matilda is
   20    brave and clever, and with the help of her loyal friends and her caring teacher, she will change
         both the school and her own life when she starts to use her amazing magical powers.

         Everyone in the audience will be delighted by the story of the special little girl with an
         extraordinary imagination.

         Peter Tabichi is a math and science teacher who has worked to change the life of
         students in a poor area in Kenya. He has won the $1 million Global Teacher Prize this
         year. Over 10 000 teachers from 179 different countries took part in the contest.

         Mr Tabichi works at Keriko Secondary School in Pwani Village, Kenya. The school is in an
   5     isolated area and it faces many challenges. The classes are huge. The school does not
         have many teaching materials. There is only one computer at the school, and the internet
         connection is not very good.

         Despite these difficulties, Mr Tabichi has led his students to great results. Although the
         number of students has doubled in the last three years, there have been fewer behavior
  10     problems. His students have taken part in national and international science fair contests
         with creative science projects. In one project, they created electricity from local plants.
         Last year, the students won first place at a national science fair.

         Mr Tabichi helps students by also teaching them after school and on weekends. He is also
         working to help the families of his students and the other people in the area. For example,
  15     once every three or four years, the area is hit by a serious drought, so Mr Tabichi has
         taught the local people how to grow plants that can survive when there isn’t much rain.
         The school is in an area of Kenya where there has been a lot of fighting, and Mr Tabichi
         has created a Peace Club to help people find ways to get along.

         Mr Tabichi comes from a family of teachers. He is a religious man so he believes in
  20     living simply and helping those around him. He also gives 80 % of the money he earns to
         help people in need. Mr Tabichi said that he would like to use the money he has won to
         improve his school. He wants to help build up the science programme. He also hopes to
         buy more computers and get the school a better internet connection.

          An activist shares her ideas for fighting the climate crisis
         More than 500 young people from around the world came to the United Nations Youth
         Climate Summit in New York over the weekend to discuss how to solve the climate crisis.
         Here’s what one young person suggested the world needs to do.




                                      Non-essential
                                     image removed




         Bertine Lakjohn is 18. She comes from the Marshall Islands, a country in the Pacific Ocean
   5     made up of more than 1000 islands that are on average just over 2 meters above sea
         level. Global warming is bringing more frequent and more violent storms and the country’s
         existence is threatened because the level of the sea is rising.
         Bertine said her interest in climate issues began when she was in high school.
         [ – 28 – ]
  10     In high school I facilitated a youth leadership camp about why leadership is important in
         fighting climate change. First, we educated young people about leadership, and about
         the impact of climate change. Then we had a dialogue about climate change and invited
         government officials to this discussion.
         I also wrote a poem. It was about how industrialization has a huge impact on not just the
  15     environment but also on our culture and our traditions.
         [ – 29 – ]
         I moved to Japan for high school, and when I came back everything was entirely different.
         Before I left, the water was warmer in a place where I used to like swimming, and then
         when I came back it was super cold. The fish that swam there are no longer there. That’s
  20     when I knew I had to do something about it urgently.
         [ – 30 – ]
         Before, youth were only informing people that climate change was happening. Now we’re
         pressuring the government, not just people in general, but the people who can actually do
         something. We’re telling them that we can’t just wait until the crisis hits us.
  25     [ – 31 – ]
         I think governments need to listen to youth. In my country, it’s mostly the youth that are
         taking initiative on this climate change issue and the best way for us to have a voice is to
         have youth representation in the government.
