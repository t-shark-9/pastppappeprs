          An activist shares her ideas for fighting the climate crisis
         More than 500 young people from around the world came to the United Nations Youth
         Climate Summit in New York over the weekend to discuss how to solve the climate crisis.

         Here’s what one young person suggested the world needs to do.




                                      Non-essential
                                     image removed




         Bertine Lakjohn is 18. She comes from the Marshall Islands, a country in the Pacific Ocean
   5     made up of more than 1000 islands that are on average just over 2 meters above sea
         level. Global warming is bringing more frequent and more violent storms and the country’s
         existence is threatened because the level of the sea is rising.

         Bertine said her interest in climate issues began when she was in high school.

         [–5–]

  10     In high school I facilitated a youth leadership camp about why leadership is important in
         fighting climate change. First, we educated young people about leadership, and about
         the impact of climate change. Then we had a dialogue about climate change and invited
         government officials to this discussion.

         I also wrote a poem. It was about how industrialization has a huge impact on not just the
  15     environment but also on our culture and our traditions.

         [–6–]

         I moved to Japan for high school, and when I came back everything was entirely different.
         Before I left, the water was warmer in a place where I used to like swimming, and then
         when I came back it was super cold. The fish that swam there are no longer there. That’s
  20     when I knew I had to do something about it urgently.

         [–7–]

         Before, youth were only informing people that climate change was happening. Now we’re
         pressuring the government, not just people in general, but the people who can actually do
         something. We’re telling them that we can’t just wait until the crisis hits us.

  25     [–8–]

         I think governments need to listen to youth. In my country, it’s mostly the youth that are
         taking initiative on this climate change issue and the best way for us to have a voice is to
         have youth representation in the government.

           Africa counts on technology to attract youth to farming
         RULINDO, Rwanda – Marie Chantal Akingeneye lost her only
         cow to an unknown illness. Since then she has had no source
         for fertilizer for her fruit and vegetables. She hopes a new phone
         app could help. The United Nations developed this technology                     Non-essential
    5    and after attending a training course on how to use the app,                    image removed
         Marie Chantal thinks it will help to keep her goats and pigs
         healthy and modernize her farm for her six-year-old son to take
         over.

         “It tells farmers about diseases that attack animals,” the 28-year-old mother explains. “The cow
  10     died because I didn’t know it was sick.”

         Experts say that these simple, mobile phone-based apps could produce great results in Africa
         by encouraging more youth to become farmers and helping to solve problems of unemployment
         and hunger. The free app also provides information on weather, market prices for crops, and
         producing and conserving healthy foods.

  15     It is becoming increasingly important for farmers to access up-to-date information as climate
         change nowadays means traditional knowledge on planting seasons is unreliable. A simple text
         to farmers just to say, “The weather forecast for the next three days is this” can fundamentally
         change what they do.

         Daniel Nshimiyimana, a Rwandan university graduate who turned his grandparents’ neglected
  20     land into a successful farm producing bananas, maize and beans, is one of 50 farmers who
         have been testing the app since 2016. “The app helps by telling me about the quality of seeds
         I have to plant, the quantity of fertilizer to use, the distance between the trees,” he said. “My
         bunches of bananas used to weigh 30 kilos. Now they are 40, 50 kilos,” Nshimiyimana said,
         proudly pointing at the banana trees.

  25     But according to one senior consultant, the advantages of technology can be uncertain when
         it is donor-funded. “If the funding runs out, the project is going to fail.” It will also take time for
         technology to revolutionize Africa’s agriculture as farmers tend to be conservative with poor
         digital literacy.

              No exams, no uniform and no football team:
                  Inside the best school in the world
    1      Welcome to High Tech High, where classes are just as likely to be making skateboards as
           studying maths, yet 95 % go on to university.

    2      A group of casually dressed teenagers are
           chattering about their upcoming lessons. The
           walls around them are hung with artwork.
           Subject boundaries are fluid. Maths and physics                   Non-essential
           are taught as one. English and history share                     image removed
           time. An art and physics scheme resulted in a
           school full of life-size wooden staircases which
           led nowhere.

    3      High Tech High has achieved fame thanks to a documentary called Most Likely To Succeed,
           which showed the life of the school and has been screened around the world.

    4      At this school, written exams have been replaced by projects that are displayed to an
           audience of parents, alumni and locals. The teens don’t carry satchels of books and the
           corridors are locker-free. But everywhere there’s an air of purpose and good fortune.

    5      This is a school that gets results for its pupils. Pupils are not elite: 15 % have special
           educational needs, 50 % are low-income and 44 % of the graduates are the first in their
           family to go on to higher education.

    6      High Tech High was envisioned by Larry Rosenstock, who rethought schooling for the
           21st century. He looked at all the elements of a child’s education and he posed the question:
           How can a system of education that was set up to produce workers for the factories of the
           19th and 20th century be relevant to young people today?

    7      In previous generations, workers sat in rows in offices or stood in line by conveyor belts1.
           They needed to learn discipline, patience and an understanding of hierarchy. In the
           21st century, employment already looks quite different. With less job security and a
           fast-changing job market, workers need to learn flexibility, resilience and teamwork. In
           addition to academic skills, there will also be more focus on technology, politics and
           language.

    8      The school teaches children aged 14–18. The youngest and most senior years share the
           ground floor, with the elders acting as positive role models for the newbies2.

    9      The school’s approach to teaching and learning reflects Rosenstock’s approach. He
           discovered that if children made things as they learnt, their comprehension of the topic was
           improved. Deeper learning is based on encouraging critical thinking, learning to collaborate,
           and effective presentation skills.
