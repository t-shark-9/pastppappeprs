Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section B [20 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

Markscheme format example:


     Question                                      Answers                                                    Notes                     Total

                  OR
                  the extent to which the performer has control over the timing of the
                  movement ✔                                                                                                           2 max

                  external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve ✔
                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine ✔


1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.
8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.
                                                                               –4–                                            M21/4/SPEXS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

        if they are unable to perform the tasks because they are physically too difficult

        eg can they kick the ball with enough force for it to complete the task set ✔


        physical fitness:
        fitness / motor skills competence / ability of the players will impact on whether they
        are able to practice and learn skills that are set / if they are not fit / competent / do
        not have the ability, players will not be able to complete drills and practice tasks to
        improve ✔
        eg an unfit player will quickly fatigue and not be able to focus on the set task such
        as one touch ball retention drill and the task cannot be completed / practised ✔


        coach:
        the style of coaching can determine whether the players will learn effectively ✔
        eg a dictatorial coach may hinder the players’ ability to apply skills when they play
        the game as the players have to make decisions by themselves in a fluid / game
        situation ✔
        eg a coach who only provides negative feedback may turn players off from being
        involved ✔

        age of players can affect their experience / physical maturation / mental ability to
        understand and apply tactics ✔
        younger players may pick skills up quickly and be uninhibited by previously-learnt
        poor techniques ✔
        older players may pick up skills more quickly as they have the ability to adapt and
        apply previously-learnt skills ✔

difficulty of task:
a difficult task may be physically difficult or complex in application / could put
performers off trying ✔
the simpler the task the easier it should be to learn ✔
eg passing the ball along the ground with the inside of the foot is a simple task and
can be quickly learnt, compared to other more complex tasks such as heading the
ball ✔


teaching environment:
this can determine the opportunities that there are for practice ✔
eg is there enough equipment to maximise time practising ✔


motivation:
a highly motivated player will persevere during difficult tasks / times until they have
mastered the task ✔
eg a player practising a complex free kick action in their own time ✔
