Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
in the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
“FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of               eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses        descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the           explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions        This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                   explanation etc.

                   The algorithm will always output zero as the value of LOWEST, for any set of the input
                   values (because all input values are greater than or equal to 0);
                   The LOWEST is initialized to 0 and negative inputs are not allowed, zero will be the
                   permanently lowest number;
                                                                                                        [1]

                   Example 1:

                   Replace LOWEST = 0;
                   With LOWEST=99999999/ any very high number;

                   Example 2:

                   Before the loop/ Accept “at the beginning”;
                   The first number NUMBER should be inputted and LOWEST set to NUMBER /
                   LOWEST=input(NUMBER);
                   Loop only 999 times (because 1 number already inputted)/ condition in the loop should
                   be changed to COUNTER>998;

                   Example 3:

                   If statement should be used within the loop;
                   after the statement ‘input NUMBER’;
                   For example, if COUNTER==0 then LOWEST = NUMBER/ set LOWEST to the first
