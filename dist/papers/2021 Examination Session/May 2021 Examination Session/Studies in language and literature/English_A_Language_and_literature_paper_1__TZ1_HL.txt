          To Love Your Sister Is To Grieve Your Twin
          It’s impossible to explain what having a twin is like to someone who asks, but I am going to try.

               Tomi Obaro                                               Tweet        Share        Copy


          My father prayed for twins. This is a fact my mother usually recites
          during birthdays, the impending new year, Thanksgiving, and other
          increasingly rare moments when mother, father, brother, sister, and I
          are all in the same room in the same time zone. He prayed for twins
      5   and we came.
                 First Dami, short for Oluwadamilola (which means “God has made
          me rich” in Yoruba), and then 25 minutes later, me, Tomi, Oluwatomilola
          (“God is my sufficiency”). My father prayed for twins, but the odds were
          in his favor. The Yoruba have the highest twinning rate in the world.
     10   Science cannot account for this strange phenomenon. Apparently it has
          something to do with the skin of the yams we eat or the high amount
          of a certain chemical found in the beans the women traditionally soak and cook in palm oil.
          Whatever the reason, we’re supposed to bring good luck and prosperity to our families.
                 My first conscious memory involves my sister. We’re sitting on potties in our little bathroom
     15   in Surrey, England, babbling to each other, trying to capture the tonal resonances of Yoruba and
          failing. Laughing.
                 We are not identical, but for the first maybe 18 years of our lives, we just say yes when
          people ask, because we might as well be. We have dark brown eyes that turn to slants when
          we smile. Milk-white baby teeth that gradually grow apart, widening and widening until we (I)
     20   demand braces and then I lose my retainer. My face is longer than hers. I am an inch taller. But
          our voices are the same timbre. When we talk on the phone, our mother can’t tell us apart. We
          say things at the same time in the same tone and then we laugh when that happens. We move
          around a lot, England, Gambia, Ohio, two to three years in each place, and so we are natural
          companions, drama kids who ham it up for the cameras, play elaborate games of make-believe,
     25   sing in school musicals, ask obnoxious questions, enamored of our own cuteness.
                 It’s an overused trope, sure, twin as metaphor. Twins as represented in the popular culture
          are usually one-dimensional carbon copies of each other, devoid of all individual autonomy, or,
          if not that, cartoonish opposites, the contradictions emphasized to the extreme. But there’s a
          subtlety about being a twin, about the myriad similarities and common interests encapsulated in
     30   someone who is not you.
                                                 –3–                                             2221 – 2013


              “Are you guys going to the same college?” Yes. But not on purpose… It will be the place
      where the untwinning starts to happen and we won’t even realize it.
              First to go, Dami’s hair. After sitting through years of cornrows, extensions, relaxers, and
      quarterly sessions at the one black hairdresser that is sort of near us, Dami just gives up one
35    day and says, “I’m cutting it permanently.” She describes the shocked face of the barber as she
      tells him, “Shorter, shorter.”
              I don’t cut my hair. I keep it relaxed, and then when laziness takes over, I declare myself a
      member of the third-wave natural hair movement.
              The second thing to go, her faith. It had been on the fritz before, in high school. Struggles
40    with the usual questions — women, gay people, pain and suffering. There were shouting
      matches when she refused to go to church. My mother was worried we’d become atheists in
      college. But once we get there, I go to a Bible study and I like it. People are kind and thoughtful.
      Smart. Open. I join a campus ministry and convince Dami to join too, and then one day she
      flames out in spectacular, extravagant fashion… Suddenly, I’m going to church alone, campus
45    meetings alone, singing on the worship team alone.
              Third to go, Dami herself, to France for 10 weeks. I am adamantly against it. I don’t tell her
      this. I feign lack of interest. Oh really? You’re afraid you won’t get your visa? Oh, Mum and Dad
      are worried about you going? Oh, they’ve relented. Oh you’re going? OK. Bye.
              She comes back and things are different. So different that we can’t quite understand it. We
50    argue often and virulently. I don’t remember what the arguments were about (surely something
      trivial), but I remember the tone vividly, the jabs, vicious jabs. It was misdirected anger, of
      course. We were changing and we didn’t know how to cope with the change.
              After graduation, I moved to D.C. for an internship and she stayed in Chicago, until she
      decided to do an AmeriCorps program that took her across the country to California and I came
55    back to Chicago for a full-time job.
              One consequence of moving so much is that you develop a numbing acceptance of
      change, and thus a tendency to avoid attachment. Growing apart, or becoming — as we now
      say to people who ask — sisters and not twins, was mostly horrifying, but sometimes it’s a relief.
      It means that my worst fear can’t possibly devastate me as much as it once could.
60            Over this past Thanksgiving break, we watched the 2015 documentary Twinsters, about a
      Los Angeles actress who discovers that she has an identical twin sister living in Paris. I was on
      the verge of crying during the whole movie, but I could not bring myself to actually cry, because
      Dami was dry-eyed and to admit that I was affected by this documentary would be to admit
      feeling, emotion, attachment, sentiment. As passionate as both Dami and I are individually and
65    with others, amongst ourselves, we are understated. I think it’s because the intensity of our love
      for each other is overwhelming. Loving someone that much is embarrassing.
              We live in the same city now. It is a fortunate accident. Or maybe God ordained it. That’s
      what my mother would say.
              We are a ‘we’ again. It’s strange but exciting. If someone asks us if we are twins, we say
70    yes at the same time in the same tone and then we laugh. It’s nice. My father prayed for twins.
      And we came.
