Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   A cashless society

     In the near future, it is possible that cash will not be accepted as a means of payment in
     Sweden. People are already using alternative ways of paying such as mobile payment, card
     payment and internet payment. Currently 94 % of citizens in Sweden have internet access.

     In 2012, a new payment app* called “Swish” was created that allowed users to transfer
     money using their cell/mobile phone. The user has to download the Swish mobile bank app
     to their cell phone and create a user ID. Once this has been done the user can register for
     Swish which connects their bank account to their cell/mobile phone number.

     The Swish app can be used with all the Swedish banks. The maximum amount of money that
     can be transferred using the Swish app is controlled by the user’s bank.

     Swish cannot be used if the user does not have a Swedish bank account. However, this only
     applies to less than 1 % of the Swedish population.

     To make a payment using Swish you select a person in the contact list on your cell/mobile
     phone and follow a series of steps, see Figure 1.

                                       Figure 1: The Swish app




     The Swish app allows you to send money to friends, companies and organizations. However,
     it is not widely used when purchasing from a shop. In this case, credit or debit cards are still
     the preferred method for making payments.

* app: small specialized program run on mobile devices, the internet, a computer or
  other electronic device

(This question continues on the following page)
                                                   –3–                                            2221 – 5512


(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   When a user wants to make a payment with the Swish app, the app will need to collect
           data about the transaction.

           (i)    Identify two items of data that the app could collect from the user making the
                  payment.[2]

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by the app to make the payment into the bank account of
                  the person receiving the money.                                                        [4]

     (b)   Explain why it is important that any data sharing agreement between the Swish app
           and the Swedish banks has policies that address both the storing and sharing of app
           users’ data.                                                                                  [6]

     (c)   Many people in Sweden have seen the advantages of using the Swish app. It allows
           friends to share a restaurant bill, to pay where credit or debit cards are not accepted, to
           easily pay for babysitting or parking tickets, or make a donation at church.

           However, some people in Sweden have expressed concerns about not using cash and
           making the Swish app the only means of payment.

           To what extent do the advantages of the Swish app as the only means of payment
           outweigh the disadvantages.                                                                   [8]




                                                                                                 Turn over
                                                    –4–                                        2221 – 5512


2.   Automatic crop watering system

     Since 1990, Bertha Ascayo has been the manager of El Pallar, a farm in Chacra Province,
     where fruit trees are grown. In recent years, the climate has become more unpredictable
     and the farm has suffered from periods of drought, and Bertha is aware that she needs to
     manage the watering of her fruit trees more than she has had to in the past.

     Bertha will need to make some improvements to the watering system by adding a rain sensor
     and use a computer program to automate the watering process. She has decided to use the
     proprietary software offered by the company that has installed the equipment for the watering
     of the trees.

     By using this software, Bertha can program a different watering plan for each type of tree.
     This includes programming the days of the week, times of the day and length of the water
     cycle for each type of tree to be watered. For example, orange trees will be watered on
     Mondays and Thursdays at 6am for 45 minutes, and at 8pm for 30 minutes.

     (a)   (i)    Identify three characteristics of proprietary software.                             [3]

           (ii)   A computer program uses the data provided by the rain sensor to decide whether
                  to water the trees. Identify the steps in this program.                             [3]

     (b)   Water is becoming increasingly scarce in Chacra Province and the provincial
           government is concerned there will be a point when there is not enough water for all of
           the farms to water their crops or fruit trees.

           To manage water for the watering of crops and fruit trees, the provincial government
           of Chacra Province intends to create a computer model to calculate how much water
           each farm in the province will receive.

           Explain three factors that will contribute to the accuracy of the model.                   [6]

     (c)   The farmers of Chacra Province are concerned about the provincial government using
           a computer model to determine the amount of water they will be allowed to use to
           water their fruit trees.

           To what extent should the farmers of Chacra Province rely on their knowledge and
           experience, rather than the computer-based solution provided by the provincial
           government, to manage the watering of the fruit trees?                                     [8]
                                                    –5–                                            2221 – 5512


3.   Technology disruption in Orams Academy

     Many schools use virtual learning environments (VLE) such as Firefly, PowerSchool
     Learning, Schoology, Final Site LMS and Google Classroom. The VLE is used for document
     storage, lesson content and homework management as well as for communication between
     the school, students and parents.

     In addition to the VLE, collaborative cloud-based online tools such as Google G Suite and
     Microsoft Office 365 are used by students and teachers.

     Recently, Daniela Stark, the principal at Orams Academy, has become concerned that
     using only one VLE may not prove to be as beneficial as originally thought. She has heard
     that some teachers and students are also successfully using social media tools such as
     Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to share their learning. She has also been told that the lack of
     bandwidth that the school experiences at times can cause problems.

     Daniela is considering an alternative approach and allowing teachers and students to choose
     the most appropriate tools to manage their learning.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of cloud-based storage.                                   [2]

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why there might be a lack of bandwidth at times on the
                   school’s network.                                                                      [2]

           (iii)   Identify two potential disadvantages of using online collaborative tools.              [2]

     (b)   An acceptable-use policy will be required for the appropriate use of virtual learning
           environments and collaborative online tools in Orams Academy.

           Explain three elements that would be included in an acceptable-use policy for Orams
           Academy.[6]

     (c)   Discuss whether Daniela should make every teacher at Orams Academy use the same
           learning platform or she should allow each teacher to choose their own preferred
           learning management approach.                                                                  [8]




                                                                                                   Turn over
                                                     –6–                                           2221 – 5512


4.   Voice simulation

     Lyrebird voice cloning software was created by three university students from Montreal. This
     technology was originally developed to change the lives of people who have lost their voice.
     These people can use the software to create a new voice by choosing one from samples
     provided in the software.

     However, Lyrebird can also clone voices. Lyrebird claims that it can clone a person’s voice
     in just 60 seconds. Users only need to access the website, create an account and generate
     the voice-print by repeating a number of predetermined sentences. Although the cloning is
     not perfect, the developers of Lyrebird believe that both the time to clone the voice and the
     quality of the cloning will improve in the future.

     The software allows the user to alter the speech and add emotion (such as, anger, elation,
     surprise, and so on), increasing the ways in which it can be used.

     The initial voice-print for the cloning process requires the most time and a lot of computing
     power. However, creating speech from the voice-print is a simple process, generating around
     1,000 sentences almost instantly. The voice print is saved as a compressed audio file.

     Lyrebird has considered the ethical issues regarding this technology and acknowledges that
     it highlights some key societal issues. Lyrebird has taken the decision to make the software
     available to all in an attempt to address these issues.

     (a)   (i)     Lyrebird uses a person’s voice-print to determine their identity.

                   Identify two other methods of biometric identification that could be used to
                   determine a person’s identity.                                                         [2]

           (ii)    Identify two audio file formats that could be used to store the voice-print.           [2]

           (iii)   The voice-print created can be compressed using lossless or lossy compression.

                   Describe the difference between lossless and lossy compression.                        [2]

     (b)   Analyse whether it would be appropriate for Lyrebird to release the biometric data of a
           user to a third party.                                                                         [6]

     (c)   To what extent do the benefits of using Lyrebird’s voice cloning software outweigh the
           concerns that may arise from its use?                                                          [8]
