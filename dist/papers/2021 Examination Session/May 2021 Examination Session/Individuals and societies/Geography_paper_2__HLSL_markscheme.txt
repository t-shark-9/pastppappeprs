                                                Section A
1.   Changing population

     (a)   Outline what is meant by “fertility rate”.                                                     [2]

           The number of children/number of births per 1000 women [1] a woman gives birth to during
           her lifetime/fertile years/reproductive age/below 50 [1].

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why fertility rates decline when the status of women
           is improved.                                                                                 [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a valid reason and [1] for development of how it impacts upon the
           fertility rate.

           Possibilities include:
           • Employment – delayed marriage and delayed childbirth.
           • Access to family planning services.
           • Education for women – delays marriage/childbirth.
           • Reduced child mortality rates – fewer replacement births.
           • Societal status of women – women have more freedom and rights, thus giving them more
              decision-making powers

           For example: One reason is because women have more access to contraception and birth
           control advice [1] which means they have more control over the number of children in their
           families [1].

     (c)   Explain why some places have an uneven sex ratio as a result of:

           (i)   migration;                                                                               [2]

                 Answers may refer to source or destination places and can be based on
                 international/regional/rural:urban migration.

                 Award [1] for a basic explanatory comment and [1] for further valid
                 explanation/exemplification linked to a valid and identified uneven sex ratio.

                 Valid reasons may include:
                 • Migration of males to find work gives higher proportion of males in working in
                   destination countries/gives lower proportion of males in origin countries.
                 • Inability of male labourers to bring families with them gives higher proportion of
                   males.
                 • Migration of female domestic and care labour eg Sri Lanka leaves a gap in the
                   middle age female groups.
                 • Migration of males of fighting age to join armies, leaves places with a higher
                   proportion of young females.

                 For example: Influx of male construction workers into an oil rich nation such as UAE [1]
                 so there tends to be a larger proportion of men than women [1]
                                        –4–                M21/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(ii)   an ageing society.                                                                [2]

       Award [1] for a basic explanatory comment and [1] for further
       explanation/exemplification linked to a valid and identified uneven sex ratio.

       Valid reasons may include:
       • Macho culture encourages risky behaviour meaning higher mortality as the
         population ages.
       • Males occupy dangerous jobs that lead to a higher mortality leaving a smaller
         proportion of males in older age groups.
       • Child mortality is higher amongst boys, more females survive until old age.
       • Biological difference in chromosomes and hormones, females are advantaged [less
         fat surrounding organs] and live longer.
       • Females more willing to consult medical advice, live longer.

       For example: Women tend to have higher life expectancies than men [1], so in the over
       65s there tends to be a greater proportion of women than men [1].
                                                    –5–               M21/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.    Global climate – vulnerability and resilience

      (a)   Identify one region showing:

            (i)    an extensive positive anomaly of +12ºC;                                            [1]

                   South/South East Greenland
                   central/eastern/N/NE USA
                   central North America
                   central Asia
                   E/NE Australia

            (ii)   an extensive negative anomaly of –12ºC.                                            [1]

                   southern Africa
                   western/NW Australia
                   western USA
                   SW Asia


(b)   Outline how extreme warming can affect:

            (i)    the albedo of a region;                                                            [2]

                   In each case, award [1] for a valid comment on effects of extreme warming and [1] for
                   the impact on albedo.

                   Valid effects may include:
                   • Decrease in the amount of ice, decrease in albedo less energy reflected.
                   • Increases amount of cloud through increased evaporation, increases albedo.
                   • Increased heat causes wildfires which destroy vegetation, increases albedo.
                   • Expansion of deserts due to water loss decreases vegetation, increases albedo.

                   For example: Extreme warming is going to melt ice in the polar regions [1] and
                   therefore the surface will reflect less solar radiation and decrease albedo [1].

                   OR

                   Extreme warming may increase evaporation in tropical areas [1], which can reduce
                   vegetation cover and increase albedo [1].
                                         –6–                M21/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(ii)   the operation of a feedback loop.                                                        [2]

        In each case, award [1] for the valid identification and description of a loop and [1] for
       development linked to impact

       Valid loops may include:
       Positive loops
       • Release of methane from frozen ground, causes increase in greenhouse gases
         which gives more warming.
       • Warming of atmosphere leads to more evaporation, causes more water vapour
         which traps heat and amplifies initial warming.
       • Warming melts ice which decreases albedo so absorbed heat warms atmosphere
         which melts more ice.
       • Warming gives conditions perfect for wildfires, causes release of more GHG/shrink
         forests as a carbon sink.
       • Warming causes the oceans to increase in temperature and become less efficient
         as a carbon sink, this increases the CO2 in the atmosphere which further increases
         warming.

       Negative loops
       • Increase in temperature increases the amount of cloud cover, decrease incoming
         solar radiation and decrease warming.

        For example: Melting of frozen ground releases methane/greenhouse gas [1] so there
        is more warming and more melting [1].
                                            –7–                M21/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain two ways in which climate change impacts upon ocean transport routes.           [2+2]

      In each case, allow [1] for a valid way and [1] for development/exemplification of impacts on
      ocean transport routes.

      Valid possibilities include:
      • Warming may decrease the amount of sea ice and so ice-bound ports may be more
          accessible all year round.
      • Warming may increase the occurrence of natural hazards, such as hurricanes/storms,
          these would make some routes more dangerous and hazardous to navigation.
      • Increased natural hazards (storms and storm surges) may damage infrastructure,
          interrupt operations at terminals.
      • Climate change may result in sea level rise which leads to more frequent flooding of port
          facilities.
      • Existing routes may no longer be safe due to icebergs/increased sedimentation due to
          worsening coastal erosion, re-routing becomes more common.

      For example: New sea routes opening up as sea ice melts [1] and allows passage through
      areas previously ice bound for large parts of the year [1].
                                                   –8–                M21/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Global resource consumption and security

     (a)   Outline two differences in the growth of the middle-class population of Ukraine
           and Serbia.                                                                                [1+1]

           Award [1] per correct point. Quantification of at least one valid point needed for both marks.

           Possibilities include:
           • More growth in Ukraine
           • Ukraine has overtaken Serbia
           • Ukraine starts at lower %

     (b)   Explain how the growth of a country’s middle-class population can lead to:

           (i)    changing diets;                                                                         [2]

                  Allow [1] for a valid dietary change and [1] for an explanation of why this is happening
                  due to growth of middle class.

                  Valid possibilities include:
                  • Increase in meat/dairy consumption – due to increase in wealth, expensive foods
                    are affordable.
                  • Diversification of diet as increase in wealth enables more imported food.
                  • Increase in healthy eating, middle class are educated and can see benefits of
                    healthy diets.
                  • Reduced intake of coarse grains and vegetables.
                  • Increased intake of sugars, Westernized diets affordable

                  For example: Middle income groups are now eating more fast foods and processed foods
                  [1] as they have more disposable income [1]

           (ii)   land-use pressures.                                                                     [2]

                  Allow [1] for a valid land-use change and [1] for an explanation of the pressure this
                  creates for another land use or user group.

                  Valid possibilities include:
                  • more cropland needed, cutting down of forests/expansion onto marginal land
                  • transport infrastructure
                  • land used for housing developments, as people become richer and no longer have
                    to live with parents
                  • land acquisition in developing countries by transnational companies for food and
                    minerals, takes land from indigenous populations.

                  For example: Middle income groups have more money and aspirations and want to live
                  in their own houses [1] this increases the demand for housing which is built on land
                  previously covered by trees [1].
                                              –9–                    M21/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Suggest one way in which greater use of renewable energy can:

      (i)    decrease the size of a nation’s ecological footprint;                                 [2]

             Award [1] for a valid way and [1] for development linked to decrease in ecological
             footprint (land/sea/vegetation).

             Valid possibilities include:
             • less need for fossil fuels like coal which means less land required to obtain energy
             • less need for fossil fuels like oil which means less land/sea polluted by oil spills
             • more energy is produced by wind farms which means less nuclear waste / land
               contamination issues
             • renewable energy is produced without the burning of fossil fuels and the resultant
               emissions, so less land/vegetation/ocean is required to absorb greenhouse gases.

             For example: Decreased use of fossil fuels because of switching energy sources [1]
             decreases the amount of land required for mining or disposal of waste [1].


      (ii)   increase the size of a nation’s ecological footprint.                                 [2]

             Award [1] for a valid way and [1] for development linked to increase in ecological
             footprint.

             Valid possibilities include:
             • solar and wind farms require large areas of land and these can reduce the natural
               vegetation of an area
             • valleys drowned for HEP reservoirs which reduces vegetation and covers areas of
               soil.
             • use of electric cars increases demand for rare minerals which increases land
               destroyed by mining.

             For example: Greater use of biofuels requires palm oil cultivation [1] across extensive
             areas of land [1].

                                             Section B
4.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the percentage of women employed in the public sector.                     [1]

                  60–70%

           (ii)   Determine the percentage of university graduates in the UAE who are men.            [1]

                  30%

     (b)   According to the infographic, 46% of STEM (science, technology, engineering and
           mathematics) graduates are women. Explain how one presentation method could be
           used to illustrate the details shown.                                                      [2]

           Award [1] for identification of a valid technique such as bars graphs/pie charts/proportional
           symbols. Award further [1] for application to the details shown [constituents of STEM] – bars
           for each subject/segments for pie charts/separate symbols.

           Award full credit for answers given as appropriate diagram.

(c)   Evaluate how far the evidence in the infographic supports the claim of the United Arab
      Emirates government that the country has achieved gender equality.                            [6]

      Award [1] for each valid point and a further mark [1] for supported
      development/exemplification up to a maximum of [5]. Award the final [1] for an overall
      appraisal that weighs up the infographic as a whole

      Award a maximum of [4] if only one perspective is given.

      Pro gender equality
      • ranks 1 in women’s literacy
      • women make significant contributions to the workforce, 50% of UAE space program are
         women
      • women have good access to education, 70% of graduates are women
      • women have obtained high standards of education – 77% enroll in higher education after
         high school
      • UAE requires females on board of every company
      • women make up high proportion of public sector workforce, 60-70% of the workforce in
         the public sector are females
      • recognized by international organization WEF/official governments.

      Against gender equality
      • not equal in important government positions, 25% only of cabinet level positions
      • women-owned business is not an import part of the economy, only contributes 10% of
        value of private sector
      • data shows male inequality
      • law only requires one female board member and there can be many men
      • statement is from a government spokesman and so could be biased
      • information provided is narrow interpretation of gender equality

      Example: The infographic does show that many women are well educated [1] as 77% of
      Emirati women enrol in higher education after secondary school / 70% of graduates are
      women [1]. Women are also well represented in the workforce [1] making up a significant
      proportion of the government workforce [1]. However, information on the infographic about
      the public sector shows women are not as well represented in higher political life [1].
      Overall the claim that they have the best gender equality has insufficient support from the
      examples shown in the infographic [1].
