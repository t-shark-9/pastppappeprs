Passage adapted from James Smith: What’s in Your Cell Phone? In Dorothy Hodgson and Judith Byfield,
eds. Global Africa Into the Twenty-First Century. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2017.

        The modern narrative about how technology has freed us from the inefficient materiality of the
        past – things like paper, stone, timber and concrete – hides a truth. By focusing on how cell
        phones are made, we can see how our technological world is produced. The invisible work of
        African miners makes this world possible.

    5   To understand Africa’s relationship to the world capitalist economy, the mineral called coltan* is
        the place to start. Following its movement from the soil into computer chips changes the way
        we see Africa’s relationship with the world. With globalization, companies and informal armies
        who control coltan mining impose their power over state authority. This ethnography examines
        the significance of coltan for those who work at the lowest end of this global commodity chain.
   10   Through oral narratives and other ethnographic data, I focus on the life of miners.

        There are millions of people in DR Congo dependent on mining. The work is typically done by
        young men, who became miners during wars, when they lost their agricultural land which is
        now mined for coltan. The miners work in small groups using hand tools, like picks and shovels.
        Their working conditions are very unstable in this informal economy. Despite the reputation
   15   for being a criminal and dangerous activity, the work is highly organized. As a former Belgian
        colony, job titles replicate those of Belgian-controlled factory mining of the past. For example:
        chef de colline (chief of the hill), representing the mine owner, and chef de camp (chief of the
        camp), in charge of social relations and peace in the camp. This creates both a division of
        labour and a sense of historical continuity.

   20   How do these miners understand their work and their contribution to the global capitalist
        economy?

        One of my informants, “The Machine”, smokes a lot. He says the smoke doesn’t cause him
        harm because cigarette box warnings were made for people like me, not for miners. He explains
        that the smoke fills the hole in which he works [the mine] and makes it feel like home, almost
   25   like a kitchen, so he forgets his worries and is comfortable in the darkness.

        All miners smoke, he says, because they’re always in the dark. Miners often say they are “in the
        dark” or “in a hole”, unable to “see ahead”, because they lack knowledge about forces that affect
        them, such as the price of coltan, or what it is used for. They also have to come up with adaptive
        strategies to respond to their dangerous and unstable working conditions, moving and changing
   30   tactics at a moment’s notice. He says, “We are like snakes in the ground, always looking for a
        hole to crawl into.”

        My friend isn’t the first “Machine” I have met in fieldwork; it is a common name, suggesting the
        person’s capacity to work endlessly. The term “machine” also represents the highly organized
        and productive nature of mining itself – the complex division of labour. They say, “We are better
   35   than a machine!”, which is a way to assert the value of themselves and their work.
                                                              –3–                                                    2221 – 5803


            “The Machine” became a miner to support his family because all of his things were taken during
            the war, and he was never able to return home. He had no idea that, in late 2000, Sony had run
            out of the coltan needed to meet the Christmas demand for Sony Playstation 2. This shortage
            fuelled a price increase intensifying the war situation, involving international corporations and
     40     nine African countries. Eighty-five firms from twenty countries collaborated with government
            armies and informal armies. These armies forced civilian populations to mine.

            Many miners at the bar where we drink beer use a nickname; at our table we have a Chuck
            Norris, a Rambo, a Snoop Dogg, and a P. Diddy. These names symbolize their connection to
            a global world. They draw these identities from a world they help to produce and desire to be a
     45     part of.

            The so-called digital age that Silicon Valley promises depends upon the work of the miners and
            the social forms imposed upon them. They are dispossessed people, subject to various forms of
            violence, who embrace their “global citizenship”.

Abstract: Congolese coltan is a mineral critical to digital devices and the digital age. Coltan provides insights into Africa’s
relationship to the world economy, global governance, and “modernity” (or postmodernity) broadly conceived. Tracing the
movement of coltan from the soil and forests of Africa to various markets around the world, and finally into computer chips,
changes the way we see Africa and the world.

Keywords: coltan, Congolese wars, digital age, regulation, artisanal mining

ANYONE WHO’S EVER WATCHED A TED talk, any of the four different movies about Steve Jobs, or the
popular television show Silicon Valley is well versed in the alluring American narrative regarding how techno-savvy
individuals have changed the world by mobilizing their indomitable wills against outmoded cultural and political
traditions. Linked to this romance is the notion that we can “save everything” by “clicking here” on our devices, as
Evgeny Morozov reminds us in his similarly named book (To Save Everything, Click Here). But this mythology about
how virtuoso minds invent technologies that liberate the world from the past’s cumbersome materiality—things like
paper, stone, timber, and concrete—conceals an even more compelling and revealing set of truths. By focusing on how
these devices are made, we can see how far-flung places connect to one another, what the “digital age” amounts to,
and how the technological worlds we inhabit are produced. One crucial though perhaps less visible example is that
of the Congolese artisanal miners who actually get down in the mud and, through extremely laborious and highly
organized work, unearth the materials that make this seemingly futuristic world possible in the first place. If you want
to understand Africa’s relationship to the world economy, global governance, and “modernity” (or postmodernity)
broadly conceived, the dark metallic mineral called coltan would be an excellent place to start. When we unpack this
mineral, and its movement from the soil and forests of Africa to various markets around the world, and finally into
computer chips, it changes the way we see Africa and the world.

Coltan ore is important to engineers because tantalum and niobium can be extracted from it; tantalum’s density
makes it highly sought aft er for its capacity to hold a high electrical charge. Coltan is found in all electronics devices,
including mobile phones and laptops, though not all of it is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR
Congo). While at one point the Australian company Sons of Gwalia was thought to control half of the world’s coltan
production (it closed in 2004 and suffered from ongoing strikes before that), these days most coltan is mined artisanally
in diverse parts of the world, especially in Africa and, increasingly, South America. According to the US Geological
Survey, the DR Congo has 80 percent of the world’s coltan. The dark, metallic silicate is similar in appearance to,
and often found alongside, other minerals that are equally crucial for digital technologies—especially wolframite, the
ore from which tungsten is derived; and cassiterite, from which tin is derived. Tungsten is used to make computer
screens and also enables cell phones to vibrate; tin is used in wiring, among many other processes. International NGOs
working in Congo refer to coltan, tin, and tungsten as the “three T’s,” a phrase that has become prominent in the policy
literature, gradually replacing the earlier emphasis on the single mineral “coltan.” Congolese involved in the trade refer
to these minerals as “black minerals” (mineraux noirs). Miners tend not to specialize in one mineral or the other, but to
move between these and other minerals depending on price, security, and accessibility.

Congolese coltan and the other “digital minerals” are found in forests and in hillsides on what would otherwise
be agricultural land. To say that these minerals are mined “artisanally” means that they are dug by small groups of
diggers using mainly hand tools, like picks and shovels. Sometimes these diggers have to dig into shaft s and end up
underground in what can be perilous circumstances. There are about two million artisanal miners in the DR Congo
and ten million people dependent on mining. Many of these people became miners during the First and Second
Congolese Wars, when they lost their access to agricultural land, their livestock, or other property. This kind of mining
is typically done by relatively young men, though women sift and clean the ore that is dug, leaving it to dry in the sun.
They also sell things to the miners. There are many other kinds of workers involved in this trade, including the porters
who are hired to carry the minerals on their head out of the forest.
                                                           –5–                                                    2221 – 5803



Each mine is different—miners often say that each mine is its own “universe”—with divergent political and social
systems, and principles of taxation and land ownership. That said, at any given mine there are also a number of people
on-site whose job it is to make sure that the work is organized and that it begins at a certain hour (say, 8 a.m.) and ends
at another (say, 6 p.m.)—unless the mine is under militia control and/or the price is running high, for then diggers will
work in shift s day and night. Artisanal miners have borrowed job titles from the days of Belgian-controlled factory
mining to create a division of labor and a sense of historical continuity: at any mine one is likely to find a chef de colline
(“chief of the hill”) serving as the mine manager or representing the mine owner. A chef de group collects fees and tax
from groups of workers, and organizes the distribution of food and other things, while a chef de camp may be in charge
of social relations and civic peace in the camp. The chef de chantier is likely to be the foreman in charge of making sure a
group of workers have whatever it is they need. According to the Congolese mining code, each mine also has a diggers’
cooperative made up of middlemen and diggers, whose job it is to ensure that workers have the food and materials
they need and that there is order in the mine. This cooperative also keeps track of workers and their debts and may
impose other rules (regarding sex or alcohol consumption, for example). Despite artisanal mining’s reputation for being
criminal or dangerous, it is also highly organized. Diggers are usually proud of the sophistication and efficiency of the
social and cultural forms that they generate artisanally.

So how do the people who dig these minerals understand the work they do, and their contribution to a global economy
that is at once increasingly interconnected and radically disconnected?

                                      CONVERSING WITH “THE MACHINE”

“The Machine” smokes a lot, that’s for sure. He assures me that the smoke from the cigarette doesn’t have time to linger
in his body and cause harm, and warns me that I shouldn’t follow his example because the warnings on cigarette boxes
were made for the likes of me, not the likes of him. He dramatically enacts breathing and digging for me, blowing in
and out with great force while moving his arms, as if to prove his point. “The Machine” explains that the smoke from
the cigarette fills the hole in which he works and makes it feel like home, almost like a kitchen, so he forgets his worries
and is comfortable in the darkness. All diggers smoke, he says, because they’re always in the dark. This idea is one that
comes up often among miners, in different ways and contexts: diggers are often said to be “in the dark” or “in a hole,”
unable to “see ahead,” because they lack knowledge about forces that affect them, such as the prices for the substances
they dig up from the ground, or what the stuff is for in the first place. They are often said to be unwilling to plan or
save for the future, but the truth is they must be ready to move and change tactics at a moment’s notice.

My new friend isn’t the first “Machine” I’ve met while studying the artisanal mining trade of the eastern DR Congo; it’s
a fairly common name, suggesting the capacity of the person to work vigorously without stopping. Sometimes the term
“machine” is also used to talk about the highly organized and productive nature of artisanal mining itself—the complex
division of labor among miners, and the multiple committees and subcommittees that work to mitigate conflict—as
in the oft -repeated phrase “We are better than a machine!” It’s just one of the ways in which people assert the value
of themselves, their social networks, and their work—with an implicit comparison to some of the things they help to
produce. Miners also desire the phones and other technologies they help to make because, through these devices, they
can acquire some measure of control over their situation, and some predictability in their work lives. They will use
these phones to call their friends in the city to find out the price that coltan or other minerals are fetching at any given
time, for example.

The Machine drinks a strong stout beer called Tembo, or “elephant.” Many of the other miners at this bar use a
sobriquet as well, usually one that speaks to and also helps to make a global social imaginary. At our table at the bar
alone we have a Chuck Norris, a Rambo, a Snoop Dogg, and a P-Diddy. “Have you ever met an Obama?” I ask the
Machine with a laugh. “Obama?!” The Machine points to a small house. “He’s right over there! He works real hard but
he smokes too much pot!” On the one hand, these names symbolize the fact that miners’ work connects them to a
social fi eld that is global in scale: they help to produce this interconnected world, and they draw their identities from
this interconnection. On the other hand, such names are also designed to help these workers avoid creditors. There
is simply no such thing as an artisanal miner who doesn’t have a debt to someone, since this work cannot take place
without a regular flow of money from middlemen to diggers. But an array of unpredictable and uncontrollable factors


                                                                                                                 Turn over
                                                           –6–                                                  2221 – 5803


can make it so that these debts don’t get repaid in a timely fashion. And so diggers like the Machine have to come up
with adaptive strategies for dealing with people who could bring them harm. “We are like snakes in the ground, always
looking for a hole to crawl into,” he says, expanding upon his original theme about being in a hole.

The Machine didn’t start out as a digger. Like many, he got into this work during the Second Congolese War (officially,
1998–2003), when all of his things were taken by the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy. Before that,
the Machine sold miscellaneous wares. Aft er those were gone, he heard about the price that coltan ore was fetching
and so went into the forest to make a living for his family. But he has never been able to return home. The Machine
had no idea that, in late 2000, Sony had run out of the tantalum it needed to meet the Christmas demand for Sony
Playstation 2. This shortage fueled already existing on-line speculation that led to a dramatic price bubble: coltan
prices rapidly rose tenfold, only to drop down to close to its original price in 2001. Among miners and traders, the
price hike for coltan is still remembered as a miraculous and dangerous time; in some places it is known simply as the
fois deux (the doubling), and in others it is recalled as the time of bisikatike, or “may it never end.” Today, the Machine
calls coltan the “mother of all minerals” because of its incredible density; it draws in multitudes of workers and vast
divisions of labor—all of whom get to “touch money,” as Congolese put it. Because it puts so many people to work and
feeds so many other businesses, coltan and the other “black minerals” are more likely to generate real, enduring peace
than gold or diamonds, which can be easily smuggled to foreign countries and individually possessed.

This price hike for coltan happened during the middle of the Second Congolese War, which is often described as
Africa’s “First World War” because it involved at least nine African countries, as well as international corporations.
This horrible war, in which more than six million people died, had complex causes, including the overflow from
the Rwandan genocide and the long history of kleptocratic governance under Mobutu. The value of minerals in the
Congo incentivized neighboring countries and international corporate players to get involved, and minerals were
used to purchase arms, which allowed some groups to continue to make a living through armed violence. These
neighboring African countries were responding to a budgetary crisis brought about by the structural-adjustment
programs of the 1980s and 1990s, which bankrupted African treasuries. During the war, occupying armies, especially
the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy, bought Congolese minerals and mined for them, often
forcing civilian populations to dig coltan at the “barrel of a gun”—to echo one NGO report. According to a 2002
UN report, eighty-five firms from twenty countries—including Anglo American, Barclays, Bayer, Cabot, HC Stark,
and Standard Chartered Bank—collaborated with occupying armies or illegal militias during the war. The UN
recommended economic sanctions on twenty-nine firms from Britain, the United States, Germany, Malaysia, Hong
Kong, and Belgium, but they were never implemented. The demand for minerals by foreign armies also helped fuel the
dollarization of the Congolese economy, and had many dramatic ramifications that continue to affect people to this
day.

For a while, the Machine was able to make enough money from his own sweat to become a middleman himself. But
when the price fell from one hundred dollars a kilo to ten dollars a kilo, it left thousands of people in the forest holding
worthless sand. The resulting indebtedness on the part of those, like the Machine, who financed their enterprise
using different sorts of “loans” (often interest-bearing ones) affected the entire region. It impacted everyone, from
urban entrepreneurs to low-level diggers, many of whom continued to stay in the mining business to pay their debts
or escape debts while living in the forest far from home. Several people have told me that this was the moment when
eastern Congolese became “addicted” to mining, because their debts made it so they had to look for other minerals in
the forest in order to return home. The Machine also had debts that he needed to pay off to various financial backers,
so he couldn’t return to the city of Goma, his original home. Instead he hung around in the forest, digging to make
ends meet, while waiting for something to happen. When the Machine heard that Bakumu trappers had discovered
cassiterite and bauxite in the middle of the rainforest at a place that came to be called Bisie (Bakumu for “it will never
end”), he went there to work, along with what soon turned out to be nearly twenty thousand others. During that
time (roughly 2003–10), the Machine says, he ate and drank like a king. But these days, a foreign company has taken
advantage of the work of these artisanal miners and secured a contract from the government to drill. The Machine and
his friends have been evacuated by the government from the site they discovered and developed. A small fraction of
them now work for the foreign company, building a road for a pittance.
                                                         –7–                                                 2221 – 5803


His physique no longer allows the Machine to live up to that name. Before, when the Machine’s boot touched the
ground, it left behind a major imprint, but now he treads lightly on the earth. He is not alone. The closure of the
artisanal mine at Bisie has put thousands of people out of work, and tied up millions of dollars’ worth of minerals for
businessmen who have taken loans from buyers back in the towns. The situation is dangerous, for those miners who
were once working are now stealing from people on the roads: “Bisie was our security,” the Machine laments, because
the work of mining kept people from more violent ways of making a living. The Machine is lucky because he works for
the company, but they feed their workers only twice a day. For the Machine and others, coltan was a peace-building
mineral because it kept them fed and allowed them to build sustainable futures. The closure of artisanal mines in 2010,
and an effective embargo on Congolese minerals since that time, have inaugurated a new kind of conflict and a new
sort of violence.

                         CONFLICT MINERAL OR PEACE-BUILDING MINERAL?

Despite the complex histories of the Congolese conflicts, NGOs have argued to the international community that there
is a direct relationship between coltan and conflict.

Unfortunately, the simple argument that some minerals cause violent conflict has had immediate and ironic effects. It
has allowed international actors to secure a de facto international embargo on Congolese minerals, with devastating
effects for Congolese. June 2, 2014, saw the deadline for US companies that purchase minerals sourced from the DR
Congo to submit their “conflict minerals report” documentation to the Securities and Exchange Commission in
accordance with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The law, which was promoted by prominent international NGOs
like the Enough Project and Global Witness, compels American companies to reveal whether the minerals in their
products originated in the DRC or any adjoining country, to report on the “due diligence” undertaken to examine
the supply chain, and to take measures if the minerals are not “conflict free.” In 2010, President Kabila responded to
such legislation by abruptly shutting down artisanal mining in the eastern DR Congo, which led to an epic social
crisis in those places dependent on mining. In the area around Bisie, the largest artisanal mine in the east, reported
malnutrition cases have increased more than tenfold in the last five years.

The new legislation has also made it easier for companies to tighten their grip on miners, using the concept of “conflict
minerals” and the association of conflict with artisanal mining to legitimate their claims to artisanally mined land. In
Rubaya, North Kivu, the company that purchased rights to the coltan mine there works with an international NGO to
track minerals from designated “conflict free” sites. They are the only company that miners can legally sell to, although
miners can also smuggle illegally through willing government agents by paying them fees. This company has bought
coltan from middlemen on credit, in accordance with a contract that stipulates that the middlemen be paid within two
weeks. As of November 2015, the company had held onto these minerals for months because they had not yet received
money from their buyer in Asia. Meanwhile, interest-bearing debts are accumulating, and many middlemen have been
compelled to sell their homes and take their children out of school—a situation that promises to promote violent
conflict between middlemen and the company on the one hand, and middlemen and the diggers on the other. As of
September 2015, the middlemen had surrounded the company’s office in Goma in an effort to prevent the company
from moving those minerals before they were paid; these same middlemen are unable to return to Rubaya for fear of
losing their lives, because they owe money to the diggers. It is a clear case of an outside organization—here an NGO
working alongside high-tech companies from the United States—unwittingly helping to produce conflict while trying
to generate peace because of a narrow and decontextualized understanding of what “conflict” is in the first place.

                                  THE MATERIALITY OF THE DIGITAL AGE

Those who work to extract the minerals used in digital devices produce the conditions of possibility for the so-called
digital age. The social forms they generate are as much part of this new world as the “incubators” of Silicon Valley. In
some ways, these miners also represent a new category of Congolese—dispossessed people who have lost whatever land
they had and for the most part no longer practice agriculture. These miners depend on these minerals and are subject
to instabilities in price and various forms of violence—from debt to war. But their dependence is also the source of new
forms of sociality, movement, and belonging that didn’t exist before. The technologies they make also help to enable
these new connections, as well as new ideas about what the future might look like. Miners embrace their incomplete

“global citizenship” in a number of ways, including the names they give to themselves. Their work is not merely
“material,” in the sense of being physical, nor does their occupation merely engage them in the dirty work of extracting
things from the ground. It also allows them to communicate with deceased ancestors who live in the ground or follow
workers through the forests. Mining is as much about rebuilding social worlds across space and time in the wake of war as it
is about extracting substances used in digital devices.
