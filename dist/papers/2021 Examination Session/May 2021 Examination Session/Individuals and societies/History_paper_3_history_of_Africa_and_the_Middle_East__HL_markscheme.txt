Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

Section 1: The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   Evaluate the consequences of the shift of power from Syria to Iraq.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the consequences of the shift of power
     from Syria to Iraq, weighing up its importance or limitations. Candidates may refer to the shift of the
     capital from Damascus to Baghdad which symbolized a new cultural centre closer to Iranian
     civilization. There was an increase in Sassanid/Iranian influence in the government; Sassanid
     models were used for ceremonials and administrative structures. A standing army on the Iranian
     model was formed to replace traditional tribal levies. These developments served to diminish Arab
     influence in government and the capital. The location of Baghdad at the Tigris and Euphrates rivers
     increased trade and trade routes throughout the empire and made it a meeting point for scholars
     from East and West, which contributed to the development of the Golden Age of Islam. Other
     relevant factors may be addressed such as the continuation of Umayyad autocracy and relations
     with the Byzantine Empire but with a focus on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’
     opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   “The size of the ‘Abbasid Empire was the main reason for its decline.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     size of the ‘Abbasid Empire was the main reason for its decline. Causes may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the difficulty of communication and controlling local factions over a wide area. The numerous
     ethnic and cultural groups made unity difficult and led to groups seeking more independence such
     as the Fatimids. Defence was difficult and costly due to the large number of external enemies.
     Other relevant factors may be addressed such as dynastic struggles and financial mismanagement
     which weakened the central government and encouraged factionalism. Religious divisions and
     disputes caused internal conflict and weakened the central government. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions must be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –5–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2: The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   “The Fatimids had little impact on the Muslim world.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     Fatimids had little impact on the Muslim world. Causes and results may predate or extend beyond
     the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     refer to the hostility of many Muslims to the Ismaili interpretation of Islam. Failure to establish a
     claim to the caliphate showed weakness. The Fatimid regime was overthrown by the Sunni
     majority in 1171. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, their enormous economic
     influence and extension of trade routes, and the expansion of Muslim presence in the Indian
     Ocean, Asia and Africa. Their creation of institutions of scholarship and higher learning increased
     Muslim intellectual development. Cultural initiatives in architecture and ceramics also had
     considerable influence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “The policy of religious toleration was responsible for the strength of the Fatimid Empire.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the policy of religious toleration was responsible for the strength of the Fatimid Empire.
     Candidates may refer to Fatimid religious relations with Muslims and non-Muslims which
     eliminated conflict within the empire. Fatimid leaders recruited the most able officials regardless of
     religion. Fatimid policies encouraged economic development through inter-action with non-Muslims
     and attracted non-Muslim merchants and manufacturers. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
     for example, Fatimid strength was based on their powerful army, their opponents were weak which
     allowed them to expand. Their economic development increased their financial strength, supported
     the army and spread their influence. Their strategic location in Egypt was a major advantage.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –6–                  M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3: The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   Evaluate the importance of leadership in determining the outcome of the Third Crusade
     (1189–1192).

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the outcome of the
     Third Crusade (1189–1192), weighing up the strengths and limitations or otherwise of leadership
     as the determining factor. Candidates may refer to the skills and influence of Saladin as a strategist
     and inspirational leader and Richard I as a skilled military leader. The death of Frederick
     Barbarossa and the departure of Phillip II limited Western strength and co-operation. Strategic
     disputes amongst the Christian leaders were also a cause of weakness. Other relevant factors may
     be addressed, for example, increased Muslim unity and strength; lack of support from Europe for
     the Crusade; poor relations with the Byzantine Empire; weakness and divisions in the Crusader
     states and the difficult physical environment. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   “The Crusades had a negative impact on the Middle East.” To what extent do you agree with this
     statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     Crusades had a negative impact on the Middle East. Results may extend beyond the timeframe
     but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the loss
     of territory and the physical and human loss caused by centuries of warfare. The political and
     territorial divisions within the Muslim world created by the Crusades which added to the destruction
     and hardship may be referred to. The Crusades weakened the ‘Abbasid dynasty making it more
     vulnerable to the Mongol invasion. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example,
     increased unity and power in the Muslim world, the emergence of powerful leaders, expanded
     commercial ties with Europe increased wealth, the Byzantine Empire was weakened by the West
     which aided the expansion of Muslim power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –7–                 M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4: The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Evaluate the reasons for Ottoman success in their struggle with the Safavids.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for Ottoman success in
     their struggle with the Safavids, weighing up the strengths of the Ottomans and the limitations or
     otherwise of the Safavids. Candidates may refer to the leadership of the Ottoman Sultan Selim I,
     who was ruthless in his opposition to the Safavids. The Ottoman army was much larger, better
     equipped and better trained than the Safavid army; which allowed them to win key battles and
     occupy the Safavid capital. The Ottomans made alliances with enemies of the Safavids. The
     Ottoman Empire controlled sea routes and territories enabling them to limit Safavid expansion. The
     continuous expansion of the Ottoman Empire gave them the power to dominate the Safavids
     throughout the period. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
     by relevant evidence.


8.   “The capture of Constantinople transformed the Ottoman state.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     capture of Constantinople transformed the Ottoman state. Consequences may extend beyond the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
     to the great expansion of Ottoman commercial and strategic interests in the Mediterranean. The
     Ottoman Empire became a new cultural and intellectual centre attracting artists and scholars. The
     removal of the last Christian state in the Middle East enabled the Ottomans to expand into the
     Middle East. Ottoman power was recognized in Europe and the Ottomans became part of the
     European treaty system; many Europeans came to study at Ottoman institutions. The position of
     the Sultan was strengthened as he now had a permanent capital. Candidates’ opinions and
     conclusions will be clearly presented and supported by relevant content.
                                                  –8–                   M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 5: Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    To what extent was the Almoravid jihad responsible for the fall of the Ghana Empire?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Almoravid jihad was responsible for the fall of the Ghana Empire. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of the role of the Almoravid jihad of 1076–1077 on the fall of the Ghana Empire and other
      factors, or they may prioritize their assessment of one over the other. However, both aspects will
      be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the Almoravid jihad weakening the Empire
      by cutting off trade routes; the capture of major trading cities such as Audaghast in 1054; the jihad
      interfering with Ghana’s control of the nomads, thus weakening their political position. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed such as overgrazing and the loss of its natural resources.
      Candidates may refer to the destruction of what was left of Ghana by Sundiata, who then
      incorporated it into Mali. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Discuss the importance of the Indian Ocean trade in the rise and growth of the Swahili city states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that the
      Indian Ocean trade played an important role in the rise and growth of the Swahili city states.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the Indian Ocean trade and other factors or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to the Indian Ocean trade causing the emergence of markets
      some of which developed into city states such as Mogadishu, Lamu, Malindi, Zanzibar, Kilwa,
      Mozambique and Sofala, as a result of the expansion in trade and the wealth amassed. They may
      refer to the role played by the Sultan in encouraging trade and agriculture in the area, and the role
      of the Indian traders in the development of the city states such as Zanzibar. Other relevant factors
      may be addressed, such as the existence of great leaders and availability of trade resources,
      migration of Bantu people and the existence of natural harbours. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –9–                   M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 6: Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   “Trade played the most important role in the rise of the Niger Delta trading states.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that trade
      played the most important role in the rise of the Niger Delta trading states. Reasons may predate
      the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the strategic location of the states, which enabled them to control trading ports especially
      those used in the palm oil trade. The importance of the slave trade and slavery may also be
      referred to. Other relevant factors may be addressed, such as social mobility in the states, which
      helped in the maintenance of unity among the Niger Delta states and the rise of leaders such as
      Jaja of Opobo and Nana of Itsekiri. The important role of middlemen may also be discussed.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


12.   Examine the importance of leadership to the rise of two of the following: the Mandinka empire
      under Samori Toure; the Lozi kingdom under Lewanika; the Ndebele kingdom under Mzilikazi and
      Lobengula; the Asante empire under Osei Tutu; the Nyamwezi under Mirambo; the Hehe state
      under Mkwawa.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the importance of
      leadership in the rise of any two chosen states/empires. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      the two leaders or they may prioritize their evaluation of one over the other. However, both leaders
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to personal qualities of the leaders such as
      good organisation; their ability to control trade and the economy in general; their ability to establish
      good relationships within their kingdoms and also with neighbouring communities. Other relevant
      factors that may be addressed would include their political and economic organisation such as the
      setting up of centralized systems of government and emphasis on trade respectively. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –               M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 7: The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   “The most important impact of the slave trade in Africa was economic.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important impact of the slave trade in Africa was economic. Candidates may refer to
      economic impacts such as the emergence of wealthy traders such as Tippu Tip, who economically
      benefitted from the trade; the development of wealthy city states, which were trade centres for the
      slave trade; and the devastation of traditional economic activities, thus leading to
      underdevelopment. Other relevant factors may be addressed such as the slave trade leading to
      both the destruction of kingdoms and groups such as the Bari of Sudan; depopulation; heightened
      tensions with communities such as the Chagga of Tanganyika; the collaboration of some groups
      that led to negative social impacts. Candidates may also refer to how able-bodied men from Sudan
      were exported as slaves to Egypt and Arabia where some worked in plantations. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Evaluate the role of colonial expansion in the decline of the East African slave trade in the 19th
      century.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of colonial expansion in the
      decline of the East African slave trade in the 19th century. Candidates may refer to how the British
      supported the Sultan in inviting the Indian Banyan traders from India to settle in Zanzibar with the
      hope of ending slave trading. They may refer to the banning of the slave trade as a result of
      various laws passed, such as the Act of Parliament of 1807 in Britain. Both the Moresby and
      Hamerton treaties played an important part in ending the slave trade. By 1833, slavery was made
      illegal throughout the British Empire. By 1873, the British forced Sultan Barghash to bring the slave
      trade to an end. Other relevant factors may be addressed such as the introduction of legitimate
      commerce, the role of missionaries and the role of the humanitarian movement. Candidates’
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 11 –                M21/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 8: European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   “African political and cultural disunity was the main reason for partition.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      African political disunity was the main reason for partition. Reasons may predate the timeframe but
      they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of the role played by African political and cultural disunity and other factors, or they may
      prioritize their assessment of one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to how the enmity between African societies, caused by their
      political and cultural differences, weakened their ability to join forces to fight against the colonial
      powers. They may also address the weak military organisation and a lack of sophisticated
      weapons. Candidates may consider humanitarian and economic factors among others, but these
      must have a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Evaluate the impact of the Berlin West Africa Conference on the partition of Africa.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Berlin West Africa
      Conference on the partition of Africa. Candidates may weigh up the effects of the Berlin
      Conference on individual colonial powers’ action. Candidates may evaluate how the Berlin West
      African Conference took away the autonomy of the African communities and set up rules on how
      European powers could own territories. It led to the division of Africa. Candidates may refer to the
      effective occupation and free navigation by the powers concerned over the Congo and Niger rivers,
      both of which had been areas of conflict among the colonial powers. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed such as the role of missionaries and collaboration by African leaders, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 9: Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   To what extent was Cetshwayo responsible for the conquest and destruction of the Zulu kingdom?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Cetshwayo was responsible for the conquest and destruction of the Zulu kingdom. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of the role played by Cetshwayo and other factors, or they may prioritize their
      assessment of one over the other. Candidates may refer to Cetshwayo’s withdrawal of forces from
      the borders, which may have weakened their protection. His failure to satisfy the ultimatum issued
      by Sir Henry Bartle Frere in 1878, lead to the British attack on the Zulu in 1879. Cetshwayo’s
      strategy may have contributed to their military defeat. Candidates may also refer to British support
      for the Boer claim on Zulu land, and the discovery of diamonds which contributed to British interest
      in destroying the Zulu kingdom. Weakness in the Zulu organisation made it difficult to organise a
      strong military force during the war with the British. Other relevant factors such as the military
      superiority of the British may be addressed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Discuss the reasons for resistance and collaboration with the colonial power in Buganda.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      there was both resistance and collaboration to colonial power in the Buganda Kingdom. Reasons
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of reasons for resistance and reasons for collaboration or
      they may prioritize their discussion of one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature
      of the response. Candidates may refer to factors for resistance such as the British interference with
      the traditional systems such as preventing the Buganda Kabaka from receiving tribute from the
      Busoga. Candidates may also consider how the British taking away Kabaka Mwanga’s control over
      all the land in the kingdom contributed to resistance. The role played by the rivalry between the
      Buganda and the Bunyoro and economic benefits to be achieved from the colonial powers, can be
      discussed as some of the reasons for collaboration. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Compare and contrast German and British rule in Tanganyika to 1961.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      German and British governments in terms of their rule in Tanganyika, referring to both throughout.
      There does not need to be an equal coverage of both. Candidates may refer to the social,
      economic and political aspects of the rule of both the Germans and the British in Tanganyika. Both
      the Germans and the British relied on plantation agriculture, which they controlled. Candidates may
      address how the Germans encouraged cotton plantations, leading to food shortages and
      resistance. Both the Germans and British used a combination of direct and indirect rule. Both used
      harsh methods of rule and benefited economically. The British were keen on economic
      development, thus by the mid-1920s they were able to help with the reconstruction of Tanganyika
      through dealing with the food situation. Under British rule, more hospitals were constructed and
      subsidies were provided for missionary-run schools. Candidates may mention that Tanganyika
      under the British was a mandate territory and therefore the British supported the development of
      the territory as it progressed towards its independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Examine the contribution of constitutional developments to the independence of Nigeria to 1960.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between constitutional
      developments in Nigeria and its achievement of independence. Candidates may refer to 1914
      when the Northern and Southern Protectorates were amalgamated with Lord Lugard as Governor
      General. They may also refer to Sir Clifford’s 1922 Constitution that led to the formation of a
      legislative council. The effects of the Richard’s Constitution of 1946 led to the creation of the
      National Council of Nigerian Citizens, which mobilised the Nigerians to fight for political
      independence. Candidates may examine how after the Second World War, a new progressive
      constitution gave Nigerians more representation in the National Assembly, thus taking up electoral
      positions. Change in constitutional development, leading to the establishment of a federal
      government with the creation of the position of a prime minister may also be examined. Other
      relevant factors such as the role of political parties and leadership may be considered, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 11: 20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   “The actions of the South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO) were the most important
      factor in Namibia becoming independent.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the actions of SWAPO were the most important factor in Namibia becoming independent.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the role played by SWAPO and other factors, or they may
      prioritize their discussion of one over the other. Candidates may refer to SWAPO as a uniting
      factor and its establishment of the People’s Liberation of Namibia in 1966 was responsible for an
      insurrection. The impact of sabotage, guerrilla warfare and terrorism by SWAPO may be
      considered. Namibia gained independence in 1990 with Sam Nujoma as the first President. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed such as external pressure from the United Nations and the fact
      that military interventions led to economic strain on South Africa, contributing to them granting
      Namibia independence. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   To what extent were political parties responsible for the independence of Senegal in 1960?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits of the suggestion that political parties
      were responsible for the independence of Senegal in 1960. Candidates may refer to the activities
      of the Young Senegalese Party and the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in the struggle for
      independence. However, these parties did not generally support independence from France, but
      strived for greater recognition of the Senegalese as French citizens with voting rights for the
      French National Assembly. Leopold Senghor, the most influential political leader prior to 1960,
      rejected independence in 1958 in favour of federation with France. His later support for
      independence resulted from French failure to provide greater autonomy for Senegal within the
      Franco-African Federation. Candidates may consider other factors that led to independence such
      as French weakness after the Second World War, the conflict in Algeria, which reduced French
      enthusiasm for colonialism, and the recognition by France in 1960 that independence was
      inevitable. The influence of African leaders such as Nkrumah and Toure may also be considered.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 12: The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   “The rise of nationalism was the main challenge to Ottoman power up to 1840.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      rise of nationalism was the main challenge to Ottoman power up to 1840. Causes may predate the
      time frame but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
      the Greek War of Independence, which resulted in Ottoman defeat; nationalist movements in
      France and Russia led to annexations of Ottoman territory in Africa and Central Asia; rising
      nationalism in the Balkans challenged Ottoman power. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example, Ottoman financial, military and government inefficiencies and internal conflicts led to
      loss of power. Powerful local leaders such as Mehmet Ali seized control of Egypt, which was a
      major loss, the Ottoman government was not able to appeal to non-Muslims and those wanting
      progress, who withdrew their support. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions must be presented
      clearly and supported by relevant evidence.


24.   Evaluate the reasons for the failure of the Young Turks to reform the Ottoman Empire after 1908.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the failure of the
      Young Turks’ reform movement, weighing up the strengths and limitations or otherwise of their
      policies. Candidates may refer to their lack of strong leadership and a clear political programme;
      their secular attitudes were unpopular with many Muslims; the Ottoman Empire was multicultural
      and no platform would satisfy all demands. They failed to satisfy the demands of various ethnic
      and religious groups for independence; their Turkish nationalism alienated minorities; foreign
      intervention caused resentment of their western, reformist ideas; the Sultan remained popular and
      encouraged conservative groups. Financial weakness made reforms difficult to achieve. They did
      have some success in reforming the army. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions must be clearly
      expressed and supported by relevant evidence.

Section 13: War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   “The Declaration of Independence reduced British influence in Egypt after 1922.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Declaration of Independence reduced British influence in Egypt after 1922. Reasons for
      reduced British influence may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may discuss that in 1922 Egypt was declared an independent state
      with a democratic constitution, free elections and a popular nationalist movement seeking total
      independence. Power was now shared between the British, the king and parliament. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example, Britain did retain military control of Egypt, power to
      suppress popular movements and interfere in Egyptian affairs. Other factors which reduced British
      influence would be Britain’s weakened state after the First World War and the constant demands
      for total Egyptian independence. British influence was finally reduced under the Treaty of 1936
      which gave Egypt more independence although with some provisos. Candidates’ opinions and
      conclusions must be clearly expressed and supported by relevant evidence.


26.   “Ataturk was successful in achieving his aims.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Ataturk was successful in achieving his aims. The discussion of the success of the policies may
      extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to his defence and recovery of Turkish territory confirmed at the Treaty of
      Lausanne; his reforms to education and literacy; creation of a secular state which reduced religious
      authority and established women’s rights and a modern legal system; establishment of a
      democratic constitution leading to multi-party democracy; and the establishment of government
      enterprises which laid the foundation for Turkish industrialization. Candidates may consider how
      some of his reforms such as modernisation were seen as being too drastic in abolishing old
      traditions. His secularisation of the state also met protest. Overall, he created a progressive
      democracy with a modern sense of progress and nationalism. Candidates’ opinions and
      conclusions must be presented clearly and supported by relevant evidence.

Section 14: Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27.   “The Organization of African Unity (OAU) failed to achieve its objectives.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Organization of African Unity (OAU) failed to achieve its objectives. The conclusion may extend
      beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may refer to the failure of the OAU to achieve a number of its objectives such as improving human
      rights and living conditions in African states; its inability to prevent conflicts and resolve disputes
      amongst African states; its inability to promote unity as a result of the Cold War and conflicting
      national ambitions; it also had limited success in promoting economic development. Candidates
      may refer to some successes in opposing minority white regimes by supporting independence
      movements and in developing a stronger African identity in institutions such as the UN.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


28.   “The UN was successful in its interventions in Africa.” Discuss with reference to two of the
      following: Congo, Mozambique, Somalia or Rwanda.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the UN was successful in its intervention in Africa. The response will be with reference to two
      countries. The reasons for the success or failure of the two interventions may predate the
      timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. The judgements on
      success or failure should consider the nature and extent of the crisis, the aims of the opposing
      sides as well as contributing cultural and ethnic factors. The outcome of the UN intervention should
      also be discussed with respect to the degree to which conflicts were resolved, the costs human
      and otherwise of the intervention, the extent to which the UN intervention created a lasting
      settlement, the degree to which the settlement was supported by all groups in the chosen countries
      as well as outside forces. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Evaluate the impact of the segregation policies of Smuts and Hertzog between 1910 and 1948.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the segregation polices
      of Smuts and Herzog. Impacts may extend beyond the time frame but must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the impact of the Natives’ Land Act, which
      evicted many Africans from their land and reduced them to a state of permanent poverty and
      confinement to native reserves. Africans were excluded from towns unless they had permission to
      work there and complied with the laws which restricted their movements. Non-whites also lost jobs
      in the mining industry, railroads and government. Those employed were paid lower wages than
      whites. After 1936, no Africans held the franchise. A further impact was the formation of the ANC in
      1912 to oppose segregation. The impact on whites was to encourage the growth of Afrikaner
      domination and nationalism through organizations such as the Broederbond which espoused
      extreme racial views. Candidates may also refer to the rise of apartheid, influenced by the view
      amongst Afrikaners that the segregation policies had not been sufficiently strict in controlling the
      African population. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


30.   Evaluate the contribution of the Black Consciousness movement to resisting apartheid.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of the Black
      Consciousness movement to resisting apartheid, weighing up the strengths and limitations or
      otherwise of the Black Consciousness movement. Candidates may refer to the awakening caused
      by the movement, which called for unity of black people to fight for liberation. They may address
      the formation of various political organisations such as the Black People’s Convention, and the
      impact of the death of Steve Biko. The movement was characterised by rebellions and protest that
      contributed to the end of apartheid. Other relevant factors may be addressed, but with a focus on
      the issue in the question, for example the repressive policies and the crackdown on political
      organizations. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 16: Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31.   To what extent did colonialism change social and cultural values in any two African countries?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      colonialism changed social and cultural values in any two chosen African countries. Both countries
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how colonialism changed social and
      cultural values through the introduction of formal education, religion and the social impact of paid
      employment may also be considered. New farming methods, infrastructures such as medical
      facilities and transport were developed. New household goods and languages were also
      introduced such as English and French. Other relevant factors may be addressed, but with a focus
      on the issue in the question, to support the fact that not all social and cultural values were changed
      by colonialism. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


32.   With reference to two African countries, examine the view that technological developments had a
      significant social impact.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between technological
      developments and significant social impact, in any two African countries. Both countries will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to how technological developments socially
      impacted the two countries as far as transport and communication are concerned. For example,
      with improved transport people were able to move long distance to look for employment and this
      affected the composition of the traditional African family. The impact of technology on agriculture
      and medicine may also be considered. On the other hand, candidates may also look at how
      technological developments had a limited social impact in some countries, where traditional
      systems of agriculture, transport and communication were maintained and thus reducing the social
      impact of technology in some areas. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

33.   With reference to the period between 1945 and 1956, evaluate the causes and effects of the
      1948–49 War in the Middle East.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the causes and effects of the 1948–
      1949 War in the Middle East. Causes and effects may extend beyond the timeframe but they must
      be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      causes and effects or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However, both aspects
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the Arab resentment of increasing
      Jewish settlements in Palestine, the failure of Britain to develop a peaceful solution and the
      creation of the state of Israel which led to invasion by Arab states. The effects may include the
      survival of the state of Israel, a large refugee problem in Arab states, Arab governments in Syria
      and Egypt were overthrown by groups unhappy with the defeat, a permanent state of hostility in the
      Middle East and the decline of Western influence (Suez). Candidates’ opinions and conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Discuss the reasons for the rise and collapse of the United Arab Republic (UAR).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the rise and collapse of the United Arab Republic. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the
      reasons for the rise and the collapse or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them.
      However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Reasons for the rise of the UAR may
      include the popularity of Nasser and Pan-Arabism, Syrian fear of US influence led them to ally with
      Nasser. Reasons for collapse may refer to the social and cultural differences between Egyptians
      and Syrians, Syrian resentment of Egyptian domination of government and imposition of Egyptian
      economic policies. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the actions of other
      Middle Eastern states and leaders. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions must be well presented
      and supported by relevant evidence.

35.   Compare and contrast the causes of ethnic conflict in two African countries.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between two African countries in
      terms of the causes of ethnic conflict, referring to both throughout. There does not have to be equal
      number of causes for each. Candidates may identify the social, economic and political causes of
      ethnic conflicts. They may refer to economic factors such as disputes over land and boundaries;
      resources or trade routes; feeling of inequality and demand for inclusion in societies with many
      ethnic groups; religious and cultural differences; historic factors and traditions of conflict between
      certain groups; ideological differences, particularly political tension, especially in nations moving
      from one-party states. Interference from outside forces seeking to create conflict for their own
      purposes may also be considered. Candidates may also look at the role played by media
      sensationalism in hyping ethnic conflict. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


36.   “The failure of democracy was the main reason for the establishment of single-party states.”
      Discuss with reference to two African countries.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the failure of
      democracy was the main reason for the establishment of single-party states in two African
      countries. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one. However, both countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer
      to the failure of democracy to solve problems such as economic distress, poverty and disease,
      establish a peaceful society or improve education and health. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example, impact of wars and invasion, ambitions of individuals or groups,
      interference from external forces and new ideological movements. Candidates’ opinions and
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
