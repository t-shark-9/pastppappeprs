           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the impact of population change on two societies, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of population growth,
     weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two societies must be from different regions. Impact
     may extend beyond the timeframe of the question, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies or they may prioritize discussion of one
     of them. However, both societies will be a feature of the response. Candidates may argue that
     population growth stimulated agricultural efficiency, for example improved axes and ploughs in
     Europe, and economic growth, in places such as Song China, by generating larger markets for
     goods and providing cheap labour. In some areas, urban (for example the Flemish towns) and
     long-distance migration (for example Bantu expansion) resulted. There may be evaluation of the
     social and economic impact of the Black Death, in the long and short term. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Discuss the social and economic influence of religious institutions on two societies, each chosen
     from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
     economic influence of religious institutions on two societies. The two societies must be from
     different regions. Influence may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the
     issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies, or they
     may prioritize discussion of one of them. However, both societies will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may discuss educational impact, such as the support of education by Hindu religious
     endowments; the support of higher education by, for example, mosques in Cairo and Fez and by
     the Pope to Charles IV in Prague. Candidates may refer to economic activities, such as agriculture
     and construction, for example, in the great monastic estates of England and France. They may
     refer to the role of religious institutions in upholding traditional social relationships, such as
     marriage, and loyalty to social “superiors” and in tending to the sick and the poor. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                   –5–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of wars (750–1500)

3.   “Religion was the most important cause of wars in the period 750–1500.” With reference to two
     wars, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     most important causes of wars in this period were religious. The two wars may or may not be from
     the same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may prioritize
     their assessment of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may consider the role of religious leaders in increasing tensions, for example Pope Urban II; the
     impetus to invasions provided by the promise of afterlife rewards; the need to secure prisoners for
     sacrifice by, for example, the Aztecs. Candidates may propose that in the case of some wars
     religious and political leadership are indivisible. Other relevant factors such as economic or political
     factors may be addressed, but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “Wars in the period 750–1500 resulted in significant boundary and dynastic changes.” Discuss with
     reference to two wars, each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that wars in this period resulted in significant boundary and dynastic changes. The two wars must
     be from different regions. Changes may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both wars or
     they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the
     response. Candidates may discuss territorial and dynastic changes resulting from invasions, as in
     the case of the Crusades or the Norman Conquest. Candidates may also discuss the permanency
     of changes, as in the case of the Hundred Years War, in which the French crown returned to the
     Valois; or the extent of the change in wars of succession where control shifted between contenders
     with the same lineage, for example the ‘Abassid Civil War. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –6–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Evaluate the administration and interpretation of law by two rulers, each chosen from a different
     region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the administration and interpretation of
     law by two rulers weighing up the strengths and limitations or otherwise. The two rulers must be
     from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both rulers or they may prioritize
     their evaluation of one of them. However, both rulers will be a feature of the response. Candidates
     may refer to origin of the law (for example tribal custom, accepted philosophy or religious
     guidelines) and evaluate the extent of its acceptance. Candidates may also evaluate, depending
     on the chosen examples, the impact of the creation of a comprehensive legal code; law in the form
     of several complementary texts, or a body of knowledge transmitted orally in societies with no
     writing system, as done by the Incas. Candidates may evaluate how the organisation of the law
     may have eased or hindered its administration and interpretation. Candidates may also discuss the
     uniformity in the application of the law and whether sanctions were applied consistently across
     different groups/classes by the ruler. Candidates may also evaluate, for example, whether some
     communities may have had some degree of autonomy in legal matters. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   With reference to two rulers, compare and contrast the methods used to address external
     challenges to their power.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two rulers in terms of the methods used to address external challenges to their power, referring to
     both rulers throughout. There does not need to be an equal number of each. The two rulers may or
     may not be from the same region. Candidates may refer to the fortification of borders and/or
     protection of territories from encroaching states, as experienced by Abd al-Rahman III who pacified
     borders with Christian Spain and Northern Africa, or Baibars who fought off the Mongol threat.
     Candidates may also refer to the creation of military alliances against a common enemy (for
     example Itzcoatl with the Aztec Triple Alliance), or the formation of trade systems which promoted
     regional hegemony. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example internal steps taken to
     raise or finance an army and unify an empire, as well as to reduce opposition, but with a focus on
     the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Compare and contrast the treatment of minority or indigenous peoples in two societies.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     the treatment of minority or indigenous peoples, referring to both throughout. There does not need
     to be an equal number of each. Candidates may refer to the treatment of indigenous peoples in
     colonial societies in the Americas, such as the Aztecs and native American Indians; or to their
     treatment as a result of the expansion of a central power, such as in Ming China, which was
     dominated by a different ethnic group. Candidates may refer to the treatment of Jewish and Muslim
     minorities in Europe and the impact of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation. For example, the
     Reconquista saw discrimination against Muslims, while Protestant minorities migrated from
     Catholic dominated areas towards France and the Low Countries. In some societies, the treatment
     of minority or indigenous peoples changed little; for example, the spread of Islam in Africa was
     tolerant of indigenous faiths.


8.   Evaluate the significance of two key intellectual/scientific figures, each chosen from a different
     region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of two key
     intellectual/scientific figures, weighing up their significance or otherwise. The two figures must be
     from different regions. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe of the question but it must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two figures, or they
     may prioritize discussion of one of them. However, both figures will be a feature of the response.
     Candidates may refer to one important scientific figure who challenged the accepted knowledge of
     his time, for example Galileo or Copernicus. They may also refer to some intellectual figures that
     played a significant role in philosophy or literature, for example, Mulla Sadra and the development
     of the philosophies of the Islamic Golden Age or Wang Yang Ming and the “Yangming School of
     Mind” which became the dominant Confucian school in China. They may refer to the political
     impact of some intellectual figures, for example Machiavelli on Europe or Inca Garcilaso de la
     Vega on the indigenous elites of the Peruvian viceroyalty. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
     be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Examine the impact of territorial expansion on the political organization of two Early Modern
      states.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the impact of
      territorial expansion and political organization. The two Early Modern states may or may not be
      from the same region. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the attempts to centralize the political
      system or increase bureaucracy, for example, in the Spanish colonial system and the creation of
      new officials such as viceroys, corregidores or visitadores. They may also refer to the
      empowerment of some groups, for example the Emirs’ power in the Ajuran Sultanate. Candidates
      may argue that some colonial empires gave some administrative independence to the colonies or
      provinces. Other aspects may be considered, for example changes in the social status of officials,
      but with a focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   With reference to one Early Modern state, discuss the challenges to its power and how
      successfully they were overcome.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the challenges to
      the power of one Early Modern state and how successfully they were overcome. Challenges may
      predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to political challenges in limiting the power of a king or emperor, for example,
      the challenge of the Shogun to the Emperor in the Tokugawa Shogunate. They may refer to
      religious challenges, for example the conflicts between Emperor Charles V and the Lutheran
      princes in the Holy Roman Empire. Wars or rebellions can also be considered, for example Hindu
      rebellions in the Mughal Empire or the war between Huascar and Atahualpa. They may refer to
      economic issues, for example the slave trade and the power of the Oba in the Benin Empire. In the
      chosen state candidates will discuss how successfully challenges were overcome. Other factors
      may be addressed, for example issues after the conquest of new lands. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –9–                  M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   “The most important causes of war were religious.” With reference to two Early Modern wars, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important causes of Early Modern wars were religious. The two Early Modern wars may or
      may not be from the same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the confrontation of different
      religions such as Christianity and Islam; for example, candidates may appraise the role of religion
      in causing the Ottoman–Habsburg wars. They may refer to the emergence of Protestantism in
      various areas of Europe, for example, the Wars of Kappel and the confrontation between
      Protestant and Catholic cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Candidates may argue that
      religious and political factors may combine in causing some wars, for example, the Eighty Years’
      War, in which Calvinists in the Spanish Netherlands fought against the Catholic Emperor Philip II.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example economics or political reasons, but with a
      focus on the issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “The most important effects of Early Modern wars were social.” Discuss with reference to two
      wars, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the most important effects of war were social. The two wars must be from different regions.
      Effects may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of two wars, or they may prioritize their
      assessment of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      assess the effects of major wars such as the Thirty Years’ War (which caused large-scale
      depopulation) or the Japanese invasions of Korea (which destroyed agricultural communities); they
      may assess the impact of a colonial war, such as the Spanish Inca War, which also resulted in
      depopulation and the expansion of an alien colonial class. Candidates may argue that war did not
      always have a severe social impact; for example, the Dutch “Golden Age”, with its burgeoning
      middle and merchant classes, began well before the War of Independence had ended. Other
      relevant economic, religious, political and territorial effects may be addressed, but with a focus on
      the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
                                                   – 10 –                M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   “The exploitation of natural resources was the most significant contributor to industrialization.”
      Discuss with reference to two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the exploitation of natural resources was the most significant contributor to industrialization in
      two countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of both countries, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However,
      both countries will be a feature of the response. Candidates may discuss how the improvements in
      the exploitation and production of iron allowed countries such as Britain or Germany to make better
      use of their own resources; avoiding dependence on imports and facilitating the production of steel,
      leading to mass production. Advancements in the exploitation of coal and fossil fuels provided the
      means for transport and to power factories. Candidates may also discuss how the extraction and
      processing of timber at a larger scale helped construction and contributed to industrialization.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example developments in energy and power,
      transportation, mass production or communication, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


14.   “Opposition to industrialization was limited.” Discuss with reference to two countries, each from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that opposition to industrialization in two countries was limited. The two countries must be from
      different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries, or they may prioritize
      their discussion of one of them. However, both countries will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates should identify the nature of opposition to industrialization and its extent. Candidates
      may refer to the growth in opposition as a result of, for example, changes in the composition of the
      workforce, declining working conditions, impact on urban centres or environmental concerns.
      Candidates may also comment on the growth or decline in opposition as a result of, for example,
      the introduction of legal reforms to safeguard workers, the changes in role and status of women,
      state support of industrialization, as well as growing local and global pressure to protect the
      environment. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the differences in the regions
      and periods of industrialization and their impact on the extent of opposition. Candidates’ opinions
      or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 – 11 –               M21/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Evaluate the importance of external factors in the growth of two independence movements, each
      from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of external factors in
      the growth of two independence movements, weighing up the strengths and importance or
      otherwise. The two independence movements must be from different regions. The external factors
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of each independence movement, or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one of them. However, both movements will be a feature of the response. Candidates
      may appraise the importance of external military help as a factor in fostering independence, for
      example, the role of France and Britain in the independence of Greece. Candidates may also
      appraise the importance of external economic interests, for example, US interests in the
      independence of Cuba. They may also refer to the importance of Cold War in the independence
      movements, for example in Angola. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


16.   Evaluate the factors, excluding leadership, that led to the success of one independence
      movement.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors, excluding leadership, that
      led to the success of one independence movement, weighing up their strengths and importance or
      otherwise. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the role of nationalism in the success of the independence
      movement, for example, in the independence of Ireland. They may consider the weakness of the
      colonial power and appraise its importance, for example the situation of the Ottoman Empire and
      the independence of Greece. Candidates may argue the importance of military strategies or
      guerrillas for the success, for example in the Algerian War of Independence. They may refer to
      foreign interests and military or economic help, for example in the independence of Cuba. Other
      factors may include, for example racial, ethnic or religious conflicts. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   “Ideology was the most important influence on the evolution of democratic states.” Discuss with
      reference to two states, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that ideology was the most important influence on the evolution of democratic states. The two
      states must come from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or
      prioritize their assessment of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may discuss the Weimar Republic, where a liberal constitution, protected civil liberties,
      promoted gender equality and encouraged artistic freedom. They may refer to Nehru’s India, which
      was guided by socialist economic policies, while also establishing liberal principles, such as
      freedom of speech; or South Africa, where socialist economic and social reform, it may be argued,
      was compromised by corruption and single-party domination. In Alfonsín’s Argentina, ideology
      played little part in the face of economic crisis. Other relevant factors, such as immigration,
      economic forces and foreign influences may be addressed, but with a focus on the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the impact of changing social policies in two states, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of changing social policies
      in two states, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two states must be from different
      regions. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may prioritize
      their evaluation of one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. There may
      be evaluation of the impact of educational policies, such as the abandonment of selection into
      secondary education, broadening access to tertiary education or improving primary provision.
      There may be evaluation of the impact of policies towards women and the family, including
      abortion, marital rights, childcare provision, and access to paid work. There may be evaluation of
      healthcare provision and welfare, and the effectiveness with which poverty was addressed.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Evaluate the impact of foreign policy on the maintenance of power in two authoritarian states, each
      from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of foreign policy on the
      maintenance of power in two authoritarian states, weighing up its importance or otherwise. The two
      authoritarian states must be from different regions. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      authoritarian states, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both states will
      be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the role of the authoritarian ruler defending
      national interests and its impact on their popularity, for example, the increase of Nasser’s
      popularity after the Suez Crisis. They may also refer to the use of a foreign policy to unify the
      population around the regime, for example, Castro's confrontations against the US. Candidates
      may evaluate the impact of the Cold War, for example, Sukarno's relationship with the Soviet
      Union. They may also refer to the importance of wars, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


20.   “Full authoritarian control could not be achieved.” With reference to two states, to what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the extent to which full authoritarian control was or
      was not achieved in two states. The two states may or may not come from different regions.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may prioritize their evaluation of
      one of them. However, both states will be a feature of the response. Candidates may assess the
      extent of rulers’ constitutional power. In Germany, for example, Hitler could make laws without
      requiring the approval of a parliament or superior authority. There may be an assessment of the
      extent of the power of the security forces, such as the NKVD in the USSR, and whether the
      judiciary’s independence had been removed. Candidates may assess the extent both of opposition
      and control over the media, culture, education and social activity. The impact of mass mobilisation,
      such as the Anti movements in China, may be assessed. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   “The most important causes of wars were political.” With reference to two wars, to what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important causes of two wars were political. The two wars may or may not come from the
      same region. Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised by
      the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two wars or they may prioritize their
      evaluation of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to wars which were caused by disputes over politically important areas, for example the
      Balkans in 1914. Some civil wars, such as Irish Civil War, may have been caused, in part, by
      unequal political rights, or to eliminate political opposition (for example, the Russian Civil War),
      while others, such as the Nicaraguan Civil War, were an aspect of ideological Cold War conflict.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, economic causes, racial and/or religious
      tension, aggressive leadership or territorial ambition, but with a focus on the issue raised by the
      question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


22.   “Changes to the role and status of women as a result of war were limited.” Discuss with reference
      to two wars, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that changes to the role and status of women as a result of the war were limited. The two wars
      must be from different regions. Changes may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both
      wars or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both wars will be a feature of
      the response. Candidates may refer to the static or changing roles assumed by women in the
      wartime or post-war economy. Candidates may choose a total war in which women replaced men,
      or a limited war with little significant change. Candidates may also consider movements (such as
      suffragettes) and the rights acquired in post-war periods. Candidates may propose that changes
      were neither long lasting nor uniformly experienced across social classes or geographic areas.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   Evaluate the factors which led to detente between the US and USSR between 1971 and 1979.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of factors which contributed to détente
      between the US and USSR between 1971 and 1979, weighing up their importance or otherwise.
      Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the financial benefits of reducing arms expenditure for a US
      drained by the Vietnam War and for a USSR that faced a stalled economy and weak satellite
      states. With regard to military factors, both countries were deeply aware of their nuclear
      capabilities (MAD: mutually assured destruction), and having achieved parity, were more prepared
      to discuss arms limitation. Candidates may also refer to political factors such as the US potential
      gain from the Sino–Soviet split by fostering separate relationships with both countries whilst driving
      them further apart; the Soviet wish to secure American recognition of the post-war borders of its
      satellite states; the impact of Ostpolitik which had relaxed tension in Europe and encouraged trade.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


24.   Discuss the impact of two Cold War crises on superpower rivalry.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of two
      Cold War crises on superpower rivalry. The two crises may or may not be from the same region.
      Impact may extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both crises or they may prioritize their
      discussion of one of them. However, both crises will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
      refer to the impact of a Cold War crisis in positioning superpowers in opposing camps, for instance
      the Berlin Blockade. Candidates could discuss the impact of crises like Korea (1950) or Congo
      (1960–61) that brought the struggle to new regions, and/or involved the UN in Cold War tensions. It
      would be valid for candidates to discuss the different aspects of crisis, for example Cuba (1962)
      and refer to the negative impact of brinkmanship or to the compromise reached in Turkey. Other
      crises, like Hungary (1956) and Prague Spring (1968), provided an opportunity to discuss steps
      taken by a superpower to deal with perceived challenges to their influence and international
      reactions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.
