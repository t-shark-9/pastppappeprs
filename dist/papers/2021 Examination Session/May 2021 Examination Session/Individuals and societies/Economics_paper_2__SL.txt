                                               Section A

1.   Study the following extract and answer the questions that follow.


                                             China’s trade reforms

        The Chinese government has announced a set of free trade measures, including lower
         import tariffs on cars, soybeans and pharmaceuticals, in an attempt to end a trade war with
         the United States (US).

        The US government has long accused China of engaging in unfair trade practices to
         maintain their current account surplus. The trade dispute between the two largest economies
         intensified when the US said it would impose anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese steel
         and aluminium.

        The trade war with the US comes at a bad time given the slowdown in China’s domestic
         demand. In recent years, China’s economic growth has relied less on investment and exports
         and more on consumption expenditure.

        Producers of many Chinese manufactured goods currently benefit from protectionist
         measures. In particular, imports of industrial equipment, medical devices, tractors and
         vehicles are subject to high tariffs.

        Automobile production capacity in China is growing. However, the domestic market is
         becoming oversupplied, with more cars being offered for sale than Chinese consumers want
         to buy. For this reason, Chinese car manufacturers are seeking to export their cars to other
         markets. They are therefore eager to see reduced trade tensions as increased US tariffs
         would make it harder to export Chinese cars to the US.

        Some Chinese car manufacturers are already focusing on adding advanced capabilities to
         their cars in order to be more competitive in global markets. China is increasing its efforts
         to become a world leader in self-driving cars. These will be intelligent cars that will improve
         transport efficiency and meet energy-saving and emission-reduction targets. Many believe
         that Chinese companies are so innovative that they no longer require protection from
         international enterprises.

        However, many Chinese firms remain dependent on imported factors of production.
         Approximately 30 % of Chinese exports are manufactured using imported equipment and
         components. The reduction of tariffs would therefore lower prices not only for producers but
         also for consumers of Chinese goods.

2.       Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.


                                            The fall of the Indian rupee

          Over the past year, India’s current account deficit widened as the 14 % increase in export
           revenue could not offset the rise in import expenditure. Over the same period, the value of
           the rupee (India’s currency) has fallen by 13 %.

          The rise in import expenditure was in part caused by higher oil prices following production
           cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Another reason for
           the increase in import expenditure was the higher spending on machinery and capital goods
           needed to achieve economic growth.

          Exports of services, especially software services, have helped to boost export revenue.
           However, one critical weakness in India’s exports of services is the lack of diversification.
           Exports of software services account for more than 41 % of India’s total service exports and
           more than 90 % of its software service exports are restricted to the United States and the
           European Union.

          The depreciation of the rupee, one of the steepest seen in recent years, has resulted in
           fears of high inflation. An economist at the Reserve Bank of India (India’s central bank) has
           warned that the increase in oil prices and consumers’ expectations of rising inflation could
           worsen inflationary pressures.

           Despite calls for an increase in interest rates in order to protect the rupee from further
            depreciation, the Reserve Bank of India has chosen to keep interest rates unchanged. The
            combined effect of a fall in confidence and higher interest rates would dampen economic
            growth.

                                         Angola’s economic reforms

        Following an oil price crash in 2014, Angola has endured a recession, a dramatic rise in
         inflation and empty supermarket shelves caused by severe shortages of foreign currency.
         Angola is highly dependent on export revenues from oil production, a major source of United
         States dollars. The foreign currency is needed to import manufactured goods because the
         country’s manufacturing sector is small.

        To respond to these challenges, the president of Angola has presented a plan with
         desperately needed reforms to promote economic development. The plan proposes tax
         incentives to attract foreign investment and privatization of the telecommunication and
         railway sectors. It also aims to expand infrastructure projects with private sector involvement.
         In addition, reforms are recommended to make the banking sector stronger. This is important
         if the government wants to reduce the borrowing costs experienced by Angolan businesses.

        The recent 20 % devaluation of the kwanza (Angola’s currency) is another sign that the
         government is serious about making Angola attractive to foreign direct investment (FDI).
         Angola has a fixed exchange rate. As the kwanza has been overvalued, this has caused a
         reduction in foreign currency reserves.

        Angola’s future economic growth is likely to be low. The business environment for firms
         remains difficult. High borrowing costs, corruption and poor infrastructure remain challenges.
         The government has failed to exploit Angola’s vast agricultural potential. The country
         depends heavily on oil revenues, which are falling.

        Living conditions for households are also poor as inflation is expected to remain above
         25 %. Approximately 40 % of Angolans live in absolute poverty and unemployment is
         high, especially in rural areas. Aware of the urgent need to reduce regional inequality, the
         government has announced plans to encourage investment in rural areas. However, there
         are also proposals to reduce public debt by removing some subsidies on food and by
         introducing ad valorem taxes.

        Although Angola’s economic growth has been slow, it remains the third-largest economy in
         sub-Saharan Africa and the government is the second-largest public spender in the region.

                                             Economic growth in Laos

          The construction of the China–Laos railway is a major contributor to Laos’ economic growth.
           This landlocked country is projected to grow by 7 % this year, which is a good achievement
           for a country still experiencing low incomes and over-reliance on the agricultural sector.

          The 420 kilometre railway line will connect China to Laos and link Southeast Asian countries
           all the way to Singapore. The railway will improve the communication between resource-rich
           Laos and its neighbours, all of which have larger markets. This will increase both trade and
           tourism in the region. With the help of Chinese investment, the Lao government also plans
           to increase its hydroelectric power generation capacity in the next 12 years. This could mean
           a total of 429 dams on the Mekong River by 2030. However, environmentalists say that the
           excessive construction of dams could destroy the ecosystem.

           Five years ago, the Lao government introduced a policy to privatize state-owned property,
            designed to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). The privatization policy was especially
            appealing to Chinese investors and has succeeded in increasing FDI in Laos. The Lao
            government sold a share in its telecommunication industry to a Chinese firm, which
            helped launch Laos’ first satellite. This not only improved internet connection quality for
            communication purposes but also made health services and education more accessible in
            rural areas, where 61 % of the labour force work as farmers.

          The Lao government hopes that Chinese investment will not only introduce technological
           innovations but will also bring jobs that would help many of the citizens of Laos to break out
           of the poverty trap. Six Chinese construction companies are now carrying out construction
           along the entire railway track and are employing a total of 50 000 workers, although these are
           mostly Chinese.

          Many are concerned that Laos may be heading for a debt crisis with so much investment
           financed through borrowing. The construction of the railway will cost an estimated
           US$6 billion, which will be 60 % funded by foreign investors. The governments of China
           and Laos will finance the remaining 40 %. Laos’ total commitment to the building of this
           infrastructure is US$840 million. Around US$500 million of that amount will come from loans
           from China. The remaining amount will be drawn from the government budget.
