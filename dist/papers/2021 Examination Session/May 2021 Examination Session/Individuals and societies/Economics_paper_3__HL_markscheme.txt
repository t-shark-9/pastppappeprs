Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use A02
   command terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full
   credit should be given.

1.   (a)   Assuming that 25 000 pencils are produced initially, identify the opportunity cost
           for Country H if the production of rice is to be increased by 100%.                        [1]

           15 000 pencils

           OR 750 pencils per kg of rice

           An answer of 15 000 pencils or 15 000 or 750 is sufficient for [1].

     (b)   State one reason why the production possibility curve (frontier) for Country H
           might shift outwards.                                                                      [1]

           Stating that there is an increase in the quantity and/or quality of one or more
           factors of production
           OR an improvement in technology / institutional framework / population, is
           sufficient for [1].

           It is not necessary to name a specific factor of production, but a response which
           correctly states one factor, eg an increase in the quality of labour should be
           rewarded.

     (c)   Using Table 1, calculate the cross price elasticity of demand between Good X
           and Good Y.                                                                          [2]


                    %∆
           XED =              =
                    %∆             .

           Any valid working (correct %Δ Qd(Y) or %Δ P(X), provided the formula is not
           inverted) is sufficient for [1].


           = 0.3

           An answer of 0.3 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

(d)   Define the term income inelastic demand.                                              [2]

      Level                                                                         Marks

      1       Vague definition.                                                     1

              For an idea that demand/quantity demanded does not change
              much/at all when income changes.
      2       Accurate definition.                                                  2

              The situation where a change in income leads to a less than
              proportionate/relatively smaller change in demand/quantity
              demanded (or a lower percentage change in demand/quantity
              demanded).

(e)   Explain two implications for Country D of a relatively low income elasticity of
      demand for its primary products.                                                            [4]

      Level                                                                         Marks

      0       The work does not meet a standard described by the descriptors        0
              below.
      1       The written response is limited.                                      1–2
              For one implication stated [1].
              For one implication explained OR two implications stated [2].
      2       The written response is accurate.                                     3–4
              For one implication explained AND one implication stated [3].
              For two implications explained [4].

      Implications may include:
       countries that specialize in primary products may need to diversify in order to
        achieve economic growth
       (relative) income for those working in the primary sector might decrease,
        leading to greater inequality
       as economic growth occurs, demand for primary products will increase more
        slowly than the demand for secondary/tertiary products, causing the prices of
        primary products to increase more slowly than the prices of secondary/tertiary
        products
       as economic growth occurs, there will be differences in the rate of expansion
        of primary industries in relation to secondary/tertiary industries/employment
       because the prices of primary products fall relative to manufactures, the terms
        of trade for countries specializing in the export of primary products may
        deteriorate. This may threaten the process of economic development
       as Country D specializes in the export of (income inelastic) goods, it will not
        benefit from global economic growth (the income gap will widen), or the
        converse could be true. This implication may be phrased as export revenue
        being relatively stable despite changes in the global economy
       any other reasonable response.

      NB Reference to the effects of negative economic growth should be rewarded.

(f)   Using a diagram to support your answer, explain the impact on the market for
      Good B of an increase in the price of Good A.                                             [4]

                                  The market for Good B

      1       The written response is limited.                                   1–2

              For a diagram showing an increase in supply (shift to the right)
              and a decrease in price/increase in quantity OR an explanation
              that if the price of Good A increases, the quantity of Good A
              supplied will increase, and as a consequence the supply of
              Good B will increase, causing a fall in price and an increase in
              quantity of B.
      2       The written response is accurate.                                  3–4

              For a diagram showing an increase in supply (shift to the right)
              and a decrease in price/increase in quantity AND an explanation
              that if the price of Good A increases, the quantity of Good A
              supplied will increase, and as a consequence the supply of
              Good B will increase, causing a fall in price and an increase in
              quantity of B.

      An alternative diagram would be with P of Good A on vertical axis and Q of Good B on
      horizontal axis and an upward sloping curve. The explanation should be consistent with this
      diagram. For full marks the response should refer to the quantity of Good B increasing and
      its price decreasing.
      NB If the explanation is vague, [1] may be awarded for an appropriate example
      (such as any product and its by-product).
                                                 –6–                  M21/3/ECONO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



      A candidate who has provided a correct diagram but refers to quantity supplied
      (rather than supply) of good B should not be penalized.

(g)   Calculate the shortage resulting from the imposition of the maximum price.               [1]

      The maximum price = $5         0.6 = $3.

      At $3, Qd = 300 000, Qs = 100 000, so the shortage = 200 000 kg

      An answer of 200 or 200 000 is sufficient for [1].

(h)   Calculate the change in producer surplus resulting from the imposition of the
      maximum price.                                                                           [2]

      Initial PS = 0.5   4    200 000 = $400 000

      New PS = 0.5       2   100 000 = $100 000

      Any valid working (initial or final PS) is sufficient for [1]

      Change in PS = $100 000 – $400 000

      = –$300 000 (ie a decrease)

      OR    Decrease in PS = 0.5        2 (200 000 + 100 000) = $300 000

      An answer of 300 or 300 000 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and
      include correct units.

      NB OFR applies where a candidate has identified the maximum price incorrectly
      in part (g).

(i)   Calculate the change in consumer expenditure on rice resulting from the
      imposition of the maximum price.                                                         [2]

      Initial consumer spending = 5       200 000 = $1 000 000

      New consumer spending = 3          100 000 = $300 000

      Any valid working (initial or final consumer expenditure) is sufficient for [1].

      = –$700 000 (ie a decrease)

      An answer of 700 or 700 000 without any valid working is sufficient for [1].

      For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and
      include correct units.

      NB OFR applies where a candidate has identified the maximum price incorrectly
      in part (g). Examiners should not penalize twice for the absence of a negative
      sign (ie in both parts h and i).

(j)   State two methods of non-price rationing.                                             [2]

      Award [1] for each appropriate method, up to a maximum of [2].

      Methods may include:
       first-come, first-served (queueing)
       allocation according to sellers’ preferences
       rationing systems using coupons/vouchers or applying a quota per
        customer/household eg distribution according to income level/size of
        household would be acceptable
       random allocation by ballot
       any other reasonable response.

(k)   With reference to Figure 2, outline why the imposition of a maximum price might
      lead to the creation of a parallel market.                                            [2]

              For the idea that some consumers are able/willing to pay a higher
              price than the ceiling OR that farmers may be unwilling to sell at
              such a low price
      2       Accurate outline                                                      2
              For an understanding that if some consumers are able/willing to
              pay more than the controlled price of $3 OR that farmers may be
              unwilling to sell at such a low price,
              AND
              EITHER some producers are willing to sell (illegally) for more than
              the controlled price, a parallel market will result OR some
              consumers set up a resale market at higher prices as sellers.

              NB For L2, reference must be made to both buyers and sellers
              and to a valid figure ($3 or 200 000 kg) from the diagram.

(l)   Explain one reason, apart from the possible creation of a parallel market, why the
      imposition of a maximum price for rice in Islandia might not enable low-income
      households to buy enough rice to meet their needs.                                       [2]

              For an explanation that
              EITHER even though rice may now be more affordable, shortages
              result in low income families finding it more difficult to access rice
              (meaning that low-income households may find it more difficult to
              access (than high-income households))
              OR maximum price discourages producers from supplying to the
              (domestic) market, which makes it less accessible to low-income
              households.

              NB An alternative valid response may be fully rewarded.

2.   (a)   Calculate Averna’s nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019.                        [2]

           GDP = 2350 + 1380 + 1624 + (462 – 476)

           Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

           = $5340 million or $5.34 billion                                                        [1]

           An answer of $5340 million, $5.34 billion (or 5340 or 5.34) without any valid
           working is sufficient for [1].

           If a candidate makes a small error in transcribing the figures eg 1642 instead of
           1624, then they can still receive [1] for valid working.

           Calculating GDP at factor cost (plus subsidies less indirect taxes) may be fully
           rewarded:

           GDP at factor cost = 2350 + 1380 + 1624 + (462 – 476) + 681 – 759

           = $5262 million or $5.26 billion

(ii)    Using your answer to part (a), calculate Averna’s real GDP per capita in
        2019.                                                                             [2]

        Real GDP = 5340      100/125 = $4272 million

        Real GDP per capita = 4 272 000 000/213 600

        Any valid working is sufficient for [1] eg using nominal GDP instead of real
        GDP (5340/213 600 = $25 000) or neglecting to convert to per capita figure
        (=$4272m).
        Neglecting to multiply by 100 in calculating real GDP may be considered a
        units error.

        = $20 000

        An answer of $20 000 or 20 000 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

        For full marks to be awarded the response must provide valid working and
        include correct units.

        OFR applies from part (a). Per capita figures may be rounded to the
        nearest dollar.

(iii)   Explain two reasons why an increase in real GDP per capita may not lead

          For one reason explained AND one reason stated [3].
          For two reasons explained [4].

        Reasons may include:
         The distribution of income may become uneven, so that the benefits of
          increasing real GDP may not be enjoyed by some.
         Due to structural changes, employment opportunities decrease for some
          groups, who will not benefit from higher real GDP.
         More accurate recording of self-provided goods may account for the
          increase in real GDP without a corresponding increase in output/income.
         An increase in real GDP may lead to negative environmental effects,
          such as poor air quality, meaning that living standards do not improve.
         The composition of output may have changed. An increase in real GDP
          that results from an increase in military spending (or without an increase
          in spending on health and education) may not improve living standards.
         GNP could be lower than GDP due to profit repatriation by MNCs or to
          income remittances overseas by immigrant workers.
         An increase in real GDP might be accompanied by reduced leisure
          time/freedom.
         Any other reasonable response.

(g)   (i)     Calculate the firm’s total variable costs if output is 20 000 widgets per
              month.                                                                         [1]

              20 000     18 = $360 000

              An answer of $360 000 or 360 000 or 360 (without working) is sufficient for
              [1].

      (ii)    Identify the level of output at which the firm would achieve productive
              efficiency.                                                                    [1]

              85 000 or 85 (allow 84 000 or 86 000)

      (iii)   Calculate the firm’s monthly total fixed costs if output equals 50 000 units
              per month.                                                                     [2]

              At 50 000 units, AFC = 15.6 – 12 = 3.6

              Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

              FC = 3.6    50 000 = $180 000

              An answer of $180 000 or 180 000 (without working) is sufficient for [1].

(h)   (i)     State two conditions necessary for price discrimination to take place.              [2]

              Award [1] for each valid condition stated.

              Conditions may include:
               the firm must possess some degree of market power
               there must be groups of consumers with differing price elasticities of
                demand for the product
               the firm must be able to prevent resale of the product from one market
                segment to others / separate the groups.

              NB A statement that markets are differentiated/divided is not sufficient for [1].

      (ii)    Using a diagram (or diagrams), explain why a profit maximizing firm might
              charge a higher price in one market than in another.                                [4]

                For a diagram(s) showing two distinct market segments, with
                different price elasticities of demand, and profits maximized (MC

                as price elasticities of demand are different, profit can be
                maximized by setting different prices with a lower price in the
                market with more elastic demand and/or a higher price in the
                market with more inelastic demand.
