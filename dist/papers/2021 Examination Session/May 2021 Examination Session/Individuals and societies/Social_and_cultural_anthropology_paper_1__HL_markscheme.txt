The following interpretation of the markscheme is offered as an example of the types of responses we
may expect, however it is not prescriptive or exhaustive, and other possible answers should be
appropriately rewarded if relevant.

Section A

1.     Define the term structure and describe how it can be understood and applied in the
       context of the passage.                                                                               [4]

       This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and
       understanding of the term “structure” and apply it in relation to the text.

       Candidates may write in terms of any of the following outlined guidance, but other
       definitions or applications will also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the
       passage.

                                                An example of application:
                                                Some candidates may refer to the miners as having a

      The response demonstrates    More sophisticated or complex definitions of the concept
      sound knowledge and          are expected at this level.
      understanding of the         Examples of application may include:
      concept; the concept is
      described in detail.         There are several examples from the text that can be
                                   used to show how the concept of structure can be applied
      The concept is clearly       in this context. For example:

                                   • The hierarchy and division of labour;
                                   • That the social organization is imposed on the workers

                                   By detailed explanation we expect that some candidates
                                   may show understanding of how this term is used by:
                                   • Discussing how structure manifests itself
                                     simultaneously in multiple layers or modes;

                                   • Relating to how the concept has changed with the
                                     development of the discipline.

2.     Analyse the ethnographic data presented in the passage using the concept of
       materiality.                                                                                        [6]

       This question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this
       ethnographic text using the key concept of materiality to help make sense of the
       ethnographic data. In order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an
       understanding of the key concept and use it to illuminate certain issues within the
       context of the passage, supporting their analyses by making reference to the
       ethnographic data of the extract.

       Candidates may write in terms of any of the following outlined guidance, but other
       definitions or applications will also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the
       passage.

Application at this level may include mention of:
• The consequential complex set of social relations
  that have emerged to secure access and
  availability of the mineral in the hands of
  consumers, and whom are mostly unaware of
  such interconnection;
• By focusing on materiality instead of only the
  social relations themselves, the ethnographer is
  able to keep attention on the degree of physical
  suffering, unhealthy and physically dangerous
  conditions that workers are subjected to;
• That consumers in other parts of the world can
  lead physically more comfortable and indulgent
  lives, unaware of how their taste for digital
  products is a direct cause of physical pain and
  suffering for populations in other parts of the
  world;
• It is also possible that responses at this level may
  discuss the symbolic dimensions of materiality
  referred to in the text.


Other possible examples should be rewarded.

3.     Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of symbolism or power is
       evident in this passage with how it is evident in one ethnographic example you have
       studied. Make reference to theory in your answer.                                                [10]
       This passage focuses on social, economic and political inequalities in relation to
       capitalist labour practices. By approaching the analysis of global capitalism through the
       social flow of a certain mineral in the global commodity chain, the anthropologist will
       explore how miners in Eastern Congo finds ways of expressing and making sense of
       these exploitative conditions and understand their own living conditions. Candidates
       are expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and
       to draw explicit comparisons. Either of the key concepts chosen on which such
       comparison may be drawn should be made explicit and clearly linked to any
       anthropological issues raised by the text. Candidates must situate the comparative
       case in terms of place, author and historical context. The discussion should be
       supported with reference to concepts.
       The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates are
       expected to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and draw
       explicit comparisons. In order to do this, responses must demonstrate an
       understanding of how either the key concept of symbolism or power relates to this
       ethnographic context. They should be able to establish a relevant comparison with any
       other group or society based on any of these concepts. The response should be
       structured as a comparison, highlighting similarities and differences.
       Candidates may write in terms of any of the following outline guidance, but other
       definitions or applications will also be acceptable if made relevant to the context of the
       passage.

                                              in view of the use of certain terminology (e.g., capitalism,

     While in the previous question the stress of the comparison needs to be drawn on the
     key concepts which would help to frame the responses; here candidates are expected
     to show an ability to think about the text with emphasis on the methodological and
     theoretical perspectives of the anthropologists as the main principle on which such
     comparisons should be established.

      By "approaches to research" the question essentially refers to the research methods
      used by the anthropologist to gather data. However, as theory is required for level 5–6
      and above, it is expected that candidates will also discuss theory with reference to
      approaches.

                                        theoretical orientation of the ethnographer. For instance,
                                        in view of the use of certain terminology (e.g., capitalism,
                                        commodity) or also by the manifest interest in labor
                                        conditions and how these relate to globalization. Thus,
                                        candidates may cite globalization theories, post-colonial,
                                        neo-Marxist, political economy, world systems,
                                        dependency theory. Some candidates may cite Actor-

5.     Why does anthropology matter? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
       ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                                  [10]
       This question requires candidates to develop an argument which is built on an
       understanding of the following “big anthropological question”: Why does anthropology
       matter? This argumentative response includes discussion and analysis that should be
       supported by relevant, detailed ethnographic material that gives evidence of the
       understanding of this big question in different cultural contexts. This “big”
       anthropological question should be the very backbone of the response and be informed
       by the ethnographic material studied. The aim of this question is to facilitate students to
       think with and through ethnographic material; to explore these materials analytically,
       aided by the focus on a “big” anthropological question. A broad variety of ethnographic
       data can be put forward in order to create meaningful responses.
       In the development of their response, candidates may make reference to a number of
       various ideas or propositions connected to the relevance of anthropology. For this
       reason, below are some ideas that may appear in candidates' responses. However,
       any other relevant lines of thought should be rewarded.
       The unseen passage, which is the focus of questions 1–4, shows that anthropology
       can uncover social processes that negatively affect the lives of people, exposing them
       to danger, armed conflict and unhealthy working and living conditions, of which
       audiences in other parts of the world may be entirely unaware. Anthropology not only
       exposes these hidden injustices, but also reveals the various political and economic
       mechanisms that hide and mask such injustices, allowing people in other parts of the
       world to carry on with their lives unaware of how their lifestyle is causing pain and
       suffering for other people.
       This particular passage shows how audiences who live in certain countries or belong to
       certain social classes enjoy freedoms and comforts that are made possible only on the
       basis of other people's suffering, and that their local discourses which emphasize
       values such as liberties or meritocracy are only possible through the subjection and
       servitude of other people. The passage also shows us how some of the strategies used
       by people in situations of subjection and exploitation to deal with their suffering only
       increases their subjection (for instance, by engaging in unhealthy behaviours as a
       coping mechanism) and increases the illusion that they also can take part of the
       privileged lifestyle they are sustaining (for instance, by emulating the names and
       practices of people in privileged positions).

Section B

6.   With reference to either stimulus A or stimulus B, and your own knowledge, discuss
     the defining features of anthropological ethics.                                              [10]

     Candidates can either offer sustained discussion on one issue or shorter, less
     developed discussions on several issues as long as they are supported by examples
     from the text and other examples.

     This question requires candidates to develop a response in which they demonstrate an
     understanding of the anthropological ethical issues raised by the stimulus material, and
     an ability to engage in a critical discussion applying the student’s own knowledge of the
     defining features of anthropological ethics.

     If stimulus A is used:

     This extract is based on an academic paper in which an anthropologist comments on
     ethical issues regarding fieldwork. More specifically, it relates to a researcher revealing
     or not their identity while doing participant observation. The stimulus allows for a wide
     range of responses.

     Candidates are expected to demonstrate –with reference to the passage– their
     knowledge about participant observation as the main method in anthropological
     fieldwork and the ethical principles governing the conduct of fieldworkers as
     professional practitioners. These principles dictate that the ethnographer respects the
     dignity of the members of the group being studied.

     Candidates may develop a discussion based on the ethical issues related to the
     methodological decision of conducting covert or overt research roles. It is likely that
     candidates will discuss anthropological ethics in relation to the nature of interaction
     between fieldworkers and research participants, and in particular, issues related with
     being open and honest regarding anthropological work, informed by notions such as
     informed consent, right to privacy, confidentiality, anonymity, credits/references and
     necessary permissions. Another issue is how the reciprocal benefit of the studied group
     is being considered and what types of compensation the members are being offered for
     participation in the research, since in a covert study it may be difficult to determine
     compensation.

     Candidates may offer an analysis from any relevant principle of anthropological codes
     of ethics (they may be informed by diverse professional national associations) as a
     point of departure. This discussion can be informed by several points, such as the right
     of individuals to be given the possibility to accept or refuse to take part in a research
     study, the lack of trust and associated feelings in the interaction of both parties,
     attitudes and actions of deception or dishonesty, the consequences in the long-term
     personal engagement between the ethnographer and the group, the moral dilemmas
     associated to the tensions between the responsibility of the anthropologist to the
     subjects of study, to the discipline and the broader public good, questions related to
     who owns the data collected, as well as the regulatory bodies governing research or
     the ethical principles of the community studied.

     Candidates may relate the methodological problems and advantages and
     disadvantages of disclosure of researcher’s identity with the ethical issues. For
     example, the practical ways in which fieldwork is conducted and anthropological data
     gathered, the insider or outsider status, the Hawthorne effect, the difficulties associated
     with full immersion. However, these should only be supporting arguments and not the
     main focus of the discussion which should be on the ethical issues.
                                               – 18 –               M21/3/SOCAN/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Candidates may put forward different views and perspectives, examining how
anthropologists must weigh competing ethical obligations to diverse actors, while
recognizing that obligations to research participants are usually primary. Some
responses may focus on asymmetries of power implicit in a range of relationships, or
on the differing ethical frameworks involved; or if ethical guidelines should be inflexible
or analysed case by case, within different groups and contexts.

Some responses may offer as elements for discussion other relevant cases in the
history of the discipline (for example, anthropologists who conducted fieldwork and did
not disclose their identity and their reasons, eg Linhart 1978, Humphreys 1970.
Candidates may contextualize their responses by showing awareness of how the ethics
of the discipline has always been discussed and debated in anthropology, from the
opposition to the use of anthropologists as spies by Boas in the early 20th century to
the more recent calls for a militant and engaged anthropology and their relation to this
topic.

If stimulus B is used:

In this case, it is likely that candidates will discuss anthropological ethics in relation to
the nature of the interaction between fieldworkers and research participants. In
particular, we expect candidates to relate the stimulus to the ethical issues that may
arise while conducting interviews as a research method.

Candidates may offer an analysis from any relevant principle of anthropological codes
of ethics (they may be informed by diverse professional national associations) as a
point of departure. This discussion can be informed by several points, such as the right
of individuals to be given the possibility to accept or refuse to take part in a research
study, the lack of trust and associated feelings in the interaction of both parties, power
asymmetries in relation to the interview, the consequences in the long-term personal
engagement between the ethnographer and the group, the moral dilemmas associated
to the tensions between the responsibility of the anthropologist to the subjects of study,
to the discipline and the broader public good, questions related to who owns the data
collected, as well as the regulatory bodies governing research or the ethical principles
of the community studied.

Candidates can also support their discussions based on ethical guidelines and
principles such as informed consent, confidentiality, anonymity, credits/references and
necessary permissions. Some responses may discuss issues related with being open
and honest regarding the nature and purpose of the anthropological work, or how the
data will be used, stored and how the data will be made accessible to those who have
taken part in the research. Other issues that may arise include protection, data
ownership and access of records. Candidates may also discuss issues of
representation, positionality and reflexivity, epistemic violence and issues regarding de-
colonization of knowledge, as well as questions of selectivity of data.

Another ethical issue is the presence of onlookers or third parties –as observed in the
photograph– and how the anthropologist may adjust practices in order to accommodate
for local cultural sensibilities about how strangers should interact and what degree of
intimacy and privacy that they are allowed. This may include issues such as gender,
age or other status differences between the researcher and participant.
