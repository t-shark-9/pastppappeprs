                                         Section A
1.   (a)   Outline two benefits for MM of outsourcing human resource management (HRM)
           (lines 51–54).                                                                            [4]

           Possible benefits include:

              •   MM staff are not specialists of HRM: they know a lot about marketing, design and
                  communications, but not about HRM. Outsourcing HRM means that they can focus
                  on their core business, and let specialists from an HR agency deal with all HR tasks
                  (recruitment, contracts etc)
              •   As MM becomes more international, HRM is getting more complex and requires a lot
                  of advanced HR knowledge, as labor laws vary from country to country, for example
                  between UK and India (about working conditions, workers’ rights etc).
              •   Outsourcing HRM will help MM deal with difficult situations, which could prove costly
                  (and even give a bad image of MM to external stakeholders), for example if they are
                  taken to court by dissatisfied employees, such as the ones who feel bullied by Claire.
              •   When they have HR questions, for example about payment schemes or holidays, MM
                  employees will benefit from working with HR specialists: this will aid communication,
                  which is better for the business.
              •   Reduction in costs. HRM managers no longer required.
              •   May lead to a consistency of HR operations across the whole of MM

           Accept any other relevant benefits.

           Mark as a 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each relevant benefit identified and an additional [1] for further
           outline in context. Award a maximum of [2] for each benefit.

     (b)   Explain how MM has differentiated itself.                                                 [6]

           This question assesses candidates’ knowledge and understanding of
           differentiation, both in general (what it means, how it may be achieved) and in the
           specific case of MM.

           Companies differentiate themselves from their competitors in many ways, such
           as:

              •   through their products (USP of their goods and services), or the
                  range/portfolio of products they may offer their customers;
              •   through their pricing strategies (e.g. price leadership or premium pricing);
              •   through the relationships they build with their customers (customer
                  service);
              •   through their reputation and image (branding);
              •   through other marketing aspects, such as the packaging they use, or the
                  type of promotion and advertising they do;
              •   through their ethical objectives (CSR) and particular values they may
                  defend;
              •   through their workforce (e.g. talented creative workers, cultural diversity);
              •   through their operations (e.g. what they do, where, how);
              •   through their innovative practices (e.g. R&D leading to particular product
                  features or performance);
              •   through their strategies (e.g. franchising, international growth etc).
                                      –6–                 M21/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The case study explicitly mentions about customer service, as MM “aims to
respond to customers more quickly than others in the industry” (line 65). Other
methods of differentiation are implied, for example MM has strong ethical
objectives (e.g. only accepting customers with strong equal opportunities policies)
and highly values cultural diversity (e.g. having multicultural content in the
marketing strategies it creates). Their competitors may share those same ethical
objectives and value cultural diversity too. The case study does not provide much
information about MM competitors, yet this is not a problem to answer this
question:


Accept any other relevant explanation.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer about differentiation.

Award a maximum of [4] for a descriptive answer.

2.   (a)   With reference to MM, outline two sources of finance suitable for taking over the
           film studio in India (lines 144–147).                                                      [4]

           The following four sources of finance are suitable:
              • loan capital (i.e. long term bank loan, mortgage)
              • share capital (either through new shareholders, or by changing MM legal
                   status to public limited company i.e. going public)
              • venture capitalists / business angels
              • grant / subsidies from the Indian government (to support FDI); this answer
                   is unlikely but acceptable

           Sale of assets is a suitable method but there is no context to suggest that this is
           an option for MM. Award one mark for sale of assets but not the second for
           context.

           Other sources are not suitable (e.g. retained profit, leasing, crowdfunding,
           overdrafts, trade credits, etc) and must not be credited.

           Mark as a 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each appropriate source and a further [1] for an outline of the
           source in context.

     (b)   Explain how a formal system of appraisal may have avoided the problems
           caused by Clare (lines 86–100).                                                            [6]

           Candidates are expected to show some understanding of one or more of the
           approaches to appraisal, including:
              • Formative
              • Summative
              • 360-degree
              • Self-appraisal

           They apply both to Clare as an appraiser (Claire appraising her staff) and Clare
           as an appraisee (Clare being appraised by her own line manager). The problems
           caused by Clare should have been identified earlier on, before they escalated
           into such a conflict where employees have asked for Clare to be dismissed for
           harassment (line 99).

           Clare seemingly resented the fact that staff in her department went to her own
           line manager to complain about her behind her back, without telling her directly. A
           system of formative appraisal may have made her aware of the problems earlier
           on, if she had regularly and formally asked her staff about their work and their
           progress. Of course, they may have been reluctant to tell her the truth, which is
           why a 360-degree appraisal, with anonymous feedback from her staff about her
           own performance, could have made her aware of the extent of their
           dissatisfaction and their feelings of being bullied.
           Similarly, a summative appraisal of Clare (by her own line manager) could have
           identified not only Clare’s positive results (“Customer satisfaction is very high,
           and some of the marketing strategies designed by Clare’s team have won
           awards”, line 90), but also areas of improvement, for example about how, as a
           leader, she reflects MM core values.
           This said, it is not certain that formal systems of appraisal would have avoided all the
           problems: the way Clare reacted when she heard about her staff feelings (“she was rude to
           them, blocked their pay rises and threatened them with less interesting work” line 98) implies
                                      –8–                 M21/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


that her autocratic style is not aligned with MM cultural values. MM “considers it important
that the organizations with which it works value freedom of expression” (line 60) – clearly
Clare herself does not believe that this applies to her staff.

Accept any other explanation.

3.   (a)   Outline two reasons why MM may relocate all of its operations to Bengaluru
           (lines 124–142).                                                                       [4]

           Reasons could include:
           • Fast growth of MM in India / success of the Indian office /will count for 60 % of
             business by 2025
           • Excellent IT facilities in Bengaluru
           • Improving infrastructure in Bengaluru
           • Lower rents in Bengaluru
           • Highly trained potential workforce in Bengaluru
           • Bengaluru’s existing film industry
           • Push factor: continued (Brexit-related) uncertainties in UK (alluded to in the
             case)

           The question is about relocation to Bengalaru specifically and not India, generally.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Accept any other relevant reason.

           Award [1] for each reason identified, up to [2], and award [1] additional mark for
           appropriate application.

     (b)   Explain how the proposed contract with Country X may conflict with MM ’s ethical
           objectives (lines 114–123).                                                            [6]

           MM’s ethics include choice of customer. MM takes a firm line on:
           • Equal opportunities
           • Carbon footprint
           • Freedom of expression
           • Exploitation of employees
           • Cultural diversity

           The proposed contract conflicts with MM ethics because Country X has been
           accused of:
           • human rights abuses (against equal opportunities, cultural diversity)
           • arresting journalists for criticizing the government (freedom of expression)
           • persecuting people for religious opinions (diversity)
           • doing little to reduce poverty (equal opportunities)
           • doing little to improve environmental record (carbon footprint)

      The proposed contract could negatively affect the reputation of MM. MM has worked
      hard to develop its profile and credibility as an ethical company, but this image could
      be damaged. This could have negative implications for future contracts, as some
      current clients may not want to be associated with MM any longer. This may be the
      case of some NGOs that specifically campaign for human rights or carbon footprint –
      and whose own CSR policies may stop them from working with an agency that does
      not consistently share the same values. Besides, country X has “arrested journalists
      for criticizing the government” (line 121) – with the contract, MM could give the
      impression that it condones such practices, and some journalists could create a
      negative campaign against MM, suggesting that its ethical claims are only a smoke
      screen meant to get them more contracts and more profit.


           Accept any other relevant explanation.

4.   (a)     Define the term social marketing.                                                         [2]

     Social marketing is the use of commercial marketing tools and techniques (such as
     market research; defining objectives and targets; creating and promoting brands;
     preparing strategies and plans; setting actions and budgets etc) in order to influence
     individuals’ behaviour, to improve their well-being and/or that of society as a whole.
     Unlike commercial marketing, the aim is not to encourage purchase, but to raise
     awareness and lead to change.

      Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding.

      Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to the answer
      above (students are not expected to word their definition exactly as above).

                    This can also be expressed as “1.2 : 1”.

           Award [2] for correct answer, showing the working Award [1] for or a correct answer
           with units or a percentage sign, or an incomplete answer (such as 6/5) or if the
           candidate calculated the current ratio for 2019 (answer: 1.33)

           Do not reward formula only.

             (ii)   suggest one reason why SF may have a liquidity problem.                            [2]


      Liquidity is a measure of how quickly current assets (stock, debtors, cash) can be converted into
      cash (cash being already liquid anyway). A liquidity problem means that the company may
      struggle to pay off its short-term debt obligations.

      In the case of SF, possible reasons include:
         • Current assets are decreasing faster than current liabilities, reducing the current
            ratio from 1,33 (in 2019) to 1,2 (in 2020), which is further away from the ideal of
            1.5
         • Direct cash has decreased more than the ‘less liquid’ current assets (stock and
            debtors) – in fact, the value of stock has doubled from 2019 to 2020. A film
            studio should not keep so much stock anyway.
         • The acid test ratio has decreased from 1,26 (in 2019) to 1,04 (in 2020); an acid
            test ratio of less than 1:1 could mean that the business is not in sound financial
            health; it may unable to pay its short-term debts.

      Accept any other reasonable reason.
        Use OFR.
        Credit candidates who calculated the acid test ratio.

      Award [1] for a basic answer that conveys some understanding of a reason why SF may have
      a liquidity problem. The answer may be short or descriptive, showing some partial knowledge
      of what current assets/liabilities/ratio are, and/or what liquidity means.

      Award [2] for an answer that conveys knowledge and understanding of a valid reason why SF
      may have a liquidity problem. The answer shows both theoretical understanding and
      application to SF.



(c)     Explain two factors that may influence the motivation of employees at SF.              [4]

        Factors could include:
        • Time pressures – does not allow SF employees to work at a comfortable
          speed, which may create stress and does not enable them to be creative,
          which is paradoxical as they work in the creative industries;
        • No overtime: no reward for extra work, in a context of low pay scales (only
          managers are financially rewarded with bonuses: absence of financial rewards
          for SF employees)
        • Autocratic leadership style – may not suit some employees, especially in the
          creative industries.

        The answer must be explicitly about SF, not about MM, even if some aspects
        could be relevant for both.

        Accept any other relevant factor.

        Mark as a 2 + 2.

        Award [1] for an appropriate factor in context and for an explanation, which may
        include a theoretical reference (for example: to Pink or Herzberg) Award a
        maximum of [2] for each factor. Maximum award overall: [4].

(d)     Recommend whether MM should take over SF.                                             [10]

        Arguments for:
        • Will reduce production costs (Aarvan), which may make MM more competitive
        • The owner wants to sell, so price might be good
        • SF has a good reputation
        • Comfortable with social marketing, which may match MM’s ethics
        • Used to meeting customer demands and deadlines
        • Fits well with MM strategy to focus on its growth in India/Asia

        Arguments against:
        • Several cultural differences between MM and SF, for example SF managers
           receive financial rewards such as bonuses, and SF has an autocratic
           management style
        • Not enough experience with short films
        • Limited experience of promotional films
        • Has always worked for Indian customers: may lack international awareness
        • How may SF employees react to the take-over?

Accept any other relevant discussion.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

For an answer with no effective use of context (theoretical answer) award a
maximum of [3].

For an answer that only looks at one side, award a maximum of [5].


Both sides of argument considered but descriptively, award a maximum of [6].
Both sides considered, good use of evidence, particularly from section B, but
no effective conclusion/evaluation award a maximum of [8].
