     Overview

     There is a growing trend to use technology that authenticates individuals based on their bodily
     or behavioural characteristics, such as fingerprints, voice, iris or gait. A survey by Market Wired
     predicted that the global biometric technologies market will reach $41.5 billion by 2020,
 5   significantly greater than the $14.9 billion in 2015.

     FaceToFace, a small start-up business, was founded in South-East Asia in 2017 by Mike Lim,
     a computer science graduate, and two of his friends from university: Carol Tan, a marketing
     graduate, and Sandra Li, a law graduate. Mike developed the initial facial recognition
     algorithms while at university but had no idea how to market them. Carol saw great potential
10   for facial recognition software in a variety of areas, but she was not sure about the associated
     legal and ethical implications. While waiting for coffee one afternoon in their university coffee
     shop, the three decided that the coffee shop would be the ideal location as a starting point for
     their venture.

     Current situation

15   In an effort to improve customer loyalty, the university coffee shop currently has a loyalty card
     programme that stores customers’ personal details and coffee preferences. The loyalty card
     data is stored in the coffee shop’s customer database stored in the cloud.

     Members are issued with a loyalty card that they can present when they make a purchase, so
     they can collect points that are redeemable for free coffee and seasonal promotions. Customers
20   can choose whether to opt in to this loyalty card programme.

     The FaceToFace facial recognition application was introduced into the university coffee shop
     as a proof of concept in an attempt to solve the problems related to long queues at busy times
     of the day and the lack of personal service caused by a high turnover of coffee shop staff. The
     coffee shop was chosen to prove the concept rather than a school or office.

25   With the facial recognition application installed, the first time a customer approaches the till to
     make a purchase, they will be asked whether they wish to have their facial image linked to their
     loyalty card data.

     The customer must be a member of the loyalty card programme if they wish their facial image to
     be linked to the customer database.

30   If the customer does not want their facial image to be used or linked to the loyalty card
     programme, they can choose to opt out.

     On subsequent visits, when customers who have linked their facial image to the loyalty card
     programme approach the cashier to make an order, the facial recognition application will
     capture an image of their face and match it to a record in the database. This will provide the
35   cashier with details about the customer. The FaceToFace facial recognition application will
     identify the customer to the coffee shop staff who can then greet them by their name and offer
     them their preferred choice of coffee.




                                                                                              Turn over
                                                –4–

        Figure 1: An example of the prompt displayed to the cashier for a customer
                     whose record exists in the coffee shop database




     If a customer has opted out of the loyalty card programme, the coffee shop staff will not be
     provided with personalized information about the customer or their coffee preferences.

40   Currently, the FaceToFace facial recognition application is software as a service (SaaS) and
     uses cloud-based processing and storage for the facial recognition data. This data is then linked
     to the customer database in the coffee shop’s point-of-sale (POS) system to provide prompts to
     the staff using the facial recognition application. FaceToFace is leasing processing and storage
     facilities from a reputable cloud service provider for the facial recognition application.

45   The proof of concept was a huge success, with the coffee shop having shorter queueing times
     and an increase in the satisfaction of both coffee shop staff and customers.

     Next steps

     South-East Asia Coffee Shops (SEACS), a local chain of coffee shops, observed the successful
     partnership between FaceToFace and the university coffee shop. They have approached Carol
50   for a meeting about the use of the facial recognition application in their shops.

     Mike has informed Carol and Sandra that this development will require an upgrade to
     the existing IT cloud-based infrastructure. This infrastructure will need to be scalable to
     accommodate not only SEACS’s project but also future clients.

     Sandra has advised that, since the data is being shared between the coffee shops, which
55   are located in a number of countries in South East Asia, there will also be legal and ethical
     implications to be considered. She is also keen that any policies developed would enable a
     roll‑out of the facial recognition application to a wider market.

      Challenges faced

      Carol believes that the market for facial recognition systems has great potential and she is keen
 60   for FaceToFace to consider expanding into new markets, such as schools and offices.

      Mike, Carol and Sandra are aware that the expansion of the facial recognition application into
      these new markets will present a number of challenges. They held a meeting and drew up a list
      of possible challenges that may result from such an expansion.

      Technical challenges
 65   y Different clients may have different thresholds for accuracy (error rate) in the identification of
        the user. These different levels of accuracy will require the adaptation of the algorithms and
        may require different numbers of nodal points to be matched.
      y The FacetoFace application must allow for interoperability and be forward compatible with
        future clients’ databases.

 70   Legal challenges
      y The storage and use of data is governed by national laws. For example, the General Data
        Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) is far more stringent than other
        national privacy laws. Sandra is conscious that these laws will need to be discussed with
        FaceToFace’s clients and that policies will need to be developed to ensure compliance and
 75     proper procedures are implemented.
      y Sandra is concerned about accountability if a data breach occurs.

      Ethical challenges
      While Mike was developing the new facial recognition application and integrating it into SEACS,
      the team realized there were a number of ethical issues that needed to be addressed.
 80   y Sandra wants to ensure any future expansion is underpinned by sound ethical principles.
         She suggests that an impact analysis should be cooperatively undertaken by FaceToFace
         and clients using a range of decision-making tools, such as a privacy impact assessment
         (PIA) and ethics canvases.
      y There should be a code of ethics to which SEACS and any other potential stakeholders
 85      should subscribe when any collaboration takes place. This may need to be adapted for
         various clients.
      y Privacy, anonymity, surveillance and the need for consent are significant concerns that may
         arise with new developments such as the facial recognition application.
      y Cloud storage of facial images and continual gathering of information, such as date and time
 90      of purchases made by SEACS customers, are a concern for Sandra.
      y Accessibility of data by third parties. Once FaceToFace has created applications that can
         be linked to databases, others – such as governments and other companies – may wish to
         access this information. This could directly contradict the expressed desire of FaceToFace for
         complete transparency in how their data is managed.

 95   Social challenges
      Any introduction of a new ICT system can have impacts on the behaviour of individuals,
      organizations and societies.
      y Sandra is concerned that the introduction of facial recognition systems could lead to changes
         in the way people behave when they are aware they are being watched.
100   y If people accept facial recognition as a part of their everyday lives, it could become easier for
         less ethical future applications to be accepted without thorough investigation.
      y Some people may feel that the introduction of facial recognition applications could lead to an
         increasing level of surveillance.

      Marketing challenges
105   Carol is interested in expanding into other markets. These are:
      y airports
      y offices
      y schools
      y shops.

110   Expansion into these markets may provide a number of opportunities as well as challenges.
