                      that a tariff would increase the price of steel and aluminium and

                prices.

Answers may include:
 Definition of free trade.

Benefits of reduced tariffs:
 Lower risk of retaliation and trade war (paragraphs  and )
 The increase in export revenue could help compensate for the decrease in
  consumption and combat the economic slowdown (paragraph )
 Greater choice and lower prices for Chinese consumers and in particular for
  agricultural producers, provider of medical services who may purchase foreign
  tractors and medical devices at a lower price (paragraph )
 Lower tariffs will reduce import prices leading to lower input costs for firms relying
  on imported components (potential increase in SRAS) (paragraph )
 Increased competition from trade and foreign firms may lead to product
  innovation and greater efficiency (paragraph )
 More efficient allocation of resources as US and China specialize and trade
 The current account surplus could be eroded (paragraph ) and this may prevent
  currency appreciation hence benefitting exporters (but at the expense of
  consumers who may see their real income reduced).

Limitations of reduced tariffs:
 Lower tariffs may increase the amount of imports, which could lead to lower AD.
   This could lower economic growth given the current slowdown in domestic
   consumption (paragraph )
 Decreased consumption of domestic products could lead to (structural)
   unemployment in the manufacturing sector (paragraph )
 There could be an opportunity cost for the government due to the loss of tariff
   revenue (paragraph )
 More competition for Chinese car manufacturers who are currently facing an
   oversupply and possible impact on domestic employment in the industry
   (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Benefits of the depreciation may include:
       The depreciation would help close the current account deficit (paragraph ) by
        making imports more expensive and exports cheaper
       Exported services would become cheaper in foreign currency terms which may lead
        to higher demand (but will not encourage diversification of exports (paragraph ))
       The cheaper export services might help capture other markets (in addition to US
        and Europe) (paragraph )
       Other currencies have also depreciated and hence the depreciation keeps Indian
        exports competitive (paragraph ).

      Limitations/disadvantages of the depreciation may include:
       The depreciation would make imported oil even more expensive. Given that
         demand is likely to be inelastic and since rising oil prices are already a
         contributor to the current account deficit (paragraph ), that would worsen the
         deficit
       Higher prices for imported capital goods and oil would worsen cost-push
         inflation (paragraphs  and )
       Higher prices for imported capital goods may reduce imports of such goods and
         slow down potential growth (paragraph )
       The inflation rate has risen between 2017 and 2018 (Table 1) and hence the
         depreciation would only lead to further increase in prices
       With the current high growth rate (Table 1), an increase in exports could lead to
         further demand-pull inflation.

      Any reasonable discussion.

The vertical axis may be labelled (cumulative) % of (national) income (GDP and
GNI are valid alternatives to income but wealth is not acceptable). For the
horizontal axis, the label may be (cumulative) % of
population/people/households. A title is not necessary. There must be a diagonal
line, but it is not a requirement that it is labelled. There should be labels (or
arrow) to indicate the difference between the two Lorenz curves (or direction of
the change).

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Answers may include:
       Definition of market-oriented policies
       Definition of economic development.

      Strengths of market-oriented policies:
       Promotes growth and creates employment and possibly higher wages by
         attracting foreign investment (paragraph )
       Devaluing the exchange rate has reduced the need for foreign exchange
         reserves (paragraph )
       Privatization may lead to competition, lower costs and lower prices and more
         choice for consumers (paragraph )
       Privatization will provide revenue to the government to pay down debt or
         invest in infrastructure and/or social spending
       Expanding infrastructure projects with private sector involvement encourage
         FDI (paragraph )
       Market-oriented policies may increase long run aggregate supply allowing
         inflation to fall below 25% (paragraph )
       Tax incentives in rural areas would create jobs and reduce inequalities
         (paragraph )
       Reforms of the banking sector will possibly make it easier for small-scale
         businesses to get loans (paragraph ).

Limitations of market-oriented policies:
 The privatization of railways and telecommunications may lead to higher
   prices for consumers and more inequality
 Incentive-based policies may not be sufficient to allow for diversification since
   manufacturing base is small and likely underdeveloped (paragraph  and )
 Stopping subsidies on food and using ad valorem taxes will raise prices
   causing inflation and inequality to worsen in the short term (paragraph )
 Measures to reduce public debt could worsen income inequality
 Market-oriented policies (eg more inward FDI) are unlikely to work without
   complementary interventionist policies such as the building of infrastructure
   (paragraph ) to support diversification
 Less intervention in the exchange rate may lead to depreciation and higher
   prices and/or less certainty for foreign investors
 Market-oriented policies may lead to externalities
 Encouraging more inward FDI and other investment will increase private-
   sector debts and debt-servicing costs, leading to less income available to
   spend on merit goods
 Market-oriented policies tend to lead to higher inequalities (eg through lower
   wages).

Any reasonable evaluation.

               costs (or negative externalities) resulting in any one of the
               following:
               • a misallocation of resources
               • a situation where the market is operating at a level where
               MSC>MSB

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].
      For an externalities diagram, the y axis may be labelled price or P or costs or
      benefits, and the x axis labelled quantity or Q.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Answers may include:
       definition of foreign direct investment
       definition of economic development.

      Strengths of FDI/MNCs may include:
       help reduce the over-reliance on the agricultural sector (paragraph ) where
         income is low
       provide employment and hence break the poverty trap (paragraph )
       Laos is landlocked so rail project facilitates cheaper transport of goods and
         services and raw materials (paragraph )
       potential to develop tertiary sector with tourism and exposure to “larger
         markets” (paragraph )
       foreign investment leads to economic growth (paragraph )
       brings efficiency and expertise/technology (paragraph )
       MNCs provide training
       MNCs may help finance infrastructure (paragraph )
       MNCs help generate tax revenue.

Limitations of FDI/MNCs may include:
 many of the jobs created do not go to the locals (paragraph )
 profits may be repatriated
 MNCs may influence local politics and taxation policies
 spending on infrastructure to attract MNCs may mean that less is spent on
   health and education (paragraph )
 a lot of infrastructure needs to be financed by loans to attract MNCs which
   may lead to debts (paragraph )
 MNCs may take advantage of less strict labour and environment protection
   laws
 rail project/dams may lead to negative externalities (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation.
