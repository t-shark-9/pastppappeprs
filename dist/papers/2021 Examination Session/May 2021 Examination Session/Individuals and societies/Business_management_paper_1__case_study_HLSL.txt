                                     Multi Marketing (MM)

     Rachel Goldstein, Javed Khan and Aarvan Anand met at university in London, United Kingdom,
     in 2010. They all grew up in different countries – Rachel in Israel, Javed in Jordan, and Aarvan
     in India. They also studied different things at university: Rachel studied graphic design, Javed
     studied business and Aarvan studied media and journalism. All had previously completed IB
5    Diploma courses at their respective schools.

     During their studies, Rachel, Javed and Aarvan worked together on the university’s student
     magazine. Javed was responsible for managing the advertisements that appeared in the
     magazine, and his role included finding new advertisers, negotiating prices and getting the
     advertisements from design to print. Rachel used her graphic design skills to design and set
10   each edition of the magazine. Aarvan used his talent for journalism to find stories and produce
     the news content of the magazine. They all enjoyed working as a team so much that they
     decided to set up a marketing business together when they graduated, which would allow them
     to each use their respective talents.

     In 2013, the three of them set up Multi Marketing (MM) as a partnership. The company
15   provided marketing services, which involved helping businesses reach customers through
     improving corporate branding and creating marketing strategies. MM ’s start-up was financed
     mainly by loans from parents and friends as well as by crowdfunding1 on social media. It was
     originally based in London, which has many benefits as a world centre for media and creative
     activities and easy access to many large national and international businesses, particularly in
20   European markets.

     Initially, MM advised customers on all issues relating to marketing and designed marketing
     strategies for them. It then outsourced the production work, which included making advertising
     campaigns, and managed and coordinated the various businesses involved. In its first year
     of operation, all of MM ’s customers were businesses located near the university or those
25   that had connections with the university. Soon, however, MM had customers throughout the
     United Kingdom.

     The business grew rapidly over the next four years. Its growth was based on its innovative use
     of social media and other technologies, the youthful enthusiasm of its owners, its rapid response
     to customers and the strong word-of-mouth promotion from customers. In 2017, the partners
30   (Rachel, Javed and Aarvan) converted MM to a private limited company. They became the
     majority shareholders, each owning a quarter of the shares, with the remaining quarter owned
     by their families.

     Rachel was appointed Managing Director and remains in that position. MM ’s organizational
     chart is shown in Figure 1.

35   Rachel is fairly cautious in her approach. Although she favours expansion, she wants to
     minimize risks. Aarvan is much more enthusiastic about expansion. He thinks that risks have to
     be taken to gain rewards.

     Today, MM has both national and multinational businesses as customers. Unusually, it also has
     charities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government departments as customers.
40   The company now employs 50 people.

     MM focuses on those areas of business in which its owners have strong skills and outsources
     some of the other functions. Today, its services include:
     y advising on advertising media and designing appropriate material for the chosen media
     y developing marketing strategies, including the use of changing technologies like social media
45     and other promotional methods and e-commerce websites
     y designing specifications for film and radio promotions, including creating storylines
     y advising on potential product improvements
     y buying advertising space for clients on the internet, radio and TV
     y advising customers on pricing strategies
50   y recommending distribution channels where appropriate.

     Some of the services that MM outsources include:
     y photography used in marketing materials, such as advertisements
     y production of film and radio promotions
     y human resource management (HRM) for MM and its employees.

55   MM has strong ethical objectives, including in its choice of customers. For example,
     the company will not accept business from organizations that do not have robust equal
     opportunities policies or those that do not actively work to reduce their carbon footprint. It will
     also not work with businesses that subcontract to other businesses that exploit employees,
     such as by paying lower-than-local-average wages, and it considers it important that the
60   organizations with which it works value freedom of expression. The owners of MM try to reflect
     their own cultural diversity in everything the business does, such as having multicultural content
     in the marketing strategies it creates. This approach is liked by many of MM ’s customers. As
     well as these ethical objectives, MM reflects the youthful enthusiasm of its owners. Through
     hard work and commitment, the company also aims to respond to customers more quickly than
65   others in the industry, with customer service being at the centre of everything it does.


                                                                                               Turn over
                                               –4–                                           2221 – 5001


      Partly because of political events in the United Kingdom in 2016, the owners decided to open
      an office in Bengaluru2, the IT capital of India. One of the fastest growing countries in recent
      years, and one that Aarvan is familiar with, India provides many opportunities for growth and
      maintaining contact with existing customers. So far, the Bengaluru branch of MM has sales,
70    design and customer care teams serving Asia. There is now the possibility of relocating more of
      the business to India in 2022.
      Rachel thinks that the opening of the Bengaluru office has provided her with the opportunity for
      a major reorganization of MM. Currently, the Sales Division, headed by Aarvan, is still based in
      London. It is organized by type of customer, which means that it has four separate departments:
75    y The Corporate Department, which manages the contracts with business customers.
      y The Public Service Department, which manages contracts with government departments
         and NGOs.
      y The Charities Department, which manages contracts with charities.
      y The International Department, which coordinates all of MM ’s activities.
80    Rachel has proposed that the Sales Division should now be organized by country of sale.
      The Indian office has been successful so far. Excellent premises were found in Bengaluru.
      Some of MM ’s London employees moved to India, with the remainder being recruited locally.
      Recruitment of highly qualified employees was difficult, however, so MM had to attract these
      new workers with high salaries and generous benefits.
85    Now, in 2021, Rachel, as Managing Director, has some problems to solve.

      The HRM problem
      The manager of the Public Service Department is Clare, a highly successful marketing manager
      recruited from New Zealand. Her drive and enthusiasm inspired some in her team, which has
      resulted in a 50 % increase in revenue by the department over the last 12 months. Customer
90    satisfaction is very high, and some of the marketing strategies designed by Clare’s team have
      won awards. Clare consults and delegates but is prepared, where necessary, to be autocratic,
      particularly when there are targets to be met. Clare is ambitious and has a very strong interest
      in environmental issues. When the government of an Indian state employed MM to design and
      implement an advertising campaign to encourage people to use less plastic, Clare wanted the
95    campaign to be bigger and better than any other and to be completed as quickly as possible.
      Staff in her department complained about unrealistic deadlines and bullying from Clare. When
      Clare found out about their complaints, she was rude to them, blocked their pay rises and
      threatened them with less interesting work. These employees have asked for Clare to be
      dismissed for harassment. Aarvan, Clare’s manager, has organized a meeting with Rachel to
100   decide Clare’s future.

      The finance problem
      Javed and Rachel met to discuss the newest provisional accounts and cash flow forecasts for
      2021. They expected that the opening of an Indian branch of the company would reduce its
      profits for a year. However, if the costs of operating the branch turned out to be higher than
105   planned, or sufficient revenues were not achieved, it would take longer to recover target levels
      of profit. They found that, although profits for 2020 were high compared with previous years due
      to some new contracts, there were signs of increasing costs.
      Javed thinks that MM needs to reduce its costs. He has suggested that they:
      y delay a planned pay rise for employees
110   y reduce the high payments made to the owners
      y reduce expenditure on marketing MM ’s services.
      Rachel does not want to reduce spending in areas that might result in reducing MM ’s ability to
      generate revenue. Instead, she thinks that MM should explore suitable sources of finance.
                                                     –5–                                             2221 – 5001


          The ethical problem
    115   Clare has been approached by a government in a nearby country (Country X) to design
          marketing in order to improve the image of the country. This contract would open up a new
          market for MM, so Clare thinks it is an opportunity that cannot be missed. The contract would be
          very profitable to MM and the country has offered a good price for the work. However, several
          people at MM have told Rachel that they think this contract is inconsistent with MM ’s ethical
    120   objectives: the country has been accused of human rights abuses, including arresting journalists
          for criticizing the government and persecuting people for their religious beliefs. It also has high
          levels of poverty and a poor environmental record, which the government has been accused of
          doing little to solve.

          The location problem
    125   The Bengaluru office is responsible for customers in Asia. In 2021, this region will account for
          30 % of MM ’s business, but it is expected to account for 60 % by 2025. Today, the Bengaluru
          office includes divisions responsible for sales, commissioning the work required to provide
          customers with the product, and providing after-sales service. Other business functions,
          including the rest of the Sales Division, either remain in the United Kingdom or are outsourced.
    130   Rachel would like to move all of MM ’s operations to Bengaluru. Bengaluru is a rapidly growing
          city of over 8 million people. Some aspects of its infrastructure, such as roads and water, have
          struggled to keep up with the growth. Deteriorating air quality, mainly from traffic pollution,
          is also a significant problem. Bengaluru is known as the “Silicon Valley of India”, with a
          concentration of high-tech businesses. These businesses benefit from high-quality education
    135   and training facilities. Bengaluru is also home to its own film industry, which produces about 80
          films each year. The rapid growth of Bengaluru means extensive construction of buildings, and
          Rachel believes that suitable premises could be found at lower rents than in the UK.
          Javed can see operational difficulties with moving some of the design functions of MM to
          Bengaluru. Although the country has a strong IT industry, London has a stronger creative
    140   industry. Many of the creative employees at MM, like its graphic designers and artists, are
          based in London and are unlikely to want to relocate to India. Many recent recruits to MM have
          also come from the London Academy of Creative Arts.

          The future
          The owners of MM are exploring the possibility of taking over Satvi Films (SF), a film studio
    145   in India, so that the company can produce its own advertisements for radio, TV and cinema
          without having to outsource the work. MM would need $100 million to pay for the film studio,
          which is approximately two years of net profits.
          There is evidence that economic activity in the major economies of the world is slowing down.
          Many businesses reduce their marketing spending in a recession, but the owners of MM are
    150   convinced that this is actually the right time for businesses to increase their marketing activity.
          All MM needs to do is convey this message to its customers…
