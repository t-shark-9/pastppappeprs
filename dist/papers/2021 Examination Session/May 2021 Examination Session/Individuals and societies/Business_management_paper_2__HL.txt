                                                 Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   The Pie Store (TPS)

     The Pie Store (TPS) bakes pies and sells them in its three retail stores. When developing its
     brand, TPS used the mathematical symbol pi (π). In 2020, each store made a profit.

           Table 1: Financial information for TPS’ three retail stores for 2020 (all figures in $)

                                                           Store 1    Store 2     Store 3
                    Sales                                 180 000     223 000     170 000
                    Cost of goods sold                     90 000     120 000      85 000
                    Gross profit                           90 000     103 000      85 000
                    Expenses                               66 000       76 000     67 000
                    Net profit before interest and tax       X           Y           Z

     At the end of 2020, the balance sheet for TPS (the three stores combined) showed $200 000
     in assets and $120 000 in liabilities. $50 000 of the liabilities was long-term debt.


     (a)     Describe one step in the development of a brand.                                             [2]

     (b)     Calculate:

             (i)    which store made the highest net profit before interest and tax (no working required);[1]

             (ii)   which store had the highest profitability (show all your working).[2]

     (c)     Calculate:

             (i)    TPS’ equity;                                                                          [1]

             (ii)   TPS’ return on capital employed (ROCE) (show all your working).[2]

     (d)     Explain one effect that the $50 000 long-term debt may have on TPS’ profit and
             loss account.                                                                                [2]

2.   Sharon’s Super Lunches (SSL)

     Sharon’s Super Lunches (SSL) is a cooperative that provides healthy school lunches. The
     lunches are delivered daily to students, who order them online. SSL aims for a minimum
     order size of 50 lunches to deliver to a school.

               Table 2: Sales and other financial information for SSL for one week

                              Forecasted sales of lunches         3200

                              Maximum sales of lunches            4000

                              Price of lunches                  $10.20

                              Variable costs per lunch           $6.40

                              Fixed costs for SSL                $7980

     SSL is considering a new promotional strategy for healthy school lunches: they will donate
     a free school lunch to a student in a lower-income area for each lunch purchased in a
     higher‑income area.


     (a)   Describe one feature of a cooperative.                                                    [2]

     (b)   Using total contribution, calculate the forecasted total profit for SSL before the
           introduction of the new promotional strategy (show all your working).[2]

     (c)   Construct a fully labelled break-even chart for SSL for before the new promotional
           strategy is introduced (show all your working).[4]

     (d)   Explain one advantage to SSL from implementing the new promotional strategy.              [2]




                                                                                             Turn over
                                                   –4–                                            2221 – 5012


                                              Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Soft Skin Cosmetics (SSC)

     Soft Skin Cosmetics (SSC) is a private limited company that produces a small range of face
     creams and soaps. Its products are designed and produced in the United States, and are
     made from safe, natural ingredients.

     SSC has a product-orientated marketing approach. Tiffany Presley, one of the company’s
     co‑founders, believes that SSC’s consumers value health above fashion. “The skincare
     market is full of toxic products, but ours are healthy even if they don’t smell or look as nice,”
     she says. Chelsea Presley, SSC’s other co-founder, wants to develop the first sunscreen free
     of synthetic chemicals. However, product innovation is costly and risky. If the new sunscreen
     is a failure, several years of research and development costs will be wasted, which SSC
     cannot afford. SSC currently lacks the scale to innovate.

     SSC does not pay for advertising. It relies on social media and word-of-mouth promotion. Its
     brand awareness is very high among young women, and customer reviews are very positive
     about SSC’s quality and effectiveness. The company only sells online, not in retail outlets. To
     reach unsatisfied demand domestically and internationally, SSC would have to broaden its
     current distribution channels.

     SSC practises corporate social responsibility (CSR). It does not test its products on animals,
     and supports several charities protecting endangered species. Pressure groups publicly
     recognize SSC’s commitment to animal welfare.

     Currently, multinational companies dominate the global skincare market. Small emerging
     companies rarely survive. Chelsea wants to convert SSC to a public limited company, but
     Tiffany disagrees: she argues that shareholder pressure toward profit maximization could
     jeopardize consumer and animal safety.


     (a)   State two features of product innovation.                                                     [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for SSC of having a product-orientated
           marketing approach.                                                                           [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to SSC of practising corporate social
           responsibility (CSR).                                                                         [4]

     (d)   Discuss Chelsea’s idea to convert SSC into a public limited company.                         [10]
                                                   –5–                                             2221 – 5012


4.   ReVolve Ltd (RV)

     ReVolve Ltd (RV ) manufactures and sells high-quality, high-priced
     bicycles to high-income earners. Operating in a niche market, its
     advertising slogan and unique selling point/proposition (USP) is “hand
     made to order, in the USA, delivered within seven days”. Brand loyalty
     is strong, but brand recognition outside of its customer base is weak.
     98 % of its sales are to customers living within 50 miles of the business.

     Prior to 2017, RV received an increasing number of customer complaints that phone lines
     were often engaged and calls not returned. As such, it adopted e-commerce. Its website now
     allows customers to:
     y customize their choice of bicycle
     y place orders
     y pay for purchases
     y have their questions answered.

     RV employs 20 highly paid, skilled employees using job production. To retain these workers,
     RV has raised their wages significantly since 2016.

     Increasing competition from imports of hand-made high-quality bikes has forced down prices
     in this niche market. RV has been making increasingly larger losses since 2017. In 2020, its
     sales fell by 15 %. Inflation is forecasted at between 2 % and 3 % for the next three years. As
     such, RV ’s directors are considering two options to enable it to lower the prices of its bicycles.

     Option 1: Offshore production to China, where production costs are significantly lower.
     The bicycles would be manufactured using batch production. RV would focus only on the
     design and marketing of its bicycles.

     Option 2: Invest in new job production techniques that enable parts to be glued rather than
     welded, which only requires unskilled labour. Investment would cost $3 500 000 and the
     forecasted annual net cash flow is $600 000.


     (a)   Define the term niche market.[2]

     (b)   Explain two benefits to RV of the decision to adopt e-commerce.                                 [4]

     (c)   (i)    Calculate the payback period if RV chooses Option 2 (show all your working).[2]

           (ii)   Explain one disadvantage to RV of using the payback period method of
                  investment appraisal.                                                                    [2]

     (d)   Recommend whether RV ’s directors should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                          [10]




                                                                                                  Turn over
                                                      –6–                                            2221 – 5012


5.    KapTan

      KapTan (KT ), which manufactures rechargeable batteries for cordless consumer products
      like vacuum cleaners, began five years ago as a business with a product orientation. It sells
      business to business (B2B). Multinational companies dominate the rechargeable battery
      industry, and KT suffered from cash-flow problems in its first year of trading. Its profits are
      small and, in the last two years, have fallen.

      KT has now developed an innovative battery that is small and lightweight. This battery is an
      emergency power source allowing electric cars to reach a charging station. However, the
      battery can only be used ten times before it runs out. KT has insufficient finance to create a
      battery that can be recharged an unlimited number of times.

      Through market research, KT has discovered that:
      y no other emergency batteries for electric cars exist
      y owners of electric cars fear running out of power
      y KT ’s new battery could be obsolete in five years.

      KT has the capacity to produce 90 000 of these new batteries each year. The average cost is
      $200 per unit. KT has insufficient funds to invest in additional capacity.

      KT is considering two options:

      Option 1: Market and sell directly to existing car owners through business to consumer
      (B2C) at a retail price of $400. KT will need to borrow significant capital to finance this option.

      Option 2: Accept an offer of a five-year strategic alliance with a manufacturer of electric cars.
      KT would provide its product exclusively at $250 per unit. Sales are guaranteed.

      (a)   Define the term product orientation.[2]

      (b)   With reference to Option 1, for KT, explain the relationship between the product life
            cycle, investment, profit and cash flow.                                                        [4]

      (c)   With reference to KT, explain two problems that a new business may face.                        [4]

      (d)   Recommend whether KT should choose Option 1 or Option 2.[10]
