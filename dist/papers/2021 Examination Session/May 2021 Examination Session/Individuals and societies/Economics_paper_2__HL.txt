1.   Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.


                             Filipino rice farmers prepare for trade liberalization

        To meet its obligations under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, the president of
         the Philippines has asked the government to eliminate the current quota system for rice
         imports. As an important part of food security measures, the government wants to achieve
         self-sufficiency in the production of rice. To support this goal, the WTO allowed the
         Philippines to extend its rice quota until June 2017 to allow more time for local farmers to
         prepare for free trade.

        The current quota system for rice imports makes domestic prices rise dramatically during
         periods of low domestic supply.

        Eliminating the quota on rice aims to make the rice market more competitive, which could
         reduce the price of rice by as much as 7 Philippine pesos (PH₱) per kilogram (kg). The
         National Economic and Development Authority has estimated that lower rice prices could
         save Filipino households as much as PH₱2362 per year. However, if the rice quota
         is eliminated, economists have warned that the government must prepare local rice
         producers so that they can either compete with rice imports or move to producing other
         crops. “Currently Filipino farmers cannot compete with Vietnamese farmers who may enjoy
         economies of scale” declared one economist. “The solution is to bring down the cost of
         production of rice.”

        To help Filipino farmers to adjust to competition from lower-priced rice imports, the
         government has allocated funds to the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund. This fund
         will provide support to farmers in order to increase productivity by supplying high-yield seeds
         and fertilizer. It will also provide subsidies to encourage the use of agricultural machinery and
         will offer support services and training to farmers.

         Apart from being an essential food for many Filipinos, rice is also an important input for
          the food industry. The plan to remove the import quota will reduce the inflation rate in the
          Philippines by up to 0.4 %. In July 2018, the central bank governor reported that inflation
          had reached 5.7 %, well above the government’s target range of 2 % to 4 %. He stated that
         “supply-side factors are the main drivers of the present inflation. These factors include rising
          international oil prices, higher indirect taxes and poor weather conditions that have affected
          food supply”. The president stated that the removal of the rice quota was one solution to
          ease the rising inflation.

                   Trade war with the United States puts pressure on China’s currency

        As a trade war between the United States (US) and China worsens, a central bank official
         has said that China will not use its currency to deal with trade conflicts and will continue
         with the market-based reforms of its exchange rate system. In the past, the US has accused
         China of being a currency manipulator that has maintained a fixed exchange rate to keep
         the renminbi (RMB, China’s currency) undervalued. According to a US trade official, “a
         depreciating currency is good for the Chinese economy”.

        The value of the renminbi has fallen 9 % against the US dollar (US$) in the past six months.
         Expansionary domestic monetary policy, concerns about economic growth and an
         escalating trade war continue to put downward pressure on the renminbi. Allowing the value
         of the renminbi to fall suggests that the central bank is currently maintaining a managed
         exchange rate rather than a fixed peg to the US dollar.

        The cause of the lower value of the renminbi—aside from a slowdown in Chinese economic
         growth—is a shrinking current account surplus. The US has imposed tariffs on US$250 billion
         worth of Chinese imports. The US president has also threatened to impose tariffs on the
         remaining imports from China. This, along with a widening trade deficit in services, caused
         mainly by the rise in Chinese tourists travelling abroad, would further reduce China’s current
         account surplus. In 2017, China’s current account surplus was 1.6 % of gross domestic
         product (GDP). By the first quarter of 2018, the surplus became a small deficit.

        There is international concern about the potential damage that a prolonged trade war with
         the US could cause to the Chinese economy. Central bank officials in China are concerned
         about the depreciating currency but are trying to avoid central bank intervention. To support
         the export sector, the Chinese government is considering measures such as subsidies and
         exemptions from some indirect taxes. These measures, along with a falling renminbi will
         allow Chinese exporters to avoid passing on some of the tariff costs to US consumers.

        To complicate matters for China, economic growth in the US is causing US interest rates
         to rise and the US dollar to strengthen. This, along with China’s first current account deficit
         in 20 years, is negatively affecting China’s financial account. Responding to the rising US
         interest rates with increases of its own is not a good option for China’s central bank, because
         Chinese companies have a heavy debt burden that is slowing economic growth. Recently, a
         government official advised against increasing China’s interest rate because of its impact on
         borrowing costs in China.

                  Can the Democratic Republic of the Congo achieve its economic potential?

          The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a nation of great potential. It has large
           mineral resources and an abundance of fertile land. The mining and export of cobalt, copper
           and gold are the main source of government revenue. However, the abundance of natural
           resources causes devastating conflicts as rebel groups fight for control of the DRC’s
           resources. With a population of 80 million and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of
           only US$457, the DRC is one of the world’s poorest nations. It is ranked 176 in the world in
           terms of the Human Development Index (HDI).

          The government has been accused of relying too much on tariffs, but to improve living
           standards, the government needs revenue to spend on agriculture, electricity and roads.
           Furthermore, business owners in the DRC complain of corruption and increasing “red tape”
           (excessive regulations).

          The government believes that a strong agricultural sector could boost economic growth
           but only 10 % of the land is used for farming. Rice, maize and other crops grow well in the
           tropical climate and yet the government spends US$1 billion per year importing basic foods.
           According to a government spokesperson, the lack of infrastructure is a major barrier to
           the processing and transporting of agricultural products. The DRC’s road network is so bad
           that farmers and traders often make a two-week trip in small boats down the Congo River
           to sell their produce. The DRC has just 27 877 kilometres (km) of roads. It is estimated that
           90 000 km of national roads and 150 000 km of rural roads must be built.

          In addition, the World Bank reports that only 17 % of the DRC’s population has access to
           electricity, despite the capacity of the Congo River to generate enough electricity to satisfy
           the needs of the region.

          To make matters worse, the regional conflicts have affected the availability of healthcare
           services. It is estimated that half of the health centres have been looted*, burnt or destroyed.
           Government expenditure on healthcare per capita remains one of the lowest in the world.
           Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are relied on to protect the health and wellbeing
           of citizens. NGOs help to achieve this by distributing medicine and teaching families about
           hygiene and proper sanitation.



* looted: goods stolen from a place, typically during a war or riot

                            Economic development in Honduras and Guatemala

         Honduras

        Honduras is a developing country in Central America. While historically dependent on the
         export of primary products, Honduras has more recently diversified its exports to include
         clothing and automobile components. Honduras’ economy depends heavily on exports to the
         United States (US) and, to a lesser extent, on remittances (money sent by a foreign worker
         to their home country).

        In rural areas, approximately one out of five Hondurans lives in absolute poverty. The
         country is also vulnerable to external shocks and has experienced worsening terms of trade.
         Revenue earned by the agricultural sector has decreased by one-third over the past two
         decades. This is partially due to the declining prices of the country’s export crops, especially
         bananas and coffee beans.

        The Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) has helped
         attract foreign direct investment (FDI). However, a threat to future FDI inflows is Honduras’
         high level of crime and violence. It has one of the highest murder rates in the world.

         Guatemala

        Guatemala shares a border with Honduras. Guatemala has the largest population and the
         biggest economy in Central America. Guatemala is the top remittance recipient in Central
         America as a result of large numbers of Guatemalans living and working in the US. These
         inflows on the current account are equivalent to two-thirds of the country’s export revenue
         and about 10 % of its gross domestic product (GDP).

        The agricultural sector employs 31 % of Guatemala’s labour force. Key agricultural exports
         include sugar, coffee, bananas and vegetables. The CAFTA-DR has reduced the barriers to
         FDI, resulting in increased investment and diversification of exports, particularly in iron, steel
         and non-traditional agricultural exports (such as high-priced fruits and vegetables). While the
         free trade agreement has improved the conditions for investment, FDI continues to be limited
         by concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers and poor infrastructure.

        With some of the worst poverty, malnutrition and infant mortality rates in the region,
         Guatemala’s economic development is slowing. Those worst affected live in rural areas.
         Faster economic growth is crucial to achieving the country’s medium- and long-term poverty
         reduction objectives.
