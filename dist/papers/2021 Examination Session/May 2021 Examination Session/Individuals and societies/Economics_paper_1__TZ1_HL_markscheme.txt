Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain why governments impose price floors in the market for agricultural
               products.                                                                            [10]

               Answers may include:
                definition of price floor
                diagram showing the imposition of a price floor leading to higher prices and
                 higher producer revenues
                explanation that governments impose price floors in the market for agricultural
                 products to support producers by increasing producers’ revenues and/or
                 improving producers’ ability to plan and invest for the future
                examples of specific agricultural markets where price floors have been
                 imposed.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of government regulations in achieving a reduction in
      the consumption of demerit goods.                                                   [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of demerit goods
       negative externalities diagram showing reduced consumption of demerit
        goods
       explanation that government regulations may restrict the demand for, or the
        supply of, demerit goods, resulting in lower equilibrium quantity
       examples of demerit goods and/or cases where government regulations on
        demerit goods have been imposed (eg ban on smoking and drinking in public
        places, age limits, warnings on packaging, ban on the consumption of certain
        drugs)
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the strengths of government
      regulations: do not increase tax burden; relatively simple to implement (compared
      to market-based policies), addressing directly the consumption of demerit goods,
      complete bans may be very effective in preventing the use of highly addictive
      demerit goods; consideration of the limitations of government regulations:
      difficulties/cost of enforcement and lack of government revenue, may be
      politically unpopular; decrease the revenues of producers of demerit goods and
      the income of workers in these industries; complete bans may lead to
      underground parallel markets; consideration of the strengths and limitations of
      alternative (market-based) policies.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

2.   (a)       Explain why a monopolistically competitive firm can make economic (abnormal)
               profit in the short run, but not in the long run.                                    [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of monopolistic competition, economic (abnormal) profit, short run,
                 long run
                diagram of a monopolistically competitive firm that makes economic profit in
                 the short run by producing the quantity of output where MR=MC and price is
                 lower than ATC; diagram of a monopolistically competitive firm that makes
                 normal profit in the long run by producing the quantity of output where MR=MC
                 and price is equal to ATC
                explanation that in the long run the economic profit will disappear, because the
                 lack of barriers to entry in the industry will allow the entrance of new firms,
                 which will attract customers away from existing firms (decreasing the demand)
                examples of monopolistically competitive markets in practice (eg restaurants,
                 legal and tax services, dental care).

(b)   Discuss the consequences of a perfectly competitive market becoming a
      monopoly market.                                                                       [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of perfect competition, monopoly
       diagrams of a perfectly competitive firm with only normal profit (producing at a
        level of output that is productively and allocatively efficient) and a monopoly
        with abnormal profit (producing at a level of output that is productively and
        allocatively inefficient)
       explanation that the firm that will dominate the industry will be able to charge a
        higher profit-maximizing price, make economic (abnormal) profit in the long
        run and produce at a level of output that is neither allocatively nor productively
        efficient
       examples of cases where a perfectly competitive market may be monopolized
        are not required, but candidates may use real-world examples of markets that
        have the characteristics of perfect competition or monopoly in their answers
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the positive and negative effects on different
      stakeholders; short-run and long-run effects on prices and economic (abnormal)
      profit; the consequences for productive and allocative efficiency, innovation,
      research and development; the possible positive effects of economies of scale.

      NB It should be noted that definitions, diagrams, theory and examples that have
      already been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be
      rewarded.

      demand-pull inflation.                                                                  [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of inflation, demand-pull inflation, supply-side policies,
        interventionist supply-side policies
       AD/AS diagram showing an increase in AD in the short run (increasing the
        inflationary gap) and an increase in the LRAS (full employment level of output)
        in the long run (decreasing the inflationary gap)
       explanation that, in the short run, interventionist supply-side policies may
        increase the inflationary pressure due to their effect on AD, but the inflationary
        pressure will be reduced in the long run due to the increased productive
        capacity of the economy
       examples of interventionist supply-side policies in practice
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: consideration of the tension between the inflationary
      short-run effects and disinflationary long-run effects of interventionist supply-side
      policies; spending on healthcare, education and infrastructure may improve
      equality in the distribution of income/equity; interventionist supply-side policies
      may be expensive and lead to high budget deficits and increased indebtedness;
      considerable time lags; negative effects on the environment; consideration of the
      strengths and limitations of alternative policies (eg contractionary monetary
      policy, contractionary fiscal policy, market-based supply-side policies).

      NB It should be noted that definitions, diagrams, theory and examples that have
      already been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be
      rewarded.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

4.   (a)       Explain two causes of structural unemployment.                                       [10]

               Answers may include:
                definition of unemployment, structural unemployment
                diagram(s) that show the demand curve for labour shifting to the left and/or
                 surplus of labour due to minimum wage legislation/labour unions
                explanation that a (permanent) decrease in demand for particular labour skills,
                 changes in the geographical location of industries and labour market rigidities,
                 would lead to a surplus of workers (and therefore unemployment)
                examples of industries that have experienced structural unemployment due to
                 relevant causes (eg coal miners losing their job due to foreign competition or
                 the advent of alternative sources of energy, workers in the newspaper and
                 retailing businesses losing their jobs due to online competition and new
                 technologies, low-skilled workers remaining unemployed due to minimum
                 wage legislation, etc).

(b)   Discuss the consequences of different types of unemployment.                            [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of unemployment, frictional unemployment, structural
        unemployment, seasonal unemployment, cyclical unemployment
       diagram(s) showing decreasing GDP due to falling AD or LRAS
       explanation of the economic consequences of different types of
        unemployment in terms of effects on government budget, personal incomes
        and real GDP, and personal or social consequences such as increased
        inequality in the distribution of income, the possibility of increased crime rates,
        increased stress levels, increased indebtedness, homelessness and family
        breakdown
       examples of specific cases where unemployment has led to economic,
        personal and social consequences (eg geographical areas with declining
        industries, the Great Depression)
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: comparison of the extent of the negative consequences
      for the government budget, personal incomes and the real GDP of the different
      types of unemployment; comparison of the extent of the negative personal and
      social consequences of the different types of unemployment for individuals who
      have lost their jobs; consideration that unemployment is part of the adjustment
      process of a dynamic economy; consideration of the desirability of some types of
      unemployment (eg frictional) in comparison to others (eg cyclical); consideration
      of the duration of different types of unemployment from the point of view of
      individuals and the economy as a whole.
