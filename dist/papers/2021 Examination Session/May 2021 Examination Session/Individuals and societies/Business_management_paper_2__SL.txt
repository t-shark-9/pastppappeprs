1.   Hafs

     Hafs is a new cooperative. It plans to manufacture wastepaper bins for the household market.

2.   The Pie Store (TPS)

     The Pie Store (TPS) bakes pies and sells them in its three retail stores. When developing its
     brand, TPS used the mathematical symbol pi (π). In 2020, each store made a profit.

           Table 1: Financial information for TPS’ three retail stores for 2020 (all figures in $)

                                                           Store 1    Store 2     Store 3

                    Net profit before interest and tax       X           Y           Z

     At the end of 2020, the balance sheet for TPS (the three stores combined) showed $200 000
     in assets and $120 000 in liabilities. $50 000 of the liabilities was long-term debt.


     (a)     Describe one step in the development of a brand.                                             [2]

     (b)     Calculate:

             (i)    which store made the highest net profit before interest and tax (no working required);[1]

             (ii)   which store had the highest profitability (show all your working).[2]

     (c)     Calculate:

             (i)    TPS’ equity;                                                                          [1]

             (ii)   TPS’ return on capital employed (ROCE) (show all your working).[2]

     (d)     Explain one effect that the $50 000 long-term debt may have on TPS’ profit and
             loss account.                                                                                [2]

                                             Section B

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Buzza

     Jo and Demi Straus established Buzza, a partnership, in 1999. Buzza manufactures women’s
     fashion accessories, such as handbags and scarves. Jo, a gifted designer, directs the design
     team. Demi, a business graduate, organized the business by function. She manages most of
     those functions.

     In 2012, they converted Buzza to a private limited company to help obtain finance for the
     business’s expansion. Jo and Demi retained 60 % ownership between them.

     Because of the brand’s reputation, Buzza can recruit creative graduates from design
     universities. Graduates receive 12-month contracts, which are renewed only if Buzza accepts
     their designs. Buzza tells graduates that, generally, only half of all contracts are renewed.
     The average age in the design team is 26. Labour turnover in the design team is much higher
     than in similar exclusive brands.

     Wealthy consumers interested in the latest fashions find Buzza a highly desirable and
     exclusive brand. Only approved retail outlets sell Buzza products. New collections are
     produced four times a year. At the end of each season, retailers return unsold products to
     Buzza. Last year, these unsold products were valued at $15 million. At present, Buzza sends
     returned products to an incinerator plant to be destroyed. A recent television documentary
     revealed that Buzza incinerates perfectly good products, which led to damaging social media
     comments.

     In response to the negative publicity, Jo and Demi are considering two options:

     Option 1: Sell surplus products at greatly reduced prices on its website.

     Option 2: Break down returned products to recover raw materials for re-use in future products.
     This process of breaking down returned products will be time consuming and costly.


     (a)   State three of Buzza’s main business functions.                                              [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to Buzza of operating as a partnership.           [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of the high labour turnover of designers
           at Buzza.[4]

     (d)   Discuss the two options that Jo and Demi are considering.                                  [10]
                                                   –5–                                            2221 – 5014


4.   ReVolve Ltd (RV)

     ReVolve Ltd (RV ) manufactures and sells high-quality, high-priced
     bicycles to high-income earners. Operating in a niche market, its
     advertising slogan and unique selling point/proposition (USP) is “hand
     made to order, in the USA, delivered within seven days”. Brand loyalty
     is strong, but brand recognition outside of its customer base is weak.
     98 % of its sales are to customers living within 50 miles of the business.

     Prior to 2017, RV received an increasing number of customer complaints that phone lines
     were often engaged and calls not returned. As such, it adopted e-commerce. Its website now
     allows customers to:
     y customize their choice of bicycle
     y place orders
     y pay for purchases
     y have their questions answered.

     RV employs 20 highly paid, skilled employees using job production. To retain these workers,
     RV has raised their wages significantly since 2016.

     Increasing competition from imports of hand-made high-quality bikes has forced down prices
     in this niche market. RV has been making increasingly larger losses since 2017. In 2020, its
     sales fell by 15 %. Inflation is forecasted at between 2 % and 3 % for the next three years. As
     such, RV’s directors are considering two options to enable it to lower the prices of its bicycles.

     Option 1: Offshore production to China, where production costs are significantly lower.
     The bicycles would be manufactured using batch production. RV would focus only on the
     design and marketing of its bicycles.

     Option 2: Invest in new job production techniques that enable parts to be glued rather than
     welded, which only requires unskilled labour. Investment would cost $3 500 000 and the
     forecasted annual net cash flow is $600 000.


     (a)   Define the term niche market.[2]

     (b)   Explain two benefits to RV of the decision to adopt e-commerce.                                [4]

     (c)   (i)    Calculate the payback period if RV chooses Option 2 (show all your working).[2]

           (ii)   Explain one disadvantage to RV of using the payback period method of
                  investment appraisal.                                                                   [2]

     (d)   Recommend whether RV ’s directors should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                         [10]




                                                                                                  Turn over

5.    KapTan

      KapTan (KT ), which manufactures rechargeable batteries for cordless consumer products
      like vacuum cleaners, began five years ago as a business with a product orientation. It sells
      business to business (B2B). Multinational companies dominate the rechargeable battery
      industry, and KT suffered from cash-flow problems in its first year of trading. Its profits are
      small and, in the last two years, have fallen.

      KT has now developed an innovative battery that is small and lightweight. This battery is an
      emergency power source allowing electric cars to reach a charging station. However, the
      battery can only be used ten times before it runs out. KT has insufficient finance to create a
      battery that can be recharged an unlimited number of times.

      Through market research, KT has discovered that:
      y no other emergency batteries for electric cars exist
      y owners of electric cars fear running out of power
      y KT ’s new battery could be obsolete in five years.

      KT has the capacity to produce 90 000 of these new batteries each year. The average cost is
      $200 per unit. KT has insufficient funds to invest in additional capacity.

      KT is considering two options:

      Option 1: Market and sell directly to existing car owners through business to consumer
      (B2C) at a retail price of $400. KT will need to borrow significant capital to finance this option.

      Option 2: Accept an offer of a five-year strategic alliance with a manufacturer of electric cars.
      KT would provide its product exclusively at $250 per unit. Sales are guaranteed.
