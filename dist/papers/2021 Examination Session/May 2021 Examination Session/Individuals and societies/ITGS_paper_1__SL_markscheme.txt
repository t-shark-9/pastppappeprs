1.   A cashless society

     Note to examiners:
     • All part (a) questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate.
     • Part (b) and part (c) are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
       provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

     (a)   When a user wants to make a payment with the Swish app, the app will need to
           collect data about the transaction.

           (i)    Identify two items of data that the app could collect from the user making
                  the payment.                                                                  [2]

                  Answers may include:
                  • the name of the person making the payment / username / ID Number
                    (accept other personal identifiers)
                  • password
                  • phone number of the person making the payment
                  • bank account to be used for the transaction (in the case that there is
                    more than one account linked to the Swish app)
                  • amount of the transaction/cost of the item
                  • message (to indicate what the transaction was for) / personal greeting
                    card.
                  • name of person receiving the payment
                  • Swish account details / phone number of the person receiving the
                    payment.

                  Note: Do not accept data that are system generated, e.g., date/time of
                  transaction, transaction id, etc.

                  Award [1] for identifying each item of data that the app would collect from
                  the user making the payment up to maximum of [2] marks.

           (ii)   Identify the steps taken by the app to make the payment into the bank
                  account of the person receiving the money.                                    [4]

                  Answers may include:
                  • user is verified
                  • buyer ’s / payer’s bank account is accessed (by the app)
                  • authorization from the bank for the amount required – amount of the
                    transaction is compared to the amount of money/credit available in the
                    buyer’s bank account
                  • authorization from the bank for the amount required – amount of the
                    transaction is compared to the limit the bank permits for Swish
                    transactions
                  • determine the seller’s / payee’s bank in order to initiate a transfer
                  • if authorized, then transfer of money from buyer’s bank to seller’s bank
                  • if not authorized, then error message (to buyer and seller)
                  • message sent (to buyer and seller) to confirm transaction.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step taken by the app to complete the
                  transaction up to maximum of [4] marks.
                                           –4–                 M21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain why it is important that any data sharing agreement between the Swish
      app and the Swedish banks has policies that address both the storing and
      sharing of app users’ data.                                                        [6]

      Answers may include:
      Storing:
         • to ensure that data is protected by a strong security network (firewalls,
            anti-malware protection, encryption etc)
         • to provide strong security for any machines that have access to the data
         • to ensure that access to data is restricted to people who have a need to
            know
         • to provide protections against loss of data are in place
         • to provide protections against any attacks aimed at stealing or changing
            the data
         • to provide a plan for backup and recovery.
         • to make sure that only relevant data is stored
         • to prevent data being stored after people have left the Swish platform.
         • to make sure that data being stored adheres to data protection laws as
            governed in specific locations, e.g., data stored in Sweden follows GDPR

      Sharing:
        • to ensure that data is only shared with the consent of the app users
        • to ensure that any data shared should be anonymized as far as possible to
            prevent the identity of the app user being determined
        • to ensure that app users should be informed if there are any additional
            organizations that their data may be shared with and for what purpose
        • to ensure that data will be shared using secure means.

      Award [1] for a reason why it is important that any data sharing agreement
      between the Swish app and the Swedish banks has policies that address the
      processing/sharing of app users’ data and [2] for developments of that reason up
      to maximum of [3] marks.

      Mark as [3] + [3]
                                              –5–                  M21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Many people in Sweden have seen the advantages of using the Swish app. It
      allows friends to share a restaurant bill, to pay where credit or debit cards are not
      accepted, to easily pay for babysitting or parking tickets, or make a donation at
      church. However, some people in Sweden have expressed concerns about not
      using cash and making the Swish app the only means of payment.

      To what extent do the advantages of the Swish app as the only means of
      payment outweigh the disadvantages.                                                     [8]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of using Swish:
        • no need to carry cash / credit cards – no risk of being stolen/no risk of not
           having enough cash
        • no risk of credit card being used fraudulently
        • transactions are recorded – there is proof of payment
        • payments can be done immediately – no need to wait until person has
           time to go to bank to get cash
        • can solve other problems regarding money – bills can be shared, one
           person pays and money is transferred
        • in an emergency money can be transferred to dependents without them
           being close (eg children at university)
        • allows money transactions between individuals
        • transfers of money are in real time (instantly) and free of charge
        • amount of money to be transferred is limited thus minimising the loss of
           money.
        • many people are already used to the app so it would be a good choice if
           the country were going cashless.
        • easier for users to track budgets / spending as all transactions are on one
           app.

      Disadvantages of using Swish:
         • Swedish banks will be able to obtain more data on their users’ transaction
            habits (privacy concern)
         • is not available to people who do not have a bank account so a potential
            digital divide concern
         • it only works within Sweden, or people who have a Swedish bank account
            so may be problematic for tourists
         • removes the anonymity of the payee in transactions – Swish stores a
            user’s transaction history. This would include date, item, recipient of the
            money and cost of the item
         • the bank controls the maximum amount of money that can be transferred
            – this may limit a person’s spending
         • the transition from a society that uses cash for transactions to one that
            does not may not be possible and in trying to make this transition it may
            cause considerable harm to many citizens.
         • use of the Swish app (specifically) would give the company an unfair
            monopoly over the technology
         • Digital Divide – smartphones ownership and use by mature adults
         • if a person loses his/her phone or breaks it or its battery runs out, he/she
            has no way to pay for anything.
         • failure in / lack of phone network coverage could affect when and where
            people could use the app.
         • Failure of the system / technical issues / down time which would prevent
            people from making transactions.
      Accept implicit and explicit references to the Swish app.

2.   Automatic crop watering system

     (a)   (i)    Identify three characteristics of proprietary software.                            [3]

                  Answers may include:
                   • software is copyrighted
                   • commercial software
                   • relicensing, distribution or copying is prohibited
                   • the user/organization must accept the agreement prior to installing or
                      using the software
                    • requires a subscription or monthly fee
                    • has customer support and maintenance of the software provided by
                      its developers as part of the purchase of the software.

                  Award [1] for identifying each characteristic of proprietary software up to
                  maximum of [3] marks.

           (ii)   A computer program uses the data provided by the rain sensor to decide
                  whether to water the trees. Identify the steps in this program.                    [3]

                  Answers may include:
                   • the sensor gathers analog data
                   • the analog data is converted into digital data
                   • the computer compares the data to a preset level within the program
                      to determine if it is raining.

                    Either:
                    o if it is raining the computer program will not start/will stop watering
                    o if it is not raining the watering continues as programmed.

                   Or:
                   o if the ground reaches a certain dampness then the watering is
                       stopped
                   o if the ground has not reached a certain dampness then the watering
                       continues as programmed.

                  Award [1] for identifying each step the computer program will use when
                  deciding whether to water the trees up to maximum of [3] marks.
                                             –7–                  M21/3/ITGSX/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Water is becoming increasingly scarce in Chacra Province and the provincial
      government is concerned there will be a point when there is not enough water for
      all of the farms to water their crops or fruit trees.

      To manage water for the watering of crops and fruit trees, the provincial
      government of Chacra Province intends to create a computer model to calculate
      how much water each farm in the province will receive.

      Explain three factors that will contribute to the accuracy of the model.                [6]

      Answers may include:
        • quality of data input
        • high quality data will allow for a more accurate model to be developed as
           this data will be more reliable / current water levels within each area must
           be accurate.

         •   frequency of readings taken
         •   more frequent readings may be able to pick up more subtle changes in the
             patterns of rainfall to increase the accuracy of the model / if we take daily
             readings and use these to create the model, that will be more accurate
             that monthly readings.

         •   number of variables taken into account when developing the model
         •   more variables will enable other, potentially less important, factors to be
             considered when developing the model / what crops are farmed in
             different areas in the province / the weather conditions in different areas of
             the province.

         •   number of assumptions that have been built into the model
         •   if any of the assumptions are weak or false the model will be inaccurate.

         •   quantity of data input
         •   if the sample of data is larger, then the resulting model would be more
             accurate / spans several years.

      Award [1] for identifying a factor that will contribute to the accuracy of the model
      and [1] for explanation why that will contribute to the accuracy of the model up to
      maximum of [2] marks.

      OR

      Award [1] for each example given and an additional [1] if the explanation
      contributes to the accuracy of the model up to a maximum of [2] marks.

      Mark as [2] + [2] + [2]

(c)   The farmers of Chacra Province are concerned about the provincial government
      using a computer model to determine the amount of water they will be allowed to
      use to water their fruit trees.

      To what extent should the farmers of Chacra Province rely on their knowledge
      and experience, rather than the computer-based solution provided by the
      provincial government, to manage the watering of the fruit trees?                 [8]

      Answers may include:
      Knowledge and experience will:
        • allow the farmers to see more than water needs for a plant (sick leaves,
           buds falling, etc) without needing to develop a model
        • be able to include other factors that may arise from time to time such as
           quality of the water (eg coming with mud) and adjust their watering
           accordingly
        • be able to resolve potential issues that cannot be programmed into the
           computer, or would be outside of the scope of a computational solution
        • provide expertise that cannot be quantified/ensure that in a worst-case
           scenario some of the farmers will be able to grow crops/trees.

      Use of the provincial model will:
        • allow water to be distributed evenly between the farmers on a “needs”
            basis rather than based on the opinions of one or two stronger characters
        • a scientific approach has limits (e.g. there may be variables which the
            model does not take into account), the decisions around the water
            requirements of the trees may be based as much on intuition as
            algorithms and models.
        • model may be biased or influenced by politics e.g. farmers may not have
            fully disclosed their data / government may favour certain groups or
            industries.

      Use of the proprietary computer system will:
        • reduce the amount of time farmers need to spend visibly checking their
            fields
        • allow exact water usage to be measured and lead to potential efficiencies
            in its usage
        • will provide quantitative data that could be used as a model for other
            farmers growing the same trees in similar locations.

3.   Technology disruption in Orams Academy

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of cloud-based storage.                             [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    • data is stored on remote servers accessed from the internet, or
                       "cloud”
                    • data can be accessed from anywhere as long as the person has an
                       Internet connection
                    • online space allows users to store data, photos, music, and videos
                    • documents stored in the cloud can be shared with others (most of the
                       time) instead of sending them via emails
                    • cloud storage providers may provide other services like backups
                    • requires a username and password for access.

                   Award [1] for each characteristic of cloud-based storage identified up to [2]
                   marks.

           (ii)    Identify two reasons why there might be a lack of bandwidth at times on the
                   school’s network.                                                                [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    • many students are using the internet (e.g. for social media) at certain
                       times of the day (e.g. lunchtimes)
                    • a large number of classes are working simultaneously on
                       collaborative projects (ie Google docs)
                    • due to geographic location, local ISPs may not be able to offer
                       enough bandwidth so that at certain times there isn’t enough for all

(b)   An acceptable-use policy will be required for the appropriate use of virtual
      learning environments and collaborative online tools in Orams Academy.

      Explain three elements that would be included in an acceptable-use policy for
      Orams Academy.                                                                       [6]

      Answers may include:
        • a philosophy of Orams Academy relating to the use of online environments
        • which acts as a guiding statement and provides the overarching principles
           for online behavior.

         •   a code of conduct
         •   that provides clear and unambiguous directions about how staff and
             students should act while online / using appropriate language in text chats
             / avoiding bullying behaviour / avoiding copying or plagiarism.
         please check with team leader for other answers

         •   an outline of the sanctions
         •   that would be imposed if staff or students did not adhere to the code of
             conduct.

         •   a disclaimer
         •   so that Orams Academy is not responsible for the actions of the staff or
             students if an illegal activity is carried out / managers at Orams Academy
             are able to supervise everything that is posted onto the VLE / managers at
             Orams Academy would be able to read students’ messages.
         please check with team leader for other answers

         •   data privacy and protection
         •   so it will be transparent who owns the data created in VLE, for how long
             and what type of data is collected by the VLE servers.

(c)   Discuss whether Daniela should make every teacher at Orams Academy use the
      same learning platform or she should allow each teacher to choose their own
      preferred learning management approach.                                                 [8]

      Answers may include:
      A single learning platform:
        • means that all of the information is centralized and can be easily accessed
           by staff, students and parents
        • the training requirements for staff are reduced as they only have to use one
           system
        • prevents the use of a range of formats that may be incompatible meaning
           that resources cannot be shared, or may need adapting to work on a
           different platform
        • having a common learning platform would make it convenient for the IT
           dept. to take backup/restore and roll-over data to new academic year.
        • makes it easier for senior managers to monitor the actions of staff, to view
           lessons etc for consistency
        • can be integrated into any acceptable-user policy or training requirements
        • may be costly and based on proprietary software meaning that fixes could
           be expensive and take a long time to happen
        • if the single platform is inaccessible for any reason, then all learning
           content would be inaccessible.

      Teachers choosing their own preferred learning management approach:
        • allows teachers to use their expertise of particular tools
        • allows teachers to feel they are being allowed to use their creativity and
          innovative approach to the teaching and learning
        • may integrate with social media tools that may be blocked by the school
          and provide a better user experience
        • may provide better functionality than a “one size fits all” approach
        • may lead to staff or students working outside of an acceptable-user
          policy/using the sites inappropriately
        • the training requirements for staff will be increased if the staff are unfamiliar
          with the platforms / training will only occur on an ad hoc basis / training
          might be decreased since staff are already familiar with the tools they
          choose to use
        • expertise of a platform may depend on particular teachers – if they leave
          then no one may be able to support students with this tool.

4.   Voice simulation

     (a)   (i)     Lyrebird uses a person’s voice-print to determine their identity.

                   Identify two other methods of biometric identification that could be used to
                   determine a person’s identity.                                                  [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    • fingerprints
                    • eye/retinal scans
                    • palm prints/hand geometry
                    • facial recognition.

                   Award [1] for each method of biometric feature identified up to [2] marks.

           (ii)    Identify two audio file formats that could be used to store the voice-print.    [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    • MP3
                    • WAV
                    • WMA
                    • OGG
                    • AAC
                    • FLAC
                    • AVI.

                   Award [1] for each audio file format identified up to [2] marks.

           (iii)   The voice-print created can be compressed using lossless or lossy
                   compression.

                   Describe the difference between lossless and lossy compression.                 [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    • lossless compression is when the original data can be recreated after
                       compression/no quality is lost
                    • lossy compression is when some of the quality may be lost when the
                       data is decompressed/the decompression is based on a best-fit
                       algorithm by the compression software and may not perfectly recreate
                       the original file.

                   Award [1] for a correct identification of a difference between lossy and
                   lossless compression and [1] for a further development up to [2] marks.

 (b)    Analyse whether it would be appropriate for Lyrebird to release the biometric data
        of a user to a third party.                                                                     [6]

        Answers may include:
        It would be appropriate:
            • to law enforcement agencies for a warrant, subpoena, or court order
            • in response to requests by regulatory, legal or government agencies as
              the information cannot be obtained by any other means
            • by with-holding this information it would be working against the ethical
              principles of Lyrebird
            • if it is necessary or appropriate to do so to protect our rights, property, or
              safety
            • where the user has provided Lyrebird with written consent to disclosure of
              your biometric data.

        It would not be appropriate:
            • where the releasing of the data would lead to harm being caused to the
              person whose data is being released, for example, data that is linked to an
              underlying medical condition
            • where it is in direct contradiction to the policies that Lyrebird have for the
              sharing of data
            • as it could be harmful to the reputation of Lyrebird
            • as it is an invasion of privacy to release personal data without consent
            • it is illegal under the laws of the country in which Lyrebird operates (e.g.
              GDPR).

(c)   To what extent do the benefits of using Lyrebird’s voice cloning software
      outweigh the concerns that may arise from its use?                                 [8]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits may include:
        • could help people who have lost their voice
        • could create better voice activated interfaces
        • characters in video games could have individual voices, could clone your
            own voice as a playable character
        • could provide interactive training and learning
        • could be used in educational software to produce a more realistic
            experience
        • any device that requires speech could be enhanced by more natural
            voices (appointment reminders, personal assistant applications,
            audiobooks, etc)
        • parents could use the software to “read” to their children.

      Concerns may include:
        • could be used to create fake news or weaken the public’s confidence in
           news of all kinds
        • increase in robocalls with realistic voices – scammers will be able to
           deceive people more easily, or make fake calls to the police
        • may lead to systems that use voice as a method of authentication become
           compromised as scammers are able to quickly create a user’s voiceprint
           and access the system.
