1.   (a)   FaceToFace used the coffee shop as a proof of concept for the facial recognition
           application.

           Outline one reason why the coffee shop was used as a proof of concept.               [2]

           Answers may include:
             • small scale environment (the coffee shop)
             • making it relatively easy for FaceToFace to develop their software.

              •   coffee shop may be on a larger scale (as it is in a University)
              •   the variety of customers may help better test the application.

              •   the FaceToFace team were familiar with the way the coffee shop operated
              •   meaning less information would need to be gathered/researched to create
                  user requirements.

              •   less chance of legal problems with the collection and storage of data
              •   the customers can see the data collected and can query the staff of the
                  coffee shop if they want to.

              •   it was convenient for the FaceToFace team to visit the coffee shop
              •   making it easier to gather information while gathering additional user
                  information and/or developing/testing prototypes.

              •   cooperation of manager/staff is likely
              •   as the coffee shop is situated on campus, the manager and staff would be
                  willing to assist Mike and colleagues by trialling the system and answering
                  questions.

              •   coffee shop had an easily identified problem
              •   success of the facial recognition could easily be tested against the known
                  problem.

              •   coffee shop had a loyalty card system set up already
              •   success of the facial recognition could be tested to replace the loyalty
                  card.

           Note: the candidate must link the answer to the coffee shop, outlining why the
           coffee shop is suitable.

           Award [1] for identifying a reason why the coffee shop was used as a proof of
           concept and [1] for a development of that reason up to [2] marks.
                                             –4–                 M21/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Outline one reason why the facial recognition application may not be able to
      capture an accurate image of the customer’s face.                                      [2]

      Answers may include:
        • bad lighting/wearing makeup/wearing glasses or other objects on the face
        • that hinders the obtaining of a clear image or is compulsory to be worn
           (e.g. masks in a pandemic).

         •   the location of the camera
         •   that does not allow the camera angle to take an image of the full face, or is
             too far away to capture enough detail.

         •   A low-quality camera
         •   That does not capture enough detail to allow the software to identify the
             nodal points.

         •   the customer may move so the image may be blurry
         •   and as a consequence, the quality is not good enough quality.

      Award [1] for identifying the circumstances with the FR software system that
      could lead to reduced accuracy in correctly identifying a person and [1] for a
      development of the reason why the circumstance could hinder the correct
      identification up to [2] marks.

2.   Explain the processes The FaceToFace facial recognition application uses to identify a
     person using faceprints.                                                                     [6]

     Answers may include:
     The whole process has two stages:
        • the creation and storage of a faceprint
        • the process for identification of an unknown person using a faceprint.

     Not all the steps in stage one are required, especially the creation of the faceprint. But
     at the least, what a faceprint is, composed of measurements and nodes, needs to be
     described in the process of matching.

     Stage One: The faceprint creation and storage
        • image of the person’s face is taken by camera
        • the software identifies nodal points and other features on the face
        • the number of nodal points and other features can range from less than a 100 to
           more than 30 000 for 3-D facial recognition
        • other features of the face can also be measured such as skin tone, colour
        • the nodal points are endpoints used to measure variables of the person’s face,
           such as the length or width of the nose, the depth of the eye sockets and the
           shape of the cheekbones. Features other than length/width can also be
           measured such as colour, patterns of lines on the face, patterns of skin-tones
           on the face
        • the measurements are stored as data and can be aggregated to create a
           faceprint of the person’s face
        • this aggregation is stored in the FaceToFace database as a record of the
           faceprint of the person who agrees to be part of the FR scheme.

     Stage Two: Using the faceprint to identify a person
        • a person is identified by matching a faceprint image taken of that person with a
            faceprint stored in the database
        • a reasonable match would be reported as a possible identification on the output
            screen
        • additional material that may be included but is not necessary: Since facial
            recognition software can be inaccurate the identification could/should be
            checked by a human.

              appropriate ITGS terminology.

            • A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the process used
              by facial recognition software to produce a metric that can be used to accurately

              reference is made to the scenario in the stimulus material. The response may
              only be theoretical and/or a general descriptive.

            • A description or superficial explanation of the process used by facial recognition
              software to produce a metric that can be used to accurately identify an unknown

              face. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the response. The
              description may omit some essential details of the two stages.

            • An explanation of the process used by facial recognition software to produce a
              metric that can be used to accurately identify an unknown face. Explicit and
5–6 marks     relevant references are made to the scenario in the stimulus material. There is
              appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the response. Candidates are likely to
              have addressed both stages in detail.

3.   FaceToFace has told HomeThings that any potentially negative impacts on
     stakeholders arising from the collection and use of the data from the application must
     be minimized. Additionally, before FaceToFace will agree to the implementation of the
     facial recognition application, HomeThings will need to carry out an impact
     assessment.

     Discuss what factors should be considered when policies are developed by
     HomeThings for the management of the data collected by the facial recognition
     application.                                                                                 [8]


     Answers may include:
     Candidates would be expected to describe a range of considerations and discuss their
     appropriateness, based on the potential impacts, and how they would be used in the
     policies to manage the collection and use of the data. This balancing of the nature of
     the data collected, its sensitivity (which seems on the surface to be relatively harmless)
     and the potential ramifications of the data being used inappropriately is likely to move
     the candidate into the higher markbands.

     A candidate who displays lateral thinking is to be given credit. For example, some
     candidates may argue that HomeThings does not hold the data and therefore is not
     responsible for the management of the data but FaceToFace is. Another example of
     lateral thinking would be an argument that some considerations are not important and
     can be ignored.

     Data collected:
     The data collected does not need to be specified in detail, but better responses
     (competent and proficient bands) would have examples appropriate to the scenario,
     most likely taken from or modified from the Case Study or candidates’ own research.
     The type, amount, frequency and sensitivity of the data collected, the storage and use
     (actual or potential) of the data and linking of the data are the source of the negative
     impacts.

     Factors:
     The main considerations (factors) would be those related to the various data privacy
     principles that most countries now use as a basis for their privacy laws.

     Customer considerations:
      • A customer’s legal and ethical privacy rights could be breached with potential
          impacts:
            ◊ customers may not know about the exact data collected
            ◊ customers may not have the option of finding out exactly what is stored
               about them
            ◊ customers may be worried about the use that will be made of the data
            ◊ customers may be worried about the security of the data collected
            ◊ customers who stop going to the store may be worried about the length of
               time the data is kept/if their data can be deleted.
      • in practice the impact may be on a day to day basis:
            ◊ customers may not want intrusive advertising sent to them, or staff
               approaching them by name while browsing the store – they may want to
               remain anonymous or want to be left alone
            ◊ in a large store it is hard to have an opt-in mechanism, so an opt-out
               mechanism would be needed. This could be overlooked by many
               customers leading to other negative impacts
                                             –8–                  M21/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


        ◊   linking of sales to images of customers or customer records could result in
            staff asking how the product is performing next time the customer visits the
            store. Customers may find this intrusive.

Staff considerations:
  • records of staff activities which may be used by HomeThings for surveillance and
      work performance assessment in a negative way – breaching the right to privacy
  • lack of trust of the company impacting on the work environment for staff
  • being watched all the time may mean staff cannot relax and interact normally with
      other staff.

HomeThings considerations:
 • non-compliance with the letter or the spirit of relevant privacy laws, potentially
    leading to a privacy breach with legal consequences and/or negative publicity
 • loss of trust by customers through lack of transparency in response to public
    concern about handling personal information
 • damage to the reputation of HomeThings if it fails to meet expectations about
    how personal information will be protected
 • lack of concern for customers and staff with the absence of identification of
    privacy risks
 • unnecessary costs for remedies when privacy of staff and/or customers has been
    damaged.

Impacts can be real or potential which means they may be generic in nature. Better
responses (competent and proficient bands) would have examples appropriate to the
scenario and their own research. Unrealistic impacts not directly related to the scenario
are to be ignored.

A conclusion based on a discussion of importance would be expected, with reasons to
support such conclusions provided.

Marking Guidelines
Adequate (3-4 marks): candidates will most likely describe factors, with little discussion
on their importance, potential impact or appropriateness

Competent (5-6 marks): candidates will describe the factors and then include some
discussion on their importance, potential impact or appropriateness

Proficient (7-8 marks): candidates would be expected to include a balanced analysis of
the respective importance of the factors. To reach the higher markband, links between
the factors and the management of the data would be expected.

4.   A high school principal has approached Carol about implementing the facial recognition
     application in his school. The school already has security cameras in open areas, the
     cafeteria and the corridors. The proposals to introduce the facial recognition application
     has divided opinion within FaceToFace and the school community.

     Discuss whether FaceToFace’s facial recognition application should be introduced in
     this high school.                                                                            [12]

     Answers may include:
     For the introduction:
       • increased efficiency and effectiveness of the school in roll-marking and the
           running of the cafeteria. Freeing up teacher time to carry out other [less
           mundane] duties
       • the principal may take a utilitarianist approach that although a few students or
           teachers may be disadvantaged, the overall benefits outweigh the concerns
           about monitoring or surveillance
       • may lead to less students being out of lesson as the FR application will be able to
           instantly detect their movement in corridors and if necessary trigger an alert to a
           senior member of staff or assist with discipline in other ways
       • if the FR application is discussed with all stakeholders and introduced with their
           consent it should be seen as a “friend rather than a foe”
       • a positive example of negotiated ethics that satisfies all stakeholders.
       • enhanced security of the school identifying intruders and can be used for
           monitoring and tracing participants if thefts or bullying happen
       • a committee to monitor the use of FR can be set up to handle complaints and
           problems.

     Against the introduction:
      • the technology may not be 100 % reliable so there may be examples of incorrect
          identification of students. Teachers may still be required to spend time on
          investigating false positives etc
      • the position of any existing cameras may lead to the FR application not
          functioning as well as intended
      • will the FR application be cost effective?
      • will teachers use the data collected about students, eg using data from the
          library, cafeteria, that gives the number of hours a student spends there, rather
          than managing them by face-to-face interaction?
      • students and teachers may see this as a form of surveillance, so privacy
          concerns may need to be addressed. Collating the movement of students and
          teachers over time is problematic.
      • as many of the students are under 18 parental consent may be required, how will
          the school deal with parents who do not want to opt in to the new facial
          recognition system?
      • use may grow to active monitoring of the school areas and activities in
          classrooms by a special employer in a room with monitors
      • biometric information cannot be changed – implications if it is compromised
      • concerns if this information is shared eg between schools or with outside
          organisations like the police
      • how rigorous is the ethical and impact analysis carried out by FaceToFace?
      • parents and students would most likely want to be able to check the data
          collected and may even challenge its accuracy
      • the implementation of a committee to monitor its use would be needed which
          could be a problem in itself to setup and operate
      • racial bias – due to bias in algorithms may not work effectively in a multicultural
          environment.

Note to markers: the format of the ethical and impact analysis used by the school is not
specified. The balanced analysis referred to in the markscheme is the student’s own
analysis. The student may refer to different techniques that could be used by the
school, eg negotiations, and others in the case study or from their own research. The
marks for referring to these are applied under this part of the rubric: Explicit references
are made appropriately to the information in the case study and independent research
