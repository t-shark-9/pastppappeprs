Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain why governments provide subsidies.                                        [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of subsidy
                diagram showing the imposition of a subsidy leading to higher producers’
                 revenues (including the subsidy), lower prices and higher level of
                 production/consumption
                explanation that governments provide subsidies to stimulate the production
                 and consumption of merit goods (eg education, healthcare) and to support
                 certain producers/consumers for political reasons
                examples of specific markets where subsidies have been provided in practice.

(b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of price floors in achieving a reduction in the
      consumption of demerit goods.                                                           [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of price floor, demerit goods
       diagram showing the imposition of a price floor, resulting in increased price
        and decreased quantity demanded (consumed)
       explanation that the imposition of a price floor on the market for a demerit
        good would increase the price and reduce the quantity demanded (and
        consumed) of the good, moving consumption of the good closer to the
        socially optimal quantity
       examples of cases where price floors have been imposed to discourage the
        consumption of demerit goods
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include:
       Consideration of the limitations of the policy: unlike indirect taxes, price floors
        do not increase government revenues; may lead to surpluses and attempts by
        the producers to sell the surpluses at a price below the legally set minimum (in
        parallel markets); may increase the producers’ revenues and profits (if the
        demand for the demerit good is inelastic).
       Consideration of the strengths of the policy: the threat of a price floor may
        cause the suppliers to modify the product to reduce the negative externalities;
        price floors may be used in cases where the local government is not legally
        allowed to impose indirect taxes or ban the use of the demerit good. A price
        floor allows government to set the price, a tax might be absorbed by abnormal
        profit-making producers.
       Consideration of the strengths and limitations of alternative policies such as
        indirect taxes and government regulations (restrictions).

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which,
      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Discuss the view that governments should always try to prevent the creation of
      barriers to entry in a market.                                                      [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of barriers to entry, market
       diagram showing a firm that faces a downward-sloping average revenue
        (demand) curve and realizes economic profit
       explanation of barriers to entry and how they permit a firm to achieve
        monopoly power and realize economic profit by restricting competition from
        other firms
       examples of barriers to entry in practice and/or firms that have acquired
        monopoly power because of economies of scale, strong brands or legal
        barriers to entry
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the possible negative effects of barriers to entry on
      allocative and productive efficiency; economies of scale may lead to lower prices
      and higher output, benefitting both producers and consumers; branding reduces
      problems of asymmetric information and may be beneficial to consumers; legal
      barriers to entry may protect consumers (eg licensing) and stimulate R&D (eg
      patents) or lead to inefficiencies and rent-seeking.

      if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        burden, bankruptcies and cyclical unemployment, wealth/income redistribution
        and social tensions, higher savings rate/lower consumption)
       examples of economies that have experienced high inflation rates (eg Weimar
        Republic, Zimbabwe, Venezuela), examples of economies that have
        experienced deflation (eg USA during the Great Depression, Japan),
        examples of specific cases of negative and/or positive consequences
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: in a progressive taxation system the inflation pushes
      individuals and businesses into higher income brackets, leading to higher tax
      revenue for the government and higher tax burden for individuals and
      businesses; the effect of inflation/deflation on groups with fixed incomes versus
      the effect on groups with incomes that change with the price level; the importance
      of the magnitude of price changes (low inflation rates of about 2 % or less may be
      beneficial for the economy); the importance of how prolonged the
      inflation/deflation is, whether the inflation/deflation is anticipated or not
      anticipated, whether the deflation is caused by supply-side or demand-side
      factors, whether the inflation is demand-pull or cost-push (mild demand-pull
      inflation may stimulate employment and economic growth, increase profits); the
      possibility that inflation may get out of control and inflation rates may reach
      astronomical levels.

4.   (a)       Explain how the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient are used to measure
               differences in income inequality between countries.                                 [10]

               Answers may include:
                definitions of income inequality, Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient
                Lorenz curve diagram(s) with one Lorenz curve that is closer to the line of
                 perfect income equality and another Lorenz curve that is further away from the
                 line of perfect income equality
                explanation of why a Lorenz curve closer to the line of perfect income equality
                 (Gini coefficient closer to zero) indicates higher income equality and/or
                 explanation of why a Lorenz curve further away from the line of perfect income
                 equality (Gini coefficient closer to 1) indicates lower income equality
                examples of countries with a relatively equal (eg Sweden, Denmark) and
                 relatively unequal (eg Brazil) distribution of income.

(b)   Discuss the view that taxation is the most effective means of achieving equity in
      the distribution of income.                                                            [15]

      Answers may include:
       definitions of taxation, equity, distribution of income
       diagram(s) showing the Lorenz curve shifting closer to the line of perfect
        income equality and/or the effect of imposing taxes on a market
       explanation of why progressive taxation may increase the income equality in a
        country; explanation of why other government policies may also increase the
        income equality in a country
       examples of progressive taxes in practice, examples of alternative policies that
        will make the distribution of income in a country more equal (eg subsidized
        health care services, subsidized education, subsidized utilities, old age
        pensions, unemployment benefits, child allowances)
       synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of the meaning of the word “equity”; the
      difference between equity in the distribution of income and equality in the
      distribution of income; a consideration of whether it is the most effective means of
      achieving equity; the effect on equity/equality depends on the type of taxation –
      progressive (direct) taxation tends to decrease equality/equity while regressive
      (indirect) taxation may decrease equality/equity; taxation is a major source of
      government revenue; taxation may be used to discourage the consumption and
      production of goods with negative externalities; too much taxation may
      discourage hard work and entrepreneurship; government expenditures on human
      and physical capital formation may have positive effects on economic growth in
      the long run; transfer payments may improve the quantity and quality of human
      capital but may also decrease the incentives to look for employment and to work
      hard or study; government expenditures and transfer payments may lead to
      budget deficits and high levels of indebtedness.
