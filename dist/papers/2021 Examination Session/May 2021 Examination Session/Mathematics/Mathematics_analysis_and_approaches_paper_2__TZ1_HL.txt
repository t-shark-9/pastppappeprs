Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be
supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

                                               Section A

Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided. Working may be

     Two boats A and B travel due north.

     Initially, boat B is positioned 50 metres due east of boat A.

     The distances travelled by boat A and boat B, after t seconds, are x metres and y metres
     respectively. The angle θ is the radian measure of the bearing of boat B from boat A.
     This information is shown on the following diagram.
