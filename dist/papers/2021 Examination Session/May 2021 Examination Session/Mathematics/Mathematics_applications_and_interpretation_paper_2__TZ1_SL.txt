Answer all questions in the answer booklet provided. Please start each question on a new page.
Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should
be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch
these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct
method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to show all working.

1.   [Maximum mark: 18]
     As part of his mathematics exploration about classic books, Jason investigated the time taken
     by students in his school to read the book The Old Man and the Sea. He collected his data by
     stopping and asking students in the school corridor, until he reached his target of 10 students
     from each of the literature classes in his school.
     (a)                    State which of the two sampling methods, systematic or quota, Jason has used.           [1]
     Jason constructed the following box and whisker diagram to show the number of hours
     students in the sample took to read this book.

     (b)                    Write down the median time to read the book.                                            [1]
     (c)                    Calculate the interquartile range.                                                      [2]
     Mackenzie, a member of the sample, took 25 hours to read the novel. Jason believes
     Mackenzie’s time is not an outlier.
     (d)                    Determine whether Jason is correct. Support your reasoning.                             [4]
     For each student interviewed, Jason recorded the time taken to read The Old Man and the
     Sea ( x ), measured in hours, and paired this with their percentage score on the final exam ( y ).
     These data are represented on the scatter diagram.

     (e)                    Describe the correlation.                                                               [1]

(Question 1 continued)

     Jason correctly calculates the equation of the regression line y on x for these students to be

                                                   y = -1.54x + 98.8 .
     He uses the equation to estimate the percentage score on the final exam for a student who
     read the book in 1.5 hours.

     (f)   Find the percentage score calculated by Jason.                                                        [2]

     (g)   State whether it is valid to use the regression line y on x for Jason’s estimate. Give a
           reason for your answer.                                                                               [2]

     Jason found a website that rated the ‘top 50’ classic books. He randomly chose eight of these
     classic books and recorded the number of pages. For example, Book H is rated 44th and has
     281 pages. These data are shown in the table.

     Daisy invested 37 000 Australian dollars (AUD) in a fixed deposit account with an annual
     interest rate of 6.4 % compounded quarterly.

     (a)   Calculate the value of Daisy’s investment after 2 years.                                    [3]

     After m months, the amount of money in the fixed deposit account has appreciated to more
     than 50 000 AUD.

     (b)   Find the minimum value of m , where mℕ .                                                   [4]

     Daisy is saving to purchase a new apartment. The price of the apartment is 200 000 AUD.

     Daisy makes an initial payment of 25 % and takes out a loan to pay the rest.

     (c)   Write down the amount of the loan.                                                          [1]

     The loan is for 10 years, compounded monthly, with equal monthly payments of 1700 AUD
     made by Daisy at the end of each month.

     (d)   For this loan, find

           (i)    the amount of interest paid by Daisy.

           (ii)   the annual interest rate of the loan.                                                [5]

     After 5 years of paying off this loan, Daisy decides to pay the remainder in one final payment.

     (e)   Find the amount of Daisy’s final payment.                                                   [3]

     (f)   Find how much money Daisy saved by making one final payment after 5 years.                  [3]

     The stopping distances for bicycles travelling at ​20 km ​h​-1​are assumed to follow a normal
     distribution with mean 6.76 m and standard deviation 0.12 m.

     (a)   Under this assumption, find, correct to four decimal places, the probability that a bicycle
           chosen at random travelling at ​20 km ​h​-1​manages to stop

           (i)    in less than 6.5 m.

           (ii)   in more than 7 m.[3]

     1000 randomly selected bicycles are tested and their stopping distances when travelling
     at 2
        ​ 0 km ​h​-1​are measured.

     (b)   Find, correct to four significant figures, the expected number of bicycles tested that
           stop between

           (i)    6.5 m and 6.75 m.

           (ii)   6.75 m and 7 m.[3]

     The measured stopping distances of the 1000 bicycles are given in the table.

                          Measured stopping distance          Number of bicycles

                          Less than 6.5 m                                12
                          Between 6.5 m and 6.75 m                      428

     It is decided to perform a  ​χ​2​goodness of fit test at the 5 % level of significance to decide
     whether the stopping distances of bicycles travelling at ​20 km ​h​-1​can be modelled by a
     normal distribution with mean 6.76 m and standard deviation 0.12 m.

     (c)   State the null and alternative hypotheses.                                                          [2]
