      The acceleration, a ms-2 , of a particle moving in a horizontal line at time t seconds, t ≥ 0 , is
      given by a = - (1+v) where v ms-1 is the particle’s velocity and v > -1.

      At t = 0 , the particle is at a fixed origin O and has initial velocity v0 ms-1 .

      (a)   By solving an appropriate differential equation, show that the particle’s velocity at time t
            is given by v ( t ) = (1 + v0) e-t - 1 .[6]

      (b)   Initially at O, the particle moves in the positive direction until it reaches its maximum
            displacement from O. The particle then returns to O.

            Let s metres represent the particle’s displacement from O and smax its maximum
            displacement from O.

            (i)    Show that the time T taken for the particle to reach smax satisfies the
                   equation eT = 1 + v0 .

            (ii)   By solving an appropriate differential equation and using the result from part
                   (b) (i), find an expression for smax in terms of v0 .                                       [7]

      Let v (T - k) represent the particle’s velocity k seconds before it reaches smax , where

                                          v (T - k) = (1 + v0) e-(T - k) - 1 .

      (c)   By using the result to part (b) (i), show that v (T - k) = ek - 1 .[2]

      Similarly, let v (T + k) represent the particle’s velocity k seconds after it reaches smax .

      (d)   Deduce a similar expression for v (T + k) in terms of k .                                          [2]

      (e)   Hence, show that v (T - k) + v (T + k) ≥ 0 .[3]
