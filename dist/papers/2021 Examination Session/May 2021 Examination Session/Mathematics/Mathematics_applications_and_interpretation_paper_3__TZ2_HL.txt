     Juliet is a sociologist who wants to investigate if income affects happiness amongst
     doctors. This question asks you to review Juliet’s methods and conclusions.

     Juliet obtained a list of email addresses of doctors who work in her city. She contacted them
     and asked them to fill in an anonymous questionnaire. Participants were asked to state their
     annual income and to respond to a set of questions. The responses were used to determine
     a happiness score out of 100. Of the 415 doctors on the list, 11 replied.

     (a)   (i)	Describe one way in which Juliet could improve the reliability of her investigation.      [1]

           (ii)   Describe one criticism that can be made about the validity of Juliet’s investigation.   [1]

     Juliet’s results are summarized in the following table.

     (b)   Juliet classifies response K as an outlier and removes it from the data. Suggest one
           possible justification for her decision to remove it.                                          [1]

(Question 1 continued)

     (c)   For the remaining ten responses in the table, Juliet calculates the mean happiness
           score to be 52.5.

           (i)     Calculate the mean annual income for these remaining responses.                          [2]

           (ii)    Determine the value of r , Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient,
                   for these remaining responses.                                                           [2]

     Juliet decides to carry out a hypothesis test on the correlation coefficient to investigate
     whether increased annual income is associated with greater happiness.

     (d)   (i)	State why the hypothesis test should be one-tailed.                                         [1]

           (ii)    State the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.                                 [2]

           The critical value for this test, at the 5 % significance level, is 0.549. Juliet assumes that
           the population is bivariate normal.

           (iii)   Determine whether there is significant evidence of a positive correlation between
                   annual income and happiness. Justify your answer.                                        [2]

(Question 1 continued)

     (e)   Juliet wants to create a model to predict how changing annual income might affect
           happiness scores. To do this, she assumes that annual income in dollars, X , is the
           independent variable and the happiness score, Y , is the dependent variable.

           She first considers a linear model of the form

                                                  Y
                                                  ​ = aX + b​  .

           (i)     Use Juliet’s data to find the value of a and of b .[1]

           (ii)    Interpret, referring to income and happiness, what the value of a represents.           [1]

           Juliet then considers a quadratic model of the form

                                              ​ = c​X​​  2​  + dX + e​  .
                                              Y

           (iii)   Find the value of c , of d and of e .[1]

           (iv)    Find the coefficient of determination for each of the two models she considers.         [2]

           (v)     Hence compare the two models.                                                           [1]

           Juliet decides to use the coefficient of determination to choose between these
           two models.

           (vi)    Comment on the validity of her decision.                                                [1]

           After presenting the results of her investigation, a colleague questions whether Juliet’s
           sample is representative of all doctors in the city.

           A report states that the mean annual income of doctors in the city is $80 000. Juliet
           decides to carry out a test to determine whether her sample could realistically be
           taken from a population with a mean of $80 000.

     (f)   (i)	State the name of the test which Juliet should use.                                        [1]

           (ii)    State the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.                                [1]

           (iii)   Perform the test, using a 5 % significance level, and state your conclusion
                   in context.                                                                             [3]

2.   [Maximum mark: 31]

     Alessia is an ecologist working for Mediterranean fishing authorities. She is interested in
     whether the mackerel population density is likely to fall below 5000 mackerel per km3, as
     this is the minimum value required for sustainable fishing. She believes that the primary
     factor affecting the mackerel population is the interaction of mackerel with sharks, their
     main predator.

     The population densities of mackerel ( M thousands per km3) and sharks ( S per km3) in the
     Mediterranean Sea are modelled by the coupled differential equations:

                                                ​​ 
                                                      dM
                                                      ___
                                                              ​= αM − βMS​
                                                      dt
                                                      dS
                                                      ___
                                                      ​​       ​ = γMS − δS​
                                                            dt
     where t is measured in years, and α , β , γ and δ are parameters.

     This model assumes that no other factors affect the mackerel or shark population densities.

     The term αM models the population growth rate of the mackerel in the absence of sharks.
     The term βMS models the death rate of the mackerel due to being eaten by sharks.

     (a)   Suggest similar interpretations for the following terms.

           (i)    γMS[1]

           (ii)   δS[1]

           Use the model to predict how the following events would affect the average value of M .
           Justify your answers.

           (i)    Toxic sewage is added to the Mediterranean Sea. Alessia claims this reduces
                  the shark population growth rate and hence the value of γ is halved. No other
                  parameter changes.                                                                                       [2]

           (ii)   Global warming increases the temperature of the Mediterranean Sea. Alessia
                  claims that this promotes the mackerel population growth rate and hence the
                  value of α is doubled. No other parameter changes.                                                       [2]

                                                               –7–                                             2221 – 7213


(Question 2 continued)

      (d)     To estimate the value of α , Alessia considers a situation where there are no sharks and
              the initial mackerel population density is  ​M0​​  .

              (i)     Write down the differential equation for M that models this situation.                          [1]

              (ii)    Show that the expression for the mackerel population density after t years
                      is  ​M = ​M0​​e​αt​  .                                                                          [4]

              (iii)   Alessia estimates that the mackerel population density increases by a factor of
                      three every two years. Show that  ​α = 0.549​  to three significant figures.                    [3]

      Based on additional observations, it is believed that

                                                            α = 0.549 ,

                                                            β = 0.236 ,

                                                            γ = 0.244 ,

                                                            δ = 1.39.

      Alessia decides to use Euler’s method to estimate future mackerel and shark population
      densities. The initial population densities are estimated to be  ​M0​​= 5.7​  and ​S0​​= 2​.
      She uses a step length of 0.1 years.

      (e)     (i)	Write down expressions for  ​Mn​ + 1​  and  ​Sn​ + 1​  in terms of  ​Mn​​  and  ​Sn​​  .           [3]

              (ii)    Use Euler’s method to find an estimate for the mackerel population density
                      after one year.                                                                                 [2]

      (f)     Alessia will use her model to estimate whether the mackerel population density is
              likely to fall below the minimum value required for sustainable fishing, 5000 per km3,
              during the first nine years.

              (i)     Use Euler’s method to sketch the trajectory of the phase portrait, for  ​4 ≤ M ≤ 7​ 
                      and  ​1.5 ≤ S ≤ 3​ , over the first nine years.                                                 [3]

              (ii)    Using your phase portrait, or otherwise, determine whether the mackerel population
                      density would be sufficient to support sustainable fishing during the first nine years. [2]

              (iii)   State two reasons why Alessia’s conclusion, found in part (f)(ii), might not be valid. [2]
