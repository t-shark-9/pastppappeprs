Questions 36 – 40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Lego® is an extremely popular children’s construction toy and a design classic based on interlocking
bricks (Figure 8). Lego pieces are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and produced by
injection moulding to precise sizes. Lego offers a wide range of products based on themes, for example,
space, robots and pirates (Figure 9). New Lego products take around twelve months to develop in three
stages: first, identifying market trends through designers going to toyshops and interviewing children;
second, designing and developing the new product using 3D modelling software to generate CAD drawings
from initial design sketches and third, prototyping using stereolithography. Prototypes are evaluated by
the design team and in focus groups with parents and children.   Designs are modified in line with the
feedback obtained.

6.   The C SEED 201, shown in Figure 9, is an outdoor TV (television) by Porsche Design Studio.
     When the TV is not being watched, it is stored underground in a waterproof shaft.
     The touch of a button on the TV’s remote control opens the lid of the storage shaft.
     A pillar-shaped support column then rises to as high as 4.6 metres. Once the stand reaches
     its set height, seven large screen panels unfold to form the 201-inch TV, in less than a
     minute, as shown in Figure 10.

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand
      side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
      comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
      question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted
      the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question. Scoris™
      will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line with
      the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
      stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her
      work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an option. Scoris™ will
      apply “NR” once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
      correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
      box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:            Design Technology HL and SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total [30 marks]) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

           and [1] for each of two distinct correct points in an explanation [3 max].
           advertising space no longer needs to be flat;
           screens can go round uneven surfaces eg poles, columns;
           increasing opportunities/advertising space;                                              [3]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of two ways in
           which smart phones can utilize a flexible screen. [3 max per way, 6 max].
           curved displays;
           screens can curve on the sides/back of a rectangular smart phone;
           or take a totally different shape by wrapping around arms and wrists eg wrist
           phones;

           compact sizes;
           screens can be bent/rolled;
           to reduce the size of smart phones when not in use;                                      [6]

     (d)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how
           relative advantage, trialability and observability impact on the rate of consumer
           adoption of flexible screen based smart phones [3 max per aspect, 9 max].
           relative advantage:
           adoption rates are affected by the degree to which consumers perceive the
           attributes of flexible screen based smart phone as better than the phones
           they supersede;
           the main attribute of such phones is flexibility;
           the more consumers who view this as a positive attribute the higher the rate
           of adoption;

           trialability:
           A flexible screen based smart phone that is trialable prior to purchase represents
           less uncertainty/risk to consumers;
           gives them more confidence to adopt the new phone;
           limited base trials of such smart phones may be provided via marketing/promotion
           campaigns;

           observability:
           The more the advantages/positive effects of flexible screen based smart phones
           are visible to consumers the more quickly they will spread;
           smart phones are highly visible products;
           and may be observed in a number of different situations eg when socializing,
           through advertising and innovative marketing campaigns;                                  [9]

6.   (a)   Award [1] for each point in an outline of why the C SEED 201 TV is a
           combination of both radical and incremental design [2 max].
           the way it is stored and opened is a radical approach;
           but it is an incremental development of existing TV screens;                           [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for stating the innovation strategy behind the C SEED 201 name and
           [1] for each of two distinct correct points in an explanation [3 max].
           analogy;
           eyes see images on TV thus the letter “C”;
           the TV rises from its shaft and unfolds like a seed grows into a tree/plant;           [3]

     (c)   Award [1] for stating each of two ways virtual prototypes assist the design
           development of this TV and [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of each
           way [3 max per way, 6 max].
           virtual prototypes may be used for FEA testing;
           FEA shows how the support column, panels and screen behave under different
           stresses;
           to modify critical high stress areas eg when the column is rising, panels are
           unfolding and when the screen is fully open;

           virtual prototypes provide a realistic simulation;
           to communicate how the TV rises and unfolds clearly;
           and allow for different types of feedback/evaluation;                                  [6]

     (d)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of how safety,
           convenience and technology specification may have influenced the design of this
           TV [max 3 per aspect, 9 max].
           safety:
           pillar should not rise if there is something on top of the storage shaft;
           screen should automatically fold in adverse weather conditions eg strong winds
           and high temperature;
           remote control should be equipped with a safety lock for activating the storage
           shaft;
           column and screen structure must be stable;

           technology:
           high screen resolution to ensure perfect pictures even on bright days;
           distortion free sound in different weather conditions;
           fold/unfold screen mechanism;
           raising and lowering the column;
           waterproof storage shaft;

           convenience:
           TV is stored out of sight until needed;
           short time to raise, unfold/fold and lower the TV;
           screen should rotate sideways;
           column height should adjust to raise and lower the screen as needed;               [9 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in a discussion of the relationship
           between form and function to the design of the opening for hands in the jet air
           hand dryer [3 max].
           the opening is tilted outward and rounded for easy entry of hands;
           the length of opening allows both hands to fit in side by side;
           the width of opening is enough for a wide variety of hand thicknesses;
           the channel in which hands are placed in is deep enough to take the 95th percentile
           of hand length;                                                                        [3 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for stating each of two issues why the cotton towel hand dryer is not
           suitable for large-scale use and [1] for each of two distinct points of discussion
           per issue [3 max per issue, 6 max].
           size of towel roll;
           limits the available amount of clean towels;
           allowing less users to dry their hands because of hygiene issues;

           laundry;
           cotton towels must be periodically changed and washed;
           leading to higher consumption of valuable resources eg water and energy;                   [6]

     (d)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in a comparison of paper towels and
           warm air hand dryers in relation to convenience, sustainability and hygiene
           [3 max per aspect, 9 max].
           convenience:
           paper towels may be used to dry hands outside restrooms;
           paper towels are not noisy;
           paper towels are more convenient when drying other body parts eg face;
           hands may not be dry enough within the automatic time limit of warm air hand dryers;

           sustainability :
           warm air hand dryers save trees;
           paper towels create waste unless recycled;
           paper towels require packaging, waste/trash bins and bin liners;
           paper towels can be made from recycled materials;
           warm air hand dryers consume energy;

           hygiene:
           some warm air hand dryers require users to push a button which may expose them
           to germs;
           air blowing on hands may blow away bacteria on others in the restroom;
           used paper towels pile up in waste/trash bins inside restrooms;                        [9 max]

                                  Section B: Case Study

Royal Philips Electronics is a major global manufacturer of lighting, electronics, electrical
and medical equipment. Philips has included sustainability as an integral part of its corporate
strategy since 2002. In its Sustainability Report (2005) the company states that sustainable
development is a priority for the board of management based on the “triple bottom line”
of economic, social and environmental responsibilities. The Sustainability Report states
that socially and environmentally responsible behaviour contributes to sustained profitable
growth which is why sustainable thinking and acting is embedded in all the daily activities of
the company.

Philips is also committed to supporting social and community activities across the globe.
For example, in 2012 Philips and the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) established a three
year partnership built around the creation of 90 solar community light centers across the
African and South American continents. The light centers are approximately 1000 m2 and lit by
highly-efficient solar-powered LED lighting. They provide an area of light for rural communities
without electricity so creating opportunities for social, sporting and economic activities in the
evening (Figure 4).

Philips adopted a systematic strategy to take into account environmental issues in 1994 starting
with a green design approach which has developed into sustainable design and sustainable
innovation polices. The policies encompass setting targets for its different product divisions
although it is not expected that each division will meet targets at the same rate. This is in
recognition that the targets are more difficult to achieve for some divisions than others and may
be dependent on the products and services provided. The design teams in each division are
expected to take into account the green focus areas of: weight; hazardous substances; energy
consumption; recycling; disposal and packaging, with improvement to be made in at least two
of these green focus areas.

     As part of its sustainability vision, Philips sees the markets of the developing world as both an
     economic opportunity and a way to meet its social and environmental responsibilities. To do
     this Philips asked its employees to come up with innovative business ideas that address the needs
     of the poor which involve partnerships between local Philips businesses and other organizations
     based on innovation in products and services. An example is the SimplyHealthy@Schools
     project which is a global community programme established by Philips to help underprivileged
     school children live healthier lives. Employees of the company engage children in the “Healthy
     Heroes Toolkit” which shows them how they can improve their health. In 2012 Philips
     employees travelled to over 100 schools in 37 countries to support this project.

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
      right-hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
      comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
      question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted
      the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question. Scoris™
      will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.    If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line with
      the rubric.

8.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
      stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her
      work.

9.    There is no need to stamp an annotation when a candidate has not chosen an option. Scoris™ will
      apply “NR” once you click complete.

10.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
      correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
      box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:              Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Maximum total = [40 marks]


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

     (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an outline of how the pricing strategy
           shown in Figure 1 is influenced by production costs [2 max].
           account needs to be taken of the variation in costs of production at different levels
           of sales;
           break-even point for each level of sales needs to be calculated in order to choose
           the price which will provide the greatest profit;                                       [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an outline of cost-plus pricing
           [2 max].
           estimating the average cost of producing and marketing a product;
           then adding a mark-up to make a profit;                                                 [2]

     (d)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how Kaizen helps to
           improve the efficiency of the production process [4 max].
           Kaizen focuses on continuous improvement of the production process;
           it involves all employees and the supply chain;
           by improving efficiency it aims to reduce waste;
           so is complementary to a philosophy of lean production;                                 [4]

2.   (a)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a description of the function of a usability
           laboratory in assisting with the design development of the microwave oven in
           Figure 2 [2 max].
           to observe/test users carrying out pre-determined tasks with the oven;
           to provide data/research into how users interact with the oven which can underpin
           design ideas;                                                                                [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an outline of how empathic design
           may help with the design of the microwave oven in Figure 3 [2 max].
           the designers can be in contact/empathize with potential users of the oven;
           in order to gain a better understanding of the users’ thoughts/needs/values/beliefs;         [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of how the requirements of the
           market sectors for each of the microwave ovens shown in Figures 2 and 3 impact
           on the design of each oven [3 max per market sector, 6 max].
           commercial oven:
           durability important as it will be used many times a day/stainless steel body for
           durability;
           it must be easy to clean as it is likely to be used by different users in one location
           who may be busy/rushed causing many food spills;
           the oven has a large grab handle which will be easy to grip even with wet hands;
           the controls are large and simple to interpret/use;
           aesthetics are less important than function;

           domestic oven:
           aesthetics important so it looks good in the kitchen;
           white colour so it fits in with other white goods in the kitchen;
           small push-button controls which are delicate to use/small number of users will
           learn the functions;
           integrated push button door control which lies flush with the surface/integrated
           design;
           child lock feature for safety for families with small children;
           multi-function use so suitable for small kitchens/people who do not cook often/
           do not cook large meals;                                                                 [6 max]

                                        SECTION B

3.   (a)   Award [1] for each of three correct distinct points in an outline of the influence of
           timescale on Philips’ strategy to move from a green design approach to a
           sustainable design approach [3 max].
           sustainable design takes longer to implement than green design;
           as it focuses on all aspects of the design cycle;
           rather than just one green focus area;                                                  [3]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three correct distinct points in an outline of why Philips’s
           corporate strategy for triple bottom line sustainability is a top-down approach
           [3 max].
           the corporate strategy was decided by executives/Board of Management as the
           way forward for the company;
           targets have been imposed on each division of the company in line with this
           strategy;
           although employees are given the opportunity to contribute to the strategy with
           ideas they do not have a choice to ignore it;                                           [3]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of five correct distinct points in an explanation of how Philips
           promotes ethical consumerism [5 max].
           Philips has a responsibility to shareholders to make a profit but strategies for
           innovation also focus on improving the lives of poor people in developing
           countries;
           who do not have the income/resources to be consumers of Philips products;
           Philips sustainability strategy is embedded in the design brief for all products;
           so it promotes ethical consumerism across the total customer base;
           even if customers do not care about sustainability issues;                              [5]

(d)   Award [1] per distinct point in a discussion of three issues which Philips is likely
      to have considered when incorporating sustainable design and sustainable
      innovation into their corporate strategy [3 max per issue, 9 max].
      resistance from employees;
      who do not fully understand the concepts/are reluctant to embrace the concepts;
      and resent the targets set for sustainability;

      complexity of products;
      Philips designs and manufactures a wide range/diverse range of products;
      some of which are more suitable for redesign taking into account sustainability
      factors than others;

      consumer reaction;
      many consumers will not be aware/are not interested in sustainability issues;
      they just want value for money in a competitive market;
      Philips has to incorporate its sustainability strategy without pricing itself out of its
      traditional markets;

      reaction of shareholders;
      Philips is a global company with a diverse shareholder base;
      shareholders may not share the vision of the board of management;
      especially if profits suffer because of it;

      changing political/economic climates;
      governments/organizations can change policy/legislation relating to sustainability;
      and it may be difficult for Philips to adapt its strategy to satisfy new
      targets/legislation;

      pioneering strategy to sustainability by Phillips;
      but other companies may imitate their sustainable products without having to
      spend much money on R&D;
      meaning that they can sell similar products more cheaply;

      difficulty of choosing which community projects to support;
      there are so many worthy projects worldwide that Philips can only support a small
      percentage of them;
      there is a possibility of alienating some market sectors by failing to support
      projects within the sector which have been presented to the company;                       [9 max]
