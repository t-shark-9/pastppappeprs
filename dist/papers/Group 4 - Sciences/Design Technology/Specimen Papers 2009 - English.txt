Questions 36-40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer the
questions.

CASE STUDY

Passive solar design is widely used to reduce energy costs and make buildings more comfortable. In some
countries heating is the primary concern, in others cooling is more of a problem. A designer working on
a single-storey house located at 56º N has done an Internet search and found that the angle of the sun at
midday in midsummer is 58º and in midwinter is 11º. She has drawn Figure 6 to help calculate the width
of the roof overhang required to shade the house in summer. In the winter the window should not be shaded
by other buildings or trees from 9 am to 3 pm each day to allow the sun to shine into the house. Sunlight hits
the floor and is absorbed as heat.  The heat is stored by the thermal mass below the floor during the day
and released as it cools in the evening. Thus the thermal mass moderates the effects of high daytime
temperatures. Distribution of the solar heat through the building is by natural heat transfer (conduction,
convection, and radiation). Figure 7 shows a plan of the building in its grounds. The designer needs to
select landscaping plants for locations P, Q, R and S.

1.   Figure 1 shows the Playstation 3 games console manufactured by Sony and launched onto
     the market in the USA and Japan in November 2006. It will eventually be available in the
     global marketplace. The Playstation incorporates Blu-ray technology which allows the console
     to also be used to play high definition DVDs. Figure 2 shows a table of suppliers of components
     for the Playstation by country. Figure 3 shows a table of recommended retail prices (prices that
     the Playstation should be sold at) by geographical region.

8.   Figure 5 shows a CAD model of a concept design for a new passenger aircraft. By changing the
     body shape and using lightweight materials it is projected that the “blended wing plane” would
     consume 32 % less fuel per passenger mile than conventional planes helping the European
     airline industry achieve its target of 50 % reduction in emissions per passenger kilometer by
     the year 2020. Cleaner, more efficient engines should be able to produce 20 % reduction in
     emissions by 2020.

                  USA has a large manufacturing base;
                       which means it has the capacity to easily manufacture new
                       components and to distribute them efficiently;
                  USA produces its own electronic products;
                       so has the expertise and manufacturing capability to produce the
                       components;
                  Japan and the USA may have a trade agreement in place;
                       which means that production of components in the USA is
                       economically competitive with producing them elsewhere including
                       in Japan;
                  the USA may be already producing the same or similar components;
                       which means that it is both economically viable and efficient/reliable
                        to maintain the agreement;                                               [2 max]

                        as consumers become increasingly aware of green issues;
                        and demand more environmentally friendly products;
                  company policy;
                        as companies become aware of the effect of planned obsolescence
                        on the environment;
                        and wish to minimise the effect;
                  legislation;
                        which may force companies to take responsibility for the impact of
                        their products on the environment;
                        which will be more expensive for companies;                              [3 max]

                  USA and Japan are both big markets for electronic products;
                  so it would be good to sell initially in such markets;
                  and would give a good indication of the potential success of the product for
                  other markets;
                  it’s cheaper to initially target fewer markets;
                  as advertising can be targeted;
                  and variable costs controlled;                                                 [3 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] per distinct point in a suitable explanation similar to:
             the range of materials will have different U values;
             the timber is available in different thicknesses and the cross-section of the
             timber affects the calculation of the U value;
             as does surface area;                                                           [3 max]

(d)   Award [1] per distinct point in a suitable explanation [3 max] for each aspect:
      tensile strength:
            the wooden floor is laid on top of concrete;
            so does not have to take the load of people and objects;
            but the floor will not break easily;
            the structure of the laminate is very strong;
            because of the grain pattern of each layer;
            and the glue;

      toughness:
           wood is very tough;
           the floor should not crack easily;
           the grain pattern of each layer will help stop cracks propagating;

      hardness:
           timber is not very hard;
           scratches will happen easily;
           the surface veneer will wear away to reveal the core of the lamination;
           which will be unsightly;
           the surface needs a protective finish;
           and should be maintained regularly;                                               [9 max]

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. Body mass index, BMI, is generated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by height in
    metres squared. A BMI of 20-25 is considered normal, one of >25 is considered overweight
    bringing risk of increased mortality and one of >30 is considered obese bringing risk of significantly
    increased mortality through a range of conditions including diabetes, heart conditions, cancer
    and high blood pressure. Figure A1 graphically illustrates underweight (BMI<20 in blue),
    normal (BMI 20-25 in white) and overweight (BMI >25 in red) weight for height data.

Option B — Electronic product design
B1. Frequency division multiplexing (see Figure B1) is widely used in modern
    communications systems. Consider a communication link with a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The
    link provider divides the available bandwidth into smaller bandwidths and allocates them to
    individual users who can then simultaneously use the communication link. The size of the
    bandwidth needed depends on the application - typical bandwidths for various applications are
    shown in Table B1.

B3. Safety is a key aspect for public transport systems, e.g. it is critically important that doors on
    a train are only allowed to open under clearly prescribed conditions. Three conditions are
    required for a door to open on any particular carriage of the train, as follows:

      A.    The train is stopped in the station;
      B.    The driver has signalled the “all clear”;
      C.    A passenger in the carriage has pressed a door release button.

      (a)   Complete the truth table shown in Table B2 to show the behaviour of the logic gate
            required to ensure that the door opens appropriately.

Option D — Textiles

D1. Prior to the middle of the 18th Century the British textile industry was a craft industry.
    Families worked together at home to clean, comb, spin, dye and weave wool into cloth – a very
    slow process. During the 18th Century demand for textile, especially cotton, products increased.
    A series of important inventions (see Figure D1) relating to various aspects of the spinning
    (shown in blue) and weaving (shown in red) processes transformed the British textile industry.

     The Flying Shuttle allowed wider cloth to be produced more quickly. The Spinning Jenny
     allowed more threads of cotton to be spun simultaneously. Both the Flying Shuttle and the
     Spinning Jenny were small enough to be used in cottages. However, the Water Frame was
     powered by a watermill – it was too large for a cottage and too expensive for an individual
     family and forced spinning into factories. When the Power Loom was adopted weaving too
     shifted from cottages to factories.



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

D3. Clothing labels use a simple system of internationally-recognisable symbols to communicate care
    instructions to consumers. These symbols relate to washing, bleaching, drying, ironing and dry
    cleaning (see Figure D2). These are combined with modifiers (dots and bars). Dots indicate the
    temperature – one dot means cool/low temperature, two dots means warm/medium temperature
    and three dots mean hot/high temperature. Bars indicate more gentle treatment requirements
    – one bar means permanent press cycle and two bars means gentle/delicate cycle. A cross over
    a symbol means “Do not”, e.g. “Do not bleach” or “Do not iron” (see Figure D3).

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for the correct calculation and answer.
           Note: no units are required as the answer is a ratio, so do not subtract [1] for
           missing units.
           BMI = weight in kg/(height in m2) = 90/1.70 × 1.70 = 31.14;                            [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for stating that the man does not know if he’s obese from Figure 1 (a).
           calculating BMI gives the answer 31.14 which makes the man obese;
           using Figure 1 (a) he is overweight and so loses the additional information that he
           is at significant increased risk of mortality, i.e. in a more serious condition;       [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how overweight and obesity
           are caused.
           overweight and obesity have a strong familial component;
           however energy intake and levels of physical activity are important;
           low levels of physical activity coupled with high levels of energy intake are likely
           to lead to an increased BMI;
           the issue of obesity and overweight can be addressed by increasing physical
           activity and/or reducing energy intake;                                                [3 max]



A2. (a)    Award [1] for a definition of poverty to the effect of:
           deprivation of essential goods and services e.g. food, clothing, shelter, education
           and a lack of sufficient income and wealth;                                            [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two factors that are incorporated into the human
           development, which is used as a holistic measure of poverty at a country level.
           life expectancy;
           knowledge/education;
           a decent standard of living;                                                    [2 marks]



A3. (a)    Award [1] for correct method of calculation plus [1] for the correct answer
           including units.
           10 g (total fat) – 3 g (saturated fat) = 7 g (unsaturated fat);
           (7 × 100)/28.3 = 24.7 g/100 g;                                                         [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a brief explanation of why the amounts of
           saturated and trans fats and cholesterol are identified amongst the
           Nutrition Facts on a packet of potato crisps (chips).
           saturated fats, trans fats and cholesterol are considered bad for health;
           people who are being careful about their diet would want to know how much of
           each component is present so that they can decide whether to purchase/eat the
           product;                                                                               [2 max]

A4. Award [1] for identifying a particular nutritional issue and [1] for each additional point
    in an explanation of how health awareness affects food choice with reference to that
    issue, [3 max] for each issue.
    fat quality and quantity;
    choose a diet low in fat;
    fat provides twice as many calories as the equivalent amount of carbohydrate or protein;
    high fat intake can lead to overweight and obesity;

     choose a diet low in saturated fat/trans fat/dietary cholesterol;
     consumption of saturated fat, trans fat, and dietary cholesterol raises low-density
     lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad cholesterol,” levels, which increases the risk of coronary
     heart disease (CHD);

     saturated fat (from meat, milk and milk products) raises blood cholesterol more than
     other forms of fat;

     reducing saturated fat to less than 10 % of calories will help lower blood cholesterol
     levels;

     replace total/saturated fat by eating more unsaturated/polyunsaturated fat;
     unsaturated fats reduce blood cholesterol when they replace saturated fats in the diet;

     choose a diet low in trans fats;
     partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as those used in many margarines and
     shortenings, contain a form of unsaturated fat known as trans-fatty acids that may raise
     blood cholesterol levels, although not as much as saturated fat;

     choose a diet low in cholesterol;
     the body makes all the cholesterol it needs;
     dietary cholesterol comes from animal sources such as egg yolks, meat (especially
     organ meats such as liver), poultry, fish, and higher fat milk products;
     eat more grain products, vegetables and fruits and by limiting intake of high cholesterol
     foods;

     Fibre intake;
     fibre is good for the health of the gut;
     eating a high fibre diet appears to reduce the risk of developing various conditions,
     including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation;
     low fibre content foods, e.g. refined foods such as white bread, white rice, refined
     cereals (corn flakes, Cheerios), white spaghetti and sugar should be replaced with higher
     fibre alternatives;

     Sugar intake;
     medical experts agree that people should get no more than 10 % of their calories from
     sugar;
     higher intakes of sugar can lead to overweight, obesity and a range of obesity-linked
     diseases;

    Salt intake;
    high salt consumption can contribute to high blood pressure for people who have been
    diagnosed with hypertension, high blood pressure can lead to heart disease and stroke;
    recommended salt intake in UK is 6 g, a salt intake of about 6 g is considered
    sensible medical advice;                                                                  [6 max]



A5. (a)   Award [1] for each of two factors underpinning the genetic modification of foods.
          enhanced yield;
          improved resistance to attack by pathogens;
          enhances storage characteristics;
          enhanced eating quality;
          production/removal of particular biochemicals from a food product;                  [2 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for identifying an advantage of FlavrSavr™ tomatoes over
          traditionally grown tomatoes and [1] for a brief explanation.
          traditional tomatoes have to be harvested green so they stay firm on trip to
          supermarket;
          FlavrSavr™ tomatoes have a firmer skin and so can be left to ripen on the vine so
          producing a fuller-flavoured tomato;                                                [2 max]

    (c)   Award [1] for identifying why it is important that new food products are
          considered acceptable by the general public and [1] for a brief explanation.
          products must have a market to remain viable;
          food choice is determined by habit and culture and people are wary of new food products
          especially ones where scientists have interfered with nature;
          it takes time to establish a product in the market place and growth in the market
          must be rapid enough to maintain commercial viability;                              [2 max]

A6. (a)    Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how one lifestyle factor may
           contribute to an increased incidence of food poisoning.
           increased incidence of eating out/increased consumption of ready meals;
           not all restaurants have high standards of food hygiene which may result in
           someone eating food that is more likely to cause food poisoning;
           poor food hygiene may mean that food poisoning bacteria are introduced into a
           food or allowed to grow in that food;
           foods which are not stored or reheated correctly can contribute to food poisoning;     [3 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of the role of cooking in
           controlling bacterial growth and preventing food poisoning.
           cooking can kill food poisoning bacteria;
           food must be cooked at a sufficiently high temperature and for a sufficient time;
           the temperature/time depends on the size of the food item and its initial
           temperature (frozen or at room temperature);                                           [3 max]


A7. Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how each type of rancidity is
    important in the shelf life of food products containing fats and oils, [3 max] per type of
    rancidity.

     Oxidative rancidity;
     important when food products containing unsaturated fatty acids are stored in too
     hot/light conditions and produce off flavours;
     involves three phase process – initiation, propagation and termination. (Initiation –
     molecular oxygen combines with unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of chemical
     oxidizers or enzymes to produce hydroperoxides and free radicals which are very
     reactive. Propagation – further oxidation by lipid oxidation products gives rise to the
     term “auto-oxidation” that is often used to refer to this process. Termination phase
     results in relatively unreactive compounds, e.g. hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones);

     Hydrolytic rancidity;
     occurs in food products containing fats and oils due to reaction of lipid and water in the
     presence of a catalyst or by the action of lipase enzymes;
     results in the formation of free fatty acids and soaps (salts of free fatty acids);
     although low levels of free 16-18°C atom fatty acids as in soybeans, corn or animal fat
     are not necessarily objectionable, low levels of shorter carbon chain fatty acids, as in
     coconut oil or butter fat, can be quite objectionable;

           appropriate points relating to this factor – one for home working and one for
           factory working.
           noise;
           factory working: generally much noisier environment than the home – employees
           would be likely to have to wear ear protection;
           home working: likely to be much quieter environments – employees may have to
           wear ear protection when conducting particular noisy processes;                      [3 max]


D2. (a)    Award [1] for stating one benefit of the EU Flower system for consumers.

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one way in which the environmental impact resulting
           from the care and maintenance of textile products in the home could be reduced
           by careful design of the textile product, and [1] for a brief explanation.
           finishing the fabric so it resists dirt;
                 washed less often / washed at lower temperatures;

           finishing the fabric so that it is easy to iron or does not require ironing;
                 reduced energy consumption from not ironing the fabric;                        [2 max]



D3. (a)    Award [1] for stating the meaning of each of the two symbols on the care label

D4. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of one advantage and
    one disadvantage of using biometrics in the design of sports clothing, [3 max] for each
    issue.
    advantage:
           biomimetic fabrics adapt ideas from natural animal and plant systems, e.g. shark
           skin;
           imitating high performance natural systems can promote innovation in the
           development of new textile products;
           can enhance human performance and provide advantages for users;

     disadvantage:
           sports clothing using biomimetic fabrics need to fit perfectly;
           therefore there are special made-to-measure requirements;
           this pushes up the price and may mean that those users who cannot afford to
           purchase them are disadvantaged;                                                    [6 max]


D5. (a)    Award [1] for identifying one advantage for developing countries when large
           multinational companies establish textile manufacturing companies in their
           country and [1] for each of two distinct additional points of explanation.
           creates employment;
           development of skills and competences;
           contribution to economic development and poverty alleviation;                       [3 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of one way in which
           fair trade regulations contribute to the sustainability of the textile industry.
           ensures that people in developing countries are not exploited;
           under the fair trade regulations they should get a fair rate of pay for the work
           they do;
           this makes the textile industry a good employment sector for individuals in
           developing countries;                                                               [3 max]

D6. (a)    Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of one challenge for the development of
           wearable computing garments.

           interaction of devices with body is complex;
           comfort is affected by weight distribution;
           designers need to promote comfort to create a market for wearable
           computing garments;

           price;
           stretch is limited;
           this means that wearable computing garments have to be made for a wider range
           of sizes;

           wearable computing garments are produced for standard sized (homogenized)
           humans;
           craft production is an option;
           this has worked for the luxury markets;

           care/maintenance is a key issue;
           wearable computing garments are not necessarily easy to launder;
           maintenance of connections between wires and devices are an issue;                    [3 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of one benefit of aligning the
           wearable computing market more closely with the fashion market.
           fashion market tends to be high cost with bigger profit margins or high volume;
           alignment of the wearable computing market with the fashion market would
           increase the volume of sales;
           this would reduce the cost-effectiveness of production and would push the price
           down making them more accessible;                                                     [3 max]

D7. Award [1] for identifying each of three aspects of the global impact of branded textile
    products and [1] for each of two points of explanation for each aspect, [3 max] per
    aspect.

     erosion of traditional cultural values and development of a youth culture;
     branded products are “cool” and are much sought after by young (and older) people;
     this contributes to the development of a generation whose allegiances are not rooted in
     traditional values;

     price;
     the branded products command high prices in the market place;
     coupled with manufacture often in developing countries this results in high profit
     margins;

     many (not all) branded textile products are produced in sweatshops where people
     are exploited;
     they challenge the concept of ethical consumerism where fair trade and appropriate
     employment practices would be required;
     corporate social responsibility has become a way in which brands manage negative
     publicity around these issues;                                                              [9 max]

Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer the
questions.

CASE STUDY

“Dead cars” or “End-of-life Vehicles” (ELVs) have until recently been crushed for disposal in landfill sites.  
This is unsightly (Figure 3) and dangerous. It is the least favoured option in the waste management hierarchy
(Figure 4). European take back legislation adopts the key principle that the “polluter pays”. It will force
better design of cars for disassembly. An ELV’s last owner should be able to take it to an authorised facility
for treatment and recovery at no cost. By 2015 the legislation requires 95 % reuse and recovery from ELVs.
ELVs comprise a range of components and the cost of disassembly is high unless considered at the design
stage. A range of design for disassembly (DfD) strategies can facilitate material recovery, for example:

      •    use the minimum number of different materials
      •    colour code materials to facilitate separation
      •    avoid adhesives
      •    do not mix materials in producing components and sub-assemblies
      •    avoid coatings
      •    use thermoplastics not thermosetting plastics

4.   Figure 4 shows a product called the Driron which dries and irons clothes. It is made in Spain by
     the Fagor company, costs 1600 Euros (2000US$) and took 3 years of research and development
     to get it to market. Clothes are hung inside the machine and weighed down with clip-on
     attachments. The heat dries the clothes and also creates the steam used to eliminate wrinkles.
     Small objects such as socks or underwear are placed in the rack at the top. After two hours in
     the Driron clothes are dry and wrinkle free.

5.   Figure 5 shows a pencil case made from a recycled car tyre. Its produced by the
     Remarkable Stationary company which manufactures a range of products made from
     recycled materials. Each product advertises boldly what it has been recycled from e.g. “I used
     to be a car tyre”. Manufacturing the pencil case from a recycled tyre is more expensive than
     manufacturing it from virgin materials.

     (a)   List two mechanical properties important to the choice of a material for manufacturing
           the pencil case.                                                                           [2]

     (b)   Explain how the structure and bonding of the thermoplastic material used to make the
           car tyre contributes to its ease of recycling.                                             [3]

     (c)   (i)    Define value-for-money.                                                             [1]

		         (ii)   Outline one reason why consumers may consider the pencil case value-for-money.      [2]

		         (iii) Suggest one reason why the use of a recycled car tyre makes the pencil case more
                 expensive to manufacture than a conventional approach.                               [3]

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. Body mass index, BMI, is generated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by height in
    metres squared. A BMI of 20-25 is considered normal, one of >25 is considered overweight
    bringing risk of increased mortality and one of >30 is considered obese bringing risk of significantly
    increased mortality through a range of conditions including diabetes, heart conditions, cancer
    and high blood pressure. Figure A1 graphically illustrates underweight (BMI <20 in blue),
    normal (BMI 20-25 in white) and overweight (BMI >25 in red) weight for height data.

Option B — Electronic product design
B1. Frequency division multiplexing (see Figure B1) is widely used in modern communications
    systems. Consider a communication link with a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The link provider
    divides the available bandwidth into smaller bandwidths and allocates them to individual
    users who can then simultaneously use the communication link. The size of the bandwidth
    needed depends on the application – typical bandwidths for various applications are shown in
    Table B1.

B3. Safety is a key aspect for public transport systems, e.g. it is critically important that doors on
    a train are only allowed to open under clearly prescribed conditions. Three conditions are
    required for a door to open on any particular carriage of the train, as follows:

      A.    The train is stopped in the station;
      B.    The driver has signalled the “all clear”;
      C.    A passenger in the carriage has pressed a door release button.

      (a)   Complete the truth table shown in Table B2 to show the behaviour of the logic gate
            required to ensure that the door opens appropriately.
                                                                                                         [2]

B4. Resistor values are normally shown using coloured bands. Each colour represents a number as
    in Figure B3 for E12 series resistors. Most resistors have four bands: the first band indicates
    the first digit; the second band indicates the second digit; the third band indicates the number of
    zeros; the fourth band shows the tolerance (precision) of the resistor (gold represents + 5 % and
    silver + 10 %).

    Families worked together at home to clean, comb, spin, dye and weave wool into cloth – a very
    slow process. During the 18th Century demand for textile, especially cotton, products increased.
    A series of important inventions (see Figure D1) relating to various aspects of the spinning
    (shown in blue) and weaving (shown in red) processes transformed the British textile industry.

     The Flying Shuttle allowed wider cloth to be produced more quickly. The Spinning Jenny
     allowed more threads of cotton to be spun simultaneously. Both the Flying Shuttle and the
     Spinning Jenny were small enough to be used in cottages. However, the Water Frame was
     powered by a watermill – it was too large for a cottage and too expensive for an individual
     family and forced spinning into factories. When the Power Loom was adopted weaving too
     shifted from cottages to factories.

D3. Clothing labels use a simple system of internationally-recognisable symbols to communicate care
    instructions to consumers. These symbols relate to washing, bleaching, drying, ironing and dry
    cleaning (see Figure D2). These are combined with modifiers (dots and bars). Dots indicate the
    temperature – one dot means cool/low temperature, two dots means warm/medium temperature
    and three dots mean hot/high temperature. Bars indicate more gentle treatment requirements
    – one bar means permanent press cycle and two bars means gentle/delicate cycle. A cross over
    a symbol means “Do not”, e.g. “Do not bleach” or “Do not iron” (see Figure D3).

     (b)   Award [1] for stating that the man does not know if he’s obese from Figure 1 (a).
           calculating BMI gives the answer 31.14 which makes the man obese;
           using Figure 1 (a) he is overweight and so loses the additional information that he
           is at significant increased risk of mortality, i.e. in a more serious condition;        [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how overweight and obesity
           are caused.
           overweight and obesity have a strong familial component;
           however energy intake and levels of physical activity are important;
           low levels of physical activity coupled with high levels of energy intake are likely
           to lead to an increased BMI;
           the issue of obesity and overweight can be addressed by increasing physical
           activity and/or reducing energy intake;                                                 [3 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a brief description of the role of an emulsifier
           in stabilizing an emulsion.
           an emulsion is a suspension of oil droplets in a water phase or water droplets in an
           oil phase in which the droplets remain separate;
           emulsifier has a hydrophilic part and a hydrophobic part and aligns itself at the
           surface of the droplet appropriately preventing the coalescence of the droplets;        [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a brief explanation of why the amounts of
           saturated and trans fats and cholesterol are identified amongst the
           Nutrition Facts on a packet of potato crisps (chips).
           saturated fats, trans fats and cholesterol are considered bad for health;
           people who are being careful about their diet would want to know how much of
           each component is present so that they can decide whether to purchase/eat the
           product;                                                                         [2 max]

A5. Award [1] for identifying a particular nutritional issue and [1] for each additional point
    in an explanation of how health awareness affects food choice with reference to that
    issue, [3 max] for each issue.
    fat quality and quantity;
    choose a diet low in fat;
    fat provides twice as many calories as the equivalent amount of carbohydrate or protein;
    high fat intake can lead to overweight and obesity;

     choose a diet low in saturated fat/trans fat/dietary cholesterol;
     consumption of saturated fat, trans fat, and dietary cholesterol raises low-density
     lipoprotein (LDL) or “bad cholesterol,” levels, which increases the risk of coronary
     heart disease (CHD).

     saturated fat (from meat, milk and milk products) raises blood cholesterol more than
     other forms of fat;

     reducing saturated fat to less than 10 % of calories will help lower blood cholesterol
     levels;

     replace total/saturated fat by eating more unsaturated/polyunsaturated fat;
     unsaturated fats reduce blood cholesterol when they replace saturated fats in the diet;

     choose a diet low in trans fats;
     partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, such as those used in many margarines and
     shortenings, contain a form of unsaturated fat known as trans-fatty acids that may raise
     blood cholesterol levels, although not as much as saturated fat;

     choose a diet low in cholesterol;
     the body makes all the cholesterol it needs;
     dietary cholesterol comes from animal sources such as egg yolks, meat (especially
     organ meats such as liver), poultry, fish, and higher fat milk products;
     eat more grain products, vegetables and fruits and by limiting intake of high cholesterol
     foods;

     fibre intake;
     fibre is good for the health of the gut;
     eating a high fibre diet appears to reduce the risk of developing various conditions,
     including heart disease, diabetes, diverticular disease, and constipation;
     low fibre content foods, e.g. refined foods such as white bread, white rice, refined
     cereals (corn flakes, Cheerios), white spaghetti and sugar should be replaced with higher
     fibre alternatives;

     sugar intake;
     medical experts agree that people should get no more than 10 % of their calories
     from sugar;
     higher intakes of sugar can lead to overweight, obesity and a range of obesity-linked
     diseases;

     salt intake;
     high salt consumption can contribute to high blood pressure for people who have been
     diagnosed with hypertension, high blood pressure can lead to heart disease and stroke;
     recommended salt intake in UK is 6 g, a salt intake of about 6 g is considered sensible
     medical advice;                                                                              [6 max]



A6. Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how each type of rancidity is
    important in the shelf life of food products containing fats and oils, [3 max] per type of
    rancidity.
    oxidative rancidity;
    important when food products containing unsaturated fatty acids are stored in too
    hot/light conditions and produce off flavours;
    involves three phase process – initiation, propagation and termination. (Initiation –
    molecular oxygen combines with unsaturated fatty acids in the presence of chemical
    oxidizers or enzymes to produce hydroperoxides and free radicals which are very
    reactive. Propagation – further oxidation by lipid oxidation products gives rise to the
    term “auto-oxidation” that is often used to refer to this process. Termination phase
    results in relatively unreactive compounds, e.g. hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones);

     hydrolytic rancidity;
     occurs in food products containing fats and oils due to the reaction of lipid and water in
     the presence of a catalyst or by the action of lipase enzymes;
     results in the formation of free fatty acids and soaps (salts of free fatty acids);
     although low levels of free 16-18°C atom fatty acids as in soybeans, corn or animal fat
     are not necessarily objectionable, low levels of shorter carbon chain fatty acids, as in
     coconut oil or butter fat, can be quite objectionable;
     oil/fat develops a soapy taste/texture;

     absorption rancidity;
     important when oils and fats are stored next to products (such as paint, detergents or
     disinfectants) which have a strong smell;
     smell absorbed by fat/oil making it unpleasant to eat;
     food should be stored in dry cool place away from strong smelling items;                     [9 max]

Option D — Textiles

D1. (a)    Award [1] for stating the source of power used by the textile industry in Britain
           prior to its mechanisation in the Industrial Revolution.
           human muscle power;                                                                   [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a description of why the development of the
           textile industry resulted from a combination of market pull and technology push.
           demand was increasing for textile products hence market pull;
           the textile industry benefited from other technological developments;                 [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for identifying a relevant factor and then [1] for each of two
           appropriate points relating to this factor – one for home working and one for
           factory working.
           noise;
           factory working: generally much noisier environment than the home – employees
           would be likely to have to wear ear protection;
           home working: likely to be much quieter environments – employees may have to
           wear ear protection when conducting particular noisy processes;                       [3 max]



D2. (a)    Award [1] for stating one source of wool.
           sheep;

            internationally-recognizable system of care instructions is used by manufacturers
            on care labels and [1] for a brief explanation.
            clothing products are global products and used in countries all over the world;
            internationally-recognizable symbols without words can be readily understood
            without linguistic issues wherever the garments are used;                           [2 max]


D4.         Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of one
            advantage and one disadvantage of using biometrics in the design of sports
            clothing, [3 max] for each issue.
            advantage
                  biomimetic fabrics adapt ideas from natural animal and plant systems, e.g.
                  shark skin;
                  imitating high performance natural systems can promote innovation in the
                  development of new textile products;
                  can enhance human performance and provide advantages for users;

            disadvantage
                  sports clothing using biomimetic fabrics need to fit perfectly;
                  therefore there are special made-to-measure requirements;
                  this pushes up the price and may mean that those users who cannot afford to
                  purchase them are disadvantaged;                                              [6 max]



D5. Award [1] for listing each of two advantages of finishing carpets with Triple Fresh
    during manufacture rather than by a user after purchase.
    more even application;
    finish can work throughout the product life;
    the user may not follow appropriate health and safety procedures;                           [2 max]

D6. Award [1] for identifying each of three aspects of the global impact of branded textile
    products and [1] for each of two points of explanation for each aspect, [3 max] per
    aspect.
    erosion of traditional cultural values and development of a youth culture;
    branded products are “cool” and are much sought after by young (and older) people;
    this contributes to the development of a generation whose allegiances are not rooted in
    traditional values;

     price;
     the branded products command high prices in the market place;
     coupled with manufacture often in developing countries this results in high profit
     margins;

     many (not all) branded textile products are produced in sweatshops where people
     are exploited;
     they challenge the concept of ethical consumerism where fair trade and appropriate
     employment practices would be required;
     corporate social responsibility has become a way in which brands manage negative
     publicity around these issues;                                                           [9 max]
