1.   Two IB students carried out a project on the chemistry of bleach.

     (a)   The bleach contained a solution of sodium hypochlorite, NaClO (aq). The students
           determined experimentally the concentration of hypochlorite ions, ClO–, in the bleach:

           Experimental procedure:
           • The bleach solution was first diluted by adding 25.00 cm3 of the bleach to a 250 cm3
             volumetric flask.  The solution was filled to the graduation mark with deionized water.

           • 25.00 cm3 of this solution was then reacted with excess iodide in acid.

                               ClO − (aq) + 2I − (aq) + 2H + (aq) → Cl− (aq) + I 2 (aq) + H 2 O (l)

           • The iodine formed was titrated with 0.100 mol dm–3 sodium thiosulfate solution,
             Na2S2O3(aq), using starch indicator.

                                           I 2 (aq ) + 2S2 O32− (aq) → 2I − (aq) + S4 O6 2− (aq)

           The following data were recorded for the titration:

                                                                 First titre                 Second titre                    Third titre

               Final burette reading of
             0.100 mol dm–3 Na2S2O3(aq)                              23.95                         46.00                         22.15

Subject Details: Chemistry HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.    Each row in the markscheme table relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.    Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’ column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail an d validity as that in
      the ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the ‘Notes’ column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –3–                                         SPEC/4/CHEMI/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

14.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct formula unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column,
      similarly, if the formula is specifically asked for, unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column do not award a mark for a correct name.

15.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do not award a mark for a word equation or an
      unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

16.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

1.      Compounds used to generate cooling in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems are
        known as refrigerants. A refrigerant undergoes a reversible change of state involving
        vaporization and condensation. The search for suitable refrigerants has occupied chemists
        for approximately 200 years.

        Previously, the most popular refrigerants were chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but these
        have been replaced first by hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and more recently by
        hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

        Some data on examples of these three classes of refrigerants are shown below.

     ODP: The ozone depletion potential (ODP) is a relative measure of the amount of degradation to the ozone layer
          caused by the compound. It is compared with the same mass of CCl3F, which has an ODP of 1.0.
2
     GWP: The global warming potential (GWP) is a relative measure of the total contribution of the compound to global
          warming over the specified time period. It is compared with the same mass of CO2, which has a GWP of 1.0.

2.   Thomas wants to determine the empirical formula of red-brown copper oxide. The method he
     chooses is to convert a known amount of copper(II) sulfate into this oxide. The steps of his
     procedure are:

           • Make 100 cm3 of a 1 mol dm–3 solution using hydrated copper(II) sulfate crystals.

           • React a known volume of this solution with alkaline glucose in order to convert it to
             red-brown copper oxide.

           • Separate the precipitated oxide and find its mass.

     (a)     Thomas calculates that he needs 0.1 × [1 × 63.55 + 1 × 32.07 + 4 × 16.00] = 15.962 ± 0.001 g
             of the copper(II) sulfate to make the solution. Outline the major error in his calculation.                                                       [1]

     (b)     He now adds 100 ± 1 cm3 of water from a measuring/graduated cylinder and dissolves
             the copper(II) sulfate crystals. A friend tells him that for making standard solutions it
             is better to use a volumetric flask rather than adding water from a measuring cylinder.
             Suggest two reasons why a volumetric flask is better.                                                                                             [2]

10.   The figure below shows two examples of molecules known as xenoestrogens, a type
      of xenobiotic. They have effects on living organisms similar to those of the female
      hormone estrogen. These compounds are found in the environment and can be taken up by
      living organisms, where they may be stored in certain tissues.

      (c)   One way to decrease the concentration of a xenobiotic in the environment is to develop
            a specific molecule, a “host”, that can bind to it. The binding between the host and the
            xenobiotic forms a supramolecule.

11.   DNA is the molecule that carries genetic information in nearly all cells. Two months before
      Watson and Crick published their paper describing the double helical nature of DNA in 1953,
      Linus Pauling published a suggested structure for DNA based on a triple helix. Pauling’s model,
      which was soon proved to be incorrect, had the phosphate groups facing into the core of the
      helix and the nitrogenous bases facing out.

17.   Salicylic acid has been used to relieve pain and reduce fevers for centuries, although it can be
      irritating to the stomach. In the 1800s it was discovered that converting it into acetylsalicylic
      acid reduces the stomach irritation while still allowing it to be effective.

            synthesize Taxol® chemically are complex and crucial to control.                                                                                 [3]

Subject Details: Chemistry HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [15 marks] and all questions from ONE option in Section B [30 marks]. Maximum
total = [45 marks].

1.    Each row in the markscheme table relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.    Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’ column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail an d validity as that in
      the ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the ‘Notes’ column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –3–                                         SPEC/4/CHEMI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

14.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct formula unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column,
      similarly, if the formula is specifically asked for, unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column do not award a mark for a correct name.

15.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do not award a mark for a word equation or an
      unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

16.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

1.   Two IB students carried out a project on the chemistry of bleach.

     (a)   The bleach contained a solution of sodium hypochlorite, NaClO (aq). The students
           determined experimentally the concentration of hypochlorite ions, ClO–, in the bleach.

           Experimental procedure:
           • The bleach solution was first diluted by adding 25.00 cm3 of the bleach to a 250 cm3

Subject Details: Chemistry SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    Each row in the markscheme table relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.    Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’ column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and val idity as that in
      the ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

14.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct formula unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column,
      similarly, if the formula is specifically asked for, unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column do not award a mark for a correct name.

15.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do not award a mark for a word equation or an
      unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

16.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

1.      Compounds used to generate cooling in refrigerators and air-conditioning systems are
        known as refrigerants. A refrigerant undergoes a reversible change of state involving
        vaporization and condensation. The search for suitable refrigerants has occupied chemists
        for approximately 200 years.

        Previously, the most popular refrigerants were chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but these
        have been replaced, first by hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and more recently by
        hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).

        Some data on examples of these three classes of refrigerants are shown below.

     ODP: The ozone depletion potential (ODP) is a relative measure of the amount of degradation to the ozone layer
          caused by the compound. It is compared with the same mass of CCl3F, which has an ODP of 1.0.
2
     GWP: The global warming potential (GWP) is a relative measure of the total contribution of the compound to global
          warming over the specified time period. It is compared with the same mass of CO2, which has a GWP of 1.0.

2.   Thomas wants to determine the empirical formula of red-brown copper oxide. The method he
     chooses is to convert a known amount of copper(II) sulfate into this oxide. The steps of his
     procedure are:

           • Make 100 cm3 of a 1 mol dm–3 solution using hydrated copper(II) sulfate crystals.

           • React a known volume of this solution with alkaline glucose in order to convert it to
             red-brown copper oxide.

           • Separate the precipitated oxide and find its mass.


     (a)     Thomas calculates that he needs 0.1 × [1 × 63.55 + 1 × 32.07 + 4 × 16.00] = 15.962 ± 0.001 g
             of the copper(II) sulfate to make the solution. Outline the major error in his calculation.                                                       [1]

     (b)     He now adds 100 ± 1 cm3 of water from a measuring/graduated cylinder and dissolves
             the copper(II) sulfate crystals. A friend tells him that for making standard solutions it
             is better to use a volumetric flask rather than adding water from a measuring cylinder.
             Suggest two reasons why a volumetric flask is better.                                                                                             [2]

     (d)   A separate experiment was done to determine the amino acid composition of maltase.
           A sample of the enzyme was hydrolysed into a mixture of its component amino acids.

     (c)   One way to decrease the concentration of a xenobiotic in the environment is to develop
           a specific molecule, a “host”, that can bind to it. The binding between the host and the
           xenobiotic forms a supramolecule.

           State three types of association that may occur within the supramolecule between the
           host and the xenobiotic.                                                                                                                         [1]

13.   Salicylic acid has been used to relieve pain and reduce fevers for centuries, although it can be
      irritating to the stomach. In the 1800s it was discovered that converting it into acetylsalicylic
      acid reduces the stomach irritation while still allowing it to be effective.

15.   Antacids help to neutralize excess hydrochloric acid produced by the stomach. The neutralizing
      power of an antacid can be defined as the amount in moles of hydrochloric acid that can be
      neutralized per gram of antacid.

Subject Details: Chemistry SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [15 marks] and all questions from ONE option in Section B [20 marks]. Maximum
total = [35 marks].

1.    Each row in the markscheme table relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.    Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’ column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail an d validity as that in
      the ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the ‘Notes’ column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.
                                                                               –3–                                         SPEC/4/CHEMI/SP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

14.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct formula unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column,
      similarly, if the formula is specifically asked for, unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column do not award a mark for a correct name.

15.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do not award a mark for a word equation or an
      unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

16.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.
