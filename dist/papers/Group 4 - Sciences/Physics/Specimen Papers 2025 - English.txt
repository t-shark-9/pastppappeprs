Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.

1.   A group of students investigate the motion of a conducting ball suspended from a long string.
     The ball is between two vertical metal plates that have an electric potential difference V
     between them. The ball is touched to one plate so that it becomes electrically charged and
     is repelled from the plate. For a given potential difference, the ball bounces between the
     plates with a constant period.

                                                                                                                     diagram not to scale


                                                                             to the point of suspension




                                                                                                metal plates




                                                                             V

     (a)      The students vary V and measure the time T for the ball to move once from one plate
              to the other. The table shows some of the data.

                                                              V / kV              T / s ± 0.1 s

                                                               3.00                     1.4

              (i)      V is provided by two identical power supplies connected in series. The potential
                       difference of each of the power supplies is known with an uncertainty of 0.01 kV.

                       State the uncertainty in the potential difference V.[1]

2.   A group of students investigate the bending of a plastic ruler that is clamped horizontally
     at one end. A weight W attached to the other end causes the ruler to bend. The weight is
     contained in a scale pan.

     The students fix the length L of the ruler and vary W. For each value of W, the group
     measures the deflection d of the end of the ruler to which the weight is attached.

                                                                                 L

Mark Allocation
Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Maximum total = [20 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “Allow ECF” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

14.   Allow reasonable substitutions where in common usage, eg c for rad.

Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.

1.   A block of mass 45 kg is placed on a horizontal table. There is no friction between the block
     and the table.

     An object of mass 15 kg is placed on top of the block.

     A force F acts on the block so that it accelerates. The acceleration of the object and the
     acceleration of the block are the same so that they do not move relative to each other.


                                                               15 kg

     The coefficient of static friction between the block and the object is 0.60.

     (a)      State the nature and direction of the force that accelerates the 15 kg object.                                                               [1]

6.   A smoke detector uses the radioactive nuclide americium-241.

     The americium is contained in a chamber that is open to the air. There are two electrodes in
     the chamber that are connected to a power supply and a current sensor.

                                     electrodes

     Americium-241 emits alpha particles that ionize the air in the chamber. Each ionization forms
     one positive ion and one electron; these are called an ion pair. The electrons and the positive
     ions move towards the electrodes and the sensor detects a current in the air.

     When smoke enters the chamber, fewer ion pairs are formed and the current in the sensor
     decreases, sounding an alarm.

     The decay constant of americium-241 is 5.08 × 10-11 s-1.
     The chamber is 0.10 m in each dimension.

     (a)   A nucleus of americium-241 has 146 neutrons. This nuclide decays to neptunium
           through alpha emission.

           Complete the nuclear equation for this decay.                                               [2]

Mark Allocation
Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Maximum total = [90 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “Allow ECF” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

14.   Allow reasonable substitutions where in common usage, eg c for rad.

                Faraday’s law states that the induced emf in B will «therefore» increase 

                so induced current will increase because resistance of ring is constant 

5.     d        the current induced in B gives rise to a magnetic field opposing that of A

                OR

                there will be a magnetic force opposing the motion 

                work must be done to move B in the opposite direction to this force

Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.

1.   A group of students investigate the motion of a conducting ball suspended from a long string.
     The ball is between two vertical metal plates that have an electric potential difference V
     between them. The ball is touched to one plate so that it becomes electrically charged and
     is repelled from the plate. For a given potential difference, the ball bounces between the
     plates with a constant period.

                                                                                                                     diagram not to scale

     (a)      The students vary V and measure the time T for the ball to move once from one plate
              to the other. The table shows some of the data.

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 1B Markscheme

Mark Allocation
Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Maximum total = [20 marks].

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR” between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    Words in angled brackets « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “Allow ECF” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

14.   Allow reasonable substitutions where in common usage, eg c for rad.

Answer all questions. Answers must be written within the answer boxes provided.

1.   A block of mass 45 kg is placed on a horizontal table. There is no friction between the block
     and the table.

     An object of mass 15 kg is placed on top of the block.

     A force F acts on the block so that it accelerates. The acceleration of the object and the
     acceleration of the block are the same so that they do not move relative to each other.


                                                               15 kg

     The coefficient of static friction between the block and the object is 0.60.

     (a)      State the nature and direction of the force that accelerates the 15 kg object.                                                               [1]

2.   In a microwave oven electromagnetic waves are emitted so that a standing wave pattern is
     established inside the oven.

     A flat piece of chocolate is placed inside the oven and the microwaves are switched on.
     The chocolate is stationary.

     Melted spots form on the surface of the chocolate. The diagram shows the pattern of melting
     on the chocolate. Each square has a length of 1 cm.

4.   A smoke detector uses the radioactive nuclide americium-241.

     The americium is contained in a chamber that is open to the air. There are two electrodes in
     the chamber that are connected to a power supply and a current sensor.

                                     electrodes

     Americium-241 emits alpha particles that ionize the air in the chamber. Each ionization forms
     one positive ion and one electron; these are called an ion pair. The electrons and the positive
     ions move towards the electrodes and the sensor detects a current in the air.

     When smoke enters the chamber, fewer ion pairs are formed and the current in the sensor
     decreases, sounding an alarm.

     The chamber is 0.10 m in each dimension.

     (a)   A nucleus of americium-241 has 146 neutrons. This nuclide decays to neptunium
           through alpha emission.

           Complete the nuclear equation for this decay.                                               [2]

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions. Maximum total = 55 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative wording is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by OWTTE
      (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then
      it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be awarded.
      When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.
