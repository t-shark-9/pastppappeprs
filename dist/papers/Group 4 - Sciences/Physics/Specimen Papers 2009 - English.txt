     (c)   The bright star Sirius A is accompanied by a much fainter star, Sirius B.
           The mean distance of the stars from Earth is 8.1× 1016 m. Under ideal atmospheric
           conditions, a telescope with an objective lens of diameter 25 cm can just resolve the
           stars as two separate images.

		         Assuming that the average wavelength emitted by the stars is 500 nm, estimate the
           apparent, linear separation of the two stars.                                                                                                   [3]

(Question B1, part 1 continued)

     (b)    In a simple model of a methane molecule, a hydrogen atom and the carbon atom can be
            regarded as two masses attached by a spring. A hydrogen atom is much less massive than
            the carbon atom such that any displacement of the carbon atom may be ignored.

		          The graph below shows the variation with time t of the displacement x from its
            equilibrium position of a hydrogen atom in a molecule of methane.

		         The car moves up the incline at a steady speed of 16 m s–1. During the climb,
           the average friction force acting on the car is 5.0× 102 N. The total weight of the
           car and the driver is 1.2× 104 N.

		         (i)    Determine the time it takes the car to travel from the bottom to the top of
                  the incline.                                                                                                                          [2]

(Question B3, part 1 continued)

     (b)   From the top of the incline, the road continues downwards in a straight line. At the point
           where the road starts to go downwards, the driver of the car in (a), stops the car to look
           at the view. In continuing his journey, the driver decides to save fuel. He switches off
           the engine and allows the car to move freely down the hill. The car descends a height of
           0.30 km in a distance of 6.4 km before levelling out.




                                                                             6.4 km

     (c)   A satellite of mass 3.2×103 kg is launched from the surface of the planet. Use the graph
           to determine the minimum launch speed that the satellite must have in order to reach a
           height of 2.0×107 m above the surface of the planet. (You may assume that it reaches
           its maximum speed immediately after launch.)                                                                                                    [4]

     A metal is placed in a vacuum and light of frequency f is incident on its surface. As a result,
     electrons are emitted from the surface. The graph below shows the variation with frequency f
     of the maximum kinetic energy EK of the emitted electrons.

                                                SECTION A

A1. (a)   (i)    reasonable curve drawn up to 15 ms −1 that does not go through zero;             [1]
                 Expect smooth single-line within one square of each correctly plotted point.

          (ii)   shape of curve wrong / curve does not go through zero;                           [1]

          (iii) 5% = ± 30 ;
                correct drawing of error bar;                                                     [2]

    (b)   (i)    when vin = 14 ms −1 , Pout = 570 (±20) kW ;
                 Pin = 1250 (±50) kW ;
                 Allow ± 21 a square.
                               570
                 efficiency =        = 0.46 or 46 % ;                                             [3]
                              1250

          (ii)   the efficiency decreases;
                 for a given increase in velocity the increase in Pout gets smaller;
                 whereas the increase in theoretical Pin gets larger;
                 or
                 as the Pout graph starts to flatten / OWTTE;
                 the Pin graph steepens;                                                          [3]

    (c)   advantage:
          wind is renewable so no resources used up / wind is free / no chemical pollution /
          carbon dioxide emission / does not add to the enhanced greenhouse effect;
          disadvantage:
          expensive initial/capital costs / large land area needed / visual / noise pollution /
          winds unpredictable/not constant / affect on birds;                                     [2]
          Award any other suitable advantage or disadvantage.

                 transmitted by P2 / OWTTE;
                 the electric field across the parts of the liquid crystal in the shape of the

B2. Part 1       Nuclear power production

    (a)   (i)    fuel enrichment means that the amount of uranium-235 present in the fuel is
                 increased / OWTTE;
                 this means that more U-235 available for fission;
                 therefore the reaction can be sustained;                                      [3]

          (ii)   enriched fuel can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons;
                 so possibly threatening World peace;                                          [2]

Part 2     Electromagnetic induction

(a)   the induced emf is induced in such a direction that its effect is to oppose the
      change to which it is due / OWTTE;                                                   [1]

(b)   description:
      on opening the switch, the reading on the voltmeter will deflect to the left and
      then drop to zero;
      explanation:
      when the switch is opened the field drops to zero – so again a time changing flux;
      which will induce an emf in the opposite direction as the emf will now be such as
      to oppose the field falling to zero/Lenz’s law;
      when the current reaches zero, there will no longer be a flux change;                [4]

(Question G2 continued)

		         The eye ring of an astronomical telescope is a device that is placed outside the eyepiece
           lens of the telescope at the position where the image of the objective lens is formed by
           the eyepiece lens. The diameter of the eye ring is the same as the diameter of the image
           of the objective lens. This ensures that all the light passing through the telescope passes
           through the eye ring.

     (d)   A particular astronomical telescope has an objective lens of focal length 98.0 cm and an
           eyepiece lens of focal length 2.00 cm (i.e. fO = 98.0 cm, fE = 2.00 cm). Determine the
           position of the eye ring.                                                                                                                       [4]

J1.   (a)   (i)    a particle that appears as an intermediate particle in a Feynman diagram /
                   a particle that is not observed and may violate energy and momentum
                   conservation at a vertex;                                                        [1]

                   e.g. − 13 = 23 + x ⇒ x = −1 or x = −1 + 0 = −1                                   [2]

J2.   (a)   (The Pauli exclusion principle states:) it is impossible for two identical

            impossible for two fermions with the same quantum numbers to be in the same
            quantum state;
            the three quarks are distinguished by an additional quantum number, colour;             [2]

      (b)   there are two states of spin;

            (ii)   the magnetic fields are used to bend the protons into circular paths;                   [1]

      (b)   the radius of the circular path increases as the speed increases;
                       mv
            since R =      ;
                       qB
            to keep the protons in the same circular path B has to increase;                               [3]

      (c)   (i)    so each beam must have a kinetic energy of 1120 − 938 = 182 MeV ;                       [1]

            (ii)   hence total energy E of accelerated particle is given by
                    22402 = 2(938) E + 2(938) 2
                   ⇒ E = 1740 MeV
                   to give EK = 1740 − 938 = 802 MeV ;                                                     [3]

      (d)   the energy needed is much less in collisions between moving particles;                         [1]



J4.   (a)   (i)    an experiment in which leptons scatter off hadrons;
                   imparting/transferring large amounts of energy/momentum (compared to rest
                   masses) to the hadrons;                                                                 [2]

            (ii)   quarks: [2 max]
                   scattering pattern is different from that expected from a single individual particle;
                   and consistent with three constituents inside baryons;
                   also accept:
                   deep inelastic scattering experiments measure the momentum carried by
                   charged constituents inside hadrons;
                   the momentum carried by a constituent is about 13 ( 12 ) of the total momentum
                   indicating that there are 3 (2) constituents in baryons (mesons);
                   gluons: [2 max]
                   the total momentum carried by the charged constituents does not add up to
                   that of the hadron;
                   indicating that there must exist other neutral constituents inside the hadron;          [4]

      (b)   in deep inelastic scattering experiments the energy transferred is very large;
            the strength of the interaction between quarks decreases as the energy of the
            interaction increases (due to a property called asymptotic freedom) hence quarks
            behave as almost free particles;                                                               [2]

      (c)   in the standard model the fundamental building blocks of matter are point particles
            but in strings they are extended objects;
            the standard model is formulated in four dimensions (accept three) – strings require
            many extra dimensions / OWTTE;                                                                 [2]

A2. This question is about an electric circuit.

     A particular filament lamp is rated at 12 V, 6.0 mA.  It just lights when the potential difference
     across the filament is 6.0 V.

     A student sets up an electric circuit to measure the I-V characteristic of the filament lamp.

     In the circuit, shown below, the student has connected the voltmeter and the ammeter into the
     circuit incorrectly.


                                                                A


                                                                                                       100 k
                                  12 V                                                S
                                                                                                   V
                                             		




     The battery has e.m.f. 12 V and negligible internal resistance.   The ammeter has negligible
     resistance and the resistance of the voltmeter is 100 k. The maximum resistance of the
     variable resistor is 15 .

     (a)   Explain, without doing any calculations, whether there is a position of the slide S at
           which the lamp will be lit.                                                                                                                     [3]

(Question B3, part 1 continued)

     (d)   From the top of the incline, the road continues downwards in a straight line. At the point
           where the road starts to go downwards, the driver of the car in (c), stops the car to look
           at the view.  In continuing his journey, the driver decides to save fuel.  He switches off
           the engine and allows the car to move freely down the hill. The car descends a height of
           0.30 km in a distance of 6.4 km before levelling out.

                 Expect smooth single-line within one square of each correctly plotted point.

          (ii)   shape of curve wrong / curve does not go through zero;                           [1]

          (iii) 5% = ±30 ;
                correct drawing of error bar;                                                     [2]

                 Pin = 1250 (±50) kW ;
                 Allow ± 21 a square.

                 efficiency =        = 0.46 or 46 % ;                                             [3]
                              1250

          (ii)   the efficiency decreases;
                 for a given increase in velocity the increase in Pout gets smaller;
                 whereas the increase in theoretical Pin gets larger;
                 or
                 as the Pout graph starts to flatten / OWTTE;
                 the Pin graph steepens;                                                          [3]

    (c)   advantage:
          wind is renewable so no resources used up / wind is free / no chemical pollution /
          carbon dioxide emission / does not add to the enhanced greenhouse effect;
          disadvantage:
          expensive initial/capital costs / large land area needed / visual / noise pollution /
          winds unpredictable/not constant / affect on birds;                                     [2]
          Award any other suitable advantage or disadvantage.

A2. (a)   there are no positions;
          the lamp is effectively in series with 100 kΩ no matter what the position of S;
          this means that the pd across it will always be close to zero (very small) / never
          reach 6 V;

      through 1K / 1 °C ;                                                                         [1]

(b)   the internal energy is the total energy of the molecules of a substance;
      the greater the specific heat (the more energy required to raise unit mass through
      1 K) this means that to increase the temperature by the same amount, more energy
      most be given to substance A than to substance B (so internal energy is greater) /
      OWTTE;                                                                                      [2]

(c)   (i)    energy supplied by heater in 1s = 7.2 ×103 J ;
             energy per second = mass per second × sp ht × rise in temperature;
              7.2 × 103 = mass per second ×4.2 ×103 × 26 ;
             to give mass per second = 0.066 kg ;                                                 [4]

B2. (a)   (i)    there is more uranium-238 present than uranium-235;
                 neutron capture is more likely in U-238 with high energy neutrons;
                 if the neutrons are slowed they are more likely to produce fission in U-235
                 than neutron capture in U-238;                                                [3]

    (b)   (i)    fuel enrichment means that the amount of uranium-235 present in the fuel is
                 increased / OWTTE;
                 this means that more U-235 available for fission;
                 therefore the reaction can be sustained;                                      [3]

          (ii)   enriched fuel can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons;

                 of energy / OWTTE;                                                            [1]

      (iii) advantage:
            plutonium is another fissionable element / may be used as nuclear fuel;

(Question G2 continued)

     (d)   The eye ring of an astronomical telescope is a device that is placed outside the eyepiece
           lens of the telescope at the position where the image of the objective lens is formed by
           the eyepiece lens. The diameter of the eye ring is the same as the diameter of the image
           of the objective lens. This ensures that all the light passing through the telescope passes
           through the eye ring.

           A particular astronomical telescope has an objective lens of focal length 98.0 cm and
           an eyepiece lens of focal length 2.00 cm (i.e. fO = 98.0 cm, fE = 2.00 cm). Determine the
           position of the eye ring.                                                                                                                       [4]
