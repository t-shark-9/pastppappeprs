Answer all questions.

11.   The temperature (in °C) of a lake was recorded every hour, every day, for one week.  
      As each reading was taken, it was added sequentially to the collection  TEMPERATURES,
      which is stored permanently.

      At the end of the week this data was read into a two-dimensional array named
      TEMPWEEK as shown below.


                                        Monday      Tuesday         ...          Sunday

15.   A company uses computer controlled equipment to monitor and control a
      heating system.  The user controls the system via an on/off switch and two dials that
      are used to set the maximum and minimum temperatures desired.

      The following flowchart represents the algorithm used to control temperature.

                          start




                set the MINIMUM and
               MAXIMUM temperatures
               based on the dial settings




                        is the
                                        no
                       SWITCH
                        OFF?


                        yes                              measure
                                                      TEMPERATURE




                                                  activate or deactivate the
                                                 fan and/or heater as needed


                          stop


      The temperature is constantly measured and the process of making the decision on
      which action to take is as follows.

      If it is too cold (temperature is less than the minimum) then the heater should be
      switched on.  If it is too hot (temperature is greater than the maximum) then the fan
      should be switched on.  If temperature is within the given range (temperature greater
      than the minimum and less than the maximum) then both the fan and heater should be
      switched off.




                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

     (b)   State three hardware devices that are needed to capture the input data and
           produce the system outputs.                                                     [3 marks]

     (c)   Construct pseudocode for the algorithm outlined on the previous page.           [4 marks]

     (d)   The company wants to use its heating system to control the temperature
           of ten different places at the same time.  All ten places will have the same
           maximum and minimum temperatures and each will have its own heater, fan,
           and temperature sensor.   Evaluate the decision of having all ten temperature
           sensors, fans, and heaters connected to a single control computer instead of
           having ten separate heating systems.                                            [6 marks]

2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.

5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.    Record sub-totals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.

8.    Section A: Add together the total for the section and write it in the Examiner Column on the cover
                 sheet.
      Section B: Record the mark awarded for each of the six questions answered in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.
      Total:     Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.

9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.

10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.

11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left hand margin.

Mark Allocation

Section A:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
              Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
        correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

General guidance

Issue          Guidance
Answering       In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
the quantity    In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
of responses     e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
prescribed       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
in the          In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
questions        explanations e.g. “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers. This
                 could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

           Answers may include:
           Incompatible formats of data: The new system may store data in a format
           different from that used in the old system. This might be a simple matter of
           translation, such as converting integers to decimals. It could also be very
           difficult if the new system stores more detailed data than the old system, such
           as the date and time of each transaction while the old system stored only the
           date.
           Data lost in migration: Data might be lost due to errors in the translation
           process or because perfect translations simply aren’t possible, e.g. if the old
           system stored ratings on a scale of 1–5 while the new system stored only 1–3.
           The systems may be unavailable during the migration process; one way to
           avoid having two systems with incompatible data is to shutdown the business,
           perform the migration, and then restart with the new system. If the migration
           takes a long time however, shutting down the business for that time may be
           undesirable.
           New data may continue coming in during the migration process; if the business
           is not shutdown during the migration process, transactions will either have to
           be performed on the new system without the old data being available or they
           will have to be performed on the old system which will add to the data needing
           to be migrated.                                                                     [6 marks]

13.   (a)   Award [1 mark] for a definition that covers the basis of the term.
            Concurrent processing means to do more than one activity at the same time;                  [1 mark]

      (b)   Award [1 mark] for a pair of tasks correctly identified.
            Install plumbing and install electrical systems;                                            [1 mark]

      (c)   Award [1 mark] for a pair of tasks correctly identified.
            Any two tasks in which one cannot begin before the other is completed:
            Digging the foundation and building the floors;
            Building the walls and building the roof;
            Building the roof and plastering the walls;                                                 [1 mark]

      (d)   Award [1 mark] for identifying a task as composed of subtasks.
            Award [1 mark] for describing some reasonable set of subtasks.
            Describe one of the tasks as being composed of subtasks:
            Build the floors: Install the beams, install the joists, install the subfloor, install
            the finish floor.
            Paint the walls: Mask off things not to paint, cover floors, select paint colours,
            paint trim, paint walls, paint ceilings.
            Landscaping: Plan the plantings, get the plants, dig holes, plant things, seed the
            lawn, install lighting.                                                                    [2 marks]

      (e)   Award [1 mark] each for the identification of an advantage and a disadvantage.
            Award up to [2 marks] for explaining the advantage and disadvantage.

            Advantages:
            Building could be finished faster; By doing some tasks concurrently,
            the overall time needed to complete the building will be reduced.
            Since construction workers are paid by the hour, getting the building done
            sooner will reduce the cost of the building.

            Disadvantages:
            Workers on concurrent tasks may get in each other’s way; If the plumbers and the
            electricians are both working at the same time and both need to get at the same
            place at the same time, one will have to wait. Thus, it may take longer to do the
            electrical work while the plumbing is being done than it would take to do it alone.
            Harder to supervise; The supervisor needs to look at the work being done and
            make sure that its being done correctly and explain what needs to be done, etc.
            If there are two (or more) sets of workers the supervisor will have to work
            harder to watch both of them at the same time.                                             [4 marks]

      (f)   Award [1 mark] for identifying an application.
            Award an additional [1 mark] for outlining a task carried out by the
            application.
            The word processor: counting the number of words in the document.
            The browser: Interpreting the HTML to figure out what to display.
            The downloading program: Calculating the amount of time remaining to
            complete the download.                                                                     [2 marks]

           the identification of a second idea up to [2 marks max].
           Application developers do not have to implement basic GUI components.
           All applications use the same basic GUI elements resulting in a better user
           experience.
           The operating system coordinates GUI elements for all applications reducing
           the need for developers to do so.
           Application code is much smaller since all the GUI-related code is in a
           standard library.                                                                [2 marks]

      (b)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
            Award [2 marks] for a basic description of the operating system in the
            management of applications.
            Award [1 mark] for elaborating on the description.
            Award [1 mark] for an explanation that is clear, detailed and balanced.
            Answers may include:
            Memory management: The OS allocates a certain portion of the memory for
            each application. The amount of memory needed by each application may
            change so the OS will need to be able to allocate more memory to an
            application as needed and to recover memory when the application no longer
            needs it.
            Allocation of processing time for each application: This could involve
            time-slicing in which each application is given a certain amount of processor
            time before control is switched to the next application. Alternatively, the OS
            could use an event-driven model in which control of the processor is passed to
            the appropriate application as events such as an incoming call, a button press,
            or an interrupt occur.
            Coordination of interfaces: The OS determines which application should be
            notified if a button is pressed and updates the display based on requests
            received from each of the applications.                                             [4 marks]

           Award an additional [1 mark each] for describing how the design of each of
           the identified resources differ between the mobile phone and PC platforms up
           to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Answers may include:
           Memory: The small size of the mobile phone restricts the amount of memory
           that can be included to less than what can be included in a PC. More
           importantly, the mobile must use much less power than a PC and this further
           restricts the amount of memory that can be included and also makes some
           designers choose slower memory that consumes less power.
           Display Screen: The small size of the mobile restricts the size of the screen to
           something much less than a PC. To compensate, the screen may need to have a
           much higher resolution. Also, the mobile screen must be readable in direct
           sunlight, which most PC displays are not.
           Input devices: The PC usually uses a full-size keyboard. The mobile must
           generally use a much smaller keyboard which results either in a greatly reduced
           number of keys or in very tiny keys such as on a Blackberry. The PC also
           usually has a pointing device like a mouse which itself is already larger than
           many mobile phones. Instead, mobile phones may use a touch sensitive screen.       [4 marks]

     (d)   Award marks as follows up to [6 marks max].

           Award [1 mark] for a contrast of the identified advantages and disadvantages.
           Award [1 mark] if the contrast is clear, and explains the relevance of the advantages and
           disadvantages.

           Possible advantages include:
           Only need a single set of max/min dials and only one on/off switch.
           There is no way for the locations to accidently have different settings.
           All ten locations can be controlled from a single place so you don’t have to run
           around to each one.
           All the temperature data is available in one place, which may make recording
           and analyzing it easier.

           Possible disadvantages include:
           May need a lot of wires to connect all the locations to the control computer.
           If the control computer breaks, all the locations suffer.
           The software will have to be changed.                                                  [6 marks]

(Question A1 continued)

     The Human Resources Department is experiencing many errors when compiling reports of
     personnel and has been advised that it should change to a relational database.

     (a)   (i)    Define the term database.                                                                   [1]

           (ii)   Describe the difference between a  flat file database and a relational database.            [2]

     (b)   (i)    Identify two problems caused by data redundancy.                                            [2]

           (ii)   Outline using examples how data redundancy in this database could lead to errors.           [2]

     (c)   The departments usually have many ongoing projects that occupy their team members.  
           The Human Resources Department needs to produce lists showing who is involved in
           current projects.

           The following information has been provided:
           Project: Project_Ref, Project_Name, Budget
           Department: Dept_Ref, Dept_Name
           Staff: Staff_Number, Forename, Surname, Job_Title, Salary
           The projects are owned by a department.
           Each member of staff is a member of a department.

           (i)    Construct an Entity Relationship Diagram to show how a relational database could
                  be designed to make this possible with the least chance of producing errors caused
                  by data redundancy.                                                                         [4]

           (ii)   Identify the steps to create a query that could be constructed to produce a list of staff
                  members whose salary is greater than $50 000 who are involved in a project called
                  “Relocation_2012”.                                                                          [4]




                                                                                                     Turn over
                                                   –4–                SPEC/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

A2. A bank wants to transfer money from one account to another.  Both accounts are held in the
    bank’s database management system (DBMS).   The account DBMS carries out a series of
    separate operations in order to achieve this transaction.  These include removing of money from
    one account and adding it to the other.  An error may occur if this process is interrupted, for
    example due to a power failure.  This could compromise the integrity of the account database.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a transaction in terms of a database.                    [2]

           (ii)   Distinguish between a database schema and a database state.                              [2]

           (iii) Explain why the interruption described above could compromise the integrity of the
                 account database.                                                                         [2]

     (b)   Identify the steps that should be taken by the software in order to maintain the integrity of
           the account database.                                                                           [4]

     (c)   The bank account data is shared between various applications, such as the bank’s
           internal accounting systems and the online transaction system.  Explain how problems of
           concurrency can arise and how they can be avoided.                                              [6]


A3. (a)    (i)    Identify two functions of a database management system (DBMS).                           [2]

           (ii)   List two tools usually provided with a DBMS.                                             [2]

     (b)   Database management systems allow data sharing and multiple views.   Explain why
           these features are important to an organization that uses databases.                            [4]

     (c)   Explain why it is important for data to be independent of the application software that
           manipulates it.                                                                                 [6]

A4. Meubles de France is a large company that manufactures and sells furniture.  It maintains a
    large factory and offices in Provence and over a hundred retail outlets.  It employs hundreds
    of workers.  It holds huge amounts of data on separate computer systems to handle:
     •     customer orders
     •     employees
     •     sales data
     •     production data
     •     finance
     •     budgeting.

     All these systems have been acquired from different software suppliers.  The management
     of Meubles de France has been advised that a data warehouse would be of great benefit to
     the business.

     (a)     (i)    Identify two characteristics of a data warehouse.                                     [2]

             (ii)   Identify four features of Meubles de France’s business that indicate the need for a
                    data warehouse.                                                                       [4]

             (iii) Identify four transformations that may be necessary in order to produce usable data
                   in a data warehouse.                                                                   [4]

     Meubles de France uses data mining to uncover patterns of consumer spending so they can
     optimise their marketing for future products and services.

     (b)     Contrast the use of association and cluster analysis for this purpose.                       [4]

     Many organizations such as Meubles de France use data mining to build a complex profile of
     its customers.

     (c)     Explain why civil liberty groups may be concerned about Meubles de France having such
             detailed information.                                                                        [6]




                                                                                                  Turn over

Option B — Modelling and Simulation

B1. Mathematical models are used to provide information to building designers.

     (a)   Identify two characteristics of a mathematical model.                                          [2]

     Any new building must be constructed to resist the force of a possible earthquake.   The
     force (V) that the building must resist in order to prevent collapse varies according to the
     following variables:

              Variable
              Z        The Earthquake zone (1–3) in which the building is constructed
              I        Importance of the building according to its intended use
                       (e.g. school, hospital, etc.)
              C        Structure index based on the dimensions, the weight and the shape
                       of the building
              R        Flexibility of the building

     A simplified version of V can be calculated by the formula:

                                           V = (Z * I * C) / R,

     where Z and I are given and the values of C and R are obtained from published tables.

     A building designer needs to be able to calculate the value of V for any one of a large number of
     buildings that is being designed.  Z is fixed for all buildings; I, C and R can vary from building
     to building.

     (b)   Outline why the use of a spreadsheet is appropriate for this modelling task.                   [2]

     (c)   Construct a diagram to show the way in which data and calculations would be implemented
           in a spreadsheet.                                                                              [4]

     (d)   Outline how data from the look up tables could be input into the spreadsheet.                  [4]

     Within a city in an earthquake zone there are many different designs of buildings.  It is decided
     to test all buildings for their resistance to a possible earthquake in that zone.

     (e)   Describe the data collection and data input needed to use the spreadsheet to test
           all buildings.                                                                                 [6]

B2. Despite many attempts, the simulation of an earthquake by computer has proved inaccurate and
    planned buildings are tested by making a physical model and applying the relevant forces to see
    if it can withstand an earthquake in the given zone.

     (a)   Explain the relationship between a simulation and mathematical modelling.                  [2]

     (b)   With reference to a simulation with which you are familiar, explain the importance of
           accurate rules and data in a simulation.                                                   [4]

      Simulation has proved successful in predicting weather patterns.

     (c)   Describe one advantage and one social consequence of using simulations for weather
           forecasting.                                                                               [4]

     To ensure that the emergency services could be located where they will be most needed a 2D
     visual model of likely danger areas, shown above, was created and distributed to surrounding
     areas in real time.

     (a)   Outline the ways in which visualization can be used to display the possible effects of the
           cyclone in real time.                                                                        [4]

     (b)   Explain the technical difficulties that could arise in data collection and processing when
           attempting to predict in real time.                                                          [4]

     (c)   Explain the advantages of using visualization in this case.                                  [6]

     (d)   Compare the use of 2D visualization with 3D visualization in this situation.                 [3]

B4. “Rescue robots capable of understanding the changing and unpredictable environment of disaster
    scenarios may one day be deployed to search for survivors in the aftermath of earthquakes.

     This is the vision of inventors Erwin Prassler and Ivan Bratko, who have developed a software
     algorithm that takes data from a robot’s sensors as it moves through an area to create models
     and predict how objects in the vicinity will change their position relative to its movements.

     Using the same algorithm, Bratko said that the robot can learn physical concepts such as
     whether an object is moveable and where it can be moved to.   He added that it also gives
     the robot the ability to learn ‘abstract concepts’ such as the structural stability of an object.”

                            [Source: http://www.theengineer.co.uk, 1 September 2010]

     In this question you can assume that the robot is equipped with distance and
     angle sensors.

     Robots involved in rescue are placed in an unknown environment and have to model
     the environment.  Part of this process involves genetic algorithms.

     (a)   Outline, using examples,         the    difference    between      supervised   learning    and
           unsupervised learning.                                                                            [4]

     (b)   Explain the way in which genetic algorithms help in the learning process.                         [6]

     (c)   Describe the way in which the robot could model the situation in which it finds itself.           [4]

     Once the robot has found a victim, it needs to communicate this information back to
     emergency services.

     (d)   Suggest ways in which the robot and human rescue workers could communicate to make
           a successful rescue of a person.                                                                  [6]

Option C — Web Science

C1. A publishing company, ABC Publications, based in London has a large IT department.  
    This department is responsible for:
     • providing IT services to the company
     • maintaining the company’s web site
     • creating and maintaining web based learning resources that are sold to schools
       and colleges.

     The company is finding it difficult to recruit and retain sufficient high quality IT staff to keep
     these functions operating at an optimal level.   It is investigating transferring at least part of
     its IT operations to a cloud computing solution.  At the moment it has not been decided how
     much of this should be implemented by a private cloud and how much by a public cloud.

     (a)   Define the term private cloud.                                                                 [1]

     (b)   Distinguish between a cloud computing model and a conventional client server model in
           providing computing services.                                                                  [4]

     (c)   Explain why ABC Publications might benefit from changing part of its IT provision to a
           cloud based model.                                                                             [4]

C2. A theatre box office maintains a web site that can display what productions are coming up
    and which seats are available for a particular production.   It can then take orders online.  
    The interface consists of dynamic web pages such as the one below, in which the underlying

(Question C2 continued)

     (d)   The organizers of the theatre want to ensure their web pages appear higher up the ranking
           of search engines.

           Suggest whether the use of meta-tags can help achieve this aim.                                  [4]

     (e)   It is common for dynamic web pages to make use of a mixture of client-side and
           server-side scripting.   Explain how the interaction of HTML, client-side and
           server-side scripting have allowed the production of a web page such as the one
           shown here.                                                                                      [6]


C3. As the web has developed, data formats, communication protocols and standards such as
    XML or SQL have proven crucial to progress.   Two fundamental concerns that have been
    central to this development are the issues of interoperability and that of open standards.

     (a)   (i)    Identify one characteristic of XML.                                                       [1]

           (ii)   Define the term protocol.                                                                 [1]

     (b)   Describe, with the use of examples, how the use of open standards allows interoperability
           to occur.                                                                                        [3]

     Music is distributed across the web in a variety of different ways such as peer-2-peer
     (P2P) networks.

     (c)   Discuss two factors that would affect the decision to use either lossless or lossy compression
           when transferring files across the Internet.                                                     [6]

     (d)   Explain one advantage of the use of a peer-2-peer (P2P) network for obtaining and
           downloading music and movie files.                                                               [2]

C4. The World Wide Web (web) can be regarded as a directed graph.  This allows search engines to
    make use of algorithms based on graph theory.

     (a)   Identify how the web may be represented as a directed graph.                                                       [1]

     The web can be represented as having a bowtie structure as indicated in the diagram below.

     (b)   (i)    Define the term Strongly Connected Core (SCC).                                                              [1]

           (ii)   Outline the characteristics of web sites that are located in the IN portion of
                  the bowtie.                                                                                                 [2]

     With the growth of the web, web site developers have realized that there are possible concerns
     about the ability of being able to link to all web pages as well as ensuring a page is highly
     ranked by search engines.

     (c)   Describe how power laws suggest it will be possible to link from one web page to any
           other web page despite the fact the web is growing so rapidly.                                                     [2]

     (d)   Explain how the relative importance of a web page can be determined in search engines.                             [4]

     The development of the web has changed the way that users interact with the web and with
     each other.

     (e)   With reference to specific examples, distinguish between an ontology and a folksonomy.                             [2]

     The growth of the web has enabled the development of new ways to solve problems.
     Collective intelligence is one such approach.

     (f)   Identify two characteristics of collective intelligence.                                                           [2]

     (g)   With the increasing world population and the effects of globalization, the world’s
           population is facing new and complex problems such as the recent banking crisis.  
           To what extent is it likely that collective intelligence could help to address
           these problems?                                                                    [6]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A bus company operates in a local city. The bus company operates along fixed routes where there are
marked stops and sometimes bus shelters for people to wait in out of the weather. People (passengers) pay
the driver a specified fare for travel when they enter a bus.

There are many objects in this company, here are some of them:

        Object      Description
        Bus         A physical vehicle that carries passengers on a specific route and has a driver.
        Passenger A person that travels on a bus.
        Route       A series of roads/streets the bus travels over from its start to its destination.
                    A named place on a route where people wait for a bus. May be a simple
        Bus Stop
                    marker or may have a shelter and seats.
        Driver      A person qualified to drive a bus and trained to drive it over a given route.


These two objects have already been defined for the bus company:

                BusRoute                                 Bus
                Integer: route                           Integer: id
                String: start                            String: driver
                setRoute(Integer: route)                 BusRoute: busRoute
                setStart(String: start)                  setId(Integer: id)
                Integer getRoute()                       setDriver(String: driver)
                String getStart()                        setBusRoute(BusRoute: route)
                String toString()                        Integer getId()
                                                         String getDriver()
                                                         BusRoute getBusRoute()
                                                         String toString()
                                              – 15 –            SPEC/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

The toString() method returns a String implementation of an object.

These are implemented in code as follows:

public class BusRoute
{
  private int route;
  private String start;
  public BusRoute(int r, String s)
  {
     setRoute(r);
     setStart(s);
  }
  public void setRoute(int r){ route = r; }
  public void setStart(String s){ start = s; }
  public int getRoute(){ return route; }
  public String getStart(){ return start; }
  public String toString()
  {
     return "Route: " + route + " start: " + start;
  }
}


public class Bus
{
  private int id;
  private String driver;
  private BusRoute busRoute;
  public Bus(int i, String d, BusRoute r)
  {
     setId(i);
     setDriver(d);
     setBusRoute(r);
  }
  public void setId(int i){ id = i; }
  public void setDriver(String d){ driver = d; }
  public void setBusRoute(BusRoute r){ busRoute = r; }
  public int getId(){ return id; }
  public String getDriver(){ return driver; }
  public BusRoute getBusRoute(){ return busRoute; }
  public String toString()
  {
     return "Bus id:" + id + " - " + driver + ": " + busRoute.toString();
  }
}




                                                                                   Turn over
                                                 – 16 –             SPEC/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

D1. (a)   Explain the term parameter variable, using an example from the code.                          [2]

    (b)   Describe one additional field that might have been included in the  BusRoute object/class.  
          Include data types and sample data.                                                          [2]

    (c)   Identify the output produced by the following code fragment.

          Bus bus = new Bus(1001, "N Prakesh", new BusRoute(431, "Klang"));
          System.out.println(bus.toString());                                                           [2]

    Consider the code fragment below.

    private static final int MAX_BUSES = 12;
    private Bus[] buses = new Bus[MAX_BUSES];
    buses[0] = new Bus(1001,  "N Prakesh",  new BusRoute(431,  "Klang"));
    buses[1] = new Bus(1010,  "J Carey",  new BusRoute(342,  "Tanglin"));
    buses[2] = new Bus(1014,  "H Lee",  new BusRoute(411,  "Queenstown"));
    buses[3] = new Bus(1015,  "K Peters",  new BusRoute(319,  "Jamaica Street"));

    showBusDrivers(buses, 1010);

    (d)   Construct the method  showBusDrivers(Bus[] b, int n) which lists the drivers for
          all buses with a route number less than or equal to the parameter variable (n).               [6]

    The company wishes to keep track of its drivers in more detail, including first and last name and
    employee number – this is a 4-digit whole number.

    (e)   Construct a suitable diagram for this  Driver object.                                         [3]
                                                  – 17 –              SPEC/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

D2. In relation to the Bus example:

     (a)   Outline how encapsulation is used.                                                           [2]

     (b)   Outline a disadvantage of using Object Oriented Design.                                      [2]

     (c)   Explain how a programming team could benefit from an Object Oriented Design approach.        [4]

     Recall that a Bus Stop is one of many named places on a route where buses stop to pick up or
     drop off passengers.  It may or may not have a shelter to protect passengers from the weather.  
     The distance in km from the start point of the Bus Route is important information for planning.

     (d)   Design the Bus Stop Object using a simple object diagram.                                    [3]

     (e)   Suggest how Bus Stop information for a given Bus Route instance could
           be stored, giving both sample data and sample code fragments to show how it could
           be implemented.                                                                              [4]


D3. The company grows, offers more routes of different types and decides to use three different
    types of bus:
     • A bus that operates on busy city routes – the Urban Bus – has only a driver.
     • A smaller bus that operates on longer country routes – it carries an additional person to
       collect the fares.
     • A van that can be used for heavy equipment deliveries rather than passengers – the Delivery
       Van – it carries a co-driver and a helper.

     These vehicles will have some things in common, such as a driver, and other elements
     that are different, for example both Urban and Rural buses will operate on a fixed route
     whereas the Delivery Van will take equipment to specified destinations (such as factories or
     other businesses).

     (a)   Construct diagrams to show how you would re-design the  Bus class to
           implement inheritance.                                                                       [8]

     (b)   Explain the advantage of inheritance for this situation.                                     [4]

     A method is required in the subclasses that returns the number of employees per vehicle.

D4. The bus company decides to run a simulation over a particular route to see what happens
    when several buses are started on the route a set time apart.  A queue will be used to hold the
    individual  Bus instances.

     (a)   Identify three features of a queue that make it suitable for this purpose.                   [3]

     (b)   Construct a diagram of the queue after the following code has been executed.

           public class BusSim
           {
             private LinkedList<Bus> busQueue;
               public static void main(String[] args){ new BusSim(); }
               public BusSim()
               {
                 // Create new LinkedList for Bus instances
                 busQueue = new LinkedList<Bus>();
                 BusRoute route = new BusRoute(903, "Nerang Creek Road");
                 Bus bus1 = new Bus(2011, "C Humbley", route);
                 Bus bus2 = new Bus(3943, "M Hillier", route);
                 Bus bus3 = new Bus(4923, "J Inglis", route);
                 busQueue.addFirst(bus1);
                 busQueue.addFirst(bus2);
                 busQueue.addFirst(bus3);
               }
           }                                                                                            [3]

     Recall that the method of the  LinkedList class  remove(int index) removes the element
     at the specified position in the list while the method size() returns the number of elements in
     the list.

     (c)   Construct the method  removeBus(int pos) which attempts to remove a bus from the
           queue at the specified position, and returns true if successful and false if it fails.       [4]

     A large company might have several hundred buses running.  Each one has a unique id stored
     with the  Bus instance.

     (d)   Explain how a binary tree could be used to store these ids such that they can be quickly
           retrieved (if they exist) by a search.                                                       [3]

     The tree stores the ids 2045, 3474, 5877, 1099, 9644.

     (e)   Draw a diagram of an ordered binary tree containing these keys assuming they were inserted
           in the order given.                                                                          [5]

     A binary tree node may be inserted iteratively or recursively.

     (f)   Identify two disadvantages of the recursive algorithm.                                       [2]

General Marking Instructions
These instructions should be read in conjunction with the examiner instructions on IBIS.

Once approved for marking, you can download up to 20 scripts into your worklist.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

2.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.


3.   For extended responses where markbands are used, it is helpful to write a brief comment indicating
     why the level was awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases write a brief annotation in the left-hand margin to explain your decision. You are
     encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity.

5.   Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the mark entry box.

7.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
     “seen” on each page where you have made no other mark.

8.   Examiners should be aware that in some cases candidates may take a different approach, which if
     appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt check with your Team Leader.

Subject Details:       Computer Science HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

For the option chosen candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same
        as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
        correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
        if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

General guidance

 Issue        Guidance
 Answering     In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than      maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity  In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses   e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include
 prescribed     two descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 in the        In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 questions      explanations e.g. “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

          (ii)   Award [1 mark] for an answer that only identifies either the nature of a
                 database state or a database schema. Award [2 marks] for an answer
                 that covers both the ideas in the points below.
                 State is the completed database with data;
                 Schema is the plans for the database;                                        [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           Different systems may attempt to access the same data at the same time;
           Both wanting to make updates;

           If one starts and then the second finished before the first is saved;
           This could potentially lead to inconsistent updates;

           Solution is to isolate the transactions;
           When one system is accessing the data, lock the transaction;
           Release it when transaction is committed;                                              [6 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for an explanation of why the feature is important;
           Answers may include:

           Data sharing allows use of the data by different users;
           and by different applications;
           Multiple views present different subsets of the data to different users;

           Award [2 marks] for a clear, detailed and balanced explanation;
           Answers may include:

           The organization uses a variety of applications for manipulating data;
           It may need to amend or add to these;
           Changes to applications may conflict with existing data structures;
           Applications may conflict with each other;
           Applications must therefore act through the DBMS;
           This imposes consistency on the way that the data is manipulated;
           Data integrity is maintained by the DBMS rather than the applications;
           Data structures do not necessarily need to be altered in order to accommodate
           new applications;

                Selecting only certain columns to load;
                Translating coded values (e.g. if the source system stores 1 for male and
                2 for female, but the warehouse stores M for male and F for female),
                this calls for automated data cleansing;
                Encoding free-form values (e.g. mapping “Male” to “1” and “Mr” to M);
                Deriving a new calculated value (e.g. sale_amount = qty * unit_price);

     (b)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
           Award [1 mark] for an outline of association;
           Award [1 mark] for an outline of cluster analysis;
           Award [2 marks] for a contrast between the two;
           The contrast should be awarded if the outlines between the two show clear
           difference. Accept examples for “Meubles de France” to show contrast.
           Answers may include:

           Association
           Looks at how entities/events are connected, and finds where one or more events
           may lead to another;
           May use examples linked to Meubles de France such as purchasing patterns of
           customers to assist in decision making;

           Cluster analysis
           Finds patterns in customer behavior by grouping and analyzing variables that
           connect them. Can find previously unknown links which help in decision
           making.
           May use examples linked to Meubles de France such as age of customers,
           amount spent on each visit, days of the week of visits, etc. to assist in decision
           making;

           The difference is that association looks to see if a set of events leads to another

           Award [3 marks] for each clear explanation of a consequence of data mining
           which could lead to an infringement of civil liberties.
           Answers may include:
           Data mining can reveal connections in personal data;
           Which could be misinterpreted/give a misleading data profile (shadow);
           Used for reasons that the individual does not know/would not want;

           Once the data is available, it may be hard to restrict access to it;
           There may be pressure from third parties to share the data for example from
           insurance companies or government agencies;
           Which is unknown/not wanted by the individual;

           The data may appear benign, but in the hands of a third party lead to
           unforeseen issues or when analysed provide information that may not be
           accessible from a standard query. Not all customers will be able to foresee the
           extent to which their data may be used;

           There may be mission creep and the reasons for the original data collection
           may be superseded meaning that the security of the data originally collected
           cannot be guaranteed;                                                                [6 marks]

B2. (a)   Computer simulation changes the values of variables in the model;
          To see the effect that the changes have on the model (or its outcomes);
          Award [1 mark] for the initial point and [1 mark] for any appropriate

          Award [1 mark] for type of data and rules inaccuracy;
          Award [1 mark] for an effect of inaccuracy;

          For example:
          In a traffic flow simulation a town planner may wish to restrict the traffic in a
          particular zone and sets up a simulation;
          Using a map of the town, traffic flows according to the known traffic density
          and direction;
          An out of date road plan is used and traffic flow simulated;
          (for example it is ignored that a new road is under construction that goes
          around the town). The results could cause the planner to set up expensive and
          unnecessary measures to restrict traffic in the town causing local unrest;
          In particular if the position of residents housing in the town was left out of the
          simulation these residents could find themselves unable to reach their own
          houses by car;                                                                       [4 marks]

    (c)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
          Award [2 marks] for a relevant advantage discussed;
          Award [2 marks] for a relevant social consequence discussed;

          Answers may include:
          Advantages – knowing the weather in advance makes it possible to plan events
          such as harvesting of crops, deciding to hold the school fête indoors instead of
          out of doors, etc.
          Predictions of drought or floods give organizations time to prepare to help with
          food aid or plan for evacuation.

          Social consequences – having life more easily planned for disasters makes for
          a secure environment.
          Lives can be saved if measures to cope with disasters are in place before
          they occur. Too much dependence could lead to misreading some of the
          known “weather symptoms”. The predictions are not perfect and a false sense
          of security could result in not being able to adapt to unexpected and
          unpredicted weather events.                                                          [4 marks]

          If only difficulties relating either to data collection or processing are addressed,
          award [3 marks max].

          The following points are likely to be included:
          Continual data collection from centre of cyclone difficult;
          Strength of cyclone needs to be recorded and transmitted which may not show
          on satellite picture;
          Transmission could be broken (unclear/interrupted) by the effect of the cyclone;
          Inaccurate data fed into the model would give false results;
          Real-time processing needs fast powerful computers;
          Which may not be readily available at the start of the cyclone;
          Computer resources need to be distributed to avoid losing the information in
          case of failure;                                                                         [4 marks]

          Visualization gives a quick way of seeing where the dangers are now and
          where they are likely to be;
          No need to interpret figures so time is saved;
          Location where rescue/support services are needed now and in near future are
          shown;
          Emergency services hence more effective and dangers to people can be
          minimized;

Question B3 continued

     (d)   2D visualization is more rapid than 3D as the calculations are less complex and
           speed is necessary in this situation;

           3D also requires more powerful computers which could be difficult to find in a
           situation that requires a distribution of computers;

           Some aspects on the effect of the cyclone such as in a mountainous area would
           be visualized in 3D but not in 2D visualization;

           Potential difficulty in arriving at an area due to damage could be seen in 3D but
           not 2D;

B4. (a)    In supervised learning the goal, or pattern, is known in advance;
           For example in optical character recognition where the set of characters is
           known in advance;
           Unsupervised learning involves finding unknown solutions, patterns or
           conditions;

          Award [2 marks] for the difference between lossy and lossless compression;
          Award [2 marks] for a relative example for each;
          Award [2 marks] for the reason for using lossy or lossless in the example;

          Answers may include:
          Lossless compression is used when loss of data is unacceptable when
          transferring files such as audio files;
          Lossy compression may not significantly affect the final version of the file
          when it is decompressed;
          Lossy compression will reduce file size;
          Reduced file size may be an important requirement such as in the use of MP3
          music files;
          Lossy compression results in faster file transfer;
          Which is important when Internet connections are slow or files are large;
          If lossy compression is used the original file cannot be reinstated;
          Also characteristics of the data itself (e.g. frequencies too high for human hearing)
          could be introduced.                                                                      [6 marks]

           Accept either an explanation of the HITS or an explanation of Google
           PageRank.
           For example:
           Search engines use algorithms such as the Google PageRank or HITS to
           determine the ranking of any web page;
           The Google PageRank calculates the rank as follows:
           Rank is determined by number of votes for it. This is based on the number of
           “in” links and importance of pages voting for it;
           Page rank uses a recursive algorithm;
           However, some web masters use link farms to “artificially” raise the rank of
           the web page, some algorithms remove this information before calculating
           the rank;

           HITS (hyperlink-induced topic search) is based on the following principles:
            Websites may be hubs (point to lots of authorities) or authorities (are
             pointed to by a number of hubs);

           The HITS algorithm calculates the rank as follows:
            Determines a base set of web sites (a closed network)
            From this set a number of pages are located by a search engine to form a
             root
            Add to S all pages pointed to by any page in R
            Add to S all pages that point to any page in R
            Maintain for each page p in S:
             o Authority score: ap (vector a)
             o Hub score: hp (vector h)
            Calculate the authority weighting for each web page
            Calculate the hub weighting for each web page
            Normalizes the values;                                                         [4 marks]

           An ontology is the formal description of the concepts and relationships that
           exist within a specified domain of discourse.
           “A folksonomy is a type of distributed classification system. It is usually
           created by a group of individuals, typically the resource users. Users add tags
           to online items, such as images, videos, bookmarks and text. These tags are
           then shared and sometimes refined.”
           Folksonomies may be imprecise and informal, developing organically through
           social networking.                                                                  [2 marks]

           Award [2 marks] for a conclusion and/or judgments based on the given
           advantages and disadvantages (may be incorporated into the body of the
           answer);
           Advantages of collective intelligence:
           Information can be easily shared, may prevent unnecessary duplication of data;
           Advancements may be rapid as large number of contributors may be involved,
           for example sites like Wikipedia may be considered as being developed
           through collective intelligence;
           The total sum may be greater than the sum of the parts;
           The project may develop further as many collaborators may freely add
           information therefore being more cost efficient than traditional methods of
           resolving problems;

           Disadvantages of collective intelligence:
           Too much information may be submitted;
           The “group” may be informal so relevant information may not be processed as
           required;
           The “group” may become unwieldy through too many contributors or lack
           motivation as there may be no designated project manager;
           Knowledge may be developed without suitable checking mechanisms to ensure
           it is correct, decisions may be based on a consensus which may not be
           appropriate;                                                                     [6 marks]

General Marking Instructions

1.    Once markscheme is received mark in pencil until final markscheme is received.

2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left-hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.

5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.    Record subtotals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.

8.    Total:      Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
                  Column on the cover sheet.

9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.

10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.

11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details:              Computer Science HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions.
Maximum total = [30 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have
        got wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of
        minor linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than
        grammatical accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

           Which can be retrieved with special software;
           A “forensic wipe” will erase all data;
           By writing (a series of zeros) over every sector;                               [4 marks max]

     (b)   Award up to [4 marks max].

           By means of identity theft / use of bank passwords for fraud;
           Publishing of confidential data to embarrass the owner;
           Such as criminal record/details of affairs, etc.
           Use of medical data against owner;
           By insurance company to increase premiums / affect job applications, etc.    [4 marks max]


3.   Award marks as follows up to [6 marks max]:
     Award [1 mark] for a descriptive of each distinctly different type of evidence,
     and [1 mark] for an explanation of its importance. Only allow [3 marks] for different
     types of evidence.

     Programs/files running in main memory may not have been saved and will be lost if the
     computer is switched off. They may contain incriminating data or messages.

     There may be secondary memory away from the computer, e.g. flash memory, disks,
     which contain vital files.

     Passwords may have been written on “sticky notes” or notepads, which would speed up
     access to computer files.

     Print-outs should be collected as they may contain evidence of files no longer on the
     hard drive.

     Telephone answering machines should be checked for incriminating messages.

     Photographing the scene may provide clues later on that were initially missed.        [6 marks max]

4.   Answers may include:

     Measures:

     1.   Steganography

          This refers to the hiding of information or files inside other innocent appearing files,
          e.g. text within a graphic file or a picture within a video file. This is better than
          encrypting files as attention will not be drawn to an ordinary document or file,
          whereas an encrypted file will certainly be noticed. Image files are particularly
          good as they are relatively large, and by the alteration of a few specific bytes a
          message can be included without adversely affecting the actual image.

     2.   Changing the file extension

          When files are saved, the program being used saves the file with the appropriate file
          extension e.g. a word-processing file might be given the extension .doc, a graphics
          file the extension .jpg, etc. However, these extensions can be manually changed, thus
          circumventing any search based upon that particular file extension. So, changing all
          image files to have a .doc extension would suggest at first glance suggest that no
          images are present. Changing the file extension also causes the operating system to
          display the appropriate (but incorrect) icon (including a thumbnail).

     3.   Renaming of files

          File names can be changed to suggest more innocent sounding subjects than their
          contents might actually merit. Points 2 and 3 together mean that time consuming
          counter measures must be taken.

     Counter measures:

     1.   Steganographic software has been developed which searches for hidden files
          (steganalysis). One such technique would be to compare a known good copy of
          the file with the suspect one.

     2/3. Search for images by the contents of the file.

          File signatures can be searched for. Each file type has a specific file signature that
          is unaltered by any manual changing of the file extension or renaming of the file.
          This signature will be positioned as the header or footer in the file. The signature
          is normally 1 byte.

          Hash analysis, which does not include the file’s metadata can be used when
          searching for a specific file. For this type of analysis the hash is created by
          adding together all of the bytes that code the data in a file. If a specific file is
          being searched for then its hash value will be known and can be checked against
          the hashes of the file present. This procedure is also useful for eliminating known

General Marking Instructions
1.    Once markscheme is received mark in pencil until final markscheme is received.

2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.

5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.    Record sub-totals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.

8.    Section A: Add together the total for the section and write it in the Examiner Column on the cover
                 sheet.
      Section B: Record the mark awarded for each of the six questions answered in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.
      Total:     Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
                 Column on the cover sheet.

9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.

10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.

11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left hand margin.

Subject Details:             Computer Science SL Paper 1 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Section A:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
              Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
        correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

General guidance

Issue          Guidance
Answering       In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
more than        maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
the quantity    In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
of responses     e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
prescribed       descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
in the          In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
questions        explanations e.g. “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                 This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

           Incompatible formats of data: The new system may store data in a format
           different from that used in the old system. This might be a simple matter of
           translation, such as converting integers to decimals. It could also be very
           difficult if the new system stores more detailed data than the old system, such
           as the date and time of each transaction while the old system stored only the
           date.
           Data lost in migration: Data might be lost due to errors in the translation
           process or because perfect translations simply are not possible, e.g. if the old
           system stored ratings on a scale of 1–5 while the new system stored only 1–3.
           The systems may be unavailable during the migration process; one way to
           avoid having two systems with incompatible data is to shut down the business,
           perform the migration, and then restart with the new system. If the migration
           takes a long time however, shutting down the business for that time may be
           undesirable.
           New data may continue coming in during the migration process; if the business
           is not shut down during the migration process, transactions will either have to
           be performed on the new system without the old data being available or they
           will have to be performed on the old system which will add to the data needing
           to be migrated.                                                                     [6 marks]

            Concurrent processing means to do more than one activity at the same time;               [1 mark]

      (b)   Award [1 mark] for a pair of tasks correctly identified.
            Install plumbing and install electrical systems;                                         [1 mark]

      (c)   Award [1 mark] for a pair of tasks correctly identified.
            Any two tasks in which one cannot begin before the other is completed:
            Digging the foundation and building the floors;
            Building the walls and building the roof;
            Building the roof and plastering the walls;                                              [1 mark]

      (d)   Award [1 mark] for identifying a task as composed of subtasks.
            Award [1 mark] for describing some reasonable set of subtasks.
            Describe one of the tasks as being composed of subtasks:
            Build the floors: Install the beams, install the joists, install the subfloor, install
            the finish floor.
            Paint the walls: Mask off things not to paint, cover floors, select paint colours,
            paint trim, paint walls, paint ceilings.
            Landscaping: Plan the plantings, get the plants, dig holes, plant things, seed the
            lawn, install lighting.                                                                  [2 marks]

      (e)   Award [1 mark] each for the identification of an advantage and a disadvantage.
            Award up to [2 marks] for explaining the advantage and disadvantage.

            Advantages:
            Building could be finished faster; By doing some tasks concurrently, the
            overall time needed to complete the building will be reduced. Since
            construction workers are paid by the hour, getting the building done sooner
            will reduce the cost of the building.

            Disadvantages:
            Workers on concurrent tasks may get in each other’s way; If the plumbers and
            the electricians are both working at the same time and both need to get at the
            same place at the same time, one will have to wait. Thus, it may take longer to
            do the electrical work while the plumbing is being done than it would take to
            do it alone.
            Harder to supervise; The supervisor needs to look at the work being done and
            make sure that its being done correctly and explain what needs to be done, etc.
            If there are two (or more) sets of workers the supervisor will have to work
            harder to watch both of them at the same time.                                           [4 marks]

      (f)   Award [1 mark] for identifying an application.
            Award an additional [1 mark] for outlining a task carried out by the
            application.
            The word processor: counting the number of words in the document.
            The browser: Interpreting the HTML to figure out what to display.
            The downloading program: Calculating the amount of time remaining to
            complete the download.                                                                   [2 marks]

           components simplifies application programming.
           Award an additional [1 mark] for a description of the idea identified above or
           the identification of a second idea up to [2 marks max].
           Application developers do not have to implement basic GUI components.
           All applications use the same basic GUI elements resulting in a better user
           experience.
           The operating system coordinates GUI elements for all applications reducing
           the need for developers to do so.
           Application code is much smaller since all the GUI-related code is in a
           standard library.                                                                [2 marks]

(Question A1 continued)

     The Human Resources Department is experiencing many errors when compiling reports of
     personnel and has been advised that it should change to a relational database.

     (a)   (i)    Define the term database.                                                                   [1]

           (ii)   Describe the difference between a  flat file database and a relational database.            [2]

     (b)   (i)    Identify two problems caused by data redundancy.                                            [2]

           (ii)   Outline using examples how data redundancy in this database could lead to errors.           [2]

     (c)   The departments usually have many ongoing projects that occupy their team members.  
           The Human Resources Department needs to produce lists showing who is involved in
           current projects.

           The following information has been provided:
           Project: Project_Ref, Project_Name, Budget
           Department: Dept_Ref, Dept_Name
           Staff: Staff_Number, Forename, Surname, Job_Title, Salary
           The projects are owned by a department.
           Each member of staff is a member of a department.

           (i)    Construct an Entity Relationship Diagram to show how a relational database could
                  be designed to make this possible with the least chance of producing errors caused
                  by data redundancy.                                                                         [4]

           (ii)   Identify the steps to create a query that could be constructed to produce a list of staff
                  members whose salary is greater than $50 000 who are involved in a project called
                  “Relocation_2012”.                                                                          [4]




                                                                                                     Turn over
                                                   –4–                 SPEC/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

A2. A bank wants to transfer money from one account to another.  Both accounts are held in the
    bank’s database management system (DBMS).   The account DBMS carries out a series of
    separate operations in order to achieve this transaction.  These include removing of money from
    one account and adding it to the other.  An error may occur if this process is interrupted, for
    example due to a power failure.  This could compromise the integrity of the account database.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a transaction in terms of a database.                    [2]

           (ii)   Distinguish between a database schema and a database state.                              [2]

           (iii) Explain why the interruption described above could compromise the integrity of the
                 account database.                                                                         [2]

     (b)   Identify the steps that should be taken by the software in order to maintain the integrity of
           the account database.                                                                           [4]

     (c)   The bank account data is shared between various applications, such as the bank’s
           internal accounting systems and the online transaction system.  Explain how problems of
           concurrency can arise and how they can be avoided.                                              [6]


A3. (a)    (i)    Identify two functions of a database management system (DBMS).                           [2]

           (ii)   List two tools usually provided with a DBMS.                                             [2]

     (b)   Database management systems allow data sharing and multiple views.   Explain why
           these features are important to an organization that uses databases.                            [4]

     (c)   Explain why it is important for data to be independent of the application software that
           manipulates it.                                                                                 [6]

Option B — Modelling and Simulation

B1. Mathematical models are used to provide information to building designers.

     (a)   Identify two characteristics of a mathematical model.                                          [2]

     Any new building must be constructed to resist the force of a possible earthquake.   The
     force (V) that the building must resist in order to prevent collapse varies according to the
     following variables:

              Variable
              Z        The Earthquake zone (1–3) in which the building is constructed
              I        Importance of the building according to its intended use
                       (e.g. school, hospital, etc.)
              C        Structure index based on the dimensions, the weight and the shape
                       of the building
              R        Flexibility of the building

     A simplified version of V can be calculated by the formula:

                                           V = (Z * I * C) / R,

     where Z and I are given and the values of C and R are obtained from published tables.

     A building designer needs to be able to calculate the value of V for any one of a large number of
     buildings that is being designed.  Z is fixed for all buildings; I, C and R can vary from building
     to building.

     (b)   Outline why the use of a spreadsheet is appropriate for this modelling task.                   [2]

     (c)   Construct a diagram to show the way in which data and calculations would be implemented
           in a spreadsheet.                                                                              [4]

     (d)   Outline how data from the look up tables could be input into the spreadsheet.                  [4]

     Within a city in an earthquake zone there are many different designs of buildings.  It is decided
     to test all buildings for their resistance to a possible earthquake in that zone.

     (e)   Describe the data collection and data input needed to use the spreadsheet to test
           all buildings.                                                                                 [6]




                                                                                                  Turn over
                                                  –6–               SPEC/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

B2. Despite many attempts, the simulation of an earthquake by computer has proved inaccurate and
    planned buildings are tested by making a physical model and applying the relevant forces to see
    if it can withstand an earthquake in the given zone.

     (a)   Explain the relationship between a simulation and mathematical modelling.                  [2]

     (b)   With reference to a simulation with which you are familiar, explain the importance of
           accurate rules and data in a simulation.                                                   [4]

      Simulation has proved successful in predicting weather patterns.

     (c)   Describe one advantage and one social consequence of using simulations for weather
           forecasting.                                                                               [4]

B3. Cyclone Yasi hit Northern Australia in February 2011.  There were many after effects such as
    flooding and landslides.

     To ensure that the emergency services could be located where they will be most needed a 2D
     visual model of likely danger areas, shown above, was created and distributed to surrounding
     areas in real time.

     (a)   Outline the ways in which visualization can be used to display the possible effects of the
           cyclone in real time.                                                                              [4]

Option C — Web Science

C1. A publishing company, ABC Publications, based in London has a large IT department.  
    This department is responsible for:
     • providing IT services to the company
     • maintaining the company’s web site
     • creating and maintaining web based learning resources that are sold to schools
       and colleges.

     The company is finding it difficult to recruit and retain sufficient high quality IT staff to keep
     these functions operating at an optimal level.   It is investigating transferring at least part of
     its IT operations to a cloud computing solution.  At the moment it has not been decided how
     much of this should be implemented by a private cloud and how much by a public cloud.

     (a)   Define the term private cloud.                                                                 [1]

     (b)   Distinguish between a cloud computing model and a conventional client server model in
           providing computing services.                                                                  [4]

     (c)   Explain why ABC Publications might benefit from changing part of its IT provision to a
           cloud based model.                                                                             [4]

     (d)   Comment on the privacy and security issues relating to ABC’s use of cloud computing.           [4]

C2. A theatre box office maintains a web site that can display what productions are coming up
    and which seats are available for a particular production.   It can then take orders online.  
    The interface consists of dynamic web pages such as the one below, in which the underlying
    HTML interacts with client-side and server-side scripts.

(Question C2 continued)

     (d)   The organizers of the theatre want to ensure their web pages appear higher up the ranking
           of search engines.

           Suggest whether the use of meta-tags can help achieve this aim.                                  [4]

     (e)   It is common for dynamic web pages to make use of a mixture of client-side and
           server-side scripting.   Explain how the interaction of HTML, client-side and
           server-side scripting have allowed the production of a web page such as the one
           shown here.                                                                                      [6]


C3. As the web has developed, data formats, communication protocols and standards such as
    XML or SQL have proven crucial to progress.   Two fundamental concerns that have been
    central to this development are the issues of interoperability and that of open standards.

     (a)   (i)    Identify one characteristic of XML.                                                       [1]

           (ii)   Define the term protocol.                                                                 [1]

     (b)   Describe, with the use of examples, how the use of open standards allows interoperability
           to occur.                                                                                        [3]

     Music is distributed across the web in a variety of different ways such as peer-2-peer
     (P2P) networks.

     (c)   Discuss two factors that would affect the decision to use either lossless or lossy compression
           when transferring files across the Internet.                                                     [6]

     (d)   Explain one advantage of the use of a peer-2-peer (P2P) network for obtaining and

Option D — Object-oriented programming

A bus company operates in a local city. The bus company operates along fixed routes where there are
marked stops and sometimes bus shelters for people to wait in out of the weather. People (passengers) pay
the driver a specified fare for travel when they enter a bus.

There are many objects in this company, here are some of them:

        Object      Description
        Bus         A physical vehicle that carries passengers on a specific route and has a driver.
        Passenger A person that travels on a bus.
        Route       A series of roads/streets the bus travels over from its start to its destination.
                    A named place on a route where people wait for a bus. May be a simple
        Bus Stop
                    marker or may have a shelter and seats.
        Driver      A person qualified to drive a bus and trained to drive it over a given route.


These two objects have already been defined for the bus company:

                BusRoute                                 Bus
                Integer: route                           Integer: id
                String: start                            String: driver
                setRoute(Integer: route)                 BusRoute: busRoute
                setStart(String: start)                  setId(Integer: id)
                Integer getRoute()                       setDriver(String: driver)
                String getStart()                        setBusRoute(BusRoute: route)
                String toString()                        Integer getId()
                                                         String getDriver()
                                                         BusRoute getBusRoute()
                                                         String toString()




                                                                                                    Turn over
                                              – 12 –            SPEC/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

The toString() method returns a String implementation of an object.

These are implemented in code as follows:

public class BusRoute
{
  private int route;
  private String start;
  public BusRoute(int r, String s)
  {
     setRoute(r);
     setStart(s);
  }
  public void setRoute(int r){ route = r; }
  public void setStart(String s){ start = s; }
  public int getRoute(){ return route; }
  public String getStart(){ return start; }
  public String toString()
  {
     return "Route: " + route + " start: " + start;
  }
}


public class Bus
{
  private int id;
  private String driver;
  private BusRoute busRoute;
  public Bus(int i, String d, BusRoute r)
  {
     setId(i);
     setDriver(d);
     setBusRoute(r);
  }
  public void setId(int i){ id = i; }
  public void setDriver(String d){ driver = d; }
  public void setBusRoute(BusRoute r){ busRoute = r; }
  public int getId(){ return id; }
  public String getDriver(){ return driver; }
  public BusRoute getBusRoute(){ return busRoute; }
  public String toString()
  {
     return "Bus id:" + id + " - " + driver + ": " + busRoute.toString();
  }
}
                                                 – 13 –             SPEC/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

D1. (a)   Explain the term parameter variable, using an example from the code.                          [2]

    (b)   Describe one additional field that might have been included in the  BusRoute object/class.  
          Include data types and sample data.                                                          [2]

    (c)   Identify the output produced by the following code fragment.

          Bus bus = new Bus(1001, "N Prakesh", new BusRoute(431, "Klang"));
          System.out.println(bus.toString());                                                           [2]

    Consider the code fragment below.

    private static final int MAX_BUSES = 12;
    private Bus[] buses = new Bus[MAX_BUSES];
    buses[0] = new Bus(1001,  "N Prakesh",  new BusRoute(431,  "Klang"));
    buses[1] = new Bus(1010,  "J Carey",  new BusRoute(342,  "Tanglin"));
    buses[2] = new Bus(1014,  "H Lee",  new BusRoute(411,  "Queenstown"));
    buses[3] = new Bus(1015,  "K Peters",  new BusRoute(319,  "Jamaica Street"));

    showBusDrivers(buses, 1010);

    (d)   Construct the method  showBusDrivers(Bus[] b, int n) which lists the drivers for
          all buses with a route number less than or equal to the parameter variable (n).               [6]

    The company wishes to keep track of its drivers in more detail, including first and last name and
    employee number – this is a 4-digit whole number.

    (e)   Construct a suitable diagram for this  Driver object.                                         [3]




                                                                                                Turn over
                                                  – 14 –              SPEC/4/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

D2. In relation to the Bus example:

     (a)   Outline how encapsulation is used.                                                           [2]

     (b)   Outline a disadvantage of using Object Oriented Design.                                      [2]

     (c)   Explain how a programming team could benefit from an Object Oriented Design approach.        [4]

     Recall that a Bus Stop is one of many named places on a route where buses stop to pick up or
     drop off passengers.  It may or may not have a shelter to protect passengers from the weather.  
     The distance in km from the start point of the Bus Route is important information for planning.

     (d)   Design the Bus Stop Object using a simple object diagram.                                    [3]

     (e)   Suggest how Bus Stop information for a given Bus Route instance could
           be stored, giving both sample data and sample code fragments to show how it could
           be implemented.                                                                              [4]


D3. The company grows, offers more routes of different types and decides to use three different
    types of bus:
     • A bus that operates on busy city routes – the Urban Bus – has only a driver.
     • A smaller bus that operates on longer country routes – it carries an additional person to
       collect the fares.
     • A van that can be used for heavy equipment deliveries rather than passengers – the Delivery
       Van – it carries a co-driver and a helper.

     These vehicles will have some things in common, such as a driver, and other elements
     that are different, for example both Urban and Rural buses will operate on a fixed route
     whereas the Delivery Van will take equipment to specified destinations (such as factories or
     other businesses).

     (a)   Construct diagrams to show how you would re-design the  Bus class to
           implement inheritance.                                                                       [8]

     (b)   Explain the advantage of inheritance for this situation.                                     [4]

     A method is required in the subclasses that returns the number of employees per vehicle.

     (c)   Outline how polymorphism might apply in this design.                                         [3]

These instructions should be read in conjunction with the examiner instructions on IBIS.

Once approved for marking, you can download up to 20 scripts into your worklist.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

2.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

3.   For extended responses where markbands are used, it is helpful to write a brief comment indicating
     why the level was awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases write a brief annotation in the left-hand margin to explain your decision. You are
     encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity.

5.   Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the mark entry box.

7.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
     “seen” on each page where you have made no other mark.

8.   Examiners should be aware that in some cases candidates may take a different approach, which if
     appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt check with your Team Leader.

Subject Details:       Computer Science SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

For the option chosen candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same
        as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
        correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However,
        if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

General guidance

 Issue        Guidance
 Answering     In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than      maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity  In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of responses   e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include
 prescribed     two descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 in the        In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 questions      explanations e.g. “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

           Both wanting to make updates;

           If one starts and then the second finished before the first is saved;
           This could potentially lead to inconsistent updates;

           Solution is to isolate the transactions;
           When one system is accessing the data, lock the transaction;
           Release it when transaction is committed;                                              [6 marks]

           Answers may include:

           The organization uses a variety of applications for manipulating data;
           It may need to amend or add to these;
           Changes to applications may conflict with existing data structures;
           Applications may conflict with each other;
           Applications must therefore act through the DBMS;
           This imposes consistency on the way that the data is manipulated;
           Data integrity is maintained by the DBMS rather than the applications;
           Data structures do not necessarily need to be altered in order to accommodate
           new applications;                                                                 [6 marks]

          Award [1 mark] for type of data and rules inaccuracy;
          Award [1 mark] for an effect of inaccuracy;

          For example:
          In a traffic flow simulation a town planner may wish to restrict the traffic in a
          particular zone and sets up a simulation;
          Using a map of the town, traffic flows according to the known traffic density
          and direction;
          An out of date road plan is used and traffic flow simulated;
          (for example it is ignored that a new road is under construction that goes
          around the town). The results could cause the planner to set up expensive and
          unnecessary measures to restrict traffic in the town causing local unrest;
          In particular if the position of residents housing in the town was left out of the
          simulation these residents could find themselves unable to reach their own
          houses by car;                                                                       [4 marks]

    (c)   Award marks as follows up to [4 marks max].
          Award [2 marks] for a relevant advantage discussed;
          Award [2 marks] for a relevant social consequence discussed;

          Answers may include:
          Advantages – knowing the weather in advance makes it possible to plan events
          such as harvesting of crops, deciding to hold the school fête indoors instead of
          out of doors, etc.
          Predictions of drought or floods give organizations time to prepare to help with
          food aid or plan for evacuation.

          Social consequences – having life more easily planned for disasters makes for
          a secure environment.
          Lives can be saved if measures to cope with disasters are in place before
          they occur. Too much dependence could lead to misreading some of the
          known “weather symptoms”. The predictions are not perfect and a false sense
          of security could result in not being able to adapt to unexpected and
          unpredicted weather events.                                                          [4 marks]

          If only difficulties relating either to data collection or processing are addressed,
          award [3 marks max].

          The following points are likely to be included:
          Continual data collection from centre of cyclone difficult;
          Strength of cyclone needs to be recorded and transmitted which may not show
          on satellite picture;
          Transmission could be broken (unclear/interrupted) by the effect of the cyclone;
          Inaccurate data fed into the model would give false results;
          Real-time processing needs fast powerful computers;
          Which may not be readily available at the start of the cyclone;
          Computer resources need to be distributed to avoid losing the information in
          case of failure;                                                                         [4 marks]

Question B3 continued

     (d)   2D visualization is more rapid than 3D as the calculations are less complex and
           speed is necessary in this situation;

           3D also requires more powerful computers which could be difficult to find in a
           situation that requires a distribution of computers;

           Some aspects on the effect of the cyclone such as in a mountainous area would
           be visualized in 3D but not in 2D visualization;

           Potential difficulty in arriving at an area due to damage could be seen in 3D but
           not 2D;

           They are embedded in HTML code can be read by search engines;
           This can help their ranking;
           Search engines have become more sophisticated;
           They no longer place a high value on the content of meta tags;
           As they are not always a reliable guide to the web page’s content;
           Search engines now use other parameters;

           The handling of inputs;
           The retrieval of information from databases;
           The performing of calculations;
           Scripts will be written in languages such as PHP;
           Server-side scripts are hidden from users and therefore secure;
           The server sends data to the browser (client) in HTML;

          Award [2 marks] for a relative example for each;
          Award [2 marks] for the reason for using lossy or lossless in the example;

          Answers may include:
          Lossless compression is used when loss of data is unacceptable when
          transferring files such as audio files;
          Lossy compression may not significantly affect the final version of the file
          when it is decompressed;
          Lossy compression will reduce file size;
          Reduced file size may be an important requirement such as in the use of MP3
          music files;
          Lossy compression results in faster file transfer;
          Which is important when Internet connections are slow or files are large;
          If lossy compression is used the original file cannot be reinstated;
          Also characteristics of the data itself (e.g. frequencies too high for human hearing)
          could be introduced.                                                                  [6 marks]

Introduction

Computer forensics is a branch of computer security which specializes in the analysis of computer systems,
in order to provide evidence of computer misuse or attacks on computers.

The ordinary desk top computer stores a considerable amount of data that was never consciously put there
by its user.  This can range from cookies, to print and email logs and browsing history.  These will be stored
in files (some hidden) which can be reasonably easily accessed.  However, it can also preserve data that has
supposedly been deleted or even previous versions of files which have subsequently been updated.  The fact
that data should be so resistant to deletion should concern not only the cyber-criminal but also businesses
and individuals who wish to permanently delete data or recycle their computers.  Users should be aware that
only a “forensic wipe” will effectively erase all data on their hard drives.

The rest of the case study investigates the work of John Martin, a fictitious computer forensic scientist.


Your Secrets Revealed Inc.

John Martin is employed by the computer security company Your Secrets Revealed Inc.  This company
has two divisions: one which acts as security consultants to advise on computer security systems, and one
which specializes in computer forensics.  John is employed in the forensics division, and although he was
already an experienced computer user, he had to undergo extensive training both in the techniques and
the software tools used to locate and identify incriminating evidence, and in procedures that had to be
rigorously followed in order that evidence might be accepted in court.

One training exercise involved investigating the following scenario:

“The home of a person suspected of organizing the illegal distribution of drugs was raided and the suspect
apprehended.  The suspect’s PC, which was still switched on, was equipped with both an internet connection
and a web cam.  The information that led to the house being raided had come about from the interception of
a telephone call which had made reference to certain names associated with the illegal drug trade.”

John’s task was to search the computer system and the surrounding area for electronic information that might
incriminate the suspect.  He was provided with various tools supplied by the company.  His tasks included
securing and evaluating the scene, conducting preliminary interviews, documenting the incident, collecting
the evidence and packaging and transporting the evidence.  His first action was to turn all equipment off and
then carefully remove the computer’s hard drive ready for transport to the company’s laboratories.

John has since been involved in various investigations including:
•   employee Internet abuse
•   criminal fraud
•   industrial espionage
•   unauthorized disclosure
•   child pornography
•   identity fraud.
                                                    –3–            SPEC/4/COMSC/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

The industrial espionage case was of particular interest as the company was convinced that a rival firm
had stolen their ideas, but had no concrete evidence that would show this.  The company’s main server
was subsequently analysed by Your Secrets Revealed Inc. who found that “back-door” remote access had
been installed.  Further to this the forensics team discovered keystroke loggers had been installed which
could relay data entered into the system via the Internet to a third party.  The third party was identified and
found to indeed be one of their rivals who were trying to steal intellectual property from the company.

The company Your Secrets Revealed Inc. was then contracted to update their security system, particularly
with respect to preventing unauthorized outside access.

John’s current investigation involves the search for illegal images on a computer.  The suspect’s computer
was found switched off.  Also, no network hardware was found in the house.  A typical hard disk can
contain thousands of files so after taking an exact copy of the suspect hard disk, John’s first task was to
filter out all known files (on the copy) using a hash analysis.  It is essential not to manipulate the original
disk in any way.

Files with the usual image extensions were located using the computer’s file manager in the normal way
(the operating system was found to be Windows XP), but no incriminating evidence was found.

As the files that he was looking for did not immediately appear, a more complicated analysis would
now have to be made which would involve searching for files that had been disguised in some way.  
Criminals will often attempt to hide files.  A further step that might reveal evidence would be to investigate
both unallocated space and slack space that is present on the disk.


Challenges Faced

John and his team must focus on the following challenges:

• To ensure that they follow all the correct procedures so that any evidence discovered would be admissible
  in subsequent legal proceedings.

• To discover all relevant files on a computer system that the user may have attempted to delete.

• To discover all relevant files on a computer system that the user may have attempted to hide or disguise
  in some way.
