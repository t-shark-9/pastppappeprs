Subject Details: Sports, Exercise and Health Science SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                            SECTION A
1.   (a)   distance running                                                                       [1]

     (b)   the breakdown of glucose to pyruvate without the use of oxygen / is an anaerobic
           pathway;
           pyruvate is converted into lactic acid;
           two/three ATP molecules produced;
           generally used for high to medium intensity activities lasting no longer than
           two minutes;                                                                       [2 max]

     (c)   Award [2 max] for characteristics:
            ATP  enzyme  ADP  Pi  energy  contraction;
           fuel source is creatine phosphate/phosphocreatine/CP/PC;
           amount of ATP production is limited;
           energy released by the breakdown of phosphocreatine rebuilds/resynthesis ATP/to
           couple Pi to ADP forming ATP;
           no by-products;
           the potential rate for power output is at its greatest;
           quickly forms new ATP;
           once exhausted, can be replenished after 30 seconds to two minutes rest;

           Award [1 max] for relative contribution:
           the ATP-CP system is the main energy source for ATP in activities of very short
           duration/3–15 seconds;
           gymnastics involves short sharp bursts of power and strength so the relative
           contribution of the ATP-CP system is high/80 %;                                    [3 max]
                                             –7–                M13/4/SPEXS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   during distance running the three energy systems will be in action with different
      contributions / OWTTE;
      the anaerobic systems will produce small amounts of energy during distance
      running when large muscle power outputs during brief intense periods are
      required for example at the start of the event/during an increase in pace towards
      the end where the runner may sprint/during an uphill stage/when over-taking
      another runner;
      the anaerobic energy systems will be limited, however, by the amount of energy it
      can produce;
      the build-up of lactic acid and a quick depletion of CP will bring about a reduction
      in power and a drop off in speed / OWTTE;
      distance running is essentially aerobic;
      the aerobic energy system is capable of producing large amounts of energy;
      the aerobic energy system will contribute the greatest percentage of energy
      production;
      the aerobic energy system will be limited by the amount of fuel/carbohydrate/fat
      available;
      Award [1 max] per energy system.

(e)   slow rise in heart rate when exercise is performed at a constant work rate over a
      prolonged period;
      due to dehydration and rising temperature within the muscles;
      rise in core temperature causing redistribution of blood to the periphery;
      characterized by decreases in mean arterial pressure and stroke volume and an
      increase in heart rate to promote cooling;
      blood flow to skin is increased;
      water loss via sweating;
      fluid shift from plasma to tissues;
      redistribution of blood to the periphery for body cooling;
      fall in plasma volume reduces stroke volume;

2.   (a)   X: cervical vertebrae/vertebrae/vertebral column
           Y: scapula                                                                                [1]
           Both required for [1].

     (b)   axial skeleton: [1 max]
           provides protection for brain, spinal cord, heart, digestive system;
           is responsible for the upright position of the body;
           transmits the weight from the head, the trunk and the upper extremities down to
           the lower extremities at the hip joints;
           is responsible for the upright position of the human body;

           Y: Z line/actin filaments                                                                 [1]
           Both required for [1].

     (b)   an action potential arrives at the motor endplate attached to many myofibrils;
           a muscle is stimulated by a nerve impulse which releases calcium ions/Ca2+ from
           the sarcoplasmic reticulum;
           Ca2+ binds with troponin which removes tropomyosin from the active site on
           the actin;
           the actin and myosin form cross-bridges;
           cross-bridges swivel, release and reform as the actin is pulled over the myosin and
           muscle shortens;
           the I bands and H zones become narrower;
           eventually disappear during maximal contraction;
           A bands remain the same length during contraction (but are pulled towards the
           origin of the muscle);
           muscle contraction only occurs when the level of calcium ions is high enough;
           muscle contraction only occurs when ATP is available;                                 [3 max]

           the arms);                                                                           [3 max]

     (c)   field testing:
           can be cost effective;
           can be performed more frequently;
           can often require minimal equipment;
           enables the testing of large numbers of subjects;
           provides a meaningful/authentic environment for the athlete / higher ecological
           validity;
           simulates specific conditions;
           more readily available compared to laboratory testing;

           laboratory testing:
           provides a controlled environment;
           uses specific equipment that cannot be transferred to the field (VO2 max test);
           frequently requires a higher level of technical support compared to field testing;   [3 max]
           Award [2 max] if only one type of testing is discussed.



5.   (a)   (i)    is the rate in which a body moves from one location to another / speed in a
                  given direction / measures the rate (speed) of the positional change of an
                  object / displacement
                               time                                                                 [1]

           (ii)   is the measure of the amount of motion possessed by a moving body /
                  mass  velocity                                                                   [1]

           half of the person’s height/near “belly button” / the point about which the body’s
           mass is evenly distributed;
           in position B/moving arms above head the centre of mass shifts upwards;
           this is due to the distribution of mass shifting upwards;                            [2 max]

                                              SECTION B

6.   (a)   immediately after take-off the momentum generated is conserved throughout
           the dive;
           the magnitude of angular momentum remains constant throughout the dive;
           angular momentum  rotational velocity  moment of inertia;
           the moment of inertia is larger when the body has an increased radius;
           the speed of rotation/rotational velocity may be increased by moving the body into
           a compact (tucked/pike) shape;
           the speed of rotation/rotational velocity is reduced by opening out into a
           straight position;
           when gravity is the only external force acting on the diver, the angular momentum
           generated at take-off remains constant for the duration of the flight /
           Newton’s first law;
           the torque/turning effect of a force applied over time at the point of take-off
           determines the quantity of angular momentum;                                           [3 max]

     (b)   for example gross and fine:
           small muscle action or small margin of error versus large muscle action or large
           margin of error;
           most sports skills are gross motor skills;
           fine motor skills are rarely found in sport and generally involve high levels of
           hand-eye coordination for example darts/snooker/putting in golf;

           for example open and closed:
           changing environment versus fixed environment;
           a stable environment versus a predictable one;
           closed skill allows the performer to commence the skill when they are ready;
           open skills performed in spatially changing setting;
           open skills requires the performer to act upon the object according to the action of
           the object;

           for example discrete – continuous – serial:
           clear beginning and end – unclear beginning and end;
           several discrete tasks;

           for example external – internal paced skills:
           the environment determines the start of the skill – the performer determines the
           start of the skill;
           internally paced allows the performer to be in full control of the timing of the
           movement;
           internally paced requires proaction by the performer;
           externally paced skills requires reaction;

           for example interaction continuum (individual – coactive – interactive):
           individual skills are those performed in isolation;
           coactive skills are those performed at the same time as others but without
           direct confrontation;
           interactive skills are those performed where other performers are
           directly involved;                                                                     [6 max]
           Award [2 max] per classification.
           Accept an example as an alternative to definition/summary.

(c)   warming of the air by the nasal cavity;
      moistening of the air by the nasal cavity / these add water vapour to inspired air;
      cilia filters foreign particles from the air;
      trap particulate matter and fumes (for example smoke/ozone/dust/yeast/bacteria);
      provide some defence against chemicals/pollution and other harmful substances
      (that are inhaled);
      pressure difference created by lung cavity provides low resistance pathway for
      air flow;                                                                               [3 max]

(d)   for example physical maturation: [2 max]
      young learners have difficulty in focusing on important cues, difficulty in
      processing information;
      young learners make a large number of errors;
      as learners mature, more motor plans are generated;

      for example physical fitness: [2 max]
      size, shape and level of fitness may assist in learning;
      one diver may have more flexibility and strength than the other;
      a learner has an ability to make decisions more effectively if they are not fatigued;

      for example motivation:
      can be related to a person’s inner drive (intrinsic) or external factors such as
      trophies (extrinsic);
      the strength of a learner’s drive to achieve is (very) individual;
      motivation is also linked to a person’s state of arousal;

      for example individual difference of coaches:
      a coach’s teaching style (command/reciprocal) may appeal to one diver but not the
      other;

      for example age:
      physical maturation/experience/emotional maturity will affect the progress of
      a learner;

      for example difficulty of task:
      progress will be slowed if the task is too difficult for the learner;
      this may have an impact on the motivation of the diver;

      for example teaching environment:
      a safe teaching environment/limited distractions/small group learning/attention;        [4 max]

(e)   when the phosphate bonds of ATP are broken, the energy released from the ATP
      supplies the energy necessary to form or break chemical bonds in biochemical
      reactions (in a cell);
      in the muscle, the coupling of actomyosin/formation of myosin and actin,
      stimulates the breakdown of ATP;
      the release of energy allows the cross-bridges to swivel towards the middle of the
      sarcomere;
      pulling the actin over the myosin, making the muscle shorter;
      when the stimulus from the nerve stops and the muscle returns to resting state,
      ADP is rejoined to phosphate to reform ATP;                                             [4 max]

           METS – a multiple of resting oxygen consumption;
           a specific example eg blood lactate testing / percentage of peak running speed;            [4 max]

     (b)   progression – readjust overload once adaptation takes place;
           frequency – increase the number of training sessions to at least three times
           per week;
           intensity – set the training session between 70–85 % of maximum heart rate;
           duration – the session should last for a minimum of 20–40 minutes to develop
           cardiovascular capacity;
           specificity – running should be the main mode of training/consider involving
           change of direction tasks whilst running/the bleep test could actually be used as a
           training tool;
           variety – Fartlek/interval/hills/continuous/circuit training/cross fit;                    [4 max]

     (c)   most of the oxygen in the body is transported by chemically combining with
           hemoglobin / oxygen enters the red blood cells and binds to the iron within the
           hemoglobin molecules;
           oxygen and hemoglobin are bound in an easily reversible reaction (to form
           oxyhemoglobin);
           each molecule of hemoglobin can transport four oxygen molecules;
           as blood passes through the lungs, the hemoglobin picks up oxygen because of the
           increased oxygen pressure in the capillaries of the lungs;
           it then releases this oxygen (dissociates) to body cells where the partial pressure of
           oxygen in the tissues is lower;                                                            [3 max]

(e)   insulin is secreted by the beta cells/islets of Langerhans of the pancreas in
      response to high blood sugar levels;
      insulin regulates the sugar level in the body;
      enzymes that convert glucose to glycogen are stimulated by insulin;
      storage of triglycerides/lipids in the adipose tissue is stimulated by insulin;
      receptors in the pancreas are sensitive to the changes in sugar level;
      thus releasing the necessary requirements of insulin depending on the needs of
      the body;
      a diet high in sugar and fat will result in a high release of insulin;
      and consequently an increase in glycogen storage and accumulation of fat occurs;
      sensitivity to insulin is reduced / obese subjects have poor insulin sensitivity
      (even if they are relatively healthy);
      high levels of body fat and insulin resistance are closely linked;                 [5 max]

8.   (a)   contractility – muscle has the ability to shorten;
           excitability – muscle responds to a stimulus/nerve impulse;
           extensibility – muscle can lengthen beyond its resting length;
           elasticity – after being stretched beyond its normal resting length, muscle can
           return to its original length without damage (to a certain degree);
           atrophy – if a muscle is not being utilized, it will waste away;
           hypertrophy – muscles can grow in size (generally by increasing the size of the
           muscle cell);
           fed by capillaries which ensures a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood and
           nutrients;                                                                              [4 max]

     (b)   when movements occur, muscles work in a pair (to accommodate movement ie
           muscles pull, they do not push);
           agonist is the muscle that contracts/shortens (the prime mover);
           antagonist is the muscle that is relaxing/stretching to allow the movement to occur;
           when the prime mover is being stimulated to contract the nerve impulse to the
           antagonist is inhibited;
           reciprocal inhibition is a safeguard against injury;                                    [3 max]

     (c)   the sport/skill is completely new to the learner / the beginning/initial stage of the
           learning stages continuum;
           characterized by a large number of errors;
           performance is highly variable/shows a lack of consistency from one attempt to
           the next;
           learners are less likely to self-correct;
           during the cognitive stage of learning, the beginner focuses on
           cognitively-orientated problems for example how fast should I move this arm?/
           where should this arm be when my right leg is here?;
           the learner must engage in cognitive processing as he/she listens to instructions
           and receives feedback;
           the learner uses verbalization to aid memory;
           identification and development of the component parts of the skill;
           involves formation of a mental picture of the skill;
           change in the rate of improvement is faster in the cognitive phase;                     [3 max]

(d)   definition of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure;
      systolic blood pressure will increase for both the flexed arm hang and the chin-up;
      cardiac output increases significantly for both the flexed arm hang and the chin-up
      which raises systolic blood pressure;
      during dynamic exercise (chin-up) there is very little change in diastolic blood
      pressure / during isometric exercise (flexed arm hang) diastolic blood pressure
      increases;
      during dynamic exercise there is a vasodilation of the blood vessels in the muscles;
      during isometric exercise there is a resistance to blood flow caused by the
      contracting muscle/constriction of blood vessels/inactive muscle pump;
      Accept marking points as a table for example
                 State                          Systolic                  Diastolic
       Rest                         120                          80;
       Static exercise/arm hang     increased                    increased;
       Dynamic exercise /                                        unchanged (possible small
                                    increased
       chin-up                                                   decrease);                     [4 max]

(e)   gas exchange occurs between the alveoli and the capillaries by (passive) diffusion;
      the alveoli are small hollow sacs connecting to the larger terminal bronchioles of
      the airways;
      the alveolar walls are lined by a single cell layer of (flat epithelial) cells allowing
      for gas exchange;
      oxygen passes from the alveoli to the capillaries;
      carbon dioxide passes from the capillaries to the alveoli;
      during inspiration, the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in the lung is higher than
      that in the arteries of the alveoli;
      the partial pressure of alveolar oxygen is high (13.7 kPa/103 mmHg) / the partial
      pressure of the oxygen capillary blood is low (5.3 kPa/40 mmHg);
      this pressure difference allows O2 to transfer into the capillary;
      the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) in the lung is less than the arterial
      partial pressure of the alveoli;
      the partial pressure of alveolar carbon dioxide is 5.3 kPa/40 mmHg / in the
      capillary blood returning to the lungs the partial pressure of the carbon dioxide
      present is 6.12 kPa/46 mmHg;
      this pressure difference allows carbon dioxide to diffuse into the lung and
      eventually into the atmosphere;
