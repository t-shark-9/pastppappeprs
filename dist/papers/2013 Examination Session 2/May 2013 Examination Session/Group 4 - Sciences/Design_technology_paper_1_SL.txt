Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

The Barrow Boat Company manufactures small sailing and rowing boats. They have a fixed wheel
at the front and holes through the transom through which the oars fit. This allows the boats to be
wheeled like a wheelbarrow and removes the need for a trolley (Figure 8). Following their success
The Barrow Boat Company has diversified its range and now has a product family with a range of traditional
style boats (Figure 9). Customers can purchase a kit and assemble a boat themselves, they can buy a boat
built but not finished or they can buy a completed boat. The boats use composite materials, for example,
marine ply (plywood which has been specially treated to resist rotting in a high-moisture environment),
rather than natural timber to make them lighter and easier to maintain.
