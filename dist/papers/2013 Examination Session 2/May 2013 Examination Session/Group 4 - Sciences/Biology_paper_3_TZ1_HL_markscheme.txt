Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

    (c)   in red light birds do not migrate in the normal pattern/direction;
          red light disorientates the birds/interferes with the functioning of
             magnetoreceptors;
          red light has (almost) the same effect as total darkness / birds do not see in red
             light;                                                                            [1 max]

E3. behavior that benefits other individuals and is/may be harmful to self;
    increases survival of colony/species as a whole, not individuals;
    natural selection works at the level of gene pools/level of the colony/population;

    survival/reproduction;
    common in animals with complex social structures;
    individuals care for related individuals who are not their own offspring;
    named example of altruism towards related individuals (eg in naked mole rat colony
    non-breeding animals help to raise offspring/forage for food/clean nest/defend); Do not
    accept name of animal alone, but show briefly what the altruistic behaviour is.
    individual that is helped may be a relative/share genes/kin selection;
    difficult to explain altruism towards unrelated/genetically distant individuals;

      (c)   Cr3+ more toxic than S2– (between concentrations of about 67/70 and
            80 mgdm–3);
            Cr3+ toxicity increases more rapidly with increasing concentration than S2–;
            Cr3+ requires lower concentration to cause same percentage inhibition (between 40
            and 70 %) as S2– / vice versa;
            below (about) 30 (mgdm–3) Cr3+ not toxic whereas S2– effect not known/may be
            toxic / Cr3+ cannot be compared with S2– below concentration of 70/67
            (mgdm–3);                                                                             [2 max]

      (d)   denitrifying bacteria convert nitrate to nitrogen/N2;
            nitrate causes eutrophication/algal blooms in rivers / removing nitrate reduces the
            risk of eutrophication/prevents algal blooms;
            high levels of nitrate/algal blooms lead to anoxic conditions / increase BOD /
            reduces oxygen levels;
            nitrate is toxic for humans (in high concentrations);
            removing nitrate reduces the risk of nitrate entering drinking water;                 [3 max]

     (b)   same range of mercury concentrations/up to 200–250 (ppb);
           levels above 50 (ppb) are lower/less common in herbivores than in detritivores /
           vice versa;
           (0–) 50 (ppb) is most common in herbivores whereas (50–) 100 (ppb) is most
           common in detritivores;                                                            [2 max]

     (c)   piscivores feed at different trophic levels (within the food chain);
           piscivores that feed on herbivores / detritivores will have lower levels of
           contamination;
           piscivores that feed on carnivores/omnivores/top of food chain will have high
           levels;                                                                            [2 max]

     (c)   nature reserve is a well defined/limited region with a protective
           framework/legislative protection;
           large reserves promote biodiversity more effectively than small reserves;
           size must be enough to have a well defined community of organisms;
           edge effect is seen at or near the boundary between ecosystems;
           leads to differences in population densities/biodiversity/levels of predation in
           central areas compared to edges;
           habitat corridors allow organisms to move between parts of a fragmented
           ecosystem;
           example       of    habitat      corridors   such    as    hedges/canals/drainage

G3. oceans are huge ecosystems with no borders / many important fishing grounds are in
    international waters;
    fishing vessels often have a large geographical range / operate outside of national
    jurisdiction;
    marine organisms migrate so need protection across their full range / breeding sites may
    be distant from feeding grounds so both need to be protected;
    agree on maximum sustainable yields/quotas;
    apply the precautionary principle in determining the level of exploitation;
    agree on allowed fishing sites and exclusion zones;
    agree on fishing seasons and moratoriums;
    identify and agree on species that may be fished and those that may not;
    determine and agree on which fishing methods are allowed and which are not/net and
    mesh size limitations;                                                                     [6 max]

Option H — Further human physiology

H1. (a)   accept range 3.8–4.2 (%)                                                                 [1]

    (b)   (i)    percentage saturation of O2 drops in both during exercise;
                 decrease is greater/more rapid in athletes than in non-athletes;                  [2]

          (ii)   athletes exercise more vigorously/at higher intensity;
                 athletes use more oxygen during exercise;                                     [1 max]

    (c)   ventilation rate/tidal volume increased;
          more oxygen absorbed (per minute);
          heart rate increased;                                                                [2 max]

    (d)   altitude causes formation of more red blood cells/more haemoglobin so/thus the
          capacity to carry oxygen increases; Idea of capacity is essential although can be
          OWTTE.
          the % saturation of blood is lower because there is less oxygen in the atmosphere;   [1 max]



H2. (a)   peptide hormones do not enter the cell whereas steroid hormones do;
          peptide hormones bind to a cell surface receptor whereas steroid hormones bind to
          a receptor in the cytoplasm;
          peptide hormones act through a secondary messenger/cAMP whereas steroid
          hormones have (direct) effect on DNA;
          steroid hormones have effect on gene transcription whereas peptide hormones
          change activities of cell/influence enzyme activity;                                 [2 max]

    (b)   involves both nerve impulses and the hormone gastrin;
          sight/smell of food causes nerve impulses to be sent/reflex action;
          food in stomach stimulates touch receptors/chemoreceptors/stretchreceptors
          releasing more gastric juice;
          stretching of stomach wall stimulates secretion of the hormone gastrin;              [2 max]

    (c)   (pepsinogen) secreted by gastric glands/stomach wall;
          pepsinogen converted to pepsin/activated by HCl;
          autocatalytic reaction / pepsin causes conversion of pepsinogen to more pepsin;
          inactive form necessary to prevent damage to stomach wall / self digestion of
             enzyme-producing cells;                                                           [3 max]

    regulates blood glucose level through glucose-glycogen reaction;
    detoxification/example of detoxification (eg contains catalase for the breakdown of
       hydrogen peroxide);
    manufactures plasma proteins/albumins/fibrinogen;
    manufactures cholesterol;
    destroys red blood cells by phagocytosis;
    breaks down haemoglobin from red blood cells;
    stores iron;
