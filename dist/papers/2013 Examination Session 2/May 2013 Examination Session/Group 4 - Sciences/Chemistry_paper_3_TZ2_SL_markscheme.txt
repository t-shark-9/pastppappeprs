Subject Details: Chemistry SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the options [2 x 20 marks]. Maximum total =
[40 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

11.   If a question specifically asks for the name of a substance, do not award a mark for a correct
      formula unless directed otherwise in the markscheme. Similarly if the formula is specifically asked
      for, unless directed otherwise in the markscheme, do not award a mark for a correct name.

12.   If a question asks for an equation for a reaction, a balanced symbol equation is usually expected, do
      not award a mark for a word equation or an unbalanced equation unless directed otherwise in the
      markscheme.

13.   Ignore missing or incorrect state symbols in an equation unless directed otherwise in the
      markscheme.

                  curly arrow from C=C to H of H–Br and curly arrow showing Br leaving;
                  correct carbocation representation;
                  curly arrow from lone pair/negative charge on Br– to C+;                       [3]

           (iii) 2-bromo-2-methylbutane involves the formation of an intermediate tertiary
                 carbocation;
                 this is more stable than the primary carbocation intermediate that would be
                 formed if the product was 1-bromo-2-methylbutane;
                 Accept argument based on low stability of primary carbocation.

                  the increased positive inductive effect of the extra –R groups increases the
                  stability of the intermediate / OWTTE;                                       [2 max]
                  Do not award marks for quoting Markovnikov’s rule without any explanation.

     (b)   react with (warm, aqueous) sodium hydroxide solution / OH–(aq);                         [1]
           Do not accept answers, such as NaOH, that do not refer to water/solution.

     (c)   magnesium/Mg;
           non-polar solvent/ether/diethyl ether/ethoxyethane / dry/absence of water;              [2]

G2. (a)   all C–C bond lengths/strengths are the same/between the different lengths/strengths
          for C–C single bond and a C=C double bond / OWTTE;
          Do not accept “bonds are the same” without any qualification.

          only one 1,2-disubstituted isomer exists whereas there would be two if there were
          alternate double and single bonds / only three disubstituted benzene compounds
          rather than four / OWTTE;
          benzene (mainly) undergoes (electrophilic) substitution reactions rather than
          addition reactions (which would be expected if it contains C=C double bonds) /
          OWTTE;
          Accept does not undergo addition reactions / decolourize bromine water.

          the enthalpy change of hydrogenation/combustion is less exothermic than would be
          expected if benzene contained three double bonds/not 3 times that of cyclohexene /
          the enthalpy change of formation is less endothermic / OWTTE;                      [3 max]

    (b)   Iodobenzene:
          does not (readily) react;
          the C–I bond is stronger due to delocalization of (one of) the non-bonding pair of
          electrons on the I atom with the benzene pi electrons / the pi electrons on the
          benzene ring repel the OH–/nucleophile making it less likely to react with the
          carbon atom attached to the I atom / the lone pair on the I atom in iodobenzene is
          delocalized into the ring, considerably reducing the polarity of the C–I bond /
          benzene ring prevents the nucleophile attacking from the opposite direction to the
          C–I bond;
          Accept “steric hindrance”.

          (Iodomethyl)benzene:
          reacts (readily);
          the OH–/nucleophile attacks the δ+ C atom attached to the I atom as the benzene
          ring has little effect / OWTTE;                                                        [4]
          Accept “reacts by nucleophilic substitution/SN2 mechanism”.
          Accept the opposite any of the reasons given above for lack of iodobenzene
          reactivity, other than the one used in the answer to the first part.

G3. (a)   methyl/ CH 3 group exerts a positive inductive effect / “pushes” electrons towards
          the (carboxyl) carbon atom (relative to the –H atom in methanoic acid);
          negative charge of the ethanoate/acetate (an)ion is more localized/electron density
          on the (carboxyl) carbon atom/in O–H bond in the ethanoate/acetate (an)ion greater
          so attracts a proton more readily/O–H bond is stronger/less likely to break /
          increases charge on the oxygen atoms of the ethanoate/acetate (an)ion making it
          less stable / OWTTE;                                                                  [2]
          Accept opposite statements for methanoate ion.

    (b)   (electronegative) Cl atom is electron withdrawing / “pulls” electrons away from the
          (carboxyl) carbon atom/O–H bond (relative to the positive inductive effect caused
          by the C2 H 5 group in propanoic acid) / OWTTE;
          electron density on the (carboxyl) carbon atom of the chloropropanoate (an)ion
          lower so attracts a proton less readily/O–H bond is weaker/more likely to break /
          decreases charge on the oxygen atoms of the chloropropanoate (an)ion making it
          more stable / OWTTE;                                                                  [2]
          Accept opposite statements for propanoate ion.
