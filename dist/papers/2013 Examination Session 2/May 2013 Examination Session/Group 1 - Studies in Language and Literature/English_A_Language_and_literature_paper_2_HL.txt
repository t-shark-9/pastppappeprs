Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you
have studied. Answers which are not based on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score
high marks. Your answer should address the ways in which language and context contribute to your
reading of each work.

1.    Works of literature can teach us something that may not have been originally intended. To what
      extent have you found this to be true in at least two of the works you have studied?


2.    Show how belief or faith is represented in at least two of the literary works you have studied
      and discuss how this aspect might be interpreted or understood in different historical, cultural or
      social contexts.


3.    Why are the works you have studied considered “literary” texts? Identify and discuss some of the
      features that make at least two of the texts you have studied literary.


4.    In what ways is the reader seduced or comforted by the ideas in the works studied and in what ways
      challenged or alienated? Refer to at least two of the literary works you have studied.


5.    Context – historical, cultural or social – can have an influence on the way literary works are written
      or received. Discuss with reference to at least two of the works you have studied.


6.    Literary works often show men and women struggling to resolve problems and not succeeding
      very well. To what degree do you find this to be true in at least two of the works you have studied?
