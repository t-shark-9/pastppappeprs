These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

     An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

     • grasp the events and the setting of the situation
     • identify and make some comment on the relationship between the parody of an acceptance
       speech and the structure of the poem
     • make some comment on the use of rhetorical and structural conventions and devices
     • make some comment on how some of the word play and/or imagery contributes to the
       humour.

     A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

     • address the relationship between domesticity and celebrity
     • offer a more detailed discussion of rhetorical and structural features
     • demonstrate a deeper discussion of word play, supported by carefully chosen examples.


2.

     An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

     • show an understanding of the two different realities in the passage
     • discuss the emotional/psychological tensions in the main character, for example as shown
       in his behaviour and the expression of his feelings
     • explore some of the techniques used to create the dark and menacing atmosphere
     • show some awareness of shifts in tone (tense/relaxed/tense).

     A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

     • explore more thoroughly the contrasts and parallels between the dream and the reality
     • discuss syntactical and structural features, their use and significance
     • discuss the impact of specific examples of diction used.
