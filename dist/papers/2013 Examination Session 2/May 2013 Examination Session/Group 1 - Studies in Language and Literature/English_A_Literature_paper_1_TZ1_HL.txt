                                         Language as an Escape from the Discrete1

                                         I came upon two wasps
                                         with intricate legs all occupied.
                                         If it was news communicated,
                                         or if they mated or fought,
                                   5     it was difficult to say of that clasp.

                                         And a cold fear because I did not know
                                         struck me apart from them, who moved,
                                         whose wasp-blood circulated,
                                         who, loveless, mated, who moved;
                                 10      who moved and were not loved.

                                         When the cat puts its furred illiterate
                                         paw on my page and makes a starfish,
                                         the space between us drains my marrow
                                         like a roof’s edge. It drinks milk,
                                 15      as I do; one of its breaths is final.

                                         And even the young child, whose eyes
                                         follow what it speaks, to see in yours
                                         what it will mean, is running away
                                         from what it sent its secret out to prove.
                                 20      And the illiterate body says hush,

                                         in love, says hush; says, whatever
                                         word can serve, it is not here.
                                         All the terrible silences listen always; and hear
                                         between breaths a gulf we know is evil.
                                 25      It is the silence that built the tower of Babel2.
