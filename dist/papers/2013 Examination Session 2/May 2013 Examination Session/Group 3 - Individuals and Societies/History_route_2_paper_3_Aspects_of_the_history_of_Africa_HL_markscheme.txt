 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
         structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
         insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8: The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present,
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Pre-colonial African states (Eastern and Central Africa) 1840–1900

1.   Assess the contribution of Johannes/Yohannis IV to the reunification of Ethiopia.

     The focus of this question is the reunification of Ethiopia, so discussion of modernization would not
     be relevant. The external threats to Ethiopia during Yohannis’s reign event could be made relevant,
     however, as a successful foreign invasion would probably have resulted in political fragmentation
     and/or the end of Ethiopian independence.

     Yohannis IV benefited from the defeat of Tewodros II by the British in 1868. He acquired firearms
     in return for logistical support, and used these weapons to defeat the newly-proclaimed Emperor
     Tekle Giyorgis II in 1871. However, he learned from Tewodros’s failure and strengthened his
     authority by diplomacy rather than war. He had more cautious objectives and created a federation
     rather than a unitary state. He regarded himself as a first among equals and was ready to share
     authority with his subordinates, provided his position as Emperor was recognized. He tolerated
     regionalism because he was aware of the many impediments standing in the way of establishing a
     strongly centralized state. He sought accommodation with his two main rivals, Adal, later called
     Tekle–Haymanot of Gojjam, and Menelik of Shoa. In 1878 Menelik submitted to Yohannis, in an
     episode illustrated how intermarriage was used as a means of conciliating Yohannis’s rivals and
     strengthening his rule. Menelik’s daughter married Yohannis’s son, and Menelik agreed to pay him
     an annual tribute and provide supplies to the imperial army. He dropped his claim to the imperial
     title and was in return recognized as Negus of Shoa. But Yohannis’s policy of creating a loosely
     federated Ethiopia encouraged centrifugal tendencies which were always a potential threat to the
     unity of the state. He never really established his authority over Gojjam and Shoa, and Menelik
     refused to fight with him against the Sudanese Mahdists in 1889. On the whole, because he was
     realistic and generally avoided making enemies, he enjoyed some success in re-uniting Ethiopia.

     He was also successful in dealing with external threats to the country. The first major threat came
     from Ottoman Egypt. The Egyptians were decisively defeated at Gundat in 1875. Yohannis could
     not afford indirect control in areas threatened by foreign invasion, and he made his trusted general
     Ras Alula governor of the northern regions which bordered Egypt. However, the result of the
     victory at Gundat was that, in the words of historian Sven Rubenson, Yohannis “traded one weak
     enemy for two stronger ones”: the Sudanese Mahdist state and Italy. The Italians acquired the port
     of Assab. In 1887 Ras Alula defeated them at the battle of Dogali. Yohannis sought to end the
     Italian occupation of Massawa, but first had to deal with the Mahdists, who had sacked Gondar. At
     the close of what had been a victorious battle at Metemma in 1889, he was killed by a stray bullet.

     Good answers should combine an in-depth discussion of his contribution with well supported
     analysis of the extent of his success. It would be acceptable to put his achievements in a wider
     context by making some reference to his predecessor Tewodros and, in particular, his successor
     Menelik II. The threat of foreign invasion was finally ended by Menelik with victory over the
     Italians at Adowa in 1896, and the process of building a centralized state was only cemented when
     he established Addis Ababa as a permanent capital.

2.   Compare and contrast the roles of Mirambo in the rise of Unyamwezi and Mzilikazi in the
     rise of the Ndebele.

     Good answers will have a clear comparative structure and not just be sequential accounts which do
     not explicitly pinpoint similarities and differences. In each case the leadership role of Mirambo and
     Mzilikazi was crucial, but the circumstances which facilitated the rise of each state were different.

     Mirambo was the son of a minor Nyamwezi chief in the north west of present-day Tanzania. He
     gained experience as a warrior and trader and gained a large and loyal following, which helped him
     create a larger state of his own. A successful warlord and state-builder, he prospered as a result of
     his strategic position along the long-distance trade routes from Zanzibar to the interior. Mirambo
     built on the existing trade of the Nyamwezi in salt, ironwork, copper and livestock, and entered the
     slave trade and the international trade in ivory as well. He controlled the major trade routes from
     Tabora to Ujiji, Buganda and Shaba, and could exact tolls on all of them. He fought against the
     Swahili Arabs of Tabora until they agreed to pay tolls. He adopted new military techniques from
     the Tuta Ngoni, a marauding group of refugees who had fled from the Mfecane, and who had
     reached Unyamwezi in the 1850s. Mirambo learnt the Ngoni language and built a mercenary army
     of men from many different ethnic groups, called the ruga ruga. His reputation as a military
     strategist was such that Stanley referred to him as the “Central African Bonaparte”. Despite his
     successful expansion of Unyamwezi and his many personal qualities, Mirambo was not a successful
     modernizer. The state he created did not long survive his death in 1884. He created no centralized
     administration, and after his death many local rulers reasserted their authority. The personal loyalty
     of his soldiers was not carried over to his successors.

     This was not the case with Mzilikazi, whose successor Lobengula continued to consolidate the
     Ndebele state. While Mirambo made successful use of the Tuta Ngoni who had fled from the south,
     the Ndebele were themselves refugees from the Mfecane. Mzilikazi had succeeded his father in
     1818 as ruler of the Khumalo chiefdom, a group allied to the Ndwandwe under Zwide. Mzilikazi
     transferred his allegiance from Zwide to the Zulus under Shaka, and the presence of his troops was
     a factor in the Zulu victory over the Ndwandwe. These events precipitated the Mfecane. He
     eventually quarrelled with Shaka and fled north with his people. He established a powerful state by
     taking advantage of the depopulation of much of the interior caused by the Mfecane, and by
     incorporating many Sotho-speaking communities. Threatened by powerful enemies, the most
     notable of which were the Boers in the Transvaal, he moved his capital several times and eventually
     settled in western Zimbabwe. His state survived and expanded through geographical mobility
     (unlike Mirambo and the Unyamwezi) and through military might (like Mirambo). His success
     resulted from his effective political and military organization, which he adopted from the Zulu state.
     He used diplomacy whenever possible to achieve peace with his enemies, and tried to foster a sense
     of common identity between conquered peoples and his ruling elite. He had opened up his state to
     European missionaries and traders before his death in 1868. In about 1840, Mzilikazi had
     conquered the Rozwi Empire and set up a new Ndebele kingdom with its capital near Bulawayo.
     Weak and divided Shona states were attacked by the Ndebele and many became vassals of
     Mzilikazi. He developed a strong and effective central government, unlike Mirambo. In its early
     years it was a military state but it gradually became more civil as regimental bodies were
     reorganized into regional administrative units. Indunas took on civil as well as military duties as
     territorial chiefs. Mzilikazi used marriage to several hundred wives from different sections of the
     nation as a means of unifying Ndebele society under his rule.

     Good answers should have a balanced and in-depth assessment of both leaders.

     If only one ruler is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Pre-colonial African states (Southern and West Africa) 1800–1900

3.   In what ways did the acquisition of modern trading skills enable the rise of new leaders like
     Jaja and Nana in the Niger Delta?

     The question does not stipulate that Jaja and Nana should be mentioned specifically in the essay,
     and it is possible that a candidate might produce a strong general response to the title. However,
     most good essays will make use of the examples of Jaja and Nana in order to illustrate explanations
     of how developments in trade facilitated the rise of new leaders in the Delta.

     The nineteenth century saw the decline in the Niger Delta of the Atlantic slave trade and the rise of
     the palm oil trade. The delta city states extended their trading empires into the interior and
     encroached on the markets of the palm-oil producers. City states such as Brass, Nembe, Calabar
     and Bonny were divided into houses. Each house had its own trading and war canoes. House heads
     were second in rank to the king. Traditionally they had been members of the royal family, but in
     the nineteenth century more commoners and even ex-slaves were promoted on the basis of their
     ability to trade and compete with commercial rivals. The social mobility that was possible in the
     houses led to the rise of new men who challenged the authority of traditional rulers in the delta.

     The competition between states was so fierce that each house tried to choose the most talented
     individuals. This meant that traders could be ex-slaves like Alali, head of the Anna Pepple house in
     Bonny. Another ex-slave was Jaja, from the Orlu area of Igboland in the Niger delta. He too
     became head of the Anna Pepple house. However, Anna Pepple soon lost out in a struggle with its
     bitter rival, the Manilla Pepples. Jaja led his followers to a new home on an island at the mouth of
     the Imo river. Here, at Opobo, he was able to cut Bonny off from the palm oil markets. Bonny fell
     into serious financial problems while Opobo flourished. Jaja acted as a middle man between the oil
     producers upriver and the British. He decided to deal exclusively with the Alexander Miller
     Company at the expense of its rivals. This threw the British companies into fierce competition, and
     Jaja was able to take advantage. When the British attempted to set fixed prices he successfully
     broke into the export trade and shipped palm oil directly to England. He gained political capital by
     using his wealth to send soldiers to fight with the British in the Ashanti War of 1875. Relations
     deteriorated only after the British declared a Gulf of Guinea Protectorate, attempted to impose free
     trade in the region, and resolved to “cut out the middle man” altogether – in other words, Jaja.

     The Itsekiri were a trading people in the Western Niger Delta. The delta was a maze of waterways
     and mangrove swamps, and farming was impossible. The Itsekiri relied on exporting salt and dried
     fish in return for yams, livestock and other foods. As long-distance traders, they were also much
     involved in the slave trade, and found the transition to the palm oil trade very difficult. This led to a
     political upheaval in 1848 when slaves took control of the capital, and the Olu or traditional ruler
     was replaced by a wealthy trader, Olomu. His success aroused the jealousy of the ousted royal
     family, of other trading houses, and even of his own family, and he fought two wars against the
     neighbouring Urhobo. The British government appointed consuls in southwestern Nigeria and
     these too caused occasional problems to Olomu, sometimes bombarding his land or imposing heavy
     fines. Olomu needed a more defensible headquarters and built the well-fortified town of Ebrohimi,
     reclaimed from the mangrove swamp. His son Nana replaced him on his death in 1883. Nana faced
     challenges from three different sources: his trading rivals, those who felt that he should not have
     succeeded his father, and the British who could not tolerate an independent state so close to their
     delta protectorate. The British were the biggest threat. They found Nana, who was declared
     “Governor of the Rivers” in 1885, to be a formidable opponent. He continued to maintain control
     over the Itsekiri and shared custom duties with them. He stationed agents across the region, and
     responded to a British decision to establish a vice-consulate in Sapele by sending his own agent.
     When the price of oil fell, Nana’s successful solution to the problem was to withhold supply.

The question is about how trading skills led to the emergence of new leaders, and not about the later
confrontation with the British. This need not be referred to, or at most should get a passing mention.

4.   Analyse the social, political and economic factors which contributed to the emergence and
     growth of either the Zulu kingdom under Shaka Zulu or the Sotho kingdom under Mosheshwe.

     Many candidates will focus on the personal agency of Shaka or Mosheshwe in the emergence and
     growth of the Zulu and Sotho respectively, and a consideration of their role of each is obviously
     unavoidable. However, the question specifies social, political and economic factors, and these
     should be made explicit in strong candidate responses.

     Candidates discussing the rise of the Zulu will no doubt have a lot to say about the phenomenon of
     the Mfecane. Since the Zulus had a part to play in its outbreak and were ultimately its main
     beneficiaries, a brief consideration of the general causes of the Mfecane would therefore be
     appropriate. These could include the following: an increase in population across the region which
     resulted from the introduction of corn, and a corresponding rise in the number of young men of
     fighting age; a drought in the region which put pressure on the emerging kingdoms and intensified
     competition for resources; the new economic opportunities which resulted from the presence of
     Portuguese traders at Delagoa Bay and the rivalries which ensued over access to the trading routes;
     and the destabilizing impact of slaving raids from Delagoa Bay and the Cape. Reference may also
     be made to the circumstances which precipitated the Mfecane. Dingiswayo of the Mthethwa was
     defeated and killed by his principal rival in the region, Zwide of the Ndwandwe. The remnants of
     the Mthethwa armies then joined forces with the rising Zulu kingdom under Shaka, who was thus
     able to defeat Zwide. This set in motion a complex series of chain reactions, where routed armies
     would flee and then settle, only to attack local peoples who would in turn be displaced. Amidst all
     of this carnage, the Zulu were to emerge as the dominant force.

     One of the keys to the success of the Zulu is that Shaka developed a centralized form of
     government. He imposed Zulu customs and his own personal will on all the territory from the
     Drakensberg to the sea. He subdued neighbouring tribes and exercised absolute authority. In
     newly-conquered regions, hereditary chiefs were replaced by royal officials or indunas, who were
     directly responsible to the king. Any group that did not submit was destroyed. At the time whole
     villages, men, women and children, were literally wiped out. Sometimes the indunas were the
     former hereditary chiefs themselves, if they had been quick to show submission to Shaka. But even
     where this happened, chiefs lost a major source of their independent power. They lost the right to
     summon their own regiments. The young men and women of newly conquered chiefdoms were
     now incorporated into the regiments of the king. A vital factor in the rapid expansion of the Zulu
     kingdom at this time was the important military changes introduced by Shaka. These were not
     entirely his own innovation but were based on developments which had taken place within the
     armies of Ndwandwe and Mthethwa over the previous decade. Shaka refined these and made them
     more efficient. The Zulu regiments were closely drilled and highly disciplined. Their principal
     weapon was a short stabbing-spear which replaced the former less effective, long throwing-spear.
     But success ultimately stemmed from the use of speed and surprise, combined with a ruthless
     determination to destroy the enemy.

Whereas Shaka can be seen as an aggressive nation builder, Mosheshwe stands out as a leader who
built a new state for defence. His personal role was a major political factor in the emergence and
growth of the Sotho state. From 1822 to 1836, when the Sotho-Tswana lands were ravaged by the
Difaqane (the Sesotho word for the Mfecane), Mosheshwe gathered a band of refugees on the
mountain fortress of Thaba Bosiu and created the kingdom of Lesotho. Its mountainous character
helped him consolidate his kingdom. He used the pitso, a sort of popular parliament, to discuss
matters of state with his people and to solve disputes. He had a federal system of government
without a standing army, though he had an armed cavalry. His personal qualities of courage,
generosity, accessibility, common sense and diplomacy facilitated his creation of a viable state. He
used Catholic priests from the Paris Evangelic Missionary Society to advise his foreign policy.
Ironically, his enemies helped to create his kingdom. During the Difaqane they drove people to
take shelter with him, a factor made it impossible for them to leave. Following the Great Trek, the
Boers occupied much of the land round the Sotho, which made it difficult for his subordinate chiefs
to break away. They had to keep together to resist the Boers. Economic factors were also
important in the rise of the Sotho state. Refugee groups were tempted into joining the expanding
Sotho nation not least because of the economic stability it offered during a period of immense
upheaval. Mosheshwe used the mafisa system to lend cattle to newcomers and win their loyalty
and allegiance. Frequent cattle raids against neighbouring people allowed him to assemble a vast
herd of his own, and he developed trade in the region with the Griquas and the Boers.

European imperialism and annexation of Africa 1850–1900

5.   Assess the relative importance of the Berlin West Africa Conference and the activities of King
     Leopold II of Belgium in the Congo in accelerating the “scramble for Africa”.

     Questions on the partition of Africa are always among the most popular on the paper, and this
     session is likely to be no exception. Candidates tend to ignore the precise wording of the question
     and write general accounts of the partition focusing on the political and economic causes. This
     would not be satisfactory. Good answers should focus mainly on Leopold and the conference.
     They should reach a supported conclusion about their relative importance. There does not have to
     be an equal balance but both areas should be covered in some depth. Candidates may discuss the
     conference at greater length, and many are likely to conclude that it was the more important factor
     in accelerating the scramble.

     Leopold hosted an international conference on Africa in Brussels in 1876, the result of which was
     the creation of the International Africa Association. It became apparent that he aimed to make
     massive trading profits for himself and establish a political empire in the Congo region. His agent
     Stanley began to set up trading settlements in the Congo in 1879, and his activities stimulated rival
     French activity in the Congo region and led indirectly to the De Brazza-Makoko Treaty. Leopold
     and Stanley stepped up their activities in the Congo and the Congo Free State was established in
     1884.

     Rivalry over the Congo was an important reason for convening the Berlin West Africa Conference,
     which met at the end of 1884. Bismarck wished to divert French attention away from
     Alsace-Lorraine and into colonial expansion in Africa. The French and Germans persuaded the
     Portuguese to put territorial disputes arising out of European activities in the Congo region to an
     international conference which was held in Berlin (1884–1885) to contain a potentially dangerous
     situation. Bismarck was concerned that rivalry over Africa might lead to a European war. The
     unintended result of the conference was to give impetus to the partition. The treaty produced by the
     conference laid down ground-rules for further scrambling for Africa. Powers had to prove
     “effective occupation” and inform their rivals before annexing territory. The doctrine of “effective
     occupation” was a powerful stimulus to actual European invasion on the ground, in order to make
     good claims of spheres of influence on maps. The process of African treaty-making developed at
     an even faster pace. In a rapid sequence of events to the 1890s, commercial coastal spheres were
     turned into inland colonies as African states were conquered and boundary negotiations effected.
     By 1912 the whole of the continent, with the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia, had been brought
     under European colonial rule. The treaty also internationalized the Congo basin and split the Niger
     basin between Britain and France, recognizing the British sphere of influence in the lower Niger.
     The word “accelerating” in the question points to the Berlin Conference as more important factor,
     but it is possible to connect Leopold’s activities in the Congo to the Berlin Conference, and thereby
     argue that these were equally crucial.

     If only Leopold II or the Berlin West Africa Conference is discussed, mark out of a maximum of
     [12 marks].

6.   Analyse the various factors which facilitated the European annexation of Africa.

     This may prove to be a rather tricky question as candidates might struggle to distinguish between
     facilitative and causative factors. The syllabus requires students to analyze how African political
     and military weaknesses facilitated the European annexation of Africa. This could be the focus of
     many answers, but it would be equally appropriate to discuss a variety of technical and medical
     advances in Europe which made colonization easier. These include steamships, telegrams,
     advances in gun technology, and the discovery of quinine to treat malaria.

     Candidates could argue that the work of explorers and missionary activity were facilitative rather
     than causative factors. The validity of such arguments would depend on the arguments advanced
     and the use of supporting evidence. Missionaries often encouraged the establishment of European
     rule in Africa, believing that it would clear a path for evangelization and end the slave trade and
     fighting between African states. Their views were more influential in some countries, such as
     Nyasaland/Malawi and Uganda, than in others. One feature of African polities before European
     annexation was the small size of most states. In many areas the largest political unit was the clan.
     These small states were often in conflict with each other, a factor which facilitated conquest.
     Alliances between African states, such as that attempted by Samori Toure, were the exception rather
     than the rule. European invaders took advantage of these political divisions to play off one side
     against another and “divide and conquer”. Islam might have provided a unifying force in North
     Africa or in the West African Savanna, but regional animosities or rivalries between Brotherhoods
     created divisions within and between Islamic states. European powers were able to defeat African
     states in war because of their greatly superior military technology. The decisive weapon was the
     machine gun. As Hilaire Belloc remarked, “whatever happens we have got the Maxim, and they
     have not”. African armies also lacked artillery, and the few rifles they possessed were often
     relatively obsolete. Few African states had disciplined and well organized standing armies. Again,
     Samori Toure was the exception here. There are some isolated examples of prolonged resistance
     for example by the Nandi in East Africa, and of major defeats by African armies such as the Zulu
     victory over the British at Isandhlwana in 1879. Menelik’s defeat of the Italians at Adowa in 1896
     helped Ethiopia avoid European annexation until 1936.

     Other facilitative factors might include the increasing importance of public opinion as a result of the
     extension of the vote in several European countries, a public opinion which was itself often
     influenced by a pro-imperialist press. Recent scholarship has indicated that the degree of public
     enthusiasm for colonial adventure should not be exaggerated, however. Economic factors and
     European rivalry were causative rather than facilitative factors, and this distinction implied in the
     wording of the question should be respected.

7.   Analyse the causes and effects of the Maji Maji Rising against German rule in East Africa.

     This is a straightforward question and likely to be popular. Causes and effects should both be
     considered but do not expect a precise balance of the two. Many candidates will have more to say
     about causes than effects.

     In 1905 a number of diverse ethnic groups rose against colonial rule in German East Africa. It
     began in the southeast of the colony among the Pogoro and Ngindo. The rising spread rapidly as
     the Bena, Ngoni, Zaramo, Luguru and others joined in. The social and political causes included
     resentment at attacks by the German authorities on traditional religious practices. The abuse of
     Ngindo women by colonial troops was another important factor. Religious belief was a significant
     feature of the Maji Maji Rising, which got its name from the magic water given by Kinjekitile, a
     Kolelo spirit medium on the Rufiji River. This encouraged resistance as people believed that the
     water would render harmless German bullets. Economic causes included forced labour and
     taxation, but the major grievance was the attempt of the government to force Africans to grow
     cotton as a cash crop for export. The soil was generally unsuitable for successful cultivation, and
     the plan had to be forcibly implemented. This was carried out with some brutality by the Germans
     and their Swahili and Arab agents, the akidas and jumbes. The imposition of a head tax and the
     threat of drought in the region were also factors in sparking the rebellion, which began in July 1905
     in the Matumbi hills with attacks on missionaries and German administrators and their agents.

     The rising took the Germans by surprise, but by the end of 1905 they had brought in reinforcements
     and dealt with it ruthlessly. African leaders were executed, houses burned, and crops and livestock
     destroyed in a scorched earth policy. The estimates of the numbers of Africans who died from the
     suppression of the rising and the ensuing famine vary, but it may have been as many as 200 000 or
     300 000. The rising served as an inspiration to later nationalists. At the same time it showed
     the futility of armed resistance against a colonial power with vastly superior military technology,
     but also the importance of inter-ethnic unity. The Maji Maji Rising shocked the Germans and led to
     the establishment of a Colonial Department in Germany, which tried to introduce reforms. A new
     governor, Rechenberg, encouraged African cash crop farming and made European employers
     accept some responsibility for the health of their workers. German settlers who ill-treated their
     workers were punished. Rechenberg refused to impose new taxes which would have resulted in
     more Africans being forced to work for German settlers. In general, German rule improved in
     Tanganyika because of the fear of another Maji Maji Rising.

8.   Assess the reasons for, and the results for their country of, either Menelik II’s resistance to the
     Italians or Apolo Kagwa’s collaboration with the British.

     The greatest threat to Ethiopian independence in the nineteenth century came from Italy during the
     reign of Menelik II. He signed the Treaty of Wichale in 1889, where Italian claims to territory in
     the northern part of Ethiopia were recognized in return for Italy’s acceptance of Ethiopian
     independence. The Italian version of the treaty, however, made it mandatory for Ethiopia to use the
     “good offices” of the Italian government for the conduct of its foreign policy. This had the effect of
     turning Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate, which led to Menelik abrogating the treaty. The
     Italians responded by annexing small territories on the Ethiopian side of the frontier agreed at
     Wichale, a move which caused a further deterioration in relations. They then tried to persuade the
     rases to side with them against Menelik, but could not match the diplomatic skills of the latter. All
     the great provincial chiefs, who had for years been accepting gifts and arms from Italian
     negotiators, eventually lined up at the Battle of Adowa on the side of the emperor. An Ethiopian
     diplomatic mission to Russia in 1895 resulted in the conclusion of a military alliance between the
     two countries. All of these factors, combined with the impressive arsenal of modern weaponry
     acquired in previous years from the British, French and Italians themselves, emboldened Menelik to
     offer stern resistance when the Italians made an incursion into Ethiopian territory in December
     1895. The resulting confrontation culminated in the stunning Ethiopian victory at Adowa in March
     1896, where the invading Italians, who were outnumbered more than five to one, were
     comprehensively routed. Menelik was able to summon about 100 000 men and also enjoyed
     superiority over the Italians in firepower. The incompetence of the Italian commander, Baratieri,
     and his officers played a major part in the Ethiopian victory. Two Tigrean allies of the Italians
     defected to Menelik with information about Italian battle positions, yet Baratieri kept his positions.
     He was fed false information about Menelik’s army splitting up and retreating. Menelik also owed
     much to the generalship of Ras Alula.

     Along with his victory, Menelik’s policies after Adowa were crucial in securing the recognition by
     European powers of the sovereignty and independence of Ethiopia. A peace treaty signed in Addis
     Ababa in October 1896 accepted Italian Eritrea’s Mareb frontier. Menelik also had diplomatic
     contacts with France, and the Anglo-Ethiopian settlement of May 1897 marked the end of the
     European threat to Menelik’s empire, at least in the short term. His post-Adowa diplomacy
     consolidated his battlefield success, safeguarded Ethiopia’s position on all sides, and won territorial
     and economic concessions from powerful European countries. He used the absence of a foreign
     threat to lay the foundations of a modern Ethiopian state by establishing a bank, hospital, postal
     system and electricity grid. Diplomatic missions were established and foreign investment and
     technical expertise flowed into the country, as the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway
     by the French testified.

Apolo Kagwa was a Christian chief who became prime minister of Buganda after Kabaka Mwanga
was deposed in 1897. His collaboration with the British stood in stark contrast to Menelik’s
resistance to Italian imperialism. While it did not preserve Baganda independence, his actions
secured a privileged place for Buganda within the Uganda protectorate. Apolo Kagwa had followed
of consistent policy of cooperating with the British from the time he became part of the Protestant
Bakungu hierarchy of county chiefs, which had risen to prominence in the court of the kabaka in the
late pre-colonial period. The agents of British imperialism arrived in Uganda after the Anglo-
German agreement of 1890 recognized Uganda as a British sphere of influence. Lugard, as the
head of the Imperial British East African Company, sought to make this a practical reality by
establishing control over the country. He supported the Protestant converts in their struggle for
power over the Catholics at the Battle at Mongo Hill. Kagwa cultivated close relations with the
BEAC, and welcomed the establishment of a Uganda Protectorate when the company experienced
financial difficulty in 1894. He resolutely opposed the rebellion by the king of Buganda, Kabaka
Mwanga, and became the senior regent as well as katikiro or prime minister when the kabaka was
deposed in 1897. He was the leading negotiator with Sir Harry Johnston of the Uganda Agreement
of 1900, which defined the basis of British administration. It rewarded him and the senior Christian
leaders for their loyalty to the British with a new system of land tenure. Clearly, self-interest and
the wish to preserve some measure of Baganda independence were key reasons why Kagwa chose
to collaborate. His recognition that the British presented a formidable and ultimately unbeatable
adversary was another factor in his decision, as was his personal identification with the colonial
power as a Protestant. As a result of the Uganda Agreement, Buganda lost ultimate sovereignty but
obtained a significant measure of internal autonomy and recognition of its status as a separate
kingdom within Uganda. The kabakaship remained, but the kabaka’s powers were limited by the
establishment of a parliament called the lukiko. This agreement was a blow to traditional clan
chiefs. The Christian chiefs benefited from mailo freehold land tenure. The lukiko was allowed to
spend funds without supervision from the British, and no new direct taxes could be imposed on the
Baganda without their consent.

Response to European imperialism (Southern and West Africa) 1870–1920

9.   Compare and contrast the response of the Asante with that of either Khama or the Zulu under
     Cetshwayo to the extension of British colonial control in the nineteenth and early twentieth
     centuries.

     Good answers will have a clear comparative structure which explicitly analyses similarities and
     differences. The Asante have been specified for West Africa so as to ensure that candidates cannot
     answer a second question about the Mandinka. Asante resistance might be compared to that of the
     Zulu, or alternatively contrasted to the collaboration of Khama and the Bamangwato. Whatever the
     choice, candidates will need to be aware that there will be similarities as well as differences, and to
     ensure that there is a reasonable balance of comparison and contrast in their answers.

     The Zulu King Cetshwayo (1873–1884) favoured an anti-Boer alliance with the British, but the
     latter did not want a strong Zulu nation on their Natal border. In 1877, Sir Bartle Frere, the British
     High Commissioner at the Cape, sent an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, who accepted each of its points
     with the exception of one relating to the disbandment of the Zulu army. The British response was
     to invade Zululand in 1879, but they suffered a humiliating defeat at Isandhlwana. Cetshwayo
     knew his victory would provoke British retaliation, and ordered his troops to retreat and wage a
     guerilla war. They ignored his orders and were defeated at Ulundi. The Anglo-Zulu war resulted in
     the conquest and destruction of the Zulu Kingdom and the loss of Zulu independence.

     Bechuanaland was recognized as part of Britain’s sphere of influence at the Berlin West African
     Conference. Khama, ruler of the Bamangwato from 1875 to 1923, and two other Tswana rulers
     chose to ask for British protection in 1885. They did so in the knowledge that the British were
     anxious to pre-empt a Boer or a German move to take over the territory and because it was in their
     strategic interests to limit the power of each of these rivals in the region. Britain declared a
     protectorate in 1890. Khama travelled to London to persuade the Colonial Secretary to confirm the
     protectorate rather than come under the rule of the British South Africa Company. His cooperation
     with the British went as far as fighting with the BSAC in 1893 against the Ndebele, and he helped
     to defeat the later Shona-Ndebele rising. Though the British appointed a resident commissioner,
     Khama was effectively allowed to operate as an independent ruler. He used British officials against
     internal rivals as they approved of his policies of promoting Christianity, education, agriculture and
     trade.

     The Asante in West Africa are part of modern day Ghana. In the early 1870s, Britain acquired a
     trading monopoly along the Gold Coast, and in 1874 proclaimed a colony over the coastal Fante
     and Ga states, which they had previously protected against Asante incursions. The Asante wanted
     to prevent foreign domination of the coastal trade. The British sought to assert their authority in the
     area by invading Asante in 1874, with an army largely made up of Africans. They defeated the
     Asante army and destroyed the capital Kumasi. The Asante had to renounce all rights to the Gold
     Coast. The British withdrew from a severely weakened Asante to avoid the expense of colonial
     administration. The Asante Kingdom revived after 1888 under a new asantehene, Prempeh I, who
     defeated rebel states and re-united the Asante Confederacy. The British feared an Asante revival
     and were upset by Prempeh’s refusal to accept British suzerainty. The British authorities refused to
     recognize Asante independence and occupied Asante in 1896, partly to pre-empt French advances
     on the fringes of the region. The Asante did not resist and a British protectorate was proclaimed
     and the asantehene was exiled. But the Asante army remained intact and rose against the British in
     1900, in a protracted rebellion led by the queen mother of Ejisu, Yaa Asentewaa.

There are many obvious parallels between Asante resistance and that of the Zulu, although it should
be noted by stronger candidates that Cetshwayo’s initial desire for an alliance with the British
contrasted with the Asante position of consistent and steadfast resistance. Similarly, the dramatic
but short-lived victory by the Zulu at Isandhlwana was at no point emulated by the Asante in
West Africa. And while Khama’s focus on diplomacy and collaboration stood in stark contrast to
Asante obduracy, there are also some parallels that can be drawn between the two situations:
both the Asante and Bamangwato suffered a partial loss of sovereignty to the British despite the
contrast in the strategies they adopted.

10.   Why were Mandinka resistance to French rule and Herero resistance to German rule both
      unsuccessful?

      This is a straightforward question and good answers should treat both the Mandinka and Herero in
      some depth. The most obvious response to the question is that neither was a match for French or
      German military superiority, but the reality is more complex. Samori Toure had created an
      effective and well equipped Mandinka army, in contrast to the Herero. His forces put up spirited
      and prolonged resistance, unlike the Herero who were quickly defeated and then nearly
      exterminated by the Germans.

      Samori was a Dyula soldier and trader who forged a powerful military empire in the highlands of
      Guinea through conquest and by co-opting rival groups. In 1881 he had his first clash with the
      French, who were expanding their colonial control westwards from upper Senegal. He was
      France’s most formidable military opponent in West Africa with his army of 30 000 men, mostly
      foot soldiers but with an elite cavalry corps. They were well trained and armed with muskets and
      rifles imported from Sierra Leone. His soldiers were in the Islamic faith and felt a strong sense of
      Mandinka identity. His experience as a successful trader enabled him to ensure a regular supply of
      food and equipment for his army. He avoided direct confrontation with the French and used
      guerrilla tactics to devastating effect. These factors explain the initial success of his resistance, and
      he even signed a treaty with the French. However, peace proved to be illusory as the French used
      the lull in fighting to undermine him by supplying and inciting his rivals. The French invaded from
      the north in 1891, having overcome the resistance of the Tukolor Empire. In 1894, they overran his
      empire but he escaped, and he founded an entirely new empire on the northern borders of modern
      Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana. But Samori was now a foreign conqueror facing the internal opposition
      of a subject people. He finally surrendered to the French in 1898. The factors which enabled the
      Mandinka to resist the French for over a decade could not save them from eventual defeat. Samori
      did not fail as a leader. His one serious military error was his decision to attempt the capture of
      Sikasso. He failed to persuade the British to grant him a protectorate, or any other African leader to
      join him in his struggle against the French. The French themselves were formidable opponents, as
      ruthless in their atrocities against civilians as he was in his scorched earth policy. Samori had no
      real answers to the vastly superior weaponry of the French.

      The Herero had no standing army, little experience of guerrilla warfare, and no means of resisting
      the Germans. Their economy had been crippled by the rinderpest epizootic of 1896–1897, and
      German settlers and traders gradually took away their grazing land and few remaining livestock.
      The threat of the confinement of the Herero to a native reservation by the German colonizers was a
      real one. Years of conflict with the neighboring Nama precluded the possibility of a united and
      possibly more effective response to German designs on their territory and freedom. In 1904 the
      Herero rose in revolt, killed over a hundred German traders and settlers, and reoccupied much of
      their former land. The Germans brought in reinforcements and isolated the Herero in the Waterberg
      area. When they broke out of their encirclement, the German general Von Trotha issued the
      notorious order to exterminate every Herero, man, women or child. The retreating Herero were
      driven westwards into the Kalahari Desert where tens of thousands died of thirst and starvation. By
      the time Von Trotha’s proclamation was cancelled, only a quarter of the Herero were still alive of
      an original population of 80 000. The Germans destroyed any remaining Herero independence
      by confiscating all of their cattle and deposing all of their chiefs. The survivors were forced into the
      position of a subordinate, low paid workforce, serving the German farms and mines.

Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

11.   In what ways was South Africa changed by the discovery of diamonds and gold?

      Most candidates will structure their answers according to the typical “social, political and economic
      effects” format. However, other approaches, provided they are sufficiently analytical in focus, are
      equally acceptable.

      The most obvious changes brought about by of the discovery of diamonds and gold were the rapid
      urbanization of the South African interior and the dramatic creation of wealth. This happened first
      in Kimberly, which grew to become a town of 50 000 in the few years following the discovery of
      diamonds in 1867. Johannesburg soon became the largest and richest city in South Africa after gold
      was discovered on the Witwatersrand in 1886. Individuals prospecting on the diamond fields such
      as Alfred Beit and Cecil Rhodes, who founded the De Beers company, were able to buy out rival
      operators and build fabulous personal fortunes before later turning their attentions to the goldfields.
      The immediate political changes resulting from by the discovery of diamonds were the granting of
      responsible government to Cape Colony in 1872 and the annexation by the Cape of the diamond
      fields of Griqualand West, despite the rival claims of the Griqua people and the Boer government of
      the Orange Free State. All of this suggests an ambition on the part of the British to control the
      mineral wealth of the region, a desire which became even more pronounced with the discovery of
      gold. This would eventually lead to conflict with the Boer republics.

      On the Witwatersrand, because of the high capital costs involved in extracting the gold-bearing ore,
      the economic trend was towards the consolidation of the big mining houses. This led to the
      concentration of wealth in the hands of a few so-called “randlords”, the most celebrated of whom
      was Barney Barnato. Some historians argue that these individuals were a crucial factor in
      fomenting the South African War, as they resented the fact that the Transvaal was governed by
      what they believed to be a politically backward Boer administration under Paul Kruger. They
      therefore petitioned London, and politicians in the Cape, to intervene by annexing the territory for
      the British Empire. Rhodes used his enormous fortune to become an agent of British imperialism in
      his own right, founding the chartered British South Africa Company in 1889 and becoming prime
      minister of the Cape in the 1890s. He was a key organizer of the ill-fated Jameson Raid of 1895,
      which further aggravated relations between the British and the Transvaal.

      The growth of cities like Johannesburg in particular transformed the economy of the region and
      profoundly altered its demographics. The demand for labour on the mines, both skilled and
      unskilled, led to a massive influx of workers, both white and black, into the new urban centres. The
      white workers insisted that the skilled and better paid jobs be reserved for them, and this was one
      factor which contributed to the gradual introduction of a comprehensive system of racial
      segregation in South Africa. Another was the need to control and regulate the enormous black
      African population which now resided in the cities. Conditions for the black workforce were on the
      whole terrible, with single men forced to live away from their families in enormous fenced
      compounds. This led to social problems such as crime, alcoholism and prostitution. The growth of
      the Anglophone white population in Johannesburg meant that the Boers no longer constituted a
      white majority in their own country, leading to squabbles between Briton and Boer over the issue of
      the franchise. So-called “uitlander grievances”, which constituted the basis of the ultimatum sent
      by High Commissioner to the Cape Alfred Milner to the Kruger government in 1899, were thus
      another important cause of the South African War.

In addition to all of the above, the economy of South Africa as a whole expanded and diversified as
a result of the discovery of diamonds and gold. Agriculture received a boost as a result of the
increased demand for food in the cities. Over time, a manufacturing sector was also developed to
meet the growing need for consumer goods. Ultimately, the discovery of diamonds and gold
provided impetus for the creation of a fully integrated national economy. It was widely believed
that further integration of this kind could only be brought about through closer political ties between
the two British colonies and (after 1902) the two former Boer republics. The mineral revolution
and the profound changes it brought about were thus important factors in the decision to create a
Union of South Africa in 1910.

12.   Analyse the role of Nelson Mandela in the achievement of majority rule in South Africa, from
      his release from prison in 1990 to the elections in 1994.

      This is a straightforward question which is likely to be popular, but good answers should combine
      narrative with explicit analysis of the role of Mandela. Much might be written about Mandela’s
      role before 1990, and some discussion of this would be appropriate so long as it helps to set his later
      role in context.

      The clamour for Mandela’s release grew in the 1980s, as the townships erupted in violence and
      international pressure on the government of P W Botha intensified. Mandela became increasingly
      involved in unofficial contacts with the South African government and even met with Botha.
      Botha’s successor F W de Klerk took the world by surprise by unbanning the African National
      Congress (ANC) and releasing Mandela from prison in February 1990. The Convention for a
      Democratic South Africa (CODESA) was set up and four years of intensive and dramatic
      negotiations led to the first non-racial elections in South Africa in 1994. In these negotiations the
      ANC and Mandela played a crucial role. He helped to transform the ANC from a liberation
      movement into a political party that was preparing for government. He ensured the party’s
      moderation, inclusiveness and its appeal to a greater range of social groups and ideological
      positions than any of the other competing parties. Mandela’s role was vital in ensuring that the
      country did not descend into the racial bloodbath that many had predicted in the run-up to the
      elections. Chief Buthelezi’s Inkatha Freedom Party, along with extreme right wing elements and
      the mysterious “third force”, did their utmost to derail negotiations by waging a clandestine war
      against the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal and the townships. Mandela, aware of the high stakes involved,
      was able to keep the firebrands in his party in check. The ANC’s response to the assassination of
      the hugely popular Communist Party leader Chris Hani by right-wing Afrikaners was similarly
      restrained. Mandela’s dignified and statesmanlike bearing during the period was enough to
      persuade many whites that the transition to majority rule would not result in the persecution of the
      minority white population. His moral authority was clearly a seminal factor in the creation of a new
      South Africa, but his record as a tough negotiator is often overlooked. Despite his willingness to
      compromise on certain matters, he was steadfast in his insistence on a non-racial one-person-one-
      vote democracy. He got much of what he wanted in the constitutional agreement, and in the run-up
      to elections and the ANC made much of his fitness to be the nation’s first fully democratically
      elected president.

      This is a basic outline of his role and the CODESA negotiations could be described in greater depth.
      The focus is on Mandela as an individual, so the contribution of the ANC as a whole, and that
      of De Klerk, with whom he was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, can be referred to
      but should be treated more briefly.

13.   “Before the end of colonial rule, European settlers had more political influence in
      Mozambique than they enjoyed in Kenya.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Many answers will agree with this statement because of the sheer size of the settler population in
      Mozambique, but allow for different, well supported viewpoints. Answers which agree or disagree
      with the statement but in a qualified manner are to be encouraged. It could be argued that
      Mozambique became independent in 1975, twelve years later than Kenya, because of the different
      policies of the two colonial powers involved, Portugal and Britain, and not because of varying
      degrees of influence in the respective settler populations.

      There were as many as 300 000 Portuguese settlers in Mozambique, as well as smaller numbers
      of Greeks, Italians, Afrikaners and other nationalities. The Portuguese government encouraged
      settlement in the colony, especially in the post-Second World War period as means of reducing the
      levels of unemployment in a struggling metropolitan economy. Land in Africa was granted to
      soldiers after they completed their terms of service. Settlers in Mozambique were often labourers,
      artisans and small-scale farmers. Many were not well-skilled and some were even illiterate. This
      reflected the poverty and low level of education in Portugal itself. The poor white settlers felt
      threatened by the prospect of African competition in the labour market, and were often even more
      racist in outlook than the Portuguese government. The vast majority shared the determination of the
      government of Salazar, prime minister from 1932 to 1968, and his successor Caetano, to maintain
      control of the African population and retard its political progress. But the settlers did not determine
      the political development of Mozambique to any significant extent. That was decided by the
      government in Lisbon. The political influence of the settler community was circumscribed by the
      constitutional status of the territory: Mozambique was not a colony but an overseas province of
      Portugal. Mozambique gained independence in 1975, but only after a protracted independence war
      and a military coup in Portugal.

      In Kenya, the sizeable settler community wanted more European agricultural development to the
      exclusion of Africans, more independence from Britain, white racial superiority and the separate
      development of European and non-European populations. These aspirations were initially
      supported by colonial governors such as Eliot, Sadler and Northey. The 1920s seemed to mark a
      weakening of settler control. The Devonshire White Paper of 1923 stated that “the interests of the
      African native must be paramount”. However, the recommendations of the report were short on
      policy specifics and the status quo in the colony was maintained, something which also
      disappointed the large Indian trading community, which had hoped for equal status to the whites.
      The Second World War hastened the growth of African nationalism. In 1952 Governor Baring
      declared a State of Emergency and asked for British troops to be flown to Kenya. By 1956, the
      Mau Mau rising was collapsing, but the rising demonstrated that Kenyans would only accept
      majority rule, that the settlers were unable to control the internal situation, and that the
      responsibility for a permanent settlement lay not with them but the government in London. Much
      to the alarm of many settlers, this was to lead to Kenya’s independence in 1963.

      It can be argued that in both colonies political development depended much more on the policies of
      the metropolitan government than on the attitude and actions of settlers. Nonetheless, it could also
      be argued that these policies were often influenced by the interests of the settle community and the
      anticipated impact on settler opinion. This would explain the reluctance of the administration in
      Kenya to implement the recommendations of the Devonshire White Paper, for instance. Answers
      should be focused, balanced and detailed.

14.   Using one example of a country where direct rule was implemented and one where indirect
      rule was implemented, analyse the reasons why each of these systems of administration were
      chosen by the colonial power. Examples can be chosen from any countries in Eastern, Central
      and West Africa.

      This is a very open-ended question and there are many examples to choose from. Answers should
      avoid vague generalizations and analyse two separate examples in some depth. Many candidates
      will use examples of British colonial rule, but examples of French, Belgian, German or Portuguese
      colonies are also encouraged.

      In a general sense, one of the main theoretical benefits of the model of indirect rule was that it
      reduced the costs of administration by derogating power to indigenous authorities. This would in
      turn entail less disruption to the lives of ordinary Africans and to the local political rhythms of the
      colony. This was important in territories which encompassed a wide diverse range of traditions and
      ethnicities. Under indirect rule, African polities could develop at their own pace. The model of
      direct rule, on the other hand, offered far greater potential for the social, economic and political
      transformation of the colony, and held out the hope and possibility that African subjects could be
      successfully “civilized” and perhaps even incorporated into the body politic of the metropolis.
      Candidates might rightly point out that in some colonies more than one administrative model was
      implemented, and that it wasn’t simply a case of “either one or the other”.

      For direct rule, French colonies might provide the best example. On a general level, the French
      harboured idealistic beliefs about the innate superiority of their own civilization, and felt that it was
      part of their colonial mission to impart their cultural values on Africans through the model of direct
      rule. Things were to turn out rather differently in practice. Although the French began by
      attempting to implement a very limited policy of assimilation in four Senegalese towns, they used
      African chiefs elsewhere at low levels of local government. Most of those appointed became in
      effect French government officials, whose job it was to collect taxes, recruit labour (including
      forced labour), and suppress opposition. Fifteen million Africans under French rule had hardly any
      legal or political rights, and were classified as sujets or subjects, at least until 1946. Education was
      one way in which Africans would be acculturated. It was planned to be of a high academic standard
      and delivered through the medium of French. In reality, very few Africans enjoyed access to it.

      The British system of indirect rule, pioneered by Lugard to administer the Sokoto Caliphate of
      Northern Nigeria, was adopted because it was believed to be the cheapest and most effective way of
      administering vast populations and areas with the minimum of European personnel. But the
      application of indirect rule varied enormously from colony to colony, and was not always in
      practice very different from French systems in its impact on African subjects. Though the British
      paid more attention than the French to the legitimacy of a candidate’s claim to chieftaincy, they did
      not hesitate to invent chieftaincies in stateless societies such as the Igbo of Nigeria and the Kikuyu
      of Kenya. The British made more use of traditional African systems of arbitration than the French,
      and allowed chiefs to judge local civil disputes and minor cases because this was administratively
      convenient and reduced the cost of colonial administration. It could also mean that chiefs rather
      than British colonial administrators were the target of African hostility when they enforced
      unpopular colonial laws.

Portuguese administrative policy was in theory similar to the French. A tiny minority of the
African population was classified as assimilado, but they did not have the voting rights of
French-assimilated citizens in Senegal. The vast majority of African subjects of Portuguese rule,
the indigena, faced punitive taxation and forced labour. While the Belgians used limited indirect
rule in Rwanda and Burundi, where there was a clearly defined pre-colonial authority structure
similar to that recognized by the British in Buganda, they allowed no participation in local politics
in the Belgian Congo, and actively discouraged secondary, let alone tertiary, education.

This is unlikely to be a popular question but good answers should have a specific, detailed and
focused knowledge of two contrasting examples.

Social and economic developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries 1800–1960

15.   “The status of women in Africa improved during the colonial period.” With specific reference
      to one of either Southern, West or Eastern and Central Africa, how far do you agree with this
      statement?

      Most of the textbooks currently in use in schools which study African history do not do justice to
      the topic of women, and few candidates are likely to have covered it in depth. There may thus be a
      tendency for candidates to produce vague generalizations without much supporting evidence. Good
      answers should use examples from one African region to agree or disagree, partially or wholly, with
      the statement.

      Women sometimes benefited from religious and educational changes, especially in areas with
      established Christian missions which greater gender equality was stressed and where discriminatory
      traditional practices were censured. Christian schools could sometimes help to increase the average
      age at which girls were married and assist them in gaining access to employment. Most women in
      the colonial period, however, continued to marry soon after they could bear children. On the whole,
      colonial change was less liberating for women than for young men. Women’s experiences differed,
      but many suffered as a result of economic changes. Following the abolition of domestic slavery, the
      work of former male slaves often fell to women. They were sometimes obliged to work for wages
      on cash-crop farms in addition to their domestic duties, while the men took most of the income.
      Many women profited from expanding food markets, but few had cattle or land of their own. The
      frequent seizure of land by colonial authorities and settlers meant that women tended to lose access
      to their sole source of economic independence, and this had had the effect of reinforcing traditional
      structures of patriarchy. The experience of Kikuyu women in Kenya is a good case in point.

      When men migrated to towns in search of work and wider experience, women were often left to
      work in agriculture and care for children. This affected women in Southern Africa in particular,
      where much of the male workforce migrated to the Witwatersrand to work on the gold mines. The
      impact on the traditional structure of the family was profound, usually to the detriment of women,
      who often had to assume the additional burden of looking after extended family. If the migrant
      husband was poorly paid, the wife might also have to take on casual wage labour. West African
      women retained their place in trade, but most new economic opportunities tended to be the preserve
      of men. Across the continent, women often supplied domestic services or were even reduced to
      prostitution in towns dominated by wifeless young men. Women also found few political roles in
      the new colonial order.

      The colonial era did not destroy traditional cultural institutions. Even though Christian missionaries
      tended to oppose traditions such as bride-price, the practice persisted and survives to this day in
      many parts of the continent, not least because it is supported by women and their families.
      Christian intolerance of polygamy and divorce had a variable impact. While chiefs’ harems
      gradually disappeared, polygamy did not. It has been estimated that in West Africa over 40 % of
      wives were still in polygamous unions when colonial rule ended. In Central and Eastern Africa,
      however the proportion of polygamous wives is estimated to have dropped to about 25 %, perhaps
      because of land scarcity, labour migration and high levels of bride price in cattle to be paid by the
      would-be husband. Attempts to eradicate the practice of female genital mutilation in some parts of
      the continent were also unsuccessful.

      The statement is obviously open to challenge and good answers might stress how limited the
      improvement was. They might also discuss what the status of women should be and what might
      constitute an improvement.

16.   Explain the reasons for the revival and spread of Islam in the nineteenth century in either
      West or Eastern and Central Africa.

      In previous years, when questions have been set on the spread of Islam or the slave trade, very few
      candidates have opted for East Africa. In Eastern and Central Africa, the spread of Islam from the
      coast to Unyamwezi, Buganda and further east was mainly the result of the establishment of an
      Omani sultanate in Zanzibar and the activities of the Arab and Swahili Muslim traders. Decisions
      taken by African rulers often played a big part in the spread of a particular religion. Mutesa I of
      Buganda encouraged trade with Muslim traders from the coast, and this briefly promoted the spread
      of Islam in Buganda. But Mutesa later invited Christian missions into the country when faced by
      the threat of Muslim invasion from Sudan. The Islamic presence along the Swahili coast and in
      other parts of the region such as Somalia and Ethiopia pre-dates the period. Reference might also
      be made to the activities of Mahdists in the Sudan, whose dramatic emergence as a political and
      social force resulted from the imposition of Turco-Egyptian rule, the heavy taxation levied by force
      on the pastoralist community by the authorities, and the attempts of the government to suppress the
      slave trade. Not least of the reasons for its emergence, however, was the charismatic and pious
      figure of the Mahdi, who inspired a devoted band of followers with his leadership.

      Most answers are likely to focus on West Africa, where the impact of Islam was much more
      extensive. Its revival was associated with a number of jihads such as those of Dan Fodio, who
      created the Sokoto Caliphate, and that of Al-hajj Umar. These jihads were aspects of a Muslim
      revival aimed at purifying Islam and strengthening its general influence, political as well as
      religious, in the area. Dan Fodio was a Fulani living in the nominally Muslim state of Gobir. He
      was an Islamic scholar and believer, associated with the Qadiryya Brotherhood. The sultans of
      Gobir tried to curb his activities, but his followers had the fervour of people who considered
      themselves to be true believers fighting a holy war. His brother and son also provided effective
      military leadership. The success of his jihad strengthened Islam and Sharia courts became more
      important. Al-hajj Umar joined the rival Tijaniyya Brotherhood, but he was inspired by the
      example of Dan Fodio. His attempts to spread Islam by force were not always successful, but they
      did help in the promotion of Islamic education and the expansion of Islamic Brotherhoods. Samori
      Toure also promoted Islam in his expanding Mandinka Empire. Vague generalizations should of
      course be avoided, but it would be valid to argue that the revival and spread of Islam may have been
      promoted by the relative simplicity of its teachings, the fact that it could accommodate traditional
      African customs like polygamy, and that the Muslim leaders were themselves African. Unlike
      Christianity, it was not associated with the colonial power, and its spread was not linked to the
      provision by missionaries of medical and health facilities. The importance of the growth in trade in
      the region was also of the utmost importance in promoting the spread of Islam, as was the education
      offered in Quranic schools. The conversion of the elites also did much facilitate its spread among
      the general population.

      Candidates may also refer briefly to factors which limited the spread of Islam. These might include
      the spread of Christianity, such as among the Igbo or Baganda, or the presence of an established
      orthodox Christian faith in Ethiopia, which limited the potential of Islam to spread still further. The
      survival and adaptation of traditional African religious movements, which still remained the
      religions of the vast majority of Africans at the end of the nineteenth century, could also be
      mentioned.

Nationalist and independence movements (Eastern and Central Africa)

17.   Analyse the role of Robert Mugabe in the Liberation War and the transition from Rhodesia to
      Zimbabwe in 1980.

      Discussion of Mugabe’s policies in independent Zimbabwe is not relevant to this question. Good
      answers should combine narrative with some explicit analysis.

      By the time Ian Smith announced the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Rhodesia in 1965,
      Mugabe was already politically active. He had been frequently arrested for his protests against the
      failure of the British to deliver independence under majority rule and the political domination of the
      colony by the white settler minority. He had left Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African Peoples
      Union (ZAPU) to join the newly-formed Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) under Rev.
      Sithole. The split in ZAPU mirrored the principal ethnic cleavage in the country, with many ZAPU
      leaders coming from the minority Ndebele while ZANU was dominated by the Shona majority.
      Mugabe was imprisoned for a long period but was released in 1974 as part of a Smith amnesty.
      However, ZANU remained banned. Mugabe replaced Sithole as leader of ZANU upon his release.
      When Mozambique became independent in 1975, ZANU’s operational headquarters relocated from
      Zambia to Mozambique and Mugabe helped to reactivate its military wing. He came to be
      recognized by African leaders as a major candidate for the leadership of the still-divided liberation
      movement. He was active in party affairs and military strategy, and travelled widely to win
      international support for the diplomatic campaign against Smith, who had co-opted Bishop
      Muzorewa in order to give the impression that he was ready to share power and accept African
      leadership in a new multi-racial dispensation.

      ZANLA, the military wing of ZANU, had 20 000 armed fighters. Mugabe and Nkomo, who were
      both Marxists, had temporarily put aside their differences in order to form the Patriotic Front, and
      both leaders took part in another round of peace talks in Malta in 1978. They insisted on elections
      leading to an independent and non-racial Zimbabwe. In 1979 Mugabe led the ZANU (PF)
      delegation to all-party talks at Lancaster House in London. These resulted in an agreement to hold
      elections. Mugabe went back to Zimbabwe in January 1980 and announced that ZANU (PF) would
      contest the election separately from ZAPU. He emphasized the need for reconciliation and for the
      full implementation of all of the provisions of the Lancaster House agreement. These included
      reserving 20 out of 100 parliamentary seats for whites. ZANU (PF) won 57 seats and Mugabe
      became prime minister and defense minister, but presided over a coalition government which
      included ZAPU together with white politicians.

      Mugabe played a crucial role in the liberation war as political and military strategist, but he was
      fortunate to have a base in Mozambique and to receive financial and material support from other
      African countries, especially Tanzania. Apart from Mugabe, ZANLA had other talented military
      leaders like Edger Tekere. Candidates could also mention the South African decision to withdraw
      military support from the Smith regime, and the role of the British government. Margaret Thatcher
      was persuaded by Lord Carrington to hold the Lancaster House Conference which resulted in the
      final breakthrough. All of these points might be discussed in a good answer, as they place
      Mugabe’s role in context.

18.   “Ethnic and religious rivalries explain why Uganda achieved independence later than
      Tanganyika.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      As with other quotations, candidates are free to agree or disagree in whole or in part, so long as they
      present supported arguments. The statement can be challenged on the grounds that there were other
      factors which facilitated the earlier achievement of independence by Tanganyika.

      In many ways, Uganda was a much more obvious candidate for early independence than
      Tanganyika. Makerere University was established in 1922, and Uganda had many well educated
      potential leaders by the late 1950s. The colony had few settlers and a well developed infrastructure.
      But there were several negative factors which delayed the achievement of independence
      in Uganda. These included the special position of Buganda and the intransigence of the kabaka,
      factors which were compounded by his deportation in 1953 and triumphant return in 1955. During
      the colonial period the British had treated the kingdom of Buganda like a separate political unit.
      The Buganda royalist party (Kabaka Yekka) had no programme beyond securing a privileged
      place for the Buganda kingdom within Uganda. Uganda lacked both charismatic leaders and
      genuinely nationalist parties. The UPC, led by Milton Obote, was the successor to the UNC
      which had disintegrated in the 1950s. It tried to unite nationalist forces across Uganda.
      However, it was Protestant-dominated and faced strong competition from the more conservative
      Catholic-dominated Democratic Party. In order to win power, the UPC entered into a marriage
      of convenience with the KY, and Uganda became independent in 1962 with an uneasy
      coalition of a royalist Buganda party and a nationalist party. Both were largely Protestant
      but had little else in common. The kabaka became president, and Obote prime minister. The rich
      farmers in Buganda were attracted to the KY while Protestant leaders and traders in the rest of the
      country favoured the UPC. However, neither of these attracted the Catholic civil servants, other
      educated elites and trade unionists, who rallied to the DP. Political divisions also reflected ethnic
      cleavages: Obote was seen as the non-Ganda leader of the non-Bantu speaking peoples of the
      colony, and his alliance with the KY was therefore highly ironic and unlikely. The independence
      of Uganda was delayed by the emergence of rival political parties, each of which reflected ethnic
      and religious interests.

      Tanganyika, in contrast, benefited from the emergence of a single, dominant nationalist party, the
      Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), and the peaceful, non-confrontational leadership of
      the charismatic Nyerere who respectfully known as Mwalimu, the teacher. He helped build TANU
      into a party that won the trust of all the ethnic and racial groups, and had such mass appeal that it
      won the most overwhelming victory of any African political party before independence. He was
      helped by the relative absence of ethnic rivalry and the unifying influence of English and Kiswahili,
      the impact of UN Trusteeship status on the territory, and the good working relationship he
      established with Governor Turnbull from 1958. Also significant was the large number of ethnic
      groups in the Tanganyika, and the fact that none of these were privileged or numerically dominant,
      as the Baganda were in Uganda. Neither Tanganyika nor Uganda, unlike Kenya, had its
      independence delayed by the presence of a large settler population. While there was of course a
      religious divide in Tanganyika between Christian and Muslim, religion was less politically
      significant than in Uganda, where rivalries between Catholic, Protestant and Muslim dated back to
      the factional chicanery in the kabaka’s court in the nineteenth century.

Nationalist and independence movements (Southern and West Africa)

19.   Why did Senegal achieve independence in 1960?

      This may seem a very straightforward question, but strong responses will place events in Senegal in
      the wider context of French colonial policy and explain the different circumstances which allowed
      Guinea to achieve independence two years earlier.

      French-speaking West Africa moved towards independence in a completely different manner from
      Britain’s colonies. For many years the main ambition of Africans had been to attain greater
      equality in Overseas France. Once nationalists were determined to attain full independence, another
      issue arose over whether French West African colonies should remain a single federation after it
      was achieved. Full federation was favoured by Senegalese politicians led by Leopold Senghor. In
      1946, a French Union was created in which the colonies or overseas territories would enter into a
      constitutional partnership with the metropolis. The colonies would have their own assemblies but
      also send representatives to the National Assembly in Paris. All inhabitants became French citizens
      and forced labour was abolished. The law which established this was named after the Senegalese
      politician Lamine Gueye. He and Senghor had campaigned from the 1930s for two Senegalese
      seats in the French Assembly. The first African to be elected a deputy in the French Assembly in
      1914 had been Blaise Diagne from Senegal. Gueye and Senghor were consistently elected to the
      French Assembly, and both opposed the formation of the RDA by Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the
      Ivory Coast, partly because of its links with the French Communist Party. Houphouet-Boigny
      broke off links with the Communists, became a minister in the French government, and helped to
      frame the Loi-Cadre of 1956 which marked a major change in French colonial policy as it gave
      French colonies considerable autonomy.

      A further decisive change took place in 1958 when President de Gaulle came to power and offered
      France’s West African territories the choice of self-government within a French community or
      complete independence with all the links with France broken. Only Guinea under Sekou Toure
      chose independence following a referendum. Senghor still hoped for a federation but when it
      became evident that that wasn’t possible, he decided that Senegal should form a more limited
      federation with the former French Soudan as the Federation of Mali. He had formed a political
      party, the PRA, in pursuit of this end. Senegal became independent in 1960, the same year as all of
      the other French West African colonies except Guinea, as part of the Mali Federation. However,
      the Federation was short-lived partly due to irreconcilable differences between Senghor and the
      Soudanese leader Modibo Keita. By the end of the year Senegal and the Republic of Mali had
      become separate independent states. The former was dominated by the newly-elected President
      Senghor and his party, the UPS or Progressive Senegalese Union, which held all 80 seats in the
      Legislative Assembly.

      In summary, Senegal achieved independence when it did partly as a result of changing French
      colonial policy. Other factors included the impact of the independence of Ghana in 1957 and
      Guinea in 1958, and the influence of Senegalese leaders, most notably Senghor. Good answers
      should cover most of these aspects and combine narrative with explicit analysis.

20.   Why was independence achieved so late, and only after an armed struggle, in Angola and
      Namibia?

      Good answers should discuss both Namibia and Angola in some depth and have a balanced
      coverage of the two. In each case the ruling power was extremely reluctant to concede
      independence, and freedom was achieved only after a long struggle. Both countries had a
      substantial European settler presence which was opposed to majority rule. Namibia had been the
      German colony of South West Africa but was ruled by South Africa after 1919. Angola was a
      Portuguese colony, but in 1951 the government of Antonio Salazar decreed that it was an “overseas
      province”. During the next two decades the white settler population grew rapidly, as did tensions
      between black African and the white community. In Angola, as well as in Namibia, the African
      majority could not remain immune to the nationalist wave sweeping across the continent in the
      1960s.

      The Portuguese government initiated limited reforms in Angola in response to the nationalist threat
      but these were inadequate. The first serious uprising was in February 1961. The Portuguese
      responded with determination and ruthlessness, and according to estimates as many as 10 000 may
      have died. The independence war continued. Unlike other colonial powers, Portugal was a
      dictatorship and was fully prepared to ignore international condemnation. South Africa was equally
      prepared to defy international opinion in Namibia. After Salazar’s retirement in 1968, his successor
      Caetano continued his policy for a few years until the economic cost of the war became intolerable.
      Independence for Angola came only after the Portuguese army lost the will to continue the conflict
      and suffer further losses, and it overthrew the Portuguese dictatorship in a coup in 1974. The new
      military regime granted independence to Angola in 1975.

      In Namibia, the United Nations was to play a major role. Responsibility for administering the
      former German colony of South West Africa was entrusted to the South Africans by the League of
      Nations in 1919. After the Second World War Namibia became the responsibility of the UN
      Trusteeship Council, but the South African government refused to transfer the mandate. After
      1948, the South African government withdrew co-operation with the UN but stopped short of
      annexation. However, apartheid laws were introduced. The Namibian issue was twice referred to
      the International Court of Justice, which in 1971 gave an advisory opinion that South Africa was in
      illegal possession and should withdraw. The General Assembly established an eleven-nation
      Council to administer South West Africa until independence, but its authority was ignored by
      Pretoria. From 1966, the General Assembly and the Security Council passed a series of resolutions
      which had little impact on the situation in Namibia. By the mid-1980s, South Africa was prepared
      to give up Namibia, but only on condition that Cuban troops were withdrawn from Angola. The
      end of the Cold War, together with the South African military defeat at Cuito Cuanevale in 1988,
      transformed the situation. The Security Council established a small mission, UNAVEM, to verify
      Cuban withdrawal from Angola, and in 1989 established the UN transition group in Namibia,
      UNTAG. This consisted of eight thousand peacekeepers and civilians who were deployed to
      organize and supervise elections and monitor the South African withdrawal. Elections in November
      1989 resulted in victory for Sam Nujoma’s SWAPO, which had been conducting an armed struggle
      against Pretoria since 1966. Nujoma became the first president of independent Namibia in March
      1990.

      Good answers will stress that the main reason for the late independence of Namibia was South
      Africa’s intransigence over the matter until the end of the Cold War. Similarly, Portugal’s
      reluctance to give up on its African empire was a key reason for the delay in Angolan independence
      until 1975.

Post-independence politics to 2000

21.   What policies were adopted to combat illiteracy and disease in any two independent African
      countries up until 2000?

      Few candidates will have studied this topic and it is unlikely that many will attempt the question.
      They may produce very general answers, but this would be unsatisfactory as the question requires
      specific reference to relevant policies in two countries. The choice of South Africa post 1994
      should be accepted, although strictly speaking South Africa became independent in 1910 under
      minority rule.

      The most obvious strategy for combating illiteracy was through the wider provision of education,
      especially primary schooling, but also at the secondary and tertiary levels. Providing mass
      education was however a very expensive undertaking, as it included spending on school facilities,
      libraries and equipment, especially at university level. Most of the costs were borne by national
      treasuries, though these were assisted by foreign aid and to a limited extent by UNESCO. All
      independent African countries tried to combat illiteracy by a massive increase in primary school
      enrolment. However, this still left many older people illiterate. Primary education was rarely free
      before 2000, which made it inaccessible to millions of young people. Females were often under
      represented at school, and rural areas tended to fare worse than urban areas. Most independent
      African countries chose to combat illiteracy by promoting the language of the colonial power with
      the exception of Tanzania, which chose Kiswahili both to promote literacy, national unity and
      traditional culture.

      Combating disease was also costly, but every independent country tried to promote the training of
      doctors and the provision of clinics and hospitals. Two UN bodies provided the model of best
      practice. The WHO succeeded in eradicating smallpox, and UNICEF helped reduce infant
      mortality thorough their program of promoting oral rehydration to combat diarrhoea, immunization
      which almost eradicated polio, breast feeding, healthy eating and family planning. Efforts to
      combat disease received a huge setback in the 1980s with the start of the Aids pandemic. Estimates
      suggest that by the early 1990 perhaps 2 % of all sub-Saharan Africa’s adults were infected with
      HIV. The worst affected country was Uganda, with perhaps 1 300 000 HIV sufferers, (8 % of its
      entire population), including as much as 25 % of the population of the capital Kampala. President
      Museveni supported a massive awareness program to get Ugandans to talk openly about HIV/AIDS,
      to change their sexual practices and to learn how to cope with the disease. This campaign had great
      success and the rate of Aids infection fell sharply.

      The policy of the Ugandan government was in sharp contrast to that of South Africa. By 1998 the
      Department of Health calculated that nearly 10 % of the population was HIV positive. The
      government reaction was confused and controversial. From 1997 to 2000 Mbeki agreed with the
      few doctors who argued that the link between HIV and AIDs was unproven. He supported an
      anti-Aids campaign awareness program, but refused to promote a larger-scale and costlier initiative
      to provide anti-retroviral treatment for sufferers. Many African governments deliberately
      understated the scale of the Aids problem for fear of damaging their tourist industry. Government
      policies could be diluted or obstructed by religious opposition, both Christian and Islamic, to the
      promotion of the use of condoms.

      Candidates might also note that governments encouraged the work of a number of different NGOs
      and missions, such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, the Red Cross, CAFOD and Feed the Children.

22.   Compare and contrast the reasons for, and the results of, military intervention in any two
      African countries since independence.

      Good answers should have a clear comparative structure and focus explicitly on similarities and
      differences. Expect a reasonable balance between “reasons for” and “results of”. There are plenty
      of examples to choose from, including many West African States such as Ghana and Nigeria, as
      well as Congo, Zaire, Ethiopia, Somalia and Uganda. Military intervention could be external as
      well internal. For example, Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles invaded Uganda in 1979 and
      overthrew the regime of Idi Amin. Military intervention could be undertaken as a result of a
      number of factors, but a frequent common reason was that soldiers got involved in order to
      overthrow unpopular and corrupt civilian administrations and restore good governance. Ethnic
      rivalry and personal ambition were other common causes of army intervention, but in many cases
      the reasons were more specific. Military intervention could of course fail, as in Kenya in August
      1982, where civilian rule was restored in less than a day.

      In Uganda, Milton Obote failed to maintain army loyalty, and the army commander Idi Amin
      suspected that he was soon to be replaced. He took advantage of Obote’s absence at a
      Commonwealth Conference in Singapore to stage a coup. For quite different reasons, Amin was
      himself overthrown by the Tanzanian army in 1979, and Obote by another army coup in 1985.
      Massive human rights violations committed by the Amin regime, together with a cross-border
      refugee crisis, prompted the Tanzanian intervention, while it was ethnic rivalries within in the army
      that led to an Acholi-led coup against Obote’s tribe, the Langi. Sudan has had mostly military
      leaders since its independence in 1956. It has been ruled by a succession of military rulers,
      including Numeiry and El-Bashir. Military intervention in Ethopia had quite different causes and
      results. There was a short-lived coup in 1960, largely provoked by discontent with the rule of Haile
      Selassie. A provisional military council known as the Derg seized power in 1974, and by 1976
      Mengistu emerged as the head of a military dictatorship. Widespread corruption, famine, and the
      feeling that Selassie was a US puppet were all factors in his downfall. Student activism and
      opposition was another very important factor in his replacement by the military. Both Ghana and
      Nigeria had military coups in early 1966. In Nigeria, the widespread belief that the elections of
      1964–1965 had been rigged finally destroyed the credibility of the civilian government. Similarly
      in Ghana, corruption, lavish spending and intolerance of criticism led to the overthrow of Nkrumah
      in 1966. There had been a growing feeling among Ghanaians that Nkrumah was playing the
      international statesman at the expense of his country’s mounting economic problems. But there
      were in addition specific military grievances related to pay, proposed cuts in the defence budget,
      and alleged government interference. The first army coup in Nigeria in 1966 was followed by
      another in July, amid fears of ethnic domination by the Igbo. The massacre of thousands of them in
      the north led Colonel Ojukwu to declare a secessionist state of Biafra in the southeast. This led to
      civil war from 1967 to 1970. Meanwhile the military government in Ghana, having purged the civil
      service of Nkrumah’s political supporters, handed power back to the civilian politician Kofi Busia.
      When he failed to solve Ghana’s mounting economic problems in the face of a further sharp fall in
      world cocoa prices, the army returned to power under Acheampong in 1972. Once again specific
      military grievances, including further cuts in the military budget, seem to have prompted the army
      action.

Results varied widely. They were often but not always negative. Some military rulers, especially
in Ghana and Nigeria, were prepared to hand power back to civilian authorities. In assessing
results, candidates might judge how far the military rulers solved the problems they sought to
remedy. Military interventions in Nigeria sharpened ethnic rivalry, although Gowon achieved a
remarkable level of reconciliation after the civil war ended. In Sudan, the issue of arabization led to
prolonged Southern resistance led by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army. In Ethiopia, thousands
were killed or tortured as Mengistu imposed his vision of Marxism-Leninism and wiped out
opponents. Tigrayan and Eritrean nationalist movements finally drove him from power in 1991.
Amin’s rule had a major and profoundly negative impact on the people of Uganda, the Ugandan
Asians and the East African community as a whole, and led indirectly to the return of Obote.

Africa, international organizations and the international community

23.   Why was the United Nations initially more successful in the Congo than in Somalia before
      2000?

      The UN was set up in 1945 with peacekeeping as one of its main objectives. At the time, this was
      understood as entailing the prevention of or bringing a peaceful end to conflict between states. The
      problem in later years, especially in Africa, was that most conflict was within states, often as an
      indirect result of artificially created colonial boundaries. Conflicts like those in the Congo and
      Somalia were very difficult to deal with, as many of the conditions for successful resolution
      were lacking. For some chance of success, the parties to the conflict had to be genuinely willing to
      co-operate. The Security Council had to award a clear mandate and provide adequate finances,
      manpower, equipment and resources for the UN operations. In the case of both the Congo and
      Somalia, the UN struggled with problems surrounding these issues. However, most candidates will
      agree that in the Congo the UN was at least initially more successful.

      ONUC (1960–1964), the acronym for the first UN operation in the Congo, was at the time the most
      complex civilian and military operation ever mounted by the organization. Its chances of success
      were complicated by the impact of the Cold War. When Belgian Congo became independent in
      1960, there were few Congolese doctors, senior government administrators, lawyers or army
      officers. Within days there was a mutiny in the armed forces, together with widespread rioting and
      attacks on Europeans. The Belgians illegally sent in troops to protect their nationals. The president
      of the mineral-rich province of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, announced its secession with Belgian
      help. Prime Minister Lumumba, who was supported by the Soviet Union, asked for the UN’s help.
      The Security Council authorized a mission and Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold organized
      ONUC, a peacekeeping operation. The first peacekeepers were from five African countries but they
      were increased to 10 000 troops with contingents from India, Pakistan, Sweden and Finland.
      Hammarskjold was reluctant to intervene in Katanga where Lumumba was murdered in June 1961.
      The Americans had backed his rival and successor, Mobutu Sese Seko. Hammarskjold himself died
      in a plane crash on his way to meet Tshombe later in 1961. The next Secretary-General U Thant
      was authorized by the Security Council to remove mercenaries and end the secession of Katanga,
      which was achieved in 1962. ONUC withdrew in 1964. It was not an unqualified success but the
      UN could be credited with the removal of illegal Belgian troops, the prevention of foreign
      intervention, maintaining the economy and administration of the country, and ultimately in
      reuniting the Congo.

      The UN could point to no such success in Somalia. After the military dictator Siad Barre fled
      Mogadishu, Somalia became a failed state. Two major parts of the country, Somaliland and
      Puntland, seceded. The UN did little while civil war broke out, 350 000 died of famine and another
      million fled to refugee camps. In 1992, 500 Pakistani peacekeepers arrived but UNOSOM had a
      wholly inadequate mandate. The US intervention in 1993 was a complete failure. The UN
      withdrew in 1995, having failed to re-unite Somalia or end the civil war between rival clan
      warlords. Indeed, militias loyal to the warlords, particularly those of Mohamed Aideed, would
      regularly attack the peacekeepers and generally hamper UN operations. The failure of UNOSOM
      to disarm the militias was thus one of the reasons for its withdrawal. The international community
      had very little interest in Somalia, whereas the resources of the Congo made it a focus of American
      and Russian Cold War rivalries and the US, especially under President Kennedy, was prepared to
      subsidize a substantial and fairly successful operation. Whereas some African countries were
      prepared to contribute to the operation in the Congo, the same was not true of Somalia because the
      OAU discouraged the intervention of its members in the affairs of fellow member states.

24.   Assess the regional impact of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
      and the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) up until 2000.

      ECOWAS, founded in Lagos in 1975, was significant as a regional organization in that its
      membership of sixteen states cut across the barriers of Anglophone and Francophone West Africa.
      In 1993 its members signed the Cotonou treaty, committing them to the establishment of a common
      trading market and currency, but this has yet to be fully realized. It did not try to embark upon
      political union but concentrated on gradually increasing regional economic cooperation, starting
      with transport and telecommunications and moving on to greater financial and commercial
      interchange. EUMOA, an organization which worked towards the achievement of a single
      economic community in the region, was created in 1994. Unfortunately it included only the
      Francophone countries which used the CFA Franc, as well as Guinea Bissau. The establishment of
      Ecobank, a regional development bank, in 1985 was a major success for ECOWAS, as it has
      worked to promote economic growth across the region ever since. In 1990 ECOWAS took the bold
      political initiative of assembling a peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, in war-torn Liberia. Though it
      had mixed results there, and later on in Sierra Leone and Cote d’Ivoire, as any international
      organization would have in a situation of civil war, it showed what could be achieved by African
      leaders taking collective responsibility for affairs beyond their own immediate national borders.

      The Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) was founded in 1980. It
      brought together the different states in Southern Africa in a bid to gradually break their economic
      dependence on South Africa, and to work towards ending the apartheid regime in that country.
      Namibia joined it on achieving independence in 1990. SADCC, like ECOWAS, enabled its region
      to coordinate negotiations for long-term development loans. SADCC began moves towards
      establishing a regional economic and trading network, and in 1993 it changed its name to the
      Southern African Development Community, as it looked forward to the incorporation of a free
      South Africa under majority rule. It was also involved in the struggle to end apartheid and bring
      about majority rule in South Africa. This was of course achieved in 1994, the same year in which
      South Africa joined the organization. Candidates would be justified in pointing out that the regional
      impact of SADCC, especially during the early years of the organization, was rather limited, not
      least because of civil wars in Angola and Mozambique, ideological differences between the
      different governments, and differing strategies towards dealing with the apartheid government in
      South Africa.

      If only ECOWAS or SADCC is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
