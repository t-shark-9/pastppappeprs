1.    (a)   Why, according to Source D, was the occupation of the Ruhr
            “disastrous” for France?                                                      [3 marks]

             The United States and Britain led the committees set up in Paris in the aftermath of
              the crisis.
             With no commitment to the Treaty of Versailles, the United States became the
              mediators of its implementation.
             France surrendered independence and the rights conferred by the Treaty of
              Versailles.
             The League of Nations was now in charge of disarmament.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                     [2 marks]

             Although Poincaré was determined to use armed force against Germany, he is
              warned that it will not produce the desired effects and cripple the German economy
              as a result of passive resistance.
             French policy drove Germany towards Bolshevism.
             The shabbily dressed image of Germany could imply she was unable, rather than
              unwilling to meet the payments.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             –4–             M13/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S1/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about the
     consequences of the occupation of the Ruhr.                                       [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      They both show the crisis had negative consequences for France as it lost control over its
       own affairs.
      They both show that Britain and the US were critical of French actions.
      They both mention the involvement of the United States in European affairs.
      The both indicate that committees, such as Dawes, were set up to address the crisis.

     For “contrast”
      Source D focuses on the consequences of the crisis which led to the involvement of the
       League of Nations, whereas Source B analyses the role of individual countries in the Ruhr
       crisis.
      Source B makes reference to the impact of the occupation of the Ruhr on France’s
       domestic policies while Source D focuses on the consequences for France’s international
       relations.
      Source B is more focused on the British response to the crisis while the main emphasis of
       Source D is upon the United States’ response.
      Source D is more critical as it centres on the negative consequences for France whereas
       Source B is more positive in its analysis of the outcome internationally.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison
     or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source E for historians studying the Ruhr Crisis (1923).             [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        A public statement made by President Ebert of Germany on 10 January 1923 as
                    a response to the French occupation of the Ruhr.

     Purpose:       To denounce the occupation as an act of aggression of France against
                    Germany. To publicly classify it as a violation to the Treaty of Versailles.
                    To encourage fellow citizens to resist the occupation.

     Value:         It is made at the time of the outbreak of the crisis. Coming from the president,
                    it reveals Germany’s official response to the crisis.

     Limitations:   As a public statement made at a time of great tension, the speech aims to
                    motivate the Germans to resist the occupation. It is unlikely to provide an
                    insight into French motivation.

     Source E
     Origin:        An extract from a book published in 1991 by American historian Ronald E
                    Powaski, who is a specialist in twentieth century history.

     Purpose:       To explain international relations, particularly the role of the United States in
                    Europe in the first half of the twentieth century.

     Value:         The author is an expert in the field and his work can help put the Ruhr Crisis
                    into a historical context and to understand the tensions between the nations and
                    the role each of them played. The work has the benefit of hindsight and,
                    because of the date of publication, access to a wide range of resources.

     Limitations:   The focus is on fifty years of the twentieth century and not explicitly on the
                    Ruhr Crisis, which may only be a secondary topic of the book.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one
     source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer
     to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations in their assessment.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, evaluate the impact of the
     Ruhr Crisis (1923) on international relations between 1923 and 1929.                [8 marks]

     Source material:
     Source A:    French policy violated the Treaty of Versailles and increased Franco–German
                  tensions; it threatened Germany’s stability.

     Source B:     It increased tension between Britain and France over the treatment of Germany
                   and deepened British fears of a dominant France. The United States became
                   more involved in European affairs and, approached by Britain, promoted the
                   Dawes Plan to assist the economic recovery of Germany. France was left
                   at the mercy of the United States and Britain. The crisis led to the revision of
                   German reparations in 1924 and to the Treaty of Locarno in 1925, so it
                   improved international relations.

     Source C:     The cartoon shows tension between France and Germany. Also, it illustrates
                   the risk that the occupation of the Ruhr might push Germany into the arms of
                   Bolshevism.

     Source D:     The aftermath of the occupation led to the dominance of Britain and the United
                   States in international meetings; the United States became the mediator of the
                   Treaty of Versailles which they had not ratified; the League of Nations became
                   more involved in disarmament; France lost power.

     Source E:     The Source suggests that the Ruhr Crisis had a negative impact on international
                   relations. Britain and the United States’ condemnation of France soured
                   relations with France; the impact of the occupation on Germany threatened
                   German democracy and the post-war international settlements. This instability
                   also made Europe more vulnerable to Bolshevism. On the other hand, the Ruhr
                   Crisis pulled the United States into greater involvement in Europe in order to
                   receive repayment of war debts.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: additional information about the greater involvement of the
     United States in European affairs; the appointment of Gustav Stresemann in 1923 leading to
     Dawes, Locarno and the beginning of negotiations in 1928 resulting in the Young Plan.
     Germany’s admission into the League of Nations in 1926, the renewal of the Treaty of
     Rapallo with the Treaty of Berlin in 1926 and the German signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact
     in 1928 all indicated Germany’s re-emergence as a major power but her dependence upon the
     Dawes and the Young Plan made her precariously dependent upon the United States. The
     crisis changed attitudes to the Treaty of Versailles and opened up opportunities for revision.
     Candidates could also mention French support for separatist movements in the Palatinate and
     the Rhineland; additional material on Britain’s policy of “benevolent passivity” and its impact
     on relations with France, such as British views about the need to ensure an economically and
     democratically viable Germany, in contrast with French policy to make Germany pay at any
     cost

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
