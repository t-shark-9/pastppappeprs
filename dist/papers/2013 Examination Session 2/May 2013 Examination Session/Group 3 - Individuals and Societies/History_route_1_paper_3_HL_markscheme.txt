Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

    0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
            appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
            detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
            are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
           limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
           but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant historical knowledge
           is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
           There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
           commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
           an understanding of historical processes has been made. An attempt at a structured
           approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
           Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
           generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
           are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
           and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
           top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant, in-depth
           knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to
           indicate some in-depth understanding, but it is not consistent throughout. Events are
           placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
           comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
           substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently
           integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
           question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
           knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
           such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
           interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
           balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
           commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
           may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
           may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
           present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
           contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
           well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   For what reasons, and with what results, was either the Franciscan or Dominican Order
     founded?

     Reasons
     The reasons for the founding of these orders are similar and relate to the challenges facing the
     Church in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The Church was losing popularity to groups which
     attacked its wealth and privilege and supported a simpler establishment more in touch with the
     people. In addition, the Church was facing challenges as a result of the twelfth century renaissance,
     the founding of the universities and the influx of classical philosophy, scientific knowledge and
     other new ideas from Spain. The growth of heretical groups and the challenge posed by
     philosophers such as Abelard posed a challenge for the Church. The new orders were designed to
     meet these challenges each in their own way.

     Franciscans were to be a humble order devoted to a life of poverty that would reaffirm faith in the
     Church amongst those alienated by its wealth. They were to travel and preach to the faithful and
     reconfirm their loyalty to the Church. Their example of service and humility would prevent the
     growth of heretical sects that saw the Church as wealthy and privileged. They were to re-establish
     respect for the Church amongst the disaffected population. Franciscans were also to act as
     missionaries and travel to foreign countries to convert the population.

     The Dominicans were to combat heresy and reconfirm faith through intellectual debate, teaching in
     universities and schools and through preaching, especially to the educated and wealthy population.
     They were to reconcile the new knowledge with Church doctrine in order to prevent a loss of
     support.

     Both orders were established as part of the movement of Church reform in response to heretical
     groups such as the Waldensians and Cathars.

     Results
     Heretical movements were less popular as the Franciscans and Dominicans increased support for
     the Church and addressed the challenges that it faced. Both took an active role in the suppression of
     heresy as inquisitors, preachers and examples of a reformed church. Both orders produced many
     teachers and intellectuals who taught at universities and worked to reconcile the new knowledge
     with Church doctrine. An example would be Thomas Aquinas.

     The Franciscans also produced a number of original thinkers such as Bacon and Grosseteste who
     took an interest in science and helped reconcile it with religious faith. Neither order had much
     success as missionaries, particularly in Muslim areas, although the Franciscans took a leading role
     in converting native populations in the New World during the Age of Exploration.

     If only reasons or results are dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

2.   Assess the causes and results of the expansion of papal power under Innocent III (1198–1216).

     The causes of the expansion of papal power may include, but not be limited to: the character of
     Innocent III, a skilled lawyer and diplomat who was able to negotiate and debate in favour of
     expanded papal authority. He was determined to exercise the power of the Papacy over all secular
     rulers. His power was increased by the decline of the power of his opponent, the Holy Roman
     Empire, which was in a state of civil war. This gave him greater control over the German Church
     as well as an end to imperial interference in the affairs of the Italian Church.

     His power was based on the work of Church reformers such as Gregory VII who fought to ensure
     that the Church was free of secular interference and was entitled to discipline disobedient or sinful
     rulers. Innocent continued and expanded this concept and interfered in secular matters to discipline
     or admonish rulers such as Phillip II and John I. The crusading movement, the suppression of
     heresy and continuing church reform gave the Papacy more prestige which could be used to support
     its policies. He was responsible for extensive church reform and reorganization through the Fourth
     Lateran Council. This increased his prestige and the influence of the Church. He also reorganized
     Church finances which made it wealthier and more influential.

     The results were that the Church reached a new height in influence both in religious and secular
     terms. The surrender of John I in the face of papal sanction demonstrated this power. The founding
     of the Franciscan and Dominican orders increased respect for the Church, suppressed heresy and
     continued the reform movements. The Church gained its independence from secular interference
     and rulers were now under the supervision of the pope who could interfere to punish them.

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   “The principal reason for the rise of the Fatimids was the unpopularity and weakness of the
     Abbasids.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This will be a popular question. Candidates must assess to what extent they believe that the rise of
     the Fatimid dynasty was the result of Abbasid weaknesses. Candidates may present other reasons
     but must address the issue of Abbasid power in their response. Responses must be in a well-
     structured, analytical format supported by accurate relevant content.

     Evidence of Abbasid weakness may include, but not be limited to: loss of control of large areas of
     the Empire in the eighth and ninth centuries (Spain, North Africa and Egypt). Declining tax
     revenues and power for the caliphate as local rulers refused to send tax money to the capital. There
     were increasing problems in society caused by the growth of trade, cities and a more complex and
     diverse society. This led to internal clashes based on cultural and racial lines. There was a growth
     of sectarianism as the Sunni–Shi‘a division continued and grew. Local interests became stronger
     and less controlled by the central government.

     The reasons for the Fatimid rise may also include, but not be limited to: the success of the Shi‘a
     missionaries from Yemen who converted many people to the view that a new leader was required to
     restore Islam. They refused to submit to the caliphate and promised a new ruler who would bring
     change. This appealed to many of the disaffected groups. Their skills in preaching their message
     attracted many supporters unhappy with the caliphate. The conversion of the Berber tribes of North
     Africa gave the Fatimids a powerful army to launch their conquest of North Africa. The Fatimids
     also appealed to the new commercial classes, and through their navy, helped expand trade and gain
     them wealth, power and support.


4.   Assess the impact of the Fatimid conquest of Egypt and the founding of the city of Cairo.

     Candidates have a wide range of material from which to choose and may include political,
     economic, social and cultural topics. Limiting the response to only one of these would not be
     sufficient for a strong response.

     The impact of the Fatimid Empire in Egypt and Cairo may include, but not be limited to:

     Economic: promoted a major expansion of trade, establishing trading routes to India, connections
     with Europe through the Italian cities. Large fleets were created which travelled through the Red
     Sea, Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean. Increased Egyptian agricultural and industrial production
     and made Egypt/Cairo the economic centre of the Islamic world. They made considerable advances
     in ceramics, metalware and glassware.

     Political: Cairo, the capital of the Fatimid Empire, rivalled the Abbasid caliphate for power and
     influence in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The Fatimids produced a system of government based
     on merit not religious or tribal affiliation. Their policies of religious toleration were the most
     progressive at that time.

     Culture: New styles of architecture were introduced. Centres of learning such as al-Azhar were
     established, which later became among the earliest universities to be founded along with a great
     number of schools and colleges. Extensive libraries were created. Cairo became the intellectual
     centre of the Islamic world. Cairo also became the centre of the Ismaili missionary movement
     which spread Ismaili doctrine throughout the Islamic world.

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   Why were the kings of France able to conquer most of the Angevin territory in France by
     1223?

     Candidates must produce a well-structured explanation supported by relevant detail.

     The reasons for the French victory may include, but not be limited to: the growing power of the
     French monarchy based on increased territory and strong central control. The deaths of Henry II
     and Richard I removed the best English military leaders. John was an ineffective and unpopular
     ruler who lost support at home and in France. Phillip was able to defeat John and seize territories
     from 1204 onwards. The defeat of John and his allies at Bouvines was the decisive factor.

     Other factors would include the unpopularity of English rule in France, particularly due to heavy
     taxation which alienated the local population. A desire by the French to evict foreign rulers also
     contributed to the English defeat. Many French nobles abandoned their alliance with the English in
     favour of the French king. English nobles were less willing to support military campaigns to defend
     or reclaim territory in France.


6.   Describe the methods used by the Norman kings of England, William I (1066–1087) and
     Henry I (1100–1135), to establish effective central governments.

     This will be a popular question.

     The methods used to establish effective central governments may include, but not be limited to: the
     military superiority shown in the conquest and the subsequent suppression of rebellion, strong
     control over the nobility exercised by both monarchs through the feudal system, suppression and
     removal of all opponents both Saxon and Norman, establishing effective administration to ensure
     the royal power was carried out throughout the kingdom. Officials were supervised and replaced if
     they failed to follow royal orders or proved dishonest. The establishment of royal courts throughout
     the country increased the king’s influence and control and good relations with the Church ensured
     the king of important support.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   “The Second (1145–1149) and Third (1189–1192) Crusades failed because of the strength of
     the Muslim opposition.” Discuss.

     Candidates must produce a response that explains the failure of the Second and Third Crusades.
     Their response must address to what extent this was the result of the strength of the opposition or
     other factors.

     The strength of the Islamic opposition had increased due to the emergence of strong leaders such as
     Nur al-Din and Salah al-Din (Saladin) who unified the Muslim forces and provided effective
     military leadership. Muslim determination to resist the invaders increased as did their morale as
     they achieved some success. In addition, Salah al-Din’s (Saladin’s) conquest of the Fatimid Empire
     added considerable strength to the Muslim forces opposing the Crusaders. The Seljuk forces were a
     powerful opponent to Crusaders attempting to reach the Holy land through Anatolia and Syria.

     The other factors that may explain the failure of the two Crusades may include, but not be limited to:
     both Crusades suffered a lack of manpower after the German contingents failed to reach the Holy
     Land, poor relations with the Byzantine Empire caused problems, a lack of cooperation between the
     leaders in both Crusades hindered the effort, poor strategic decisions and failure to understand the
     political situation in the Holy Land contributed to the failure of both Crusades.


8.   Assess the impact of the Crusades on either medieval Europe or the Muslim world.

     The impact of the Crusades on medieval Europe may include, but not be limited to, political,
     economic, religious, social and cultural areas.

     Economy
     The economic impacts may include: the growth of the Italian cities through trade and shipping, new
     trade routes and connections with Islamic world established, importation of new products from the
     east flourished, helped create a more commercial economy in Europe.

     Culture
     A great influx of new products, foods, architectural styles and dress, as well as an enormous amount
     of intellectual material. Knowledge of science, medicine and technology was expanded through
     contact with the Islamic world. Classical knowledge was also discovered and imported to Europe
     where it assisted in the creation of the twelfth century renaissance and a wide range of new ideas in
     philosophy.

     Religion
     The failure of the Crusades was a setback for Christianity and the papacy and led to increased
     criticism of the Papacy but it did achieve success within Europe in the suppression of heresy and the
     Reconquista. The Crusades also contributed to increased persecution of Jews and an increased level
     of hostility between the Christian and Islamic worlds. There was further violence and intolerant
     attitudes.

     The Crusades weakened Christianity in that they contributed to the decline in power of the
     Byzantine Empire and its replacement by a Muslim power.

The impact of the Crusades on the Muslim world may include, but not be limited to: loss of territory
to the invaders for several centuries, weakening of the Fatimid Empire contributing to its collapse,
emergence of new military leaders such as Salah al-Din (Saladin), a new sense of Islamic unity and
militancy to resist non-Muslim invaders, increased commercial links with the West particularly
Italian cities, loss of the Muslim states in Spain, Christian alliances with the Mongols led to defeats
and occupation of the Muslim world.

Politics
The Crusades increased divisions in the Middle East between various factions – this led to defeats
in the early years of the Western invasion. However, a response to the Crusades led to stronger
Muslim regimes as leaders such as Nur-al-Din and Salah al-Din (Saladin) emerged and unified the
Muslims. The presence of the Crusaders in the Middle East continued to undermine Muslim power.
The Fatimid Empire was overthrown by Salah al-Din (Saladin) partially as a result of the Crusades.
The concept of jihad re-emerged as a result of the Crusades.

Economy
Development occurred as Western merchants sought to expand trade with the Middle East and
created increased demand for products from the region.
The impact of the Crusades was largely negative in the Middle East as a result of the damage and
casualties caused by war and increased political and religious divisions. Some increase in Muslim
confidence occurred as a result of the defeat of the West and a more hostile attitude toward the West
developed.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.    Why were the Abbasid caliphate and the rest of the Islamic world unable to resist the Mongol
      invasions?

      This may be a popular question. The inability of the Islamic world to resist the Mongol invasion is
      a combination of the weakness of the caliphate and the Islamic world and the strength of the
      Mongol invaders. Candidates should provide a well-structured analytical response that incorporates
      aspects of both explanations.

      The weakness of the caliphate was the result of loss of control of distant parts of the Empire,
      invasions and attacks from rival groups such as the Fatimids, Seljuks, Mamluks and the European
      Crusaders. Local rulers became more powerful and gave no support or allegiance to the caliphate.
      The caliph became a titular ruler with little power beyond the city of Baghdad. The caliph was
      unable to organize or lead an effective resistance.

      The Islamic world was also divided by political rivalry between local rulers, tribes and factions.
      Religious factions existed and were increasing in some areas and cultural divisions continued to
      exist in a diverse and multicultural community. This made any unified response to an external
      threat very difficult to organize. In addition, some Muslim rulers had failed to establish a strong
      bond with their subjects – they deserted their rulers at the first opportunity.

      The Mongol strengths which would also account for their success may include, but not be limited to:
      the power, discipline and tactics of their army. Their policies of religious tolerance gained them
      allies, their support of religious leaders, support of trade and commerce, their establishment of
      peaceful and orderly societies attracted support and weakened support for many Muslim rulers.


10.   Assess both the positive and negative impacts of the Mongol invasions for the Islamic world.

      The negative impacts of the Mongol invasion may include, but not be limited to: extensive
      destruction of towns, property, depopulation of many areas. The caliphate was ended as Baghdad
      was captured and the caliph killed. The unity of the Islamic world was destroyed. Baghdad did not
      recover its place in the Islamic world. Iran became the new centre of Islamic civilization.

      Positive effects may include, but not be limited to: the Mongol invasion produced greater political
      stability and unity in many areas, towns and trade expanded. Mongols converted to Islam in 1295
      and continued the spread of Islam to Asia. Contact with Asia was expanded for both commercial
      and cultural reasons. Mongols supported scholars and scientists.

      If only positive or negative impacts are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   Assess the principal influences of al-Andalus on the Islamic world.

      The ways in which al-Andalus influenced the Islamic world may include, but not be limited to:

      Political
      It was the first breakaway state from the Abbasid Caliphate – exposed the problems of trying to
      control a large empire and began the process of breakup. It created a new type of Islamic society
      with a high level of toleration, and the integration of different faiths and cultures created a
      successful state for many years.

      Cultural
      It was a major source of intellectual development from Muslim and Jewish scholars such as
      Averroes, Maimonides and others. Many intellectual advances in the Islamic world originated in or
      were developed by scholars in al-Andalus. These ideas were transmitted through the Islamic world
      and influenced developments elsewhere. There was considerable interaction between the
      universities in al-Andalus and those in Cairo and Baghdad. Al-Andalus was also a fertile source of
      literature for the Islamic world.


12.   Analyse the reasons for the expansion of Christian power in Spain after 1031.

      Candidates should present a well-structured essay supported by relevant content. The reasons for
      the expansion of Christian power may be found in a combination of Islamic problems and changes
      in the Christian world.

      The Muslim problems may include, but not be limited to: the collapse of the Umayyad dynasty and
      the division of the Muslim territory into 36 parts, constant strife amongst these small kingdoms
      weakened the Muslim grip on power, the Christian kingdoms joined together and became stronger,
      Muslim states made alliances with Christian states to fight other Muslim states which increased
      Christian wealth and power while weakening the Muslim states, the capture of Toledo in 1085 was
      a major boost for Christian morale. New Muslim rulers (the Almohads and Almoravids) could not
      restore Muslim power due to strife between them and their unpopularity with many Muslims in
      Spain. The Christians in Spain received major reinforcements from Europe as part of the crusading
      movement. This allowed them to be victorious at Los Navas de Tolosa which was a major blow to
      Muslim power. Military orders, such as the Templars, established themselves in Spain to fight
      against the Muslims and added strength to Christian armies. Christian states gained in wealth and
      power by adopting Muslim knowledge, technology and military tactics.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   In what ways, and with what results, did Edward I (1272–1307) seek to expand his royal
      authority?

      Edward I desired to expand the power of the monarchy and recover what had been lost during the
      reign of his father, Henry III. Edward’s efforts to regain royal power and influence were assisted by
      his personal qualities: hard work, ability to choose effective ministers, determination to rule well
      and considerable skill as a leader.

      His methods to expand power may include, but not be limited to: reassertion of all his feudal rights
      no matter how tenuous. He overhauled the feudal system and placed it under royal control, he took
      steps to end local conflicts and disorder. He exercised control over the sale and transfer of feudal
      estates to increase the funds that he received from his feudal rights. He increased his revenues
      through a tax on wool and established his rights to do so on a permanent basis. He increased royal
      influence in the legal system as he created three separate royal courts to administer justice in both
      civil and criminal cases. He limited parliament to the great nobles in order to exercise better control
      over it. His military campaigns in Wales, Scotland and Ireland were undertaken to increase his
      power and wealth.

      The results of his efforts were mixed. He did gain power and respect through his administrative and
      legal changes. He was able to expand his control of Wales, Scotland and Ireland. It might be noted
      that English control in Scotland and Ireland did not survive him. Royal courts had wider influence
      in all matters both civil and criminal. His desire to limit the power of parliament was not successful
      as he was constantly in need of funds for his wars. This forced him to summon parliaments
      composed of lesser nobles and the merchant class to gain approval for taxation. His constant
      indebtedness due to wars was a major obstacle to his attempts to expand his power. His desire to be
      an autocrat was therefore not entirely successful.

14.   Analyse the reasons for the establishment of parliament in England in the thirteenth century.

      Candidates must address the reasons for the establishment of parliament during this period. The
      period encompasses the reigns of John I, Henry III and Edward I.

      The reasons for the establishment of parliament may include, but are not limited to: the principle of
      limiting the king’s power as in Magna Carta. Limits to the kings’ power were the result of a loss of
      faith in them as leaders and excessive financial burdens placed on the great nobles. Defeats in war
      and loss of land by John I and Henry III encouraged opposition, lack of respect for the monarch and
      a demand to limit his ability to make important decisions on foreign policy and taxation.
      A desire to control the king’s ability to impose taxes was a major incentive to institute some limits
      on his power both by the nobles and the middle classes. They demanded that they be given a share
      in power in exchange for agreeing to increased funds for the king.
      The Provisions of Oxford in 1258 became the basis for proposed limits to the king’s power.
      These proposals and the leadership of Simon de Montfort in the movement to limit royal power
      resulted in civil war between his supporters and the king. The defeat of the king led to the
      summoning of parliament in 1265 which admitted the middle class to state offices and an increased
      role in the process to limit royal power.

      The establishment of parliament and the monarch’s acceptance of the need for parliament to consent
      to new taxation was formalized under Edward I. The reason for this concession by the king was the
      king’s constant military campaigns which required increased financial support. The king was
      forced to seek the consent of parliament and make concessions in return.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   Explain the decline in power of the Duchy of Burgundy in the fifteenth century.

      The reasons for the decline of the Duchy of Burgundy may include, but not be limited to: the
      English defeat in the Hundred Years War removed their strongest ally. The Burgundian role in the
      death of Joan of Arc increased popular feeling against them. Their constant strife with the French
      monarchy, notably Louis XI, caused loss of territory and wealth due to the increasing weakness of
      the ruler, Phillip the Good.

      The failure of the League of the Public Weal to limit the power of the French monarchy reduced the
      power of the French nobles and increased the power of the king. Charles the Bold of Burgundy was
      an extravagant individual who bankrupted the Duchy and reduced its ability to remain independent.
      Charles the Bold was unable to find allies in his struggle with the French monarchy while Louis XI
      was able to create a league of hostile forces which led to the crushing of the Burgundian Army in
      1477 as well as the death of Charles the Bold. The Duchy was then divided by France and the Holy
      Roman Emperor.


16.   Analyse the causes and the results of the Wars of the Roses.

      The Wars of the Roses had both long-term and short-term causes. Candidates may refer to both in
      their responses. These may include, but not be limited to:

      Long-term causes
      These are related to the continuing disputes over the royal succession after the overthrow of
      Richard II by Henry IV. This demonstrated the power of the feudal lords and their desire to
      maintain control of the monarchy – created friction as different families struggled for the succession.
      The growth in wealth and power of the nobility set the stage for conflict amongst rivals. The
      nobility felt entitled to interfere in the succession.

      Short-term causes
      The more immediate causes may include: the weakness of Henry VI as king, his failures in the
      Hundred Years War undermined his popularity and public support. The king was also regarded as
      mentally unfit to rule by many and this increased tension over who would succeed. Henry VI had
      no heir, which created the conditions for a struggle over the succession between the York and
      Lancaster families. The attack on the King’s forces by the Duke of York in 1455 began the war.

      Results
      The results of the war may include, but not be limited to: Henry VII defeated Richard III, became
      king and established the Tudor dynasty. Physical destruction from the war was limited. The
      nobility were weakened by their struggles against each other, Henry VII established a strong central
      government which removed their private armies and limited their influence. The urban areas and
      the middle classes became more powerful as the nobility weakened. The middle classes replaced
      the nobility as royal advisers and administrators. They supported a strong central government to end
      the anarchy of the Wars of the Roses and reduce the power of the nobility whose power they
      resented. This further increased the power of the king and the central government.

Fourteenth century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   “The Black Death was the principal reason for the decline of feudalism.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to respond to the statement and explain to what extent they feel that it is
      accurate. A number of candidates may challenge the statement. All responses must discuss the role
      of the Black Death in the decline of feudalism even if it is not considered a major cause.

      Factors that would support the statement may include, but not be limited to: labour shortage made
      peasants more valuable and able to demand concessions and relief from feudal obligations. Many
      peasants were wealthier through inheritance and could negotiate an end to their servile status.
      Peasants abandoned the land for towns, forcing lords to change conditions to attract labour. A lack
      of labour caused a conversion to stock-raising and commercial agriculture in place of traditional
      manorial economy. Peasants were expelled and estates converted to commercial agriculture based
      on rents alone. Institutions which supported feudalism, such as the Church, were also declining or
      losing influence.

      Factors that would oppose the statement may include, but not be limited to: the decline of feudalism
      had begun many years before the Black Death as a result of famines which had reduced labour
      supply and forced lords to make concessions, peasant uprisings had forced changes in laws and
      conditions, new industries and markets encouraged lords to convert to commercial farming and end
      traditional manorial agriculture. The growth of towns provided refuge and employment for serfs
      which forced lords to make concessions to retain labour. Feudal lords’ need for cash caused them
      to end traditional manorial agriculture and serfdom. New technology, production methods and
      products were creating an economy that was out of step with the manorial system.


18.   “The Black Death had both a positive and negative impact on the medieval Church.” Discuss.

      Candidates must present a well-structured response which clearly explains both the positive and
      negative impact of the Black Death.

      The positive impact of the Black Death may include, but not be limited to: increased levels of
      personal devotion by many expressed in pilgrimages, practice of flagellation, many continued to
      depend on the Church for support and were aware of the sacrifices made by many clerics to help.
      The Church emerged from the crisis without a major outbreak of heresy or challenges to its position.

      The negative impact of the Black Death may include, but not be limited to: a large number of clergy
      died in the plague – many were amongst the most devoted. The Church was forced to recruit large
      numbers of new clergy whose level of devotion, education and overall quality was often lower and
      this led to abuses and complaints against the Church. The lack of priests made it necessary for them
      to hold multiple offices. This led to further abuse and corruption of wealth and power in the future.
      The Church was not able to provide an explanation for the plague and lost the respect of some as a
      result, the despair caused by the plague caused moral decline, loss of faith, expansion of witchcraft
      and hedonism. Some of the loss of faith in the Church was reflected later in movements such as
      Lollardry. The negative impact on the Church can be seen as both short- and long-term. A decline
      in respect for institutions and a general cynicism was also harmful to the position of the Church.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Assess the reasons for the Ottoman victory over the Byzantine Empire and the capture of
      Constantinople.

      The Ottoman victory should be explained in terms of their strength and the declining power of the
      Byzantine Empire.

      The Byzantine Empire had been in decline for several centuries and had been seriously weakened
      by the Western conquest in 1204, the Mongol invasions and loss of Byzantine territory to the
      Ottomans in the Balkans in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The lack of support from the
      west when continued Byzantine existence was threatened was another reason for its decline. Its
      internal divisions and dynastic problems had further weakened it. Ottoman strength was based on a
      number of factors; their extensive military experience, military organization, extensive use of the
      latest technology including artillery and the high morale of their troops were major factors. The
      defeat of their opponents such as the Seljuks by the Mongols and the later demise of the Mongols
      gave them an opportunity to expand their territory and power, they increased their wealth and power
      by commercial treaties with the Genoese merchants as well as their acquisition of land in the
      Balkans from which they drew money and military recruits. Their administration in the Balkans
      was seen as more benevolent than that of the Byzantines and added to their support from Christian
      populations. The conquest of Constantinople can also be seen as a combination of their strength,
      better tactics and technology, excellent leadership and the weak resistance of the Byzantines.


20.   How did the expansion of the Ottoman Empire affect medieval Europe?

      The effects of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire on medieval Europe may include, but not be
      limited to: the Ottomans controlled the Balkans and posed a serious threat to the countries of central
      Europe such as Hungary. Europe was in a state of war with the Ottoman Empire and under threat
      of invasion until the seventeenth century. The Ottomans played a role in European diplomacy,
      entering into an alliance with the French against the Holy Roman Empire. Italian cities such as
      Venice expanded their trade with the Ottomans. Their control of the eastern Mediterranean helped
      inspire the Western exploration movement as well as naval struggles in the Mediterranean.
      Ottoman government and administration were seen as a model of modern, efficient, centralized
      government by political writers such as Machiavelli. European governments were encouraged to
      emulate the policies of the Ottoman Empire if they wished to avoid unrest. Ottoman conquest of
      Constantinople made Rome the centre of Christianity and provided a number of refugees from the
      Byzantine Empire who contributed to the arts, culture and economy of Europe.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500

21.   “Italy was the only place in Europe where the Renaissance could have occurred.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question requires candidates to understand the conditions that led to the Renaissance occurring
      first and foremost in Italy. Candidates must identify the key reasons and determine if they were
      unique or particular to Italy as opposed to other areas of Europe.

      The conditions in Italy that contributed to the Renaissance may include, but not be limited to: many
      parts of Italy were not feudal in nature – not constrained by tradition, Italy had continued its
      connection to the classical past and was open to the knowledge and ideas of antiquity, Italian
      universities were leaders in secular studies of law and medicine, Italian cities had wealth and a great
      range of cosmopolitan influences through trade with Islam, Constantinople and other areas. Italian
      cities had developed strong independent spirit of municipal government based on a progressive
      middle class. The wealth of Italian cities provided great support for the arts and humanist ideas.
      Overall Italy was the wealthiest and, in many ways, most progressive part of Europe and as such a
      logical home for the new ideas and attitudes found in the Renaissance.


22.   Explain how conflict in the Renaissance period affected the development of the arts.

      Candidates should be able to explain how conflict in Italy, both political and military, helped
      support the development of the arts. Conflict was between cities, families, the Church and the state
      and between individuals.

      The reasons that conflict may have aided the arts may include, but not be limited to: wealthy cities
      supported artists, architects etc in an effort to produce better examples of the new art and
      architecture than others, the same was done by families, the Church and individuals. There was a
      desire to display wealth and power through art and the employment of the most famous artists.
      Everyone was trying to outdo others in an effort to provide proof of their wealth and power. It was
      a form of warfare but creative not destructive in nature. This encouraged artists to come to Italy, to
      develop new styles and techniques and produce even better works. The fact that artists now had
      secular patrons was a huge change from the medieval period when the Church had been the major
      patron and dictator of styles. The fact that wealthy individuals were competing for their talents and
      giving them creative freedom was a great boost to the arts. The worth and fame of families such as
      the Borgias, Medici etc were in some part based on their support of artists and the works they
      produced. This competition made the artist a celebrity and contributed to the quantity and quality
      of works produced.

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   Analyse the role played by the Muslim world in the process of Western exploration.

      The Muslim world played a significant role in the process of western exploration.
      Some of the ways in which the Muslim world contributed to the process may include, but not be
      limited to: the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople and increased control of the Middle East,
      Mediterranean and trade routes to the East encouraged traders to seek other routes to the spices of
      Asia. The continuous religious conflict with the Muslim world, particularly in the Iberian peninsula,
      encouraged efforts to attack the Muslim world in other parts of the world and seek converts to
      Christianity.
      Muslim science and technology played a large role in making the voyages of exploration possible:
      cartography, mathematics, ship designs, navigation instruments were all strongly influenced or
      developed by the Muslim world. Skilled travellers and explorers from the Islamic world were often
      drawn upon by western navigators in seeking local and regional knowledge and expertise.


24.   Assess the reasons for the existence of long-distance travel in the Muslim world.

      There are a considerable number of reasons for the tradition of long-distance travel in the Islamic
      world.
      The cultural and linguistic unity of the Muslim world for centuries made travel and communication
      easier than elsewhere. The existence of long-distance trade routes on land and sea provided
      information and organizations such as caravans through which travel could be undertaken. The
      improvements in cartography and the availability of accurate maps made travel easier. The travel of
      scholars between universities in various parts of the empire was a constant factor as was the work of
      missionaries who either travelled to convert Muslims to a particular sect or to expand the frontiers
      of Islam.
      The political unity that existed at many times under groups like the Ottomans, Mongols, and
      Fatimids allowed individuals to travel easily and securely.

      The travelogues composed by famous writers such as Ibn Batuta, Ibn Khaldun, etc contributed to
      knowledge about far-flung regions. Travel to Mecca for the pilgrimage by Muslims from across the
      Islamic world also contributed to this.
