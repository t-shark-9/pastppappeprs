                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe two benefits for LR of using cell production.                                 [4 marks]

           Benefits of using cell production could include:

            Employees see the product and participate in the production process from
             beginning till the end thereby creating a sense of ownership, interest, creativity
             and motivation. That could allow LR to create new innovative farm/dairy
             products.
            Creates empowerment for LR workers, hence increasing motivation further in
             LR. Low staff turnover can decrease costs for LR hence more money will be
             available for the much needed fund for R&D in LR.
            Improved communication, avoiding confusion arising from misunderstood or
             non-received messages.
            Workers become multi-skilled and more adaptable to the future needs of RL.

           Accept any other relevant benefit with a description.

           While the points above are rather generic, it is expected that candidates will make
           some reference to LR.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct benefit identified and [1 mark] for
           describing the benefit in context up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain two benefits for LR of meeting quality standards.                              [4 marks]

           By meeting quality standards LR could benefit from:
            A wider acceptance of its products both nationally and possibly internationally.
             The compliance with quality standards shows that LR produces internationally
             recognized / approved quality products. Customers regards quality of food as
             important as damage can be done to the body. The farm will be able to
             enhance its export and compete in many more markets, increase customer
             retention and attract new customers through an international presence. LR can
             use this as a USP.
            Higher prices. LR will be able to enter into demanding markets that are ready
             to pay higher prices for quality products.
            Enhanced marketing. LR will be able to advertise its compliance with quality
             standards to create business opportunities and attract new customers.
            An improvement in employee motivation and morale.                A successful
             implementation of quality standards at LR will probably entail the inclusion
             and involvement of workers into the process, which could lead in turn to an
             increase in motivation and commitment among employees.

           Accept any other relevant benefit.

      N.B. Given that the question does not ask for international standards, do not
      penalize candidates who do not refer to international issues.

     Year 4   12  0.73 = $8.76m
     Year 5   17  0.68 = $11.56m

     Total present value $33.59m

     NPV = TPV – initial costs
     NPV = 33.59 – 24 = $9.59m

(d)   Comment on your results to parts (c)(iii) and (c)(iv).                              [3 marks]

      If LR acquires El Remanzo, the NPV over the five years would be of $9.59m
      (or $9.67m). This means that the acquisition of El Remanzo is a viable project
      and produces a positive return on the investment. On the other hand, the gearing
      ratio will increase to 53.33 %. With a gearing ratio higher than 50 %, LR will be
      highly geared as most of the capital will be borrowed. As the farm will have to
      pay interest on the loan, the acquisition will imply higher risks for LR.

      Accept any other relevant comment.


      Award [1 mark] for a relevant brief comment on either the NPV or on the
      gearing ratio.

      Award [2 marks] for one relevant well-developed comment on either the NPV or
      on the gearing ratio.

      Award a maximum of [3 marks] for a relevant comment on the NPV and on the
      gearing ratio.

      If the candidate only repeats the figures award [0 marks].

(e)   Analyse two costs to LR resulting from the acquisition of El Remanzo.                  [6 marks]

      The financial costs of the takeover will be $24m. This financial cost will also lead
      to cuts of LR’s R&D budget to zero. Given that the company (LR) has a culture of
      innovation, LR may find that their current competitive advantage is eroded and
      that demotivation of workers occurs. If new markets are not developed, then
      redundancies may occur.

      However, the benefits in terms of economies of scale are considerable and may
      allow LK to experience risk-bearing economies of scale – an essential ingredient
      for a company wishing to innovate. Other types of economies of scale may be
      experienced as well. The reduction in costs of production may enable LR to
      channel some funds for R&D and remain competitive.

      Linked to the culture idea is that currently LR uses cell production. The
      acquisition of El Remanzo may lead to a company which is much larger and
      difficult to organize. Cells will need to be created from a much larger pool of
      workers and it may take time for El Remanzo to adjust to this new environment.
      There may be diseconomies of scale within the enlarged company.

      However, a synergy may be created between the employees and the management
      of both organizations which could lead to efficient production and a supportive
      culture. More cells can be created to concentrate further on developing and
      producing new products.

      Moreover, the much larger company may be able to lobby the government to
      overturn some of the legal constraints hampering innovation in the eyes of the
      Financial Manager. The new larger company will become a much larger presence
      in the market and will increase market share allowing the company to exercise
      much greater control over pricing.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      For one relevant cost that is one-sided, with no analysis, award up to a maximum
      of [3 marks]. For one relevant cost that is balanced, with analysis, award up to a
      maximum of [4 marks]. For two relevant costs that are one-sided, with no
      analysis award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

2.   (a)   Describe two advantages to Icarus of having a family brand.                             [4 marks]

           Advantages of a family brand could include:
            It allows Icarus to offer new and or related products/services to customers
             under one family brand name, which is established and positioned in the minds
             of stakeholders, especially consumers, as innovative and most trusted. Thereby
             reducing promotional/advertising costs on creating brand awareness especially
             for such an innovative concept such as outer space hotel. Hence, it may allow
             Icarus to experience marketing economies of scale, as they need only to
             advertise the family brand, which is associated to their portfolio of products.
            Enable brand extension with low level of risk and costs and higher chance of
             success. Icarus might find it easier to attract investors for their new hotel
             venture to be built under the family brand.

           Accept any other relevant advantage with a description.

           For full marks candidates should describe the advantages of a family brand rather
           than just branding in general.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct advantage of a family brand
           described and [1 mark] for application to Icarus (beyond the name) up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to Icarus of using stratified
           samples in its market research.                                          [4 marks]

           The population is divided into segments that have some common characteristics; a
           number of respondents from each segment are chosen that is proportional to the
           population. The selection within the segment is done randomly.

           Since Icarus caters to a niche segment, stratified sampling may reveal interesting
           and specific data which can then be used to focus and streamline marketing
           efforts.

           As the sample is more representative, stratified sampling is likely to improve the
           accuracy of market research for potential guests interested in staying at the new
           outer space hotel given the very high cost.

           Sampling (standard) errors are likely to be reduced. For Icarus, they will allow
           very accurate figures for forecasting potential revenues given the high risks of this
           project and a potential first-mover advantage can be gained.

           Stratified samples can be difficult to identify appropriate strata for a study. It is
           more complex to organize and the cost of conducting this type of research is likely
           to be very high. It also takes time to identify suitable market research respondents.

(ii)   Explain the limitations of the 2013 break-even chart from part (i) as a
       decision-making tool for Icarus.                                        [3 marks]

       Given the nature of this project being perceived as extremely risky and
       unique, break-even alone cannot provide enough information as a decision-
       making tool.

       There are weaknesses in a break-even analysis model: the linear nature of
       the cost and revenue diagrams based on the assumption that costs and price
       are constant. New competition may reduce Icarus’ ability to increase prices.
       We have limited information about how costs could further change, for
       example, due to economies of scale. There is the assumption that all rooms
       are sold-which might not be a realistic assumption given the potential
       risk/danger that consumers may perceive.

       No probabilities or qualitative and quantitative risk are attached to the
       model as it might be difficult to predict some external influences that might
       impact on a trip to outer space.

       The model ignores any qualitative issues like the reaction of the employees
       who need training, or new and future competition in this market. It would be
       wise for Icarus to examine other models and to use other marketing and
       business tools such as investment appraisal, before reaching its final
       decision.


       Award [1 mark] for each relevant limitation explained.
       Award [1 mark] for explaining each limitation in context / application to
       Icarus up to [2 marks] per limitation.

(e)   Analyse Icarus’ decision to open the first hotel in outer space.                      [6 marks]

      The decision to open the first hotel in outer space will allow Icarus to exploit a
      new niche market. Given the stratified samples of families with incomes
      over $10 000 000, it would appear that a price skimming method is being used.
      With price-skimming, the high market research costs and development will be
      recouped. Icarus has already invested significant funds into this project and
      would be unable to realize profits if they withdrew from the project or if it was
      incomplete. It will also allow Icarus to beat competitors as it will guarantee
      Icarus a first-mover advantage and cement in the minds of the consumers that
      Icarus is still being innovative.

      Moreover, given the well established and reputable brand image combined with
      the use of family branding, Icarus is likely to be successful.

      However, there are unexpected costs with the project, with three years until
      completion, these costs will impact on future profits.

      Given the customer service and perception of Icarus, the issue on training
      becomes paramount. Intensive training will add to the costs considerably. Are
      there any other aspects of preparing for customer service in outer space, which
      have yet to be considered?

      If the product/service fails, there is a great risk of negative effect on the other
      products under the family brand.

      With future revenues and costs uncertain, the degree of risk in the project is
      considerable. Perhaps they could form a joint venture to share these? Moreover,
      other adventure tourism companies are considering entering this innovative and
      unique market. Icarus’ potential USP may be eroded very quickly.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

                                               SECTION B

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    productivity                                                                     [2 marks]

                  Productivity is a measure of the efficiency of production.          It makes
                  reference to the amount of output per unit of input.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  A pressure group is an organized group of stakeholders who believe in the
                  same cause and decide to join forces to act together by putting pressure on
                  businesses. For example, lobbying governments to change laws and
                  appealing directly to public opinion to advance the pressure group’s interest.
                  (for instance about pollution or about the ecological impacts of the new
                  bridge).

(b)   Explain two non-financial rewards used at Construir to motivate workers.            [6 marks]

      Empowerment: is the process of enabling or authorizing an individual to think,
      behave, take action, and control work and decision-making in autonomous ways.
      It entails more freedom, autonomy and the power to make own decision. One
      may argue that empowerment shows respect, trust and level of delegation from
      the management and hence enable employees to feel competent, respected and
      trusted. This may in turn increase motivation and employee satisfaction.

      Teamwork: means organizing the labour force into teams. It usually implies
      workers planning their own work or projects, and making their own decisions.
      Teams usually set targets to achieve and may receive rewards for doing so.
      Teamwork has proved to be a successful motivator at Construir as “commitment
      to quality is strong, and productivity is high”. Working in teams facilitate more
      social interaction and possibly support and friendship from team members

      Job enrichment: implies increasing the depth of the job to include
      responsibilities that have traditionally been carried out at higher levels of the
      organization. As training is a crucial element to job enrichment, Construir is
      making substantial investment in the training and professional development of its
      workers to encourage it. Employees feel appreciated, supported and more
      confident

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      N.B. the answer should focus on job enrichment not enlargement/or rotation.

      Accept training and/or appraisal as non-financial rewards.

      Mark as 3+3.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying an appropriate non-financial reward, [1 mark] for
      an appropriate explanation and [1 mark] for a further development of this
      explanation with some application to Construir up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   Analyse two benefits for Construir of a public-private partnership with the
      government.                                                                 [6 marks]

      A public-private partnership (PPP) is an agreement between the public sector and
      the private sector for the purpose of designing, planning, financing, constructing
      and/or operating projects which would traditionally be done by the public sector.
      The current government is considering the construction of a bridge through a PPP
      with Construir.

      Construir could benefit from the PPP:
       Construir will share the construction costs with the government as the latter
        will pay half. Construir will then transfer some of its financial risks to the
        public sector.
       A source of income will be generated for Construir as the company will be
        given the right to charge drivers a fee for using the bridge. In addition, profits
        will possibly be higher.
       Due to the gains on experience and economies of scale, Construir may be
        offered new construction projects and hence more business opportunities may
        be created for the company on successful completion.
       Accept any other relevant benefit.

      However, Construir will have to face several costs if the PPP with the government
      takes place:
       Opportunity cost: In order to build the bridge, Construir will have to turn down
         other construction projects and thus lose business opportunities.
       The project also entails important risks for Construir. As the current
         government is unpopular, there are chances that the project will be cancelled if
         another government is elected. In addition, operational and financial risks are
         also involved.
       Construir’s corporate image could be damaged due to the local environmental
         pressure groups campaigning against the bridge project. These groups would
         rather have government funds allocated to alternative social projects.
       Accept any other relevant cost.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      For one relevant benefit that is one-sided, with no analysis, award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks]. For one relevant benefit that is balanced, with analysis,
      award up to a maximum of [4 marks]. For two relevant benefits that are
      one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Evaluate Construir’s training and appraisal methods.                                    [9 marks]

      Training makes reference to the activity of imparting knowledge or skills to
      improve worker’s performance. Construir makes substantial investment in the
      training and professional development of its workers who receive both external
      and internal training.

      Workers at Construir are externally trained at a local university. Construir may
      then benefit from increased motivation and commitment among its workers as
      they would probably acknowledge the value of being trained externally, which is
      usually costly. External training could also bring fresh new ideas into Construir,
      as workers mix with people from outside the company; ideas could be exchanged
      and relationships developed. Concentration may also be enhanced as workers are
      sent out of their usual working environment. It could also be argued that external
      training at a university can be of a better quality as is provided by professional
      educators in facilities that were specially built for training purposes. On the other
      hand, university fees are increasing for Construir. Travelling to and from the
      university can increase costs for Construir in terms of lost productivity time.
      If staff training takes place during the day then there may be some disruption of
      the working day. This would not be the case if staff training was undertaken
      outside working hours.

      Construir also conducts in-house or internal training which is led by the managers
      within each department. Internal training may be less expensive as fees are not
      paid. In addition, new skills could be applied quickly in the real working
      environment. On the other hand, it may narrow worker’s perspectives as external
      contact and sharing experiences are not possible. In addition, it seems that
      managers conducting training at Construir do not feel comfortable doing this
      activity; this situation may lead to demotivation and generate conflict among
      managerial staff.

      Construir also conducts appraisals. Benefits include the possibility of identifying
      worker’s strengths and weaknesses to improve their performance, setting
      professional development targets to motivate them, rewarding success and
      enhancing communication. However, some of the managers have expressed their
      concerns about the appraisal process at Construir. They believe that it takes too
      much time and that it is very stressful for some workers. The impact on
      Construir’s productivity and worker’s motivation could then be negative.
      Alternatively, managers could be further trained on how to conduct appraisals
      efficiently; time may be saved and managers may feel more comfortable with
      appraising their subordinates.     Workers in turn, should be told of the
      “constructive” intention of appraisal; anxiety about criticism could then be
      reduced and worker’s productivity and motivation improved.

      Training and appraisal are crucial components of human resources planning and
      hence the arguments for are very significant. It is not a question should they be
      stopped, but how to improve the process. The arguments against, while relevant
      are of less significance. Nevertheless, Construir should assess and adjust, when
      necessary, its current training and appraisal methods to reach the ultimate goal of
      remaining competitive in the construction market.

4.   (a)   Describe one possible above the line and one possible below the line
           promotional method for OA.                                           [4 marks]

           OA could use the following tools.

           Above the line:
            an advert of charging below market prices compared to competitor airlines
             could be included on the company web site
            TV commercials or radio advertising
            advertising in magazines targeted to business passengers, eg journals.

           The above is only a list, application to OA is expected.

           Below the line:
            point-of-sale material: such as a toy aircraft, T-shirts with the logo on etc to
             possibly include the mission statement, or excerpts from customer feedback
             indicating the level of customer service
            sales promotions could be used, although many of OA’s flights are full

(b)   Explain three stakeholder conflicts at OA.                                              [6 marks]

      There are a number of stakeholder conflicts present at OA:
       Obese passengers versus other passengers. The issue is a lack of space
        impacting on emergency evacuation procedures if the very obese passenger
        does not purchase an additional seat.
       Business passengers versus families travelling in business class (from the
        stimulus).
       Pressure groups and OA’s Board of Directors or Eythor (directly), over the
        issue of the credibility of OA’s ethical objectives.

      Accept any other relevant stakeholder conflict with an explanation.


      Mark as 2+2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for correctly identifying a relevant stakeholder conflict and
      [1 mark] for an explanation of the nature of that conflict with application to OA.

(c)   Analyse how the two social changes could affect OA’s ability to fulfil its
      mission statement: “In the air, we care for everyone!”.                    [6 marks]

      OA’s mission statement reads “In the air, we care for everyone!”. The business
      aims to cater for both business and economy class passengers. However the two
      social changes will impact on the airlines ability to deliver on its mission.

      The degree of obesity is increasing, some passengers complain about the lack of
      space. The business is trying to satisfy passengers who are not obese by charging
      those that are very obese for two seats. With OA flights mostly full, it is likely
      that obese passengers will have to pay twice. On the one hand one may argue that
      by doing so OA does not care for the obese passengers, OA is going to have to
      define what an obese passenger is. This could be regarded as culturally
      insensitive and unethical.

      However, not only do the obese passengers affect the comfort of other passengers,
      they also create some safety issues that must be addressed by the airline as safety
      is the most important factor in the aviation industry.

      To fulfill its mission, OA is going to have to spend time and resources
      determining appropriate criteria to indicate who has to pay twice. There may be
      some significant public relation issues here.

      The issue is equally difficult for families travelling in business class. The mission
      is created to cater to both segments. It can be argued that families with children
      who can afford the service should not be discriminated against and that is what
      OA is trying to do. However, loyal business customers that do not like the
      children in the cabin may seek other airlines. The new proposed daily family-only
      service caters for this need. To separate the two markets is potentially a good
      solution. However, we must note the potential hostility from families who cannot
      afford the new “higher” prices for this service and may feel discriminated against
      by OA.
                                             – 21 –           M13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



      One is tempted to suggest that OA may need to alter its mission to “In the air,
      we care for everyone … at the right price!”. It will be difficult to satisfy all
      stakeholders and the mission given the two social changes.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      For one relevant social change that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks]. For one social change that is balanced, with analysis
      award up to a maximum of [4 marks]. For two relevant social changes that are
      one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss an appropriate marketing mix for OA’s proposed new “family-only
      service”.                                                               [9 marks]

      Although this is a service, the 7Ps marketing mix in its entirety is not expected.
      Candidates’ answers should be in context and specific reference to the
      family-only service is expected to achieve the top two markbands. A judgment is
      expected at the top of the markband.

      A discussion of pricing and promotion should be at the centre of the analysis as
      these are indicated in the stimulus, but answers should include reference to at least
      two more Ps to be allocated marks in the top markband under detailed analysis.

      Candidates should refer to at least one advantage and one disadvantage of each of
      the recommended / proposed marketing mix.

      Suggested responses with balance include:
      Product/service – the proposed family-only service could lead to the creation of a
      new competitive strategy for OA if family friendly, through facilities such as a
      playing area, trained staff for children entertainment and special children menu.
      This augmented service is likely to attract the families who are likely to approve
      the segregation and the more bespoke service. With the right price, OA could
      increase demand significantly.

      However, OA needs to ensure the availability of spare capacity otherwise the
      business passengers will feel alienated and OA may danger the loyalty and custom
      of the business passengers.

      The cost in terms of the provision of the service might be very expensive.

      Price – OA is well known for its below market pricing method. Eythor expects
      that the new service will need to be priced above current market levels given a
      reduced number of seats and more space. Families travelling in business class
      will be able to pay, but the danger of price skimming is that they may raise the ire
      of pressure groups.        What if families cannot afford this new service?
      Overcrowding may result on OA’s other flights, exacerbating the problems
      highlighted in the stimulus material.
                                       – 22 –            M13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Promotion – the new service will need a new promotional mix. Perhaps this
could be through direct marketing to families through a loyalty scheme, or public
demonstration of the new service? Or even open days at OA headquarters.
Answers should be creative and in context.

The costs of promotion should be carefully looked at but given the fact that OA is
likely to use promotion now, perhaps it is not a major issue. However, OA’s
Marketing Manager has to take care not to neglect and alienate the business
passengers and keep or even enhance the promotion for this segment. Costs may
increased as OA is unlikely to enjoy advertising economies of scale.

People – appropriately trained staff will be required to staff the new service.
This will raise costs, although it appears that OA has been successful and this may
add value to the product and be used in future promotional activities.

Physical evidence – The costs of refitting the plane could be considerable but
given the fact that OA is providing a service, the physical evidence is of
paramount importance. Moreover, the tangibility of the service can be used in the
promotion especially advertising.

Place – the distribution channels for the service include not only the flight, but the
booking systems and the airport facilities. OA may be best advised to separate the
family-only flights from the regular operations, possibly in specific waiting areas.
Ticket sales may be offered in some more imaginative locations such as toy
outlets. However, there may be cost implications and possible erosion of brand
image if too much attention is given to children.

Process – may refer to waiting times, and customer services beyond the flight.
For example, OA will need to consider activities during waiting periods and also
redesign their customer satisfaction surveys. Again, there is the issue of costs,
availability and training of staff etc.

Conclusion/Judgement:
The marketing mix should strategically fit / support each other. There is a danger
that given the enhanced service, the price has to be increased significantly. This
will erode OA’s current USP and reputation.

However, a market gap has been identified by Eythor so the assumption is that
there will be a demand and that the needs for such a service exists.

By providing such a service OA can enjoy a first-mover advantage and create a
new USP especially in the short run.

If successful, more competitors are likely to enter the market with similar services.
This type of service cannot be patented. Hence the airlines might find themselves
trying to fill the same gap with possibly lower price and better services hence less
profit. Such a new service is unlikely to be sustainable in the long run.
                                       – 23 –            M13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


One has to remember that the new service being offered is for one flight a day. In
the short run OA is likely to manage and schedule the flight for the convenience of
children and parents which is likely to be different from the requirements of the
business passengers. Both segments are likely to be satisfied. OA is likely to
create a win win situation.

In the long run, if the demand increases for any of the services and profit is made,
OA can increase capacity.

It might be worthwhile for OA to try the new service.

5.   (a)   (i)    Define the term social marketing.                                 [2 marks]

                  Activities that seek to influence social behavior in order to maintain or
                  improve the consumers and society’s well being through promoting
                  activities that are regarded as being beneficial to a stakeholder community.
                  In this stimulus material, MT is promoting healthy eating and youth sport
                  participation.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and

           (ii)   Identify two characteristics of a matrix structure.                              [2 marks]

                  Characteristics of a matrix structure (project teams) could include:
                   project team will come from various departments/functions and will last
                    for the duration of the project to be carried out and then workers return to
                    their original teams
                   flexible and high quality decision-making due to workers being qualified
                    and high level of delegation and empowerment.

                  Accept any other appropriate characteristic, which is related to
                  organizations that are not organized along functional lines.


                  Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct characteristic identified up to
                  a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            – 25 –           M13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain the role that budgets could play in solving the cash-flow problems
      at MT.                                                                     [6 marks]

      MT nearly faced bankruptcy in 2012 as the management did not adhere to the
      budget and overspent on social marketing.

      Had the management of MT followed the budget, it would allow MT to exercise
      some financial discipline and avoid the financial crisis.

      Moreover, a variance analysis could have been carried out to identify specific
      issues / lack of inflow and higher outflow. Corrective action should have been
      taken to avoid the crisis. In short, the management of MT should have created and
      followed the whole budgetary process.

      The Financial Manager should now pay very close attention to creation and
      execution of the budget especially to the issue of cash flow. Attention should be
      made to forecast as accurately as possible the possible inflow and outflow of cash
      as well as other revenue, income and expenditure. The cup success is not certain
      for next year so additional cash coming into MT is not guaranteed. Therefore
      having tighter budgets in place is useful to discipline Dave to not repeat mistakes
      of the past.

      The club now has funds in which to repair the stadium which may reduce cash
      outflows in the future. A budget could be set for spending less on social
      marketing activities, which could bring in additional cash in the future through
      increased attendances and therefore improving the cash flow of MT.


      It is expected that two roles will be explained. Hence mark as 3+3.

      Award [1 mark] for a relevant role with an additional [1 mark] for application to
      MT. Award an additional [1 mark] for a developed explanation up to a maximum
      of [3 marks] per role.

      Credit the candidate that explains more than two relevant roles and therefore the
      explanation of each role may lack some depth and detail.
                                            – 26 –           M13/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Using two appropriate motivation theories, analyse player motivation at MT.           [6 marks]

      Herzberg two factor theory / Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and some influence of
      Taylorism are appropriate theories, but please be aware that candidates may use
      others.

      Assuming salaries are paid and sufficient, one can assume that the lower level
      needs is being satisfied.

      Being part of a team can be used to explain love and belonging.

      Hygiene needs are being satisfied to an extent at MT. The cup win has paid
      salaries and with fresh working capital, MT may be able to invest some funds in
      making the club run smoother after they were threatened with bankruptcy.
      MT’s open culture may also leave workers feeling satisfied giving them a chance
      to have a positive working environment. According to Herzberg, the above will
      not motivate, but prevent the players from being dissatisfied.

      The possible joint venture with Dynamo may provide the opportunity for all MT’s
      players to improve their skills through job enrichment.          Moreover, the
      tournaments, games / cup games itself clearly challenge the players. Job
      enrichment and challenging tasks according to Herzberg motivate employees.

      The cup win may be regarded as a self-actualization point (Maslow) for some of
      the players at MT, but more information is required before it could be extended
      to all. There is evidence that love and belonging is a strong driver for motivation
      as player turnover at the club has been very low.

      Before the cup win, the club has faced the possibility of bankruptcy and some
      players have threatened to leave until a possible “joint venture with another club
      (has) encouraged them to stay”. This has links to Taylorism as financial
      motivation seems to be paramount.

      There is evidence that the matrix structure and open culture is not motivating
      some players who may be more inclined toward a Taylorist approach of financial
      motivation.

      If Maslow’s hierarchy of needs theory is in operation, then again the theory is not
      a perfect fit for player motivation at MT. The financial difficulties could
      undermine psychological or security needs.

      The issues around motivation become more complex if the proposed joint venture
      with Dynamo takes place. Culture clashes may impact on the love and belonging
      needs but the new bigger club may allow personal growth and other yet to be
      defined “job enrichment” activities. However, we must note that the centralized
      and authoritarian culture at Dynamo may be more Taylorist than some of the
      MT players would be used to.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis, award up to a maximum
      of [3 marks]. For one relevant issue that is balanced, with analysis, award up to a
      maximum of [4 marks]. For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, with
      no analysis award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(d)   Advise Dave on the proposal for a joint venture with Dynamo.                           [9 marks]

      Dave has a dilemma.

      By joining with Dynamo his players will have access to modern training facilities
      that should improve performance and keep MT financially sustainable. The
      chance of further cup success will mean that he can keep this group of players
      together. A synergy can be created between the players and the managers and
      performance will be further improved. The loss of his son Wayne will be felt, but
      it does provide an opportunity for Dave to promote one of his high profile players
      to the captaincy thus possibly defusing any dissatisfaction.

      Dynamo however has had an unsuccessful season and attendances are falling.
      The Dynamo culture is in direct contrast to MT’s. Although they will be sharing
      the new stadium which will take time to build, it will not solve the short-term
      financial difficulties. Inevitably both sets of managers will need to work with
      each other, and conflict could undermine the goodwill generated from the social
      marketing work that MT has already undertaken. (Will Gary Driver be interested?)
      The contrasting management styles could be judged as a very significant
      argument against the joint venture as it is highly unlikely that any of the managers
      will be able to change their style. Perhaps a decision should be made as to who is
      going to manage overall. However, what will the other manager do?

      Accept any other relevant arguments.

      In conclusion:
      From reading the stimulus material it appears that after their cup success, MT do
      not need Dynamo, but Dynamo needs MT. The joint venture may not be an equal
      partnership. Wayne’s transfer may also cause problems and Dave may need to
      not take up the joint venture to show supporters that his interest lies solely with
      MT. Falling attendances at both clubs would do little to improve motivation at
      either. Perhaps Dave should wait to see how the football season develops.

      Accept any other relevant advice.
