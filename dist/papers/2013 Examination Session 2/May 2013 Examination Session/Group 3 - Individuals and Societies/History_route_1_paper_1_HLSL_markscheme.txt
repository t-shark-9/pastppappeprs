                                            SECTION A

Prescribed subject 1 The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These questions relate to the political and economic development of Mecca before the Prophet
Muhammad.

1.   (a)   Identify the key points made in Source D concerning the economic and
           political development of Mecca before the Prophet Muhammad.          [3 marks]

              Farming and agriculture around Mecca were very difficult to sustain due to the
               environmental conditions in its physical location;
              The Quraysh became wealthy because of long-distance trade in which they were important
               merchants;
              This was instigated by Hashim in the century before the Prophet Muhammad;
              The success of Hashim and his brothers in developing a trade-based economy for Mecca
               was due to commercial and security accords which were made with powerful neighbouring
               states on all sides of the Arabian Peninsula.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                       [2 marks]

              There were several trade routes that crossed the Arabian Peninsula in the pre-Islamic
               period, connecting the region with states that bordered on it;
              These trade routes spanned long distances;
              The south–north route ran from Yemen to southern Palestine, passing through Mecca,
               which gave it a strategic location.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                                  –4–                M13/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about the roles of
     Qusayy and Arab tribes in pre-Islamic Mecca.                                   [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources recognize the role, real or legendary, of Qusayy and the Arab tribes;
      In both cases, Mecca’s importance as a religious centre is recognized;
      Both sources mention the importance of spiritual as well as political control over Mecca, which
       in both sources is described as a important settled centre;
      Both sources refer to political and social stability in Mecca, Source A points out that Qusayy was
       obeyed by his people and Source B points out that there was no social discontent;
      Both sources point to the traditional political roles and social values of the Bedouin Arab tribes.


     For “contrast”
      Source A states that Qusayy had won control over Mecca through battle and arbitration, while
       source B does not mention how Qusayy rose to power;
      Source A highlights the role of Qusayy, while Source B minimizes his role arguing that the
       traditional view ascribed to the economic changes brought about by him are exaggerated, since
       Mecca, even in later periods, was an architecturally modest settlement. From a social and
       economic point of view, the author suggests that the Meccan merchant families were not
       aggressively aspiring or desirous of change;
      Source A talks about a new political/social order reflected in Qusayy creating a tribal kingship
       and assuming the role of the king for the first time; however, Source B does not hint to any new
       political order.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative element is
     only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are used with a good
     running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of [4–5 marks]. For the
     maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running, comparison and contrast.
     If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying the economic basis of Meccan
     wealth.                                                                       [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        A book entitled Kitab al-Maghazi by al-Waqidi. The author was an Arab-Muslim
                    and an early source for Islamic history of the period of Muhammad.

     Purpose:       The extract provides information on how the caravan trade was organized in Mecca
                    and on its main stakeholders. The book’s purpose is to describe raids, battles and
                    wars in the history of Islam.

     Value:         The author was one of the earliest Muslim historians who had access to sources
                    which were relatively close to the events he described.

     Limitations:   The author was writing almost two centuries after the events he describes. He cannot
                    be regarded as a primary source since he was dependent on other, unnamed sources,
                    for his information. He also had a reputation for being controversial and thus,
                    making his claims debatable. The figures he cites in the extract are round numbers
                    and may be impressionistic. His report implies that the Quraysh, who were
                    opponents of Muhammad at Mecca at the time, were exceptionally wealthy, which is
                    a generalization, as not all Qurayshi Meccans were rich. Furthermore, al-Waqidi,
                    like other early Islamic historians, depended on oral history, which might have
                    suffered from distortion and exaggeration.

     Source D
     Origin:        The source is a modern one written by an expert in medieval Islamic and Middle
                    Eastern history.

     Purpose:       The author’s aim is to write a coherent biography of the life and times of Muhammad
                    from a modern perspective. The extract concentrates on the economic situation of
                    Mecca and the context in which Muhammad was born.

     Value:         As a modern source in a famous Western university, the author (who is a specialist in
                    the subject area) is well-placed to benefit from centuries of scholarship in the subject
                    area.

     Limitations:   The author writes from his own particular (Western and non-Muslim) frames of
                    reference within which there is potential for misconstruction or inherent bias. In this
                    passage, the author does not cite any sources for his claims, but the argument appears
                    to be based on Muslim tradition, which in itself constitutes an incomplete set of data.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, assess the political and economic
     development of Mecca before the Prophet Muhammad.                           [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source gives information in the form of factual data about the range of political
                  and religious roles of Mecca and how these came to be controlled by tribal kingship
                  before Islam.

     Source B:     This source emphasizes the socio-economic importance of Mecca as a commercial
                   centre for both short- and long-distance trade. However, it suggests that the view of
                   Islamic tradition many have over-estimated the importance and wealth of Mecca at
                   that time while also suggesting that the Arab tribes were a socially conservative force
                   in the pre-Islamic period.

     Source C:     This source highlights the importance of long-distance trade; in this case large camel
                   trains carrying vast amounts of gold to areas beyond the Arabian Peninsula. It also
                   suggests that the investments into and profits from such ventures were managed by
                   kin-groups and tribes.

     Source D:     This source focuses on the importance of trade and commerce between Mecca and
                   the surrounding areas, including states far beyond the Peninsula and even overseas.
                   It clearly suggests that the economic situation from the time of Muhammad was well
                   established in the generations before him through trade agreements and protection
                   treaties with foreign powers.

     Source E:     This source shows how long-distance trade routes extended across the Arabian
                   Peninsula, connecting Mecca in all directions to important cities and ports both
                   within and beyond the Peninsula.

     Own knowledge
     In modern scholarship of pre- and early Islam, the rise of Mecca, the Quraysh, and their roles in the
     long-distance commerce are considered central to understanding the political and socio-economic
     environment in which Muhammad was raised and which he would come to control, in part by
     overturning important elements of the established order. However, given the lack of corroborative
     primary source materials, many key aspects mentioned in the extracts are unknown or unclear. For
     example, the extent to which the central Arabian Peninsula was connected (diplomatically,
     commercially, culturally, etc.) with the neighbouring empires of the Sassanids and Byzantines; the
     passive and active functions of Mecca as a transit point for long-distance, high-value commerce as
     compared to trade in lower value goods exchanged on a more local scale; the role that the Quraysh
     played as “middle-men” in the carriage of goods, and the disparate wealth (and its socio-political
     effects) said to have been generated from trade relative to other tribes in the region. In any event,
     the use of large amounts of gold coinage at Mecca at that time as claimed by al-Waqidi is most
     likely an exaggeration. Such historical uncertainties have given rise to many different explanations
     and theories. Some controversial (Western) authors have even suggested that Mecca was not as
     central to Muhammad’s career as areas in the north-western parts of the Arabian Peninsula, but
     these hypotheses have not found widespread support.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum [8 marks]
     expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the
     sources used.

                                              SECTION B

Prescribed subject 2 The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These questions relate to the conquest of the kingdom of Sicily by Charles I of Anjou in the 1260s.

5.   (a)   Why, according to Source A, did Charles I of Anjou become King of Sicily?             [3 marks]

              The Papacy used the death of Emperor Frederick II to try to attack his successor, Manfred;
              The Papacy was looking for a warrior to fight the successors of Frederick II;
              Louis IX did assent, although without enthusiasm, to his brother Charles becoming King of
               Sicily;
              Charles had the wealth and ambition to conquer Sicily.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                             [2 marks]

              Charles is shown kneeling with his hands clasped together; a recognized gesture of
               submission;
              Charles is shown submitting to Pope Clement IV, who is named in the image;
              Charles is shown wearing his crown, suggesting that he owes submission for his royal title
               to the Pope;
              The Pope is shown enthroned in his official garb, suggesting superiority over Charles;
              The presence of cardinals as witnesses suggests that the submission was verified and
               official.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

6.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B about how
     Charles I of Anjou became King of Sicily.                             [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources mention the ambitions of the Popes to decide the future of Sicily;
      Both sources mention that the Popes wanted to conquer the lands of the Hohenstaufen family and
       to remove them from power;
      Both sources mention the role of Louis IX of France, brother of Charles of Anjou;
      Both sources mention that Charles had ambition.


     For “contrast”
      While both sources mention Louis IX, only Source A mentions that his support for Charles was
       grudging;
      Source A alone mentions that Charles had wealth and resources to pursue his ambitions;
      While both sources mention that Charles had ambition, Source B claims that Charles was put
       under pressure by the Popes to invade the Kingdom of Sicily;
      Source B alone claims that Charles was reluctant to undertake the invasion of Sicily;
      Source B alone mentions Giovanni Villani’s claims that Charles had claimed on his deathbed
       that he had taken the Kingdom of Sicily to serve the Church;
      Source B alone mentions the risks that Charles faced in invading Sicily.


     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative element is
     only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources are used with a good
     running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum of [4–5 marks]. For the
     maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running, comparison and contrast.
     If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of [4 marks].

7.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
     Source C and Source D for historians studying how Charles I of Anjou became
     King of Sicily.                                                                  [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origin:        A poem by the French poet Adam de La Halle, written in the late thirteenth century.

     Purpose:       To praise Charles of Anjou and to celebrate his life and achievements.

     Value:         It was written in France in the late thirteenth century; the author was a contemporary
                    of Charles of Anjou.

     Limitations:   This poem is highly praising of Charles, reflecting a purely French view. Adam de
                    La Halle may have had expectations of reward from the French royal dynasty.

     Source D
     Origin:        A chronicle by the Florentine diplomat, Brunetto Latini, written in the late thirteenth
                    century.

     Purpose:       To record the events of the age, viewed from a Florentine perspective, perhaps
                    reflecting the official view of the Florentine state.

     Value:         Latini was a contemporary observer. He was very well informed, having access to
                    Florentine government papers. As a diplomat in France and Castile, he is likely to
                    have encountered leading figures of the period, and may have been able to draw on
                    their reminiscences.

     Limitations:   As a Florentine, Latini viewed events from a North Italian perspective. He may have
                    been giving the official view of Florence, rather than a purely personal view.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

8.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in Source B that
     it was “pressure by successive popes” that made Charles I of Anjou conquer the
     kingdom of Sicily.                                                               [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This source shows that the Papacy had a long-term aim of removing the
                  Hohenstaufen, and claims that the Popes chose Charles of Anjou as a warrior to
                  destroy Manfred and his family. The source also claims that Charles was not only
                  ambitious, but also had the wealth to realize his goals.

     Source B:     This source emphasizes the pressure that the Papacy put on Charles of Anjou to act
                   on its behalf. This source also mentions the claim that Charles himself stated near
                   the end of his life that he had been motivated to serve the Papacy. This source also
                   notes that the invasion was a very risky venture, and that Charles was risking his life
                   and all of his territories.

     Source C:     This source emphasizes the supposed wrongs done by Manfred against the Church,
                   and how he had deserved condemnation through his extreme behaviour. It also
                   emphasizes how Charles was approached to defend the Church against its enemies.

     Source D:     This source notes that the fate of Sicily was part of a broader struggle between the
                   supporters of the Papacy and of the German Emperors over the future of the whole of
                   Italy, as well as the Kingdom of Sicily. This source also details the actions of
                   Charles towards the Papacy, including his visit to Rome. The source explains the
                   military details of Charles’ invasion, and how soldiers journeyed to Sicily. The
                   source also notes the allegation by the Church that Manfred had sent Muslim soldiers
                   (Saracens) to invade Papal territory.

     Source E:     This image gives a strongly pro-Papal interpretation of Charles’ relationship to the
                   Church. The visual symbolism of the homage ceremony suggests that Charles was
                   dependent on, and subordinate to, the Papacy. Therefore, Charles appears as a
                   crowned servant of the Pope.

     Own knowledge
     The invasion of Sicily by Charles of Anjou in 1266 can be seen in the context of the broader
     struggle between the Papacy and the heirs of Frederick II over the future of the whole of Italy.
     Since the later years of Frederick II’s reign, the Papacy had worked hard to overthrow him.

     Charles was not the first, or only, potential King of Sicily considered by the Papacy. Richard of
     Cornwall, brother of Henry III, and Edmund, younger son of Henry III, were discussed as potential
     candidates, while, perhaps more realistically for the Mediterranean world, Alfonso of Castile also
     had ambitions in this direction.

     In the early 1260s the French-born Pope Urban IV sent one of his officials, Albert of Parma, to
     France to ascertain whether King Louis IX would allow a French candidate to replace the
     Hohenstaufen as Kings of Sicily. There is debate over the degree of support that Louis IX gave
     towards a French claimant, but he did not prevent his youngest brother Charles from plotting with
     the Papacy.
                                           – 11 –              M13/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The Papacy supported Charles with significant loans, and appears to have borrowed from bankers,
and is also said to have sold territory to support his invasion. This would suggest that the Papacy
was willing to risk resources in support of Charles.

Although Charles was the youngest brother of Louis IX, he had already been very well endowed
with lands, both within France as Count of Maine and Anjou, and, in right of his wife Beatrice, as
Count of Provence. Evidence from later in Charles’ career, when he sought to claim and secure
other titles, even after gaining the kingdom of Sicily, would suggest that he was a highly ambitious
prince. Moreover, Charles committed considerable resources to the invasion of Sicily, and appears
to have borrowed heavily to pursue his ambitions. In contemporary literature, Charles was famed
(or infamous) for his ambition.

However, archival evidence would suggest that Charles required considerable persuasion from the
Papacy to undertake the invasion, and that he was far from easily convinced to stake everything on
a highly risky venture.

Furthermore, the historian Jean Dunbabin claims that relations between Charles and the Papacy
were often awkward, and that Clement IV did not attend Charles’s coronation as King of Sicily, in
Rome, in 1265.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum [8 marks]
expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references to the
sources used.
