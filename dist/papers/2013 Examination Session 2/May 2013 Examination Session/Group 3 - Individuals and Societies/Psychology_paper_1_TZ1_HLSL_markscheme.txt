                                              SECTION A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one study of localization of function in the brain.                                   [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands on the next page when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one
     study related to localization of function in the brain.

     Responses should clearly describe the aim, method, findings and conclusion of the
     chosen study, displaying clear understanding of, and support for, localization of
     function in the brain. Candidates should clearly identify the specific part of the brain
     and its function.

     Candidates are not required to give a detailed account of localization of function but
     should make a clear link between the study and theory to gain marks in the top
     markband. If the link is only implicit apply the markbands up to a maximum of
     [6 marks].

     Examples of studies include, but are not limited to:
      localization of speech production/understanding
      hippocampal impairment
      the role of the amygdala in aggression
      the role of the prefrontal lobe in decision-making.

     If Sperry and Gazzaniga’s study of split-brain patients is described, it is important that
     the focus of the response is on localization of function. Candidates may refer to areas
     for language or to the function of corpus callosum.

     If a candidate describes localization of function without making reference to a relevant
     study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     If a candidate describes a study that is not relevant to localization of function, [0 marks]
     should be awarded.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should be given only to the
     first description.

            question.

7 to 8      The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
            the demands of the command term. The response is supported by
            appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of research.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Explain how one principle that defines the cognitive level of analysis may be
     demonstrated in one example of research (theory or study).                    [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands on the next page when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of an
     appropriate principle and show how this principle is clearly demonstrated in a theory or
     study relevant to the cognitive level of analysis.

     Acceptable principles include, but are not limited to:
      mental processes can be scientifically investigated
      internal processes are important mediators between stimuli and responses
      mental representations guide behaviour
      mental processing can be compared to computer function
      cognitive processes are influenced by social and cultural factors
      biological factors may affect cognitive processes.

     If the principle used is that sociocultural or biological factors can affect cognitive
     processes the focus of the research should be on the cognitive principle – that is, if a
     study or theory that is more typically linked to the biological level of analysis or the
     sociocultural level of analysis is used, the answer must focus on the cognitive aspects of
     the research. For example, if using the HM study, candidates should focus on memory
     aspects not physiological ones

     After briefly outlining the principle and giving a brief summary of one study or theory,
     candidates should make an explicit link between the research and the principle.
     If a relevant principle and research are identified but are not explicitly linked, then
     apply the markbands up to a maximum of [6 marks].

     If a candidate explains a principle without making reference to research, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [4 marks].

     If a candidate only describes a study or theory relevant to the cognitive level of analysis,
     apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     If a candidate explains more than one principle and/or uses more than one example of
     research, credit should be given only to the first explanation of the first principle and to
     the first example demonstrating that principle.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   Describe the role of situational and dispositional factors in explaining behaviour.          [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how
     situational and dispositional factors may explain human behaviour.

     Answers may clarify that dispositional factors include personality, biological factors and
     genetics and situational factors are external factors. Candidates may highlight that we
     seem to perceive the actions of others as stemming primarily from internal dispositions,
     while viewing our own as largely a response to environmental factors. Candidates may
     also address the fact that attributional judgment may vary across cultures.

     Candidates may explain attribution theory or any other relevant research to help
     describe the situational and dispositional factors. This approach is appropriate as long
     as the focus of the answer is on the description of the factors.

     It would also be appropriate to refer to studies such as Milgram or Zimbardo in looking
     at the power of the situation in determining behaviour. In such responses, however,
     candidates should show knowledge and understanding of the role of dispositional
     factors using other appropriate research if necessary.

     If a candidate describes a relevant study with no link made to dispositional and
     situational factors, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     If a candidate describes only situational factors or only dispositional factors, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [4 marks].

4.   Discuss two effects of the environment on physiological processes.                         [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review, supported by appropriate evidence, of the way in which the environment affects
     physiological processes.

     Candidates may address two effects of the environment on two different physiological
     processes or may address two different effects of the environment on one physiological
     process. Both approaches are equally acceptable. The physiological processes should
     be clearly identified.

     Examples of how the environment may affect physiological processes include:
      effects of jet lag on bodily rhythms
      effects of deprivation on neuroplasticity
      effects of environmental stressors on reproductive mechanisms.

     Examples of studies include, but are not limited to:
      Michael Meaney’s (1988) study on how environmental stressors lead to hippocampal
       cell loss in rats
      Rosenzweig and Bennett’s (1972) study on stimulating environments and
       dendritic branching
      Small and Vorgan’s (2008) study on the effect of computer use on the brain.
      Studies by Maguire et al. (2000), Draganski et al. (2004), Brefczynski-Lewis et al.
       (2007) and Tierney et al. (2001).

     Discussion may include but is not limited to:
      methodological and ethical issues
      other contributing factors – such as personality, age, or genetic predisposition
      empirical evidence
      application of the findings.

     If a candidate discusses more than two effects of the environment, credit should be
     given only to the first two discussions.

     If a candidate discusses only one effect of the environment, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [11 marks].

5.   Examine how cognitive and biological factors interact in emotion.                        [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider an argument in a way
     that uncovers the assumptions and interrelationships of how cognitive and biological
     factors interact in emotion.

     Examples of appropriate theories and studies include, but are not limited to:
      Schachter and Singer’s (1962) two-factor theory, which proposes that physiological
       arousal and cognition are the central elements in emotional experience
      Dutton and Aron’s (1974) study on misattribution of arousal on emotion
      Lazarus’s (1975) theory that the experience of stress is not only physiological, but
       very dependent also on the cognitive appraisal of situations
      LeDoux’s (1999) model of two different biological pathways, which explains how
       emotional stimuli are processed in different parts of the brain depending on the
       degree of cognitive evaluation involved, especially in relation to fear and anxiety
      the role of the cerebral hemispheres in the cognitive and affective experience of
       emotion
      Speisman et al.’s (1964) experimental study that demonstrated how biological and
       cognitive factors interact in emotion.

     The interaction between the cognitive and biological factors is the focus of the
     question, so candidates must include both factors in their answer.

     Candidates may examine a smaller number of factors in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may examine a larger number of factors in order to demonstrate breadth
     of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

6.   Discuss the role of one cultural dimension on human behaviour.                            [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review, supported by appropriate evidence, of the role of a specific cultural dimension
     on human behaviour.

     Cultural dimensions include, but are not limited to:
      power distance: the way people perceive power differences and how they react to
       power relations
      individualism versus collectivism: how much people define themselves apart from
       their group memberships and how it affects their behaviour
      masculinity versus femininity: differences between “masculine” and “feminine”
       cultures and their effects on individual behaviour
      uncertainty avoidance: society’s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity and its
       effect on behaviour
      long- versus short-term orientation (Confucian dynamism): time perspective in a
       society for the gratification of people’s needs and its effect on behaviour
      monochronous versus polychronous time orientation: another form of time
       perspective in which punctuality, deadlines, and future orientation affect behaviour.

     It is important that candidates make a link between the cultural dimension and human
     behaviour, demonstrating how the selected cultural dimension affects human behaviour.
     For example, when examining the role of Confucian dynamism, responses may refer to
     how it affects management leadership, creative behaviour, identification with
     workplace, perseverance, and/or respect for tradition.

     Discussion may include but is not limited to:
      methodological issues
      empirical evidence
      application of the findings
      other contributing factors.

     If a candidate discusses the role of more than one cultural dimension, credit should be
     given only to the first discussion.
