Answer all the questions.

1.    Data types and data structures are an important feature of every programming language.

      (a)     State two possible consequences of selecting the wrong data type for the data
              that you intend to store.                                                             [2 marks]

      (b)     Outline a set of data that could be stored in a one-dimensional array of Boolean.     [2 marks]

      (c)     Construct the method howMany() that will inspect your Boolean array in
              part (b) and display the number of occurrences of each of the different values
              stored in it.  You can assume that the size of the array is 100, and that your
              data structure is declared globally.                                                  [5 marks]

      The table below shows the wages paid to five employees for each month of the year
      (in euros).

      (d)     Describe in full the data structure, table, that can be used for storing the
              numerical data shown above.                                                           [2 marks]

      (e)     Using your structure in part (d), construct the method adams() that would
              add up the total wages for “Adams” for the year.  You can assume that table
              is declared globally.                                                                 [5 marks]

      (f)     Outline how you could use an additional data structure to link the names of the
              employees to their wages.                                                             [2 marks]

      (g)     Outline how you would modify the method in part (e) so that it could add up
              the wages of any named employee.                                                      [2 marks]

2.    An array of objects is being used to hold the marks for a class of 25 students.  
      Each object is a member of the Student class, part of which is outlined below.

      class Student
      {
        double averageMark;
        String surname;
        int studentID;
        int[] marks;

            public double average()
      }


      The values in the marks array represent the percentages obtained in 15 tests which
      are given over the course of the year.  They are initially set to –1.

      (a)     Suggest a reason for initially setting the values to –1.                      [2 marks]

      (b)     Explain why the averageMark variable is of type double.                       [3 marks]

      The method average() in the Student class calculates the average mark for a
      particular student at any time during the year.

      (c)     Construct the method average().                                               [6 marks]

      The class that processes the Student data contains a modified bubble sort method.  
      This method carries out the following steps:
      • receives the Student array (originally initialized as Student[] s = Student[25];)
      • calculates the average mark for each student
      • sorts the Student array by average mark (highest first)
      • returns the sorted Student array.

      (d)     Construct this modified bubble sort method.   You should make use of any
              previously defined methods.                                                   [6 marks]

      (e)     Explain why it is convenient to store the student data as objects.            [3 marks]

This question requires the use of the case study.

3.    (a)   With reference to page 4 of the case study, explain with the use of examples why
            RAM is also known as dynamic memory.                                               [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify the data that would be stored in the firmware of a smartphone.             [1 mark]

      (c)   Describe two ways in which manufacturers have overcome the limited number
            of options that can be displayed on a touch screen.                                [4 marks]

      (d)   Explain why the increase in use of 3G/4G phones might be of concern to
            Internet Service Providers (ISPs).                                                 [3 marks]

      (e)   By making use of both positive and negative examples, discuss whether students
            should be allowed to use smartphones during lessons at school.                     [6 marks]

      (f)   Outline why one of the chips inside a smartphone will contain an
            analogue-to-digital converter (ADC).                                               [2 marks]

      (g)   Describe two consequences of the low power consumption of Bluetooth for
            smartphone users.                                                                  [4 marks]

      Scientists often make use of sensors when taking part in field studies.

      (h)   With reference to a specific example, describe how a smartphone could be used
            in these studies.                                                                  [3 marks]

      (i)   Suggest one reason for choosing a smartphone that makes use of a “kill” switch.    [2 marks]

      (j)   Explain why higher-pixel density leads to sharper images on a screen.              [3 marks]
