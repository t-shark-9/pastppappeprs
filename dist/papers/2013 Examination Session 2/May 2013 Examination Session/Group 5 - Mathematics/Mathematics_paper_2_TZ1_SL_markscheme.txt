                                        Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.

Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to scoris instructions and the document “Mathematics SL: Guidance for e-marking
      May 2013”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In particular,
      please note the following. Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps, using the new scoris
      tool. Please check that you are entering marks for the right question.

      • If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the “must be seen” marks), use the ticks with
        numbers to stamp full marks.
      • If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
      • If a part gains anything else, it must be recorded using all the annotations.

      All the marks will be added and recorded by scoris.

2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

      • Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked,
        and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
      • It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
        M mark(s), if any. An exception to this rule is when work for M1 is missing, as opposed to
        incorrect (see point 4).
      • Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1 for an attempt
        to use an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the correct values.
      • Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded independently; so if
        the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award A0A1A1.
      • Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a note.
      • Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
      • Most M marks are for a valid method, ie a method which can lead to the answer: it must indicate
        some form of progress towards the answer.
      • A marks are often dependent on the R mark being awarded for justification for the A mark, in
        which case it is not possible to award A1R0. Hence the A1 is not awarded for a correct answer if
        no justification or the wrong justification is given.
                                                 –4–            M13/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


3   N marks

    If no working shown, award N marks for correct answers. In this case, ignore mark breakdown
    (M, A, R).

    • Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
    • There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
      penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
    • There may not be a direct relationship between the N marks and the implied marks. There are
      times when all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks: this indicates that we
      want to see some of the working, without specifying what.
    • For consistency within the markscheme, N marks are noted for every part, even when these match
      the mark breakdown.
    • If a candidate has incorrect working, which somehow results in a correct answer, do not award the
      N marks for this correct answer. However, if the candidate has indicated (usually by crossing out)
      that the working is to be ignored, award the N marks for the correct answer.

4   Implied and must be seen marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1).
    • Implied marks can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if implied in subsequent working
      (a correct final answer does not necessarily mean that the implied marks are all awarded). There
      are questions where some working is required, but as it is accepted that not everyone will write the
      same steps, all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks for the question.
    • Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
    • Where there is an (M1) followed by A1 for each correct answer, if no working shown, one correct
      answer is sufficient evidence to award the (M1). An exception to this is where at least one
      numerical final answer is not given to the correct three significant figures (see the accuracy
      booklet).

    Must be seen marks appear without brackets eg M1.
    • Must be seen marks can only be awarded if correct work is seen.
    • If a must be seen mark is not awarded because work is missing (as opposed to M0 or A0 for
      incorrect work) all subsequent marks may be awarded if appropriate.

5   Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s) or subpart(s). Usually, to award FT marks, there must be
    working present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.
    However, if the only marks awarded in a subpart are for the final answer, then FT marks should be
    awarded if appropriate. Examiners are expected to check student work in order to award FT marks
    where appropriate.

    • Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for work which
      uses the error, but M marks may be awarded if appropriate. (However, as noted above, if an
      A mark is not awarded because work is missing, all subsequent marks may be awarded
      if appropriate)
    • Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.
    • If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer
      FT marks.
    • If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the sum
      of an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s)
      for the final answer(s).
                                                 –5–            M13/5/MATME/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


    • The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates may be
      using an incorrect value.
    • If a candidate makes an error in one part, but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent part(s),
      award marks as appropriate, unless the question says hence. It is often possible to use a different
      approach in subsequent parts that does not depend on the answer to previous parts.
    • In a “show that” question, if an error in a previous subpart leads to not showing the required
      answer, do not award the final A1. Note that if the error occurs within the same subpart, the FT
      rules may result in further loss of marks.
    • Where there are anticipated common errors, the FT answers are often noted on the markscheme,
      to help examiners. It should be stressed that these are not the only FT answers accepted, neither
      should N marks be awarded for these answers.

6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). A candidate
    should be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate that this is a
    misread. Do not award the first mark in the question, even if this is an M mark, but award all others
    (if appropriate) so that the candidate only loses one mark for the misread.

    • If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award
      fewer marks.
    • If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg probability greater than 1, use of r > 1 for the sum of
      an infinite GP, sin θ = 1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s) for
      the final answer(s).
    • Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.

7   Discretionary marks (d)
    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
    cover the work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note written next to
    the mark explaining this decision.

8   Alternative methods
    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
    specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt,
    contact your team leader for advice.

    • Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
    • Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
    • Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
      alternatives start and finish.

9   Alternative forms
    Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

    • As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
    • In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
      brackets immediately following the answer.
    • In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
      will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the
      bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen).

10   Accuracy of Answers

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the final answer
     to the required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers should be
     given exactly or correct to three significant figures

     Candidates should NO LONGER be penalized for an accuracy error (AP). Examiners should award
     marks according to the rules given in these instructions and the markscheme. Accuracy is not the
     same as correctness – an incorrect value does not achieve relevant A marks. It is only final answers
     which may lose marks for accuracy errors, not intermediate values. Please check work carefully for
     FT. Further information on which answers are accepted is given in a separate booklet, along with
     examples. It is essential that you read this carefully, as there are a number of changes.

     Do not accept unfinished numerical final answers such as 3/0.1 (unless otherwise stated). As a rule,
     numerical answers with more than one part (such as fractions) should be given using integers
     (eg 6/8). Calculations which lead to integers should be completed, with the exception of fractions
     which are not whole numbers.

     Clarification of intermediate values accuracy instructions

     Intermediate values do not need to be given to the correct three significant figures. If candidates work
     with any rounded values, this could lead to an incorrect answer, in which case award A0 for the
     final answer. However, do not penalise inaccurate intermediate values that lead to an acceptable
     final answer.

11   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 2, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (eg TI-89) are not
     allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics SL guide says:
           Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of
     calculator notation in the working.

12   Style

     The markscheme aims to present answers using good communication, eg if the question asks to find
     the value of k, the markscheme will say k = 3 , but the marks will be for the correct value 3 – there is
     usually no need for the “ k = ”. In these cases, it is also usually acceptable to have another variable,
     as long as there is no ambiguity in the question, eg if the question asks to find the value of p and of q,
     then the student answer needs to be clear. Generally, the only situation where the full answer is
     required is in a question which asks for equations – in this case the markscheme will say “must be
     an equation”.

     The markscheme often uses words to describe what the marks are for, followed by examples, using the
     eg notation. These examples are not exhaustive, and examiners should check what candidates have
     written, to see if they satisfy the description. Where these marks are M marks, the examples may
     include ones using poor notation, to indicate what is acceptable. A valid method is one which will
     allow candidate to proceed to the next step eg if a quadratic function is given in factorised form, and
     the question asks for the zeroes, then multiplying the factors does not necessarily help to find the
     zeros, and would not on its own count as a valid method.

13    Candidate work

      If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way crossed
      out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

14.   Diagrams

      The notes on how to allocate marks for sketches usually refer to passing through particular points or
      having certain features. These marks can only be awarded if the sketch is approximately the correct
      shape. All values given will be an approximate guide to where these points/features occur. In some
      questions, the first A1 is for the shape, in others, the marks are only for the points and/or features. In
      both cases, unless the shape is approximately correct, no marks can be awarded (unless otherwise
      stated). However, if the graph is based on previous calculations, FT marks should be awarded if
      appropriate.
