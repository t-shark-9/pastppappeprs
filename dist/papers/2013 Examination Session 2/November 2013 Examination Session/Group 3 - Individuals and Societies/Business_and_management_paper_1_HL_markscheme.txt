                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    economies of scale (line 16)                                                   [2 marks]

                  Economies of scale refer to the decrease in cost per unit produced, as the
                  total scale of the production facility increases.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding, with reference to both decrease in cost per unit and increase
                  in scale of production.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   empowerment (line 35).                                                         [2 marks]

                  Empowerment is a form of non-financial reward and a motivational
                  technique; it means that some power is given to employees so they can
                  make some of their own decisions regarding their working life (for instance
                  they may have control over how to use their time and decide which tasks
                  could be done from home).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge
                  and understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above with reference to decision making.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].
                                             –8–               N13/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   With reference to RDB, distinguish between internal growth and external
      growth.                                                                 [4 marks]

      Internal growth (also called organic growth) refers to the growth of a business
      (RDB in this case) through increasing sales (for example, developing first-mover
      advantage in the market for “technologically advanced, energy-efficient ball
      bearings” (lines 95–96)) or developing marketing activities (hence Anna’s idea of
      using “engineers-turned-salesmen” (line 116)). Internal growth is also possible by
      cutting costs and selling goods at a lower price, thereby increasing market share,
      though there is no reference to this in the case study.

      External growth takes place through external solutions, such as joint ventures and
      mergers and acquisitions. Valdemar suggested strategic alliances with companies
      based in Brazil, China and India, which would be a form of external growth
      (it would enable RDB to operate or at least sell directly in those countries, without
      having to develop its own marketing activities there).


      N.B. If incorrect understanding/definition of internal/external growth but correct
           application award a maximum of [2 marks].


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for a basic definition of each type of growth. Award another
      [1 mark] for an application to RDB up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            –9–             N13/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each new RDB factory being
      “jointly managed by one experienced RDB senior manager from Europe and
      one local manager familiar with the language and culture” (lines 100–101). [7 marks]

      Advantages include the following:
       the factories will benefit from having two managers who combine forces
        (in terms of synergy, when adding the experience of the European RDB senior
        manager and the field knowledge of the newly appointed local manager)
       having two complementary managers avoids the problem of RDB headquarters
        having to decide who to appoint as a sole manager: on their own, expats from
        northern Europe might struggle to be accepted and respected; on their own,
        newly appointed local managers might not appreciate the RDB culture of
        high-quality ball bearings
       for RDB as a whole, this means a more diverse workforce, which is in line with
        Anna’s ideas about reflecting customers’ profiles; diversity in the workforce is
        often seen as a vector of creativity; it is also more politically correct and it
        seems that Anna has that agenda too
       communication between head office and managers, and managers and employees
       accept any other relevant advantage.

      Disadvantages include the following:
       the two managers, being from different cultural backgrounds, could be
        prejudiced against each other, or could have different values and attitudes,
        which might create tension or conflict between them and hinder communication
        between them
       the two managers may have different management/leadership styles, which
        could be confusing for the employees, for example if one is more autocratic and
        the other more democratic
       the two managers may have different ideas about quality control, operations or
        marketing, which could slow the decision-making process in the factories
       accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      Candidates are not expected to refer to all of the above points for top marks,
      but their analysis must be balanced in order to reach the highest level of
      the markband.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   By the 1970s, Japanese companies had moved to just-in-time production
           (line 26). Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of just-in-time
           production.                                                           [4 marks]

           Advantages of just-in-time production stock control include:
            it improves the working capital cycle (as the companies only produce the ball
             bearings that have been ordered: they do not keep stock, so there is no capital
             “blocked” in the form of stock)
            it reduces storage costs (unlike with a just-in-case approach)
            it reduces the chances of holding unsellable stock (if business customers
             change specification or requirements)
            accept any other relevant advantage.

           Disadvantages of just-in-time production stock control include:
            unlike with a just-in-case approach, sudden large orders cannot be met (as there
             is no stock), so customers could then turn to competitors
            if the suppliers also operate on a just-in-time basis, it can create some delays
            accept any other relevant disadvantage.

           Accept any other relevant answer.


           N.B. Accept answers that only refer to just-in-time stock control.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant advantage/disadvantage identified, award an
           additional [1 mark] for the development of that advantage/disadvantage up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Interpret the results from your calculations in part (b).                              [7 marks]

      The gross profit margin of RDB declined significantly between 1970 and 1975,
      falling from 53.39% to 43.90% . Profitability from the manufacturing process
      declined. In the case study, mention is made of intensifying competition from
      Japanese manufacturers. In all likelihood, as Japanese firms became more fierce
      competitors, companies such as RDB had to lower the sales prices of its products.
      With lower sales prices, the gross profit margin contracted.

      With the decline in profitability but with expanding operations, RDB’s liquidity
      weakened – though it was still strong. The acid test ratio fell from 2.75 times in
      1970 to 2.31 times in 1975. The expanded operations meant that RDB had to
      commit greater funds to support its growth thus decreasing liquidity.

      It is arguable that RDB’s acid test ratio was too high (that it had too much money
      tied up in low-yielding assets and that the decrease in the acid test ratio was
      actually a positive development).

      In isolation, the decline in gross profit margin is a negative development,
      the slight deterioration in liquidity less so. However, according to the case study,
      RDB has had a long-term trend in reduced profitability and a deteriorating balance
      sheet. As part of a long-term trend, these developments were worrisome.

3.   (a)   Describe one consequence of the likely relocation of the factories
           (lines 96–99):

           (i)    for one internal stakeholder of RDB.                                              [2 marks]

                  An example of one internal stakeholder that would be affected by the
                  relocation is the workforce in the Swedish megafactory: as RDB would be
                  closing their workplace, many would be laid off. Some might be offered
                  jobs in the new factories (for example, some of the senior managers) but the
                  majority of workers’ jobs would be made redundant and the workers
                  themselves would become unemployed.

                  Accept any other relevant internal stakeholder with a description.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description of the consequence; award an
                  additional [1 mark] for the development of that point, up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks]. Award [0 marks] if the stakeholder is not internal or is not
                  precisely identified.

           (ii)   for one external stakeholder of RDB.                                              [2 marks]

                  An example of one external stakeholder that would be affected by the
                  relocation is the Swedish government: firstly, they would lose all the
                  business rates (taxes) paid by RDB; secondly, they would see an increase in
                  unemployment in the towns that were dependent on RDB (for direct and
                  indirect jobs); thirdly, as “the Swedish factory was so large that railroad
                  lines had been installed in order to deliver supplies and to transport finished
                  products” (lines 139–140), the Swedish government might try to put
                  pressure on RDB to keep the factory there.

                  Accept any other relevant external stakeholder with a description.


                  Award [1 mark] for a basic description of the consequence; award an
                  additional [1 mark] for the development of that point, up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks]. Award [0 marks] if the stakeholder is not external or is not
                  precisely identified.

(b)   Using information in lines 19–21, construct a position map of the ball bearing
      industry in the 1930s and place RDB and its two main competitors on it.        [4 marks]




      Award [1 mark] for the overall layout of the position map with both axes
      correctly labelled (quality and price) and high/low clearly indicated. N.B. it does
      not matter which axis is horizontal/vertical.
      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of RDB in the quadrant “high quality and
      high price”.
      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of UAB at the centre of the model
      (to show “medium quality and medium price”).
      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of FIB in the quadrant “low quality and
      low price”.

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for RDB of becoming a public
      limited company (line 123).                                           [7 marks]

      Becoming a public limited company means that RDB shares would be traded on
      the stock market. By selling shares to the general public, they would be able to
      rapidly raise more funds, hence Anna’s keenness, as that extra capital is essential
      to implement her “RDB 2020” vision. Supporting further expansion by changing
      status from a private to a public limited company is a common method to raise
      capital – however there are several disadvantages. RDB’s audited accounts would
      have to be released to the public, but more importantly RDB would become
      vulnerable to takeover bids and the Holstein family would also lose some control
      and ownership (hence Valdemar’s resistance). Moreover, the value of RDB shares
      may also be very dependent upon stock exchange fluctuations.

           (i)    benchmarking (line 37)                                                           [2 marks]

                  Benchmarking is about comparing a business (or a business unit or some
                  products/services) to competitors, typically to the ones that can be described
                  as providing “best practice”. A set of standards (called “benchmarks”) is
                  then produced and comparisons are made (ideally with the aim of not only
                  meeting the benchmarks, but exceeding them).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and

                  Collective bargaining can be defined as “the process by which management
                  and employees have representatives (eg trade unions) who negotiate on the
                  terms and conditions of employment” (adapted from page 391, Clark, P.

(b)   With reference to members of the Holstein family, distinguish between
      scientific and intuitive decision-making processes.                   [4 marks]

      A scientific decision-making process is rational, linear and based on evidence
      and logic. Anna definitely has that type of approach: she studied the external
      environment before preparing her strategic plan “RDB 2020”. Her decisions are
      based on empirical evidence (eg about manufacturing and the ball bearing
      industry) and reasoning (eg about the need to relocate production to factories in
      Brazil, China and India). At times, Valdemar also displays signs of scientific
      decision-making. For example, he consults economists and other specialists,
      though it is less clear in his case.

      An intuitive decision-making process relies more on feelings, spontaneity,
      insight and perception; it can be described as irrational. Henrik Holstein, the
      founder of RDB, is presented as a visionary: in 1915, he could not know that
      manufacturing ball bearings would be so important throughout the 20th century –
      and he could not imagine how successful his Danish company would become.
      Henrik’s business intuitive proved right. His son Valdemar is worried about
      Anna’s plans. He has a bad feeling and maybe he will be right: is she taking RDB
      in a wrong direction?

      Accept any other relevant response.


      Award [1 mark] for each definition (scientific decision-making, intuitive
      decision-making); award an additional [1 mark] for the application to the
      RDB case study (Anna, Valdemar, Henrik), up to a maximum of [4 marks].

      N.B. If the response is simplistic such as “Anna = scientific, Valdemar = intuitive”,
           award a maximum of [3 marks].

(c)   With reference to RDB, explain differences between strategic analysis and
      strategic implementation.                                                 [4 marks]

      Strategic analysis is about identifying where the business is; this involves a close
      examination of both the internal and external environment. PEST and SWOT
      models are commonly used for that purpose. Anna has carried out this background
      analysis in order to articulate her strategic vision for RDB: “to make the world’s
      most technologically advanced, energy-efficient ball bearings in small “green”
      factories located near its customers” (lines 95–96). This is the first part of the
      strategic process.

      Strategic implementation occurs later in the strategic process: having chosen the
      future direction of the business, implementation is about deciding how to put the
      strategy into operation; this phase has a more practical dimension. It involves,
      amongst others, marketing decisions (for example about R&D) and HR decisions
      (for example about the new workforce in the new factories) as well as change
      management (as the changes for RDB will be colossal, both culturally and
      operationally).

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic answer showing some limited knowledge of strategic
      analysis and/or strategic implementation (for example an answer that may lack
      clarity or shows some confusion).

      Award [2 marks] for an answer which shows some knowledge and understanding
      of both strategic analysis and strategic implementation (for example by providing
      definitions yet without application).

      Award [3 marks] for an answer which clearly explains the differences between
      strategic analysis and strategic implementation yet with limited application to RDB.

      Award [4 marks] for an answer which clearly explains the differences between
      strategic analysis and strategic implementation with precise application to RDB.

(d)   To what extent is Anna Holstein’s “RDB 2020” strategic plan consistent with
      a focus on corporate social responsibility?                                 [8 marks]

      Anna’s “RDB 2020” strategic plan is consistent with a focus on corporate social
      responsibility (CSR) because one of the cornerstones of “RDB 2020” is “green”
      engineering (the topic that Anna studied at university); it is about energy
      efficiency and environmental friendliness. When she started working at RDB,
      implementing “green” approaches to manufacturing was her personal mission –
      and with “RDB 2020” she is turning this personal mission into a corporate
      strategy. Sustainable development is one of the values underpinning CSR and
      business ethics in general. She also wishes to employ workers in new factories
      in Brazil, China and India, which will be a way for RDB (as a successful Western
      European company) to contribute to economic development in other countries.

      It is possible, however, to argue that Anna’s plan is not consistent with a focus on
      CSR when one considers some of the direct implications of “RDB 2020”,
      especially about the planned redundancy of thousands of European workers’ jobs.
      This goes further than just relocating, outsourcing and offshoring: as stressed by
      Valdemar, RDB has had almost a century of strong links with the local
      communities where it has been based, contributing to the development of
      “company towns”, working in partnerships with local and even national
      governments and other stakeholders. Valdemar’s references to a “social contract”
      and to “a moral obligation to provide jobs in Denmark” (line 130) are powerful
      counterparts to Anna’s own ethical views about sustainable development and
      CSR.

           describe a budget.                                                    [2 marks]

           In the context of the renovations to the RDB megafactories, a budget refers to the
           estimated plan of spending to renovate the factories. The budget would be
           itemized, probably by factory and, for each factory, by expected costs (various
           demolition costs, various components of the cost of construction, environmental
           clean-up costs, etc).

      Advantages of decision trees include:
       they quantify possible outcomes, giving a commensurate basis for comparison
       construction of the decision tree can stimulate additional ideas for alternate
        routes to pursue not previously thought of
       decision trees also involve estimation and comparison of risk factors.

      Disadvantages of decision trees include:
       they are based upon expected outcomes – forecasts – and actual outcomes can
        differ significantly
       factors other than quantitative ones often play a role in decisions.

(d)   With reference to RDB, examine possible marketing practices required for
      effective rebranding.                                                    [9 marks]

      “Marketing practices” can be loosely interpreted, eg marketing mix, marketing
      strategy, plans, etc. Rebranding will require a complete adjustment to the
      marketing strategy as it focuses on the “green” nature of RDB. The strategy will
      need to address the issue of targeting new customers as well as familiarising
      existing customers with the new brand and changes to the product and
      maintaining customer loyalty.

      Marketing practices for effective rebranding include realignment of all the
      elements of the market mix to ensure that RDB has a focus consistent with its new
      mission (candidates could elaborate on this with respect to any or all of the 7Ps).
      Clearly relevant in the marketing strategy will be product, pricing, and promotion,
      with most of the emphasis on promotion, as RDB will have to promote the
      changes that it is making.

      In terms of promotion, RDB would be wise to consider standard strategies
      for developing a constellation of signifiers that point to a brand and build
      brand identity and awareness, such elements as a word or phrase that catches
      customers’ attention, perhaps a character (such as the Michelin Man) with whom
      customers can identify, a consistent theme, logo, or phrase, and a new consistent
      look to promotional literature. RDB must also use various means of promotion in
      an awareness program to educate customers about the new RDB. This brand
      awareness (or rebrand) campaign would include:
       1. Direct contact by senior sales staff to major and/or long-standing customers
          (since RDB is a B2B business) to make them aware of the new brand name
          and symbols and to ensure that RDB will maintain its commitment to quality.
       2. Extensive reliance on below the line promotion, including direct mailings to
          all customers and known potential customers and attendance at exhibitions and
          trade fairs.
       3. Above the line promotion in appropriate trade journals, including the
          traditional trade journals it advertises in and the design magazines/journals
          that RDB wants to become known in.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      N.B. Balance means focussing on rebranding in relation to marketing.

      It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers are likely to include
      a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified below. There is no
      “correct” answer.

      Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and
      evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus materials.

      It is to be expected that the answer will include relevant information from the case
      study, extension material and Items 1 to 3 and employ a range of business concepts,
      tools and terminology.

      Candidates are free to recommend any of the options. The marks awarded depend
      upon the strength of the candidate’s reasoning and should be based upon the
      markbands on page 6.

      Option A represents the boldest option for RDB; it is probably the riskiest in the
      short term, but the soundest in the long term. It would mean significant
      restructuring of the company, laying off many workers, and trying to maintain
      continuity of operations while, at the same time, managing considerable change.
      Much of RDB’s corporate identity would be lost. Financially, all of the expenses
      of the transition would have to be absorbed by RDB, and it would have the
      challenge of selling two of its three large megafactories. On the other hand,
      Option A would represent the most forward thinking of the three options.
      RDB would become a “green” company, its workforce would become more
      international, and the small factories around the world would allow for greater
      flexibility and responsiveness. The new corporate culture could be built around a
      new form of corporate social responsibility (CSR): environmental friendliness and
      a global workforce rather than the “social contract” sense of responsibility it had
      (employment for life).

      Option B represents what is in many ways a safer option than A, but it is still
      has many issues. The positives include the act that RDB would not have to lay off
      employees, while at the same time adopting a new mantle of CSR based upon
      environmental friendliness. The financial incentives offered by the government
      would certainly help in making the transition, but RDB would still see a
      significant increase in its gearing and leverage. The cell production would
      probably allow the company to be more flexible in terms of production, but the
      sites of production would continue to be far away from many of its customers and
      where much of global industrial production is expected to be in the decades ahead.
      Strategic alliances with ball bearing companies in Brazil, China, and India will
      help in this regard, but forming strategic alliances is a lesser commitment to these
      economically growing parts of the world than under Anna’s “RDB 2020” vision.
      The wage and salary structure of northern Europe would continue to be an issue;
      wages, salaries and benefits for workers in these countries are among the highest
      in the world. So, while this option may be “the best of both worlds”
      (employment-for-life and an environmentally forward-looking company), it may
      not reverse the long-term erosion in margins that has been plaguing RDB.
      Gloria Woolrich (Item 3) is not convinced that the offer of promotion in Danish
      Global Business Directory will have much value, and there may be many
      unanticipated costs associated with rebranding.

Option C is the least risky of the three options in the short term, but it may be the
riskiest in the long term. Like with Option B, cell production would probably
allow the company to be more flexible in terms of production, but the sites of
production would continue to be far away from many of its customers and where
much of global industrial production is expected to be in the decades ahead.
Strategic alliances with ball bearing companies in Brazil, China and India will
help in this regard, but forming strategic alliances is a lesser commitment to these
economically growing parts of the world than under Anna’s “RDB 2020” vision.
Really, under this option, the company is going to do what it always has with the
exception of cell production and the new marketing spin (“green” in name only).
Though this will protect the balance sheet in the short term (and RDB has a strong
balance sheet), it will do little to correct deep long-term issues that have slowly
been weakening the company. Further, were RDB to start asserting it as a “green”
company with little real basis for that assertion, if discovered by the press there
could be a negative reaction in the marketplace and weaken RDB’s credibility.

Accept any other relevant recommendation.


N.B. All three options have advantages and disadvantages. Candidates are
     expected to have a clear conclusion (and a recommendation on which option
     to pursue) – it could be any of the three, as long as the answer is justified.

If the candidate refers to only one option, award a maximum of [7 marks].

If the candidate refers to only financial considerations or only non-financial
considerations, award a maximum of [7 marks].

To achieve the top markband, candidates must formulate a final recommendation.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6.
