     Overview

     Dragon City is a small city of approximately 200 000 people in East Asia.  There is one main
     taxi company, Red Dragon Taxi Company, which the owner Yao Chu’s grandfather started with
     one taxi.  Over the years the family run company has grown and is now the leading taxi company
     in the city, although there are other operators in a highly competitive market.  There are ten people
 5   working in the company who manage an increasing number of drivers.

     Demand for taxis in Dragon City is rising and Red Dragon Taxi Company is expanding rapidly
     as a result of increased economic growth in the area.  Yao Chu believes an increased use of IT
     will facilitate the planned growth of Red Dragon Taxi Company ensuring it continues to be the
     leading taxi company in Dragon City.  Yao Chu realizes that unless the company upgrades its IT
10   they run the risk of being overtaken by other operators that are starting to use information and
     communication technologies.

     Current IT system

     At the present time the company controls about 150 taxis from a small office in the centre of
     the city, but not all of them are on the road at the same time.  The company has a set of networked
     computers in the office as well as landline and mobile phone communications.  Customers who
15   ring for a taxi have their request answered by one of the controllers in the office who then contacts
     a taxi driver on their mobile phone from a list of free taxis.   Usually the drivers call in to be
     recorded as booked when a customer requests a taxi from the side of the street.  If a driver does not
     call in, then the taxi will remain recorded as free, which has caused many problems.

     The taxi requests are recorded in a shared spreadsheet on the office network with one worksheet
20   for each driver which is cumbersome to use.  At the end of the day each driver returns to the
     depot to reconcile the jobs and money taken, and this data is entered into the spreadsheet as well.  
     This system is highly inefficient.  The company is making a profit but keeping track of expenses,
     profits, vehicle maintenance and driver wages is becoming very difficult, especially for drivers
     who own their own cars.

25   Processing the data in the spreadsheets to analyse taxi performance has been a problem and
     Yao Chu’s son, who is studying Computer Science at university, has been experimenting with a
     prototype database application to import the spreadsheet data and produce weekly taxi and driver
     performance reports and more accurate wage slips.  He has not completed the task.

     The increased business is also causing problems with the current system not being able to
30   handle the load efficiently.   This is causing dissatisfaction among the customers with longer
     response times.

     The range of problems is creating difficulties for the administration and threatens to undermine the
     expansion of the company, jeopardizing their market position.

     Solution requirements

     Yao Chu and his family are looking at procuring an integrated IT system that serves the following
35   purposes:

     Online booking management
     The booking system needs to be able to offer a variety of services for customers and to
     manage bookings.  Many of the features of the booking system will need to be able to be accessed
     on the company website and through the use of smartphones and the internet by customers.

40   The booking system needs to be able to:
     • identify regular customers and their usual pick up and drop off address and to be able to display
       the address through a map look-up
     • provide the availability of taxis and their location, arrange for multiple pick-up,
       regular bookings, long term and multi-trip hirings, return trips, and a trip price calculator
45   • manage special vehicle hiring, eg for large numbers of customers, with large luggage capacity,
       special needs customers, and luxury taxis
     • monitor bookings to prevent overbookings and possible overload of the taxi system during
       busy periods
     • handle different methods of accepting bookings such as by telephone, through the company
50     website on the internet, by email, by SMS, or by using a smartphone app.

     System interface
     The system in the office needs to include graphical displays to make the management and
     monitoring of the taxis easy and quick.  These will display information about taxi location, bookings,
     job tracking, and traffic updates which can be communicated to the drivers in their taxis as well.

55   Dispatch
     A dispatch system is needed that can allocate taxis, either automatically or manually.  
     The system also needs to be able to display the location and status of each taxi and the progress of
     each journey.  This can be done using taxi location equipment based on GPS and other information
     sent back to the office using communications and monitoring systems.

60   The dispatch system needs to be able to communicate to the customer the time they can be expected
     to be picked up, and to alert the customer if there are any delays.

     Journey optimization
     Taxis need to be available throughout the city to minimize the response time.  The system needs to
     be able to monitor the location of taxis in the city.

65   Red Dragon Taxi Company is also looking for software that will help with planning of the routes
     taxis should take, especially one that can help with minimizing the waiting time for pick-ups.

     As the city is growing, an increasing challenge will be the ability to locate new and changing
     pickup points and destinations.

     Inside the taxi
70   As well as fare calculation equipment, the taxi needs to have these systems installed:
     • a visual and voice guiding GPS navigator with built-in maps and text display of information
     • a variety of communications systems between the dispatch centre and the driver
     • vehicle tracking and data logging equipment
     • driver and customer safety equipment such as CCTV.

75   Control centre management
     The control centre will have a customer account manager who is responsible for:
     • managing credit card and other payment methods by customers
     • production of regular customer invoices
     • recording and management of taxi maintenance and usage
80   • driver activity statements.

     Challenges faced

     Project management and system procurement
     The company wants the system to be in place by July 2014.  They are concerned that not all the
     requirements can be met by this date, and that they may need to prioritize the implementation of
     the features.

85   The IT system needs to be secure, easy to use and maintain, and be scalable as the
     company expands.  The cost of the new system must be able to be justified from the benefits it
     will provide.  Also there are other considerations:
     • Yao Chu has become more aware of the different types of systems available, both off-the-shelf
        and customized, from a variety of providers, and needs to make a decision about which type
90      of system/s and which provider/s to use, especially with the continued rapid growth that is
        being foreseen.
     • Some systems require the setting up of the system in-house and some can be outsourced in a
        variety of ways, which is attractive since no one in the company has much expertise in IT.

                                                                                             Turn over
                                                –6–           M&N13/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      System requirements
 95   Data management
      The new system at Red Dragon Taxi Company needs to be capable of collecting and storing
      information about the company’s customers.  This would enable the company to keep in contact
      with those customers and allow it to offer incentives and special rates and services.  The company
      may also choose to share customer information with other businesses for marketing purposes.   
100   This information could include which customers have been put on a blacklist .

      Many of the systems being considered have the capability of analysing and sharing the data stored
      about customers and drivers as well as the times and locations of trips made.  Red Dragon Taxi
      Company is considering the purchase of business intelligence software to enhance this capability,
      but is not certain of the benefits and implications for the company.

105   Communication and booking management
      The company is investigating different methods of communications between the taxis,
      control centre and customers.   The integrated communication and dispatch system must be
      compatible with the data management system that Red Dragon Taxi Company will implement.

      The communications systems must be able to cope with unexpected events such as accidents,
110   traffic jams and dangerous situations.  Because of the possibility of these and other disruptions,
      as well as general performance issues, Red Dragon Taxi Company is investigating whether to use
      available communications systems for their communications or a dedicated system.   The need
      to have communications maintained when the usual communication system fails for a variety of
      possible reasons is also a main consideration here.  A variety of backup communications systems
115   and procedures needs to be investigated.

      Surveillance
      The management of Red Dragon Taxi Company has announced that CCTV equipment will
      be installed to monitor the activities in the taxi in the interests of driver and customer safety.  
      GPS and GPRS will also provide the location of the vehicles.  However, this raises concerns from
120   the drivers about employee monitoring.  Different monitoring systems are being investigated.

      Also, Red Dragon Taxi Company is regularly asked by the police and other authorities for
      information about customers and their journeys.  The information in the system needs to be held
      for up to two years.
