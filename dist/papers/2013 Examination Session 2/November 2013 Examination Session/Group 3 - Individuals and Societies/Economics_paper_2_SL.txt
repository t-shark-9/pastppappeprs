                             Botswana is the sixth best for investment in Africa

           Botswana has been ranked the sixth best foreign direct investment destination out of
            45 sub-Saharan states. Botswana’s main advantages include a population with a high
            average level of income, good transport and other infrastructure, an efficient legal system,
            low corruption, low tax rates, an efficient financial sector and a good human rights record.

           The country also has a history of strong economic growth, democracy and prudent
            economic management, as well as low political risk. It is one of Africa’s most stable countries
            and it is the continent’s longest continuous multi-party democracy. On the other hand,
            wages are high relative to productivity, there is excessive bureaucracy, high HIV prevalence,
            insufficient skills in the workforce and high income inequality.

           Botswana is the world’s biggest producer of diamonds, which accounts for nearly half of the
            government’s revenue and over a third of its GDP. Botswana’s government has invested this
            revenue wisely in infrastructure.

           Diamond production may be exhausted by 2030 so the government is promoting the
            diversification of the economy. The government is considering different supply-side policies
            to encourage industrial development.

           Despite the impressive progress in per capita income, rates of poverty and inequality are
            still high.

           Botswana’s government is progressing well with the implementation of policy reforms required
            to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Significant progress has been
            made in education and in health through considerable investments that the government has
            made to improve human capital.

                                       Economic growth and poverty in India

           Although India has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it is unlikely that
            the Millennium Development Goal of halving the rate of poverty by 2015 will be achieved.
            An important factor is growing income inequality. Calculations of Gini coefficients
            show that inequality increased by about 14 % between 2001 and 2011.

           India has about one third of the world’s population living in extreme poverty (living on less than
            $1.25 a day). Three quarters of its population live in moderate poverty (less than $2 a day).
            It is estimated that nearly half the Indian population suffers from malnutrition. Part of India’s
            poverty problem is a result of poor governance and failure to address the underlying causes
            of poverty.

           Growth averaged 8.6 % per year in the years 2005–2011 compared with the 10 % needed over
            20 years to lift the poor out of their poverty. The central bank governor says that the lack of
            steps to improve the supply-side of the economy will make it difficult for India to maintain its
            high growth rates.

           The Indian Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen argues that economic growth should not be
            “our ultimate objective, but a very useful means to achieve … a better quality of life”.
