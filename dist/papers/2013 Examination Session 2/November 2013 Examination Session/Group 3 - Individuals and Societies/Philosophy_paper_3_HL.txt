Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

Read the text below then write a response to it (of approximately 800 words).              Your response is
worth [30 marks]. In your response include:

   • a concise description of philosophical activity as presented in the text
   • an exploration of the pertinent issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text, relating this
     to your experience of doing philosophy throughout the whole course
   • appropriate references to the text that illustrate your understanding of philosophical activity
   • your personal evaluation of the issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text.


            Regardless of various conceptions of the role of the philosopher, and regardless of how remote
      we may think his/her activities are from our immediate concerns, the philosopher has been engaged
      in considering problems that are of importance to all of us, either directly or indirectly. Through
      careful critical examination, he/she has tried to evaluate the information and beliefs we have about
 5    the universe at large, and the world of human affairs. From this investigation, the philosopher has
      attempted to work out a general, systematic, coherent and consistent picture of all that we know
      and think. As we gain more information about the world through sciences, new interpretations of
      accepted pictures need to be considered.

            This sort of understanding has provided an outlook or framework in which the ordinary person
10    can place his/her own – possibly more limited – conception of the world of human affairs. It has
      provided as well a focus through which we can see our own roles and activities, and determine if
      they have any significance. Through such an examination and evaluation, we may all be better able
      to assess our ideals and aspirations, as well as understand better why we accept these, and possibly
      whether we ought to.

15          From the very beginnings of philosophy in Ancient Greece, it has been the conviction of the
      serious thinkers who have engaged in this pursuit, that it is necessary to scrutinize the views that we
      accept about our world and ourselves to see if they are rationally defensible. We have all acquired
      much information and many opinions about the natural and human universe. But few of us have
      ever considered whether these are reliable or important. We are usually willing to accept without
20    question reported scientific discoveries, certain traditional beliefs, and various views based upon our
      personal experiences. The philosopher, however, insists upon subjecting all this to intensive critical
      examination in order to discover if these views and beliefs are based upon adequate evidence, and if
      a reasonable person may be justified in adhering to them.

             All of us have some general outlook about the kind of world we think we live in, the sort of things
25    that are worthwhile in such a world, and so on. Most of us, like Socrates’ contemporaries, have never
      bothered to examine our views to discover their foundations, whether we have adequate or acceptable
      reasons for believing what we do, or whether the totality of our views has any general consistency
      or coherence. Rather than merely possessing an unorganized mass of opinions, the philosopher feels
      that these must be inspected, scrutinized and organized into a meaningful and coherent system of
30    views.

             One may be tempted to observe that these initial comments give some slight idea of what
      philosophy deals with, but that they are too vague to make clear what it is all about. The difficulty
      is that philosophy can be better explained by doing it rather than trying to describe it. Regardless of
      their aims, philosophers have, by and large, shared a common conviction that thoughtful examination
35    and analysis of our views, and our evidence for them, is important and worthwhile. A philosopher
      thinks about certain matters in certain ways. He/she wants to find out what various basic ideas or
      concepts that we have mean, what we base our knowledge on, what standards should be employed in
      arriving at sound judgments, what beliefs we ought to adhere to, and the like. By reflecting on such
      questions, the philosopher feels that one can achieve more significant comprehension of the universe,
40    natural and human.

            The philosopher does not want just any answers, and is unwilling to accept them merely because
      they purport to be answers. The philosopher wants to find the right answers, those that a rational
      man can feel are warranted after most thoughtful consideration. The fact that some answers have
      been offered, or even that some have been accepted by almost everybody in a given society, does
45    not suffice for the philosopher. Even that one might feel that certain answers are the right ones is
      not an adequate basis for relying upon them. Rather, the philosopher insists, it must be completely
      certain, that these answers are the true ones, before a rational person can adopt them as his/her own.
      Otherwise, the best that we may be able to accomplish by philosophical examination is only to realize
      the inadequacy of all answers that have been thus far presented.
