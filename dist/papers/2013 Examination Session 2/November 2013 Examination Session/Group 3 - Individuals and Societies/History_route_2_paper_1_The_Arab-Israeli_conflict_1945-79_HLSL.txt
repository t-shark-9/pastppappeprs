These sources and questions relate to the Suez Crisis of 1956.

SOURCE A                Extract from The Suez Crisis, 1956 from The Office of the Historian, United States
                        Department of State, 2012. The authors are experts on the history of US
                        foreign policy.

On 29 October 1956, Israeli forces moved across the border, defeated the Egyptian army in the Sinai,
captured Sharm el-Sheikh and thereby guaranteed Israeli strategic control over the Straits of Tiran.
Britain and France issued their ultimatum and landed troops, effectively carrying out the agreed
upon operation. However, the United States and the Soviet Union responded to events by demanding
a ceasefire. In a resolution before the United Nations, the United States also called for the evacuation
of Israeli, French, and British forces from Egypt under the supervision of a special United Nations force.
This force arrived in Egypt in mid-November. By 22 December, the last British and French troops
had withdrawn from Egyptian territory, but Israel kept its troops in Gaza until 19 March 1957, when the
United States finally compelled the Israeli government to withdraw its troops. The Suez conflict
fundamentally altered the regional balance of power. It was a military defeat for Egypt, but Nasser’s status
grew in the Arab world as the defender of Arab nationalism.

SOURCE C                Extract from Arafat – The Biography by Tony Walker and Andrew Gowers, 2003.
                        Tony Walker is political editor of the Australian Financial Review and Andrew
                        Gowers was Middle East editor of the London Financial Times from 1987 to 1990.
                        Walker and Gowers are both journalists.

International pressure forced a ceasefire at midnight on 6 November and Nasser emerged a towering
hero in the Arab world. He had defied the power of Britain and France, not to mention Israel. It was a
“victory” that seemed to Arafat and his colleagues could benefit the Palestinian cause, but they discovered
nothing could have been further from the truth. After his triumph over the tripartite aggression,
Nasser cracked down even harder on the Muslim Brotherhood and anyone else he considered a threat
to public order. Student activists who had flirted with the Muslim Brotherhood were among those kept
under close surveillance. The Egyptian secret police had, in any case, long been taking a close interest in
Arafat’s activities.


SOURCE D                Extract from The Arab–Israeli Wars by Chaim Herzog, 2004. Chaim Herzog was
                        president of Israel from 1983 to 1993 and was a high ranking officer in the Israeli
                        army until 1962.

In Gaza, the withdrawal of the Israeli forces led to a period of violence in which those who had allegedly
“cooperated” with the Israeli occupying forces, from November 1956 until the Israeli withdrawal in
March 1957, were summarily executed. The United Nations soldiers in the Gaza Strip lost all control of the
roaming fedayeen gangs, and indeed of the entire situation. Within two days of Gaza being transferred to the
United Nations, Nasser had nominated a military governor for the Gaza Strip who, without asking the UN,
moved in with his headquarters – the United Nations did not even complain, and this weakness sowed the
seeds for future problems in the area. Within a short time, the Mayor of Gaza was dismissed and replaced
by a pro-Egyptian. At the same time, the UN, under pressure from the Egyptians, ordered its forces to
leave the Gaza Strip and only patrol its borders. The UN Emergency Force took up positions along the
borders between Israel and Egypt, and at Sharm el-Sheikh.


SOURCE E                Extract from “Consequences of the Suez Crisis in the Arab World”
                        by Rashid Khalidi, in The Modern Middle East: A Reader by Albert Hourani,
                        et al, 1993. Rashid Khalidi is professor of Arab Studies at Columbia University, US,
                        and was a personal friend of Arafat in the 1980s.

Beyond its effect on Egypt and the other direct participants, the Suez Crisis had a profound effect on the
rest of the Arab world … Suez firmly established Nasser as the pre-eminent Arab leader until the end of
his life, and Arab nationalism as the leading Arab ideology for at least that long. Suez also ended the
dominant influence over the Arab world which Britain and France had sometimes shared and sometimes
disputed for over a century … Arab leaders ceased paying attention to London and Paris, turning to Cairo,
Washington, and Moscow. Finally, because it involved Israel in open collaboration with the old
imperial powers and in an invasion of the territory of an existing Arab state, the Suez Crisis established an
image of Israel in the Arab world, and a pattern of conflict with it, that had an impact perhaps as important
as the 1948 war.
