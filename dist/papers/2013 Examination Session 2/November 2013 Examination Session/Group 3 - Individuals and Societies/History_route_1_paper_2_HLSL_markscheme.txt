content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


      0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.


      1–3:     Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
               appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.


      4–5:     There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are
               mainly inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are
               barely understood and there is minimal focus on the task.


      6–7:     Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
               limited in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will
               understanding of historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only
               partially addressed.


      8–9:     The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is
               present but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive
               in nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation.
               Critical commentary may be present. There is an attempt to place events in historical
               context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a
               structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.


      10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are
             considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present.
             Events are generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes,
             such as comparison and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different
             approaches and interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical
             knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.


      13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
             applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
             produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
             understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
             different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.


      16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of
             the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is
             used as evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as
             comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
             interpretations are used appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1           Dynasties and rulers

1.    Analyse the methods by which either one medieval European ruler or one Islamic ruler
      attempted to establish his power.

      This question deals with the methods used by rulers to establish their power or authority over their
      territory, country or empire. Candidates must select one medieval European or one Islamic ruler as
      the subject of their responses.

      The methods used by a ruler to establish his authority may include, but not be limited to:
      elimination of individuals who might challenge his right to rule, these might include other family
      members or other claimants to power; alliances with influential groups such as the Church,
      powerful landowners or merchants; use of military power to eliminate or intimidate challengers,
      suppress dissidents and exercise control over all parts of his territory; establishing a strong central
      bureaucracy to enforce royal edicts and laws throughout the country; an effective legal system to
      spread royal authority; an effective taxation policy that would provide revenues to support the
      administration and the military power needed to maintain authority. Other strategies such as
      marriages, foreign alliances and the use of elaborate ceremonials and rituals would also be methods
      by which rulers could establish their authority. Asserting hereditary right to succession or divine
      designation might also be other ways of establishing the right to rule.


2.   Why did medieval rulers replace the nobility with the middle class in the royal administration?

      The reasons for the replacement of the nobility with middle class individuals may include, but not
      be limited to: members of the nobility were often rivals for the throne and some resented the ruler
      and wished to replace him/her with themselves or a family member; rulers were often worried about
      the loyalty of their administration and wished to find individuals who were not anxious to replace
      them. Nobles often lacked administrative skills having been trained as soldiers, many would have
      had minimal education beyond military training. Rulers needed literate, educated individuals to
      administer taxes, laws, maintain accounts and write legislation. Middle class individuals owed their
      position to the ruler and were therefore most likely to be loyal supporters and not undertake
      schemes to replace them. As enemies of the nobility in many cases they were an effective
      counterweight to members of the aristocracy who might have wished to replace the ruler. In
      addition, middle class individuals, with their links to towns and the commercial classes, could assist
      the ruler with raising funds to maintain his rule. Successful rulers throughout the medieval world
      created effective bureaucracies staffed by individuals of non noble birth.

3.   In what ways, and with what results, did Charlemagne (768–814) seek to expand his power?

     The ways in which Charlemagne sought to expand his power may include, but not be limited to:
     military conquest which gave him control of Italy, and eliminated rivals such as the Saxons, Avars
     and Bavarians. He also conquered Rome and controlled the Pope and the institution of the Papacy.
     He extended his authority by extending Christianity in all of the pagan areas that he conquered and
     using the Church as an agent for civilization and control of these regions. He asserted himself as a
     theocratic ruler in charge of both the political and spiritual. The Pope was his subordinate. He
     increased his authority by taking the title of Holy Roman Emperor to ensure a link to the past and
     gain greater recognition for his authority. He attempted to establish a more effective central
     administration through the missi dominici, new law codes to replace tribal customs, and the
     issuance of extensive regulations to do with the economy, trade, roads and bridges and welfare. In
     addition, a standard coinage was issued to indicate authority, provide stability and increase
     commerce.

     The results of his efforts were substantial. He was successful in ruling an enormous empire and in
     dominating both temporal and spiritual worlds. He extended his territories and unified much of
     Europe for the first time since the fall of Rome. He extended Christianity in Eastern Europe.

     He was less successful in establishing a strong central administration – the territory was so large
     and diverse that he was not able to unify it under a central legal and bureaucratic system. His need
     for a strong military to support his campaigns led to an increase of land grants to his vassals in
     exchange for service. This feudal arrangement weakened the central administration as the local
     nobles became more powerful.

     If only ways or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

4.   Explain the sources of law codes in either the Islamic world or medieval Europe.

     The sources of law codes in medieval Europe may include, but not be limited to: the remnants of
     Roman statute law which survived in some areas of Europe; the Justinian Code of the Byzantine
     Empire would also have provided some material or direction; tribal customs and traditions, which
     were also used by the pagan tribes to regulate their societies; the coming of Christianity created a
     new set of laws for the regulation of the Church and its institutions, but also to regulate the
     behaviour of all Christians. Kings and other rulers created statute laws to control and regulate
     behaviour in their kingdoms and often to replace or modify the traditional laws and customs that
     had existed previously. Charlemagne, William I and Henry II would be good examples. In
     addition, administrative laws and regulations to cover taxation, trade and other day to day activities
     were passed by all rulers anxious to extend their authority. Law codes also resulted from the
     collection of legal precedents accumulated in the royal and manorial courts. These were an
     important addition to the law codes and affected how laws were applied. The work of the itinerant
     judges of Henry II would be an example.

     Candidates should present a properly structured response supported by relevant examples.

     The sources of law codes in the Islamic world may include, but not be limited to: the local customs
     that had existed prior to Islam and continued to exist. They were interpreted by local elders and
     formed the basis of how individuals should act. These were replaced by the sharia – the body of
     Islamic law. This was developed and interpreted by religious scholars – the ulama – and
     administered by specialist judges (the qadi). Judges made decisions based on their understanding of
     religious law and the school of law in which they had been educated. These also took into account
     existing laws in the lands in which Islam spread, thus adding to the diversity of the interpretations
     among the ulama. In Shia Islam, the imams, as successors to the Prophet Muhammad’s temporal
     and religious authority, were also considered as law givers. Where specific laws were lacking, they
     made decisions which could form a body of precedent for future decisions. The government also
     had statute law that covered administrative regulations, crime and punishment and taxation. These
     were not part of the sharia and were administered by government judges and officials.

5.   Assess the reasons for the success of Henry II of England (1154–89) as a ruler.

     There are a number of reasons for the success of Henry II. Some of these are found in the
     institutions that had been established by previous rulers, others are the result of Henry’s policies
     and actions.

     Candidates may point out that Henry inherited excellent governing institutions that had been created
     by William I and Henry I. These had suffered somewhat during the civil war but were still in place
     and could be revived by a strong ruler. The anarchy of the civil war period led many people, and
     the Church, to welcome the return of a strong ruler, and this worked in Henry’s favour.

     Henry was also fortunate that two individuals, who might have caused a problem for his reign, died
     immediately before he took power. His marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine increased his territory
     enormously and made him the wealthiest ruler in Europe. This contributed to his ability to develop
     and maintain power.

     The policies that Henry established which made his rule a success may include, but not be limited
     to: he re-established law and order by ending the civil war, destroying the castles built by the barons
     during that time, and forcing them to swear allegiance and accept his rule. The government was
     reorganized and central control extended over the sheriffs and the collection of revenues. He
     crushed opposition in Scotland, Wales and Ireland, and stamped out internal rebellion in 1173–74.
     This meant that Henry could now concentrate on legal and administrative reforms in England
     without danger of opposition. He defeated the French monarchy, who were trying to encroach on
     his lands. Through the office of the Justiciar, the curiales and itinerant judges, Henry extended his
     authority and that of the crown throughout England. The king, not the local officials, became the
     source of law and justice. He introduced the jury trial and legislation to prevent wars over disputed
     successions. Sheriffs were supervised and replaced if their work was found unsatisfactory. Taxes
     were collected efficiently, fees were charged for royal writs and legal matters. Royal revenues
     increased as the barons were compelled to pay higher taxes. The Assize of Arms organized the
     military forces and ensured that they were equipped to serve. England was peaceful,
     well-administered and unified as a result of his rule.

     Candidates may point out that Henry was not successful in his personal relations and found himself
     at war with his sons over the division of the Angevin lands.
                                                  –8–                 N13/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Analyse the success of the policies of either ‘Abd al-Malik (685–705) or Harun al-Rashid
     (786–809).

     ‘Abd al-Malik (685–705)
     ‘Abd al-Malik’s rule as caliph in the Umayyad period demonstrated a number of successes. These
     would include, but not be limited to: he expanded the Islamic world by conquering Turkestan and
     taking all of North Africa from the Byzantines. He made Arabic the language of the empire to
     simplify and unify the administration. The postal service was improved. The tax system was
     rationalized and made more effective. ‘Abd al-Malik issued the first gold coins with Arabic
     inscriptions. These replaced the Byzantine coins and were not only an advantage for commerce but
     were a strong assertion of the power of Islam as the coins displayed verses from the Qur’an. He
     also asserted the power of Islam against other faiths by his construction of the Dome of the Rock on
     the haram in Jerusalem. This was a clear demonstration of the wealth and power of Islam as well as
     a symbol that it had superseded Judaism and Christianity.

     He de-centralized the Umayyad administration and appointed competent administrators to rule the
     growing empire. He was successful in arranging a peaceful succession of power to his son. He
     may be seen as not being able to overcome the opposition of the Shi’ites and others who refused to
     accept the Umayyads as the legitimate rulers.

     Harun al-Rashid (786–809)
     Harun al-Rashid was the fifth caliph of the Abbasid dynasty. His reign is famous for the flourishing
     of art, literature, science, philosophy and all forms of intellectual knowledge and pursuits. He
     founded libraries and a House of Wisdom to translate classical works into Arabic. His age is
     believed to be the basis of the Thousand and One Nights. It is said that his era was the foundation
     of the intellectual golden age of Islam and established the superiority of Islamic scholars, scientists
     and philosophers for a number of centuries. The administration of the empire was improved under
     his viziers, the Barmakids, and the city of Baghdad flourished. Politically, he was able to suppress
     rebellions, but was less successful at retaining the unity of the empire. Independent regimes were
     established in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt, which seriously weakened the power of the caliph and
     the empire. He further weakened the empire by dividing it between his two sons on his death.
     They engaged in a destructive civil war.

Topic 2         Society and economy

7.   Assess the impact of the rise of towns in medieval Europe.

     This is a broad question which offers candidates a number of areas to explore with respect to the
     impact of towns. These may include, but not be limited to: trade and commerce, social structure,
     political influences and effects on government, industry, education and culture, demographics.
     Candidates will not be able to develop all of these areas but should select a variety of them through
     which to develop an effective response. Candidates should provide specific examples to illustrate
     their points.

     Candidates should note in the analysis of the areas that they have chosen that cities were a dynamic
     force which challenged and changed the existing medieval order. Cities challenged the feudal and
     manorial systems, changed the economic structure, altered the political system through their
     alliances with monarchs and their development of new political structures within their walls. Their
     wealth funded the growth of schools and universities, opened Europe to the outside world and
     created a secular world that challenged religious authority.


8.   Examine the religious and non-religious importance of pilgrimages in medieval Europe or the
     Islamic world.

     The religious role of pilgrimages in medieval Europe was of considerable importance. This may
     involve, but not be limited to: pilgrimages were an important action for those seeking salvation or
     doing penance. They were a condition imposed by the Church for the granting of absolution to
     individuals whose sins were of a serious nature. Pilgrimages could be of a local or long-distance
     nature: the further the distance the greater the religious benefit – hence the attraction of the Holy
     Land as a destination. Pilgrimages also played a key role for the Church in maintaining the shrines
     to which pilgrims travelled and benefitting from the offerings, payments and contributions made by
     pilgrims who reached their goal.

     The non-religious importance may include, but not be limited to: pilgrims were a major source of
     economic activity for the destinations they reached. Food, drink and housing had to be provided. A
     profitable trade in sacred souvenirs was carried on. Towns and villages along the route of
     pilgrimages also benefitted from the influx of travellers needing supplies and assistance.
     Pilgrimages were also a source of literature and stories (The Canterbury Tales being an example).
     Pilgrims also brought ideas and knowledge from one part of Europe to another and returned home
     with considerable knowledge from their travels.

     The religious role of pilgrimages was of great importance in the Islamic world. It was an
     expectation that all Muslims would undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their life if
     they had the economic means to do so. In addition, great importance was attached to pilgrimages to
     Jerusalem, Hebron and other holy places. These pilgrimages were both a duty and a desire by the
     faithful. In addition, Shi’ite and Sufi pilgrimage sites were important and attracted numerous
     visitors of that sect.
                                                  – 10 –               N13/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      The non-religious importance of pilgrimages may include, but not be limited to: the organization of
      pilgrimages by thousands of individuals was an important responsibility for governments. Their
      strength and status as a governing body could be judged by their ability to organize and defend the
      pilgrimage routes. The economic needs of the pilgrims played a key role in the economy of many
      areas of the empire, which provided the supplies necessary for the pilgrims to make the journey.
      Wars and other forms of conflicts between groups in the Islamic world took place over the desire to
      control the pilgrimage routes. It was a sign of power and authority if a particular dynasty or tribe
      was able to gain control of these areas which were so crucial to the spiritual life of the empire.


9.    Explain the role and importance of cities in the Islamic world.

      The Islamic world was marked by the existence of a chain of great cities that stretched from Spain
      to India. These cities were important in the Islamic world from the outset. They were the centres of
      Islamic civilization and dominated many aspects of the life of the empire.
      The role of these cities may include, but not be limited to: they were the centres for markets and the
      great merchants who controlled the long-distance trade throughout the Empire. They were also the
      centres of large-scale production of a wide range of goods and the homes of the skilled craftsmen
      who produced them. Cities were the centres for the administration of the law and the schools which
      trained individuals in the law. The royal palaces and government buildings were located in the
      cities, as were the military garrisons which defended the city and the ruler and which imposed order
      on the countryside. Cities were also the centres of education through the universities as well as
      religious training and discussion in the great mosques. They dominated many aspects of life
      throughout the history of the Islamic world.


10.   Analyse the reasons for the development of the manorial system.

      The reasons for the development of the manorial system may include, but not be limited to: peasant
      farmers found themselves in need of protection in the early years of the medieval period. They
      were prepared to exchange some of their freedom for the promise of protection and support from a
      powerful landowner. Landless peasants displaced by the upheavals of the fall of the Roman Empire
      and the subsequent chaos, offered to sacrifice their freedom to serve large landholders: to work for
      them in exchange for land, powerful rulers captured territories and their inhabitants and gave them
      as rewards to their followers – the peasants became serfs who worked to support their overlords.
      Kings or other rulers distributed lands to military men in exchange for their service to the ruler
      when required (feudal system). The land and the attached peasants would support the military men
      and kings would not have to pay them a salary. The manorial system assumed that however a
      peasant became attached to a manor, he was to remain attached to it as long as his overlord required.
      Candidates may note that the manorial system did not develop in highly urban areas such as
      Flanders and Italy. It was a rural phenomenon requiring the existence of extensive agricultural
      lands.
                                                 – 11 –              N13/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


11.   Explain the factors that encouraged long-distance trade in either medieval Europe or the
      Islamic world.

      The factors that encouraged long-distance trade in the medieval world may include, but not be
      limited to: improvements in ships and navigation which made longer voyages easier; the growth of
      towns and commercial centres such as Venice, which established trade routes from Northern Europe
      to the Mediterranean and the Byzantine Empire; improvements in banking and credit systems,
      which made trade between distant areas easier; the Crusades encouraged the development of more
      trade between Europe and the Islamic world. The growth of strong central governments and larger
      political units such as the Holy Roman Empire facilitated travel, trade and communication. The
      increased power of towns and the middle class encouraged the development of laws to protect
      commerce and merchants. The Fairs of Champagne were an example of how royal administrations
      encouraged merchants to travel long-distance to conduct business.

      The factors that encouraged long-distance trade in the Islamic world may include, but not be limited
      to: a tradition of long-distance trade predated the foundation of the Islamic world, and was
      supported and maintained; merchants had a prestigious role in Islamic society and their activities
      were encouraged and protected; strong central administrations, and effective communications
      networks made trade more secure and profitable. The size of the Islamic world and the need to
      communicate with all parts made the merchant a key figure, and encouraged the movement of
      goods across long distances. The need to supply large cities with goods required trade over long
      distance as did the wealth of the cities, which encouraged the growth of commerce to supply a vast
      array of needs.


12.   How did religious communities play an important role in the medieval economy?

      This question deals with the economic role of religious communities. Candidates should not
      discuss other functions of these communities such as education or charitable work unless they have
      a clear economic impact.

      The economic impact of religious communities may include, but not be limited to: they were
      consumers of a wide variety of products and encouraged trade, markets and the development of
      industries to supply their needs; they were major employers of craftsmen for religious buildings
      (cathedrals, abbeys, churches). These construction projects promoted a variety of industries to
      supply building materials as well as furnishings and ornamentation. They were major producers of
      agricultural products and made major advances in agricultural technique, which they passed on to
      other farmers. This led to an increase in both the quantity and quality of produce. They played a
      major role in the wool trade through their improvements in stock-raising. Their schools trained
      clerks and merchants in arithmetic and record keeping – essential skills for commerce.

Topic 3           Wars and warfare

13.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the Ridda Wars or “Wars of Apostasy” (632–633).

      The causes of the Ridda Wars may include, but not be limited to: the death of Muhammad
      encouraged many Bedouin tribes which had supported Islam to revolt against the control of his
      successors. They felt that their allegiance had been to Muhammad personally and they owed no
      allegiance to any other organization or individual; their alliance with Muhammad had been purely
      political and had no religious aspect. They wished to recover their traditional independence, and
      avoid the taxes and control imposed by the regime in Medina. Some tribal chiefs also saw this as
      an opportunity to increase their importance by claiming to be prophets. The absence of a
      designated successor to Muhammad also encouraged them to feel that the alliance with Medina was
      ended.

      The results of the wars may include, but not be limited to: Abu Bakr was chosen as caliph to
      succeed Muhammad. He organized military forces and crushed the rebellions and brought the
      tribes back into the Islamic world. This prevented the destruction of Islam and established a base
      for further expansion. After the wars, Abu Bakr used the armies that he had built to crush the

14.   Compare and contrast the causes of any two wars in medieval Europe.

      This is a broad question which will give candidates a wide choice of material from which to
      construct a response. Responses must be in a compare and contrast format.

      The causes of wars in the medieval period may include, but not be limited to: territorial disputes
      between rulers or dynasties, disputes over the succession to the throne or overlordship of a territory,
      disputes arising from contracts such as marriages or inheritance, religious wars, civil wars caused
      by intra- or inter-family disputes, foreign invasions. Popular choices will be the Crusades, Hundred
      Years War, Wars of the Roses, French–English wars of the twelfth century, the Reconquista. Any
      medieval European war may be chosen.

      If only one war is selected, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

15.   Assess the significance of two of the following battles: Manzikert (1071); Hattin (1187);
      Bouvines (1214); Poitiers (1356).

      Candidates must choose two of the above and comment on their significance/importance in
      medieval history. Simple narratives of the battles themselves will not score well.

      Manzikert (1071)
      This battle between the Byzantine army and the Seljuk Turks resulted in the obliteration of the
      Byzantine army. The significance of this battle may include, but not be limited to: the defeat
      allowed the Turks to dominate Anatolia, which had been a key area for Byzantium; this was a factor
      in the long-term decline of the Byzantine Empire; the Seljuk Turks invaded Syria and Palestine and
      captured Jerusalem. The Fatimids, who had allowed Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land, were
      defeated and replaced by the more militant Seljuks. Christian pilgrims were not allowed to go to
      the Holy Land. The possibility of complete defeat of the Byzantines meant the reduction of the
      Christian world and loss of access to the Holy Land. This created panic in Europe at the thought of
      a more aggressive Islam and a new wave of conquests.

      The defeat at Manzikert helped inspire the First Crusade as a way of recovering the Holy Land for
      Christendom and pushing back Islam. In addition, the weakening of the Byzantines encouraged the
      Roman Church to support the Crusades as a way to gain power over the Eastern Church.

      Hattin (1187)
      The Battle of Hattin was a catastrophic defeat for the crusading states in their battle against Islamic
      states. The significance of this battle may include, but not be limited to: the Islamic forces
      destroyed the Christian army and were able to conquer Jerusalem – a major blow to the Crusades
      and Europe. Salah al-Din was hailed as a great leader in the Islamic world and was able increase
      his power and authority. The defeat at Hattin exposed the weakness of the crusading states in terms
      of numbers, leadership and tactics. The Third Crusade was a response to the defeat at Hattin.
      Hattin demoralized the Europeans and, as a result, a number of castles and fortresses surrendered to
      Salah al-Din accepting that they could not resist any longer. In comparison, Hattin was a great
      boost for the confidence of the Islamic world and encouraged them to continue their assault on the
      European presence.

      Bouvines (1214)
      The Battle of Bouvines saw the defeat of the Holy Roman Emperor and his allies by Philip II of
      France. This was a very significant victory as it greatly strengthened the power of the French
      monarchy and made France the most powerful nation in Europe. The Holy Roman Empire was
      seen as weak and becoming weaker as a result of this defeat. John of England, who was an ally of
      the Holy Roman Empire, suffered from the defeat also. His attempt to regain land in France failed,
      and he was forced to return to England where his failures encouraged the barons to revolt against
      him and force him to accept Magna Carta. His defeat confirmed the French possession of most of
      the lands previously held by the Angevin family.

      Poitiers (1356)
      The Battle of Poitiers resulted in a French defeat and the capture of the French king. This resulted
      in the collapse of the government in France. The King of Navarre launched an uprising, the Estate
      General demanded that the monarch reform his administration, reduce taxes and submit to a council
      of knights, clergy and merchants. In addition, the countryside was devastated by the free
      companies who could pillage and destroy at will as the government had no army to stop them. A
      massive Jacquerie occurred as the peasants revolted against the landowners. France was forced to
      cede large territories to England and pay an enormous ransom for the king. The Treaty of Brétigny
      was signed in 1360, which gave the English large areas of land. This was an enormous victory for
      England and a serious loss in wealth and prestige for France and its rulers.

      If only one battle is addressed mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


16.   Why was William I able to conquer England between 1066 and 1070?

      The reasons for the success of William I may include, but not be limited to: he had developed a
      well-organized, disciplined and powerful base in Normandy which supported his ambitions, and he
      had gained the support of the Pope for his expedition. He had some supporters in England as he
      had been named by Edward the Confessor to succeed him. His opponent in England, Harold, was
      opposed by both William and the King of Norway and did not have unanimous support in England.
      William was able to assemble a powerful military force using the new technology of the mounted
      knight to oppose the Anglo-Saxon infantry. In addition, William had numerous archers which
      Harold did not, and they played a key role in the battle.

      The Battle of Hastings was won by William as the result of the exhaustion and lack of discipline of
      the Anglo-Saxon army. The death of Harold and his brothers during the battle demoralized and
      disorganized the Anglo-Saxon forces and allowed William a victory. The death of a large number
      of Anglo-Saxon nobles at Hastings weakened the potential opposition to him.

      He completed the conquest of England by a strong demonstration of force: building castles at key
      locations to intimidate and control the population. Opposition to him was divided, and no English
      leader emerged to challenge his authority. Any attempt at rebellion was crushed with enormous
      severity as in the Harrying of the North. This exterminated all opposition and intimidated those
      who might consider it in future. All the rebel leaders were killed or exiled. William immediately
      extended his authority, declaring that all land, including that of the Church, was controlled by him.
      He replaced the Anglo-Saxon nobility with Normans to further buttress his authority.

      Candidates should focus on a range of reasons for William’s ability to conquer England and not
      produce a simple narrative of the Battle of Hastings.
                                                   – 15 –              N13/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


17.   “Salah al-Din’s victories were the result of both political and military skill.” To what extent
      do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will have to assess the reasons for Salah al-Din’s success as a military leader by
      determining what role was played by his military ability and what role was played by his ability to
      form alliances and weaken his opponents through negotiation and diplomacy. Candidates should
      not restrict the discussion to his well-known victories over the Crusaders but consider his defeat of
      other Islamic forces as well.

      Salah al-Din based his power on his overthrow of the Fatimid Empire and his takeover of Egypt,
      Syria and most of the Fatimid territories. The overthrow of the Fatimids helped to unify other
      Islamic states and removed an important ally for the crusaders. He had gained this position through
      his military skill and personal charisma under Nur al-Din. His political skill gave him the military
      resources to launch attacks against the crusading states. Salah al-Din also continued the movement
      to unify Islamic states against the West and to use the idea of jihad to rally the Islamic forces in a
      unified movement against the west. This ability to continue the process of unification was a major
      reason for his ability to defeat the West. This unification of Islamic states gave him the ability to
      raise large forces and to deny the crusaders the chance to benefit from Islamic disunity.

      Salah al-Din’s military victories were gained through a combination of military skills but it should
      be noted that he was not infallible and was defeated by the Crusaders on a number of occasions. He
      was able to take advantage of the divisions in the crusading states and isolate and defeat their forces
      piecemeal. The Christian lack of coordination and Salah al-Din’s offer of generous terms for
      surrender undermined his opponents’ will to resist, and many strongpoints surrendered to him
      without a fight. The defeat at Hattin, which was the result of poor western tactics as much as Salah
      al-Din’s skill, was a psychological blow that greatly undermined Christian resistance and allowed
      him to make further conquests.


18.   Explain the cultural and economic impact of the Crusades on medieval Europe.

      Cultural
      The cultural impact of the Crusades may include, but not be limited to: new styles of dress, new
      types of food, architecture and literature were introduced to Europeans. Classical learning in many
      fields including medicine, science and philosophy became available to Europeans; this had a
      significant impact on European education and created challenges to existing religious practice.
      European understanding of other cultures and societies was increased through their exposure to the
      Byzantine and Islamic worlds.

      Economic
      The economic impact of the Crusades may include, but not be limited to: the Crusades opened trade
      routes between the Middle East and Europe, which introduced a variety of new products to Europe
      and created a demand for these products. The Italian cities such as Venice, Genoa etc grew in
      prosperity as they controlled the shipping between Europe and the Middle East, and also operated
      as merchants to provide the products to Europe. This enriched the Italian states and allowed them
      to increase their economic importance in banking, manufacturing and transportation. The European
      wool trade was increased as a result of the Crusades as there was an increased demand for fine
      woolens in the Islamic world. European banking increased to meet the needs of the Crusaders and
      to finance shipping and military expeditions. European manufacturing increased in response to the
      demand for new products.

Topic 4          Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   Assess the intellectual significance of the work of two of the following: Peter Abelard (1079–
      1142); Roger Bacon (1220–92); Thomas Aquinas (1225–74); Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037);
      Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126–98); Ibn ‘Arabi (1165–1240).

      Peter Abelard (1079–1142)
      Abelard was a French scholastic thinker and theologian often seen as the greatest logician of his
      time. He was an extraordinary teacher and attracted multitudes to his lectures in Paris. As a result,
      his ideas were widely distributed and discussed. He was responsible for establishing Aristotle as
      the most important philosopher. Through his use of the dialectic method, he applied rational
      explanation to ecclesiastical doctrine in such works as Sic et Non. He was twice condemned for his
      writings and forced to stop teaching and live in a monastery. His greatest opponent was Bernard of
      Clairvaux, who was violently opposed to the practice of applying logic and reason to religious faith.
      His tragic love affair with Héloïse made him an important figure in romantic literature and his
      determination to use reason and logic made him a source of inspiration to others in the twelfth
      century renaissance and in later years.

      Roger Bacon (1220–92)
      Bacon was an English theologian, philosopher and thinker who placed emphasis on the study of the
      natural world through empirical and experimental approaches. His interests were wide-ranging and
      he wrote on all subjects from theology to calendrical studies, astrology and astronomy as well as
      mathematics and optics. He wrote important works in many areas which often attacked other
      authorities or past practices. He supported the study of ancient languages so that the Bible could be
      studied in its original form and not through translation. He was a well known teacher at Oxford and
      produced a wide range of tracts on many subjects. He was a strong advocate of deductive reasoning
      and was a supporter of the work of Robert Grosseteste, particularly in the area of optics and
      mathematics.

      Thomas Aquinas (1225–74)
      Aquinas was an Italian Dominican monk who is most widely known for his role in the scholastic
      movement. He is considered to be among the greatest theologians and philosophers of the Catholic
      Church. His work was a reconciliation of the logic of the Aristotelians with the beliefs of the
      Church. This reconciliation resolved to some degree the conflict between faith and reason that had
      developed in the twelfth century.

      Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037)
      Ibn Sina was a Muslim physician, scientist and philosopher who lived during the Islamic Golden
      Age of the tenth and eleventh centuries. He is regarded in some quarters as the most influential
      philosopher and scientist of this period. He wrote extensively on philosophy in the area of logic,
      ethics and metaphysics. He made important contributions to the reconciliation of rational
      philosophy and theology. He also produced major works in astronomy, chemistry and mathematics.
      His published works number in the hundreds. His comments on Aristotle and his work in
      metaphysics formed part of the new ideas of the twelfth century renaissance. His most famous
      works are in the area of medicine. His 14 volume Canons of Medicine contained enormous
      advances in the study of disease, treatments and prevention as well as anatomy. This text arrived in
      Europe in the twelfth century and became the standard medical text for centuries, both in Europe
      and the Islamic world.

      Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126–98)
      Ibn Rushd was a Spanish-Muslim polymath often regarded as the most influential of Muslim
      philosophers. He wrote extensively on the work of Aristotle and Plato. His work on Aristotelian
      logic brought him into conflict with philosophers such as Avicenna. He was a staunch defender of
      Aristotelian logic and used it to question certain aspects of Islamic theology. His comments on
      Aristotle and his translations of his work brought Aristotle to the attention of Western philosophers
      of the twelfth century renaissance and strongly influenced Thomas Aquinas and the scholastics
      amongst others. His work on Aristotle and Plato should be seen as crucial to Western interest and
      understanding of classical philosophy.

      He wrote extensively and effectively on physics, astronomy and medicine. However his work on
      philosophy, both in defence of Aristotle and his attempts to explain the relationship between
      philosophy and religion, was his greatest contribution.

      Ibn ‘Arabi (1165–1240)
      Ibn ‘Arabi was a very influential Sufi mystic, teacher and author. He was seen as a highly original
      thinker who wrote extensively on all aspects of the world from science to religion. He produced
      hundreds of works which were widely circulated. His influence was largely in the Islamic world as
      he was little known in the West. His works covered all aspects of Sufism from prayers to practical
      subjects. Many of his writings were inspirational and challenged traditional approaches to a variety
      of subjects.

20.   Discuss the role and impact of universities and centres of learning in the Islamic world.

      The importance of learning centres in the Islamic world may include, but not be limited to: they
      were often established in association with mosques and became the basis for the transmission of
      religious learning; they evolved into the madrasa, which also included legal studies and the study of
      all aspects of Islamic belief, traditions and ideas such as Sufism. These were enormously important
      and were funded by rulers and high officials. They produced scholars who were highly respected in
      the Islamic world, and who interpreted the Qur’an, wrote and interpreted laws, adjudicated disputes
      and provided administrators and officials for the caliphate.

      The universities and schools also continued the intellectual traditions that had been inherited from
      the Greeks and Byzantines. They expanded the study of science, medicine and mathematics as well
      as many other subjects. The schools produced translations of foreign books that allowed Muslim
      scholars to expand and develop their knowledge. They became the leaders in a great range of
      scientific and related subjects during the Golden Age. The support for intellectual development by
      the Fatimids and the foundation of the university in Cairo was a marker of the importance of such
      institutions. The establishment of universities in Spain at Toledo and Cordoba further enhanced the
      importance of scholarship in Islamic society and made it the leader in a wide range of intellectual
      pursuits. Scholarship also distinguished Islamic society from medieval European society where
      learning in the medieval period was very limited and relied on imported knowledge from the
      Islamic world to develop new ideas.

21.   Analyse the results of the twelfth century renaissance.

      The results of the twelfth century renaissance may include, but not be limited to: there was a
      dramatic increase in scholarship both in religion and the natural world. Universities were founded
      to study and incorporate the classical material imported from the Islamic world along with other
      knowledge from Islamic universities. Considerable study was made of Roman law and philosophy.
      Law, medicine and science were studied in the universities and many new ideas developed.
      Important scholars such as Abelard, Grosseteste, Bacon and Peter Lombard provided new theories
      in philosophy, logic and science. The Church was challenged by the new ideas in philosophy and
      logic and was forced to reconcile these new ideas with its teachings. The result was the work of
      Thomas Aquinas who sought to reconcile the ideas of the Renaissance with church doctrine.
      Monastic orders such as the Dominicans were founded to address the intellectual issues raised
      during this period. There was a new spirit of progress and humanism in Europe which laid the basis
      for further progress on many fronts. The image of humans began to change as they were seen as
      being able to understand their world based on reason and observation. New architectural styles
      such as the Gothic cathedrals were adopted as part of the general spirit of change and progress.
      Education was more widespread, literacy increased, as did the production of books.


22.   Explain the influence of religion on the visual arts in either the Islamic or medieval European
      world.

      The influence of religion on art in the medieval European world was extensive. Candidates should
      recognize that almost all art forms were commissioned by religious institutions, influenced by
      religious beliefs or expected to conform to religious beliefs.

      The majority of art works, painting, sculpture etc were found in religious institutions: churches,
      abbeys and cathedrals. Art works were not signed by artists but were executed to a particular
      formula dictated by custom-specific colours and symbols were used to denote religious figures such
      as saints or apostles. Artists of all types found employment in religious institutions and thus, their
      work reflected the needs of the patrons. Secular themes or those depicting non-religious activities
      were very rare and might cause the artist to be criticized or punished by the Church. Art was
      designed to serve the interest of the Church and convey its message to the masses. As the masses
      were largely illiterate, their understanding of the religious message and themes was best transmitted
      through art. Art was therefore not free but served, in a sense, the interests of an institution or state.

      The influence of religion on art in the Islamic world may include, but not be limited to: Islamic
      thought was opposed to representations of the human figure in religious contexts and therefore
      mosques were decorated in geometric designs and elaborate calligraphy using verses from the
      Qur’an. Portraiture was also not permitted through most of this period, although it appeared in the
      early years of the Ottoman era. Sculpture of the human figure was also forbidden. The rules
      against human figures were not strictly followed in the area of book illustrations. This may be
      because they were not on public display.

      Religious buildings such as mosques had an important influence on art as they were examples of the
      skill of the architects, masons, etc. Their interiors demonstrated the most sophisticated examples of
      art and calligraphy and were set as an example to the faithful and a source of inspiration.

23.   For what reasons, and with what results, did vernacular books and writings emerge in
      medieval Europe?

      The reasons for the emergence and spread of vernacular writings may include, but not be limited to:
      the development of new literary styles such as the chanson de geste. These emerged from poems
      and songs that had existed for many years in vernacular languages – often to recount some heroic
      events or the life of a famous individual such as El Cid. These were now written in various
      vernaculars and became sources of enjoyment, models for heroic behaviour and inspirational tales
      for knights and others.

      More vernacular was written in new styles as fables, histories, biographies and romantic poetry.
      These forms were more in demand as they were more accessible to the uneducated, reflected a
      growing national feeling, and were promoted by certain regions such as the courts of Aquitaine and
      Provence. They were linked to the oral tradition of minstrels, etc, and thus were familiar to the
      populace who created a market for more stories of this type, particularly the romantic and the heroic.
      The great expansion of education and literacy created a large number of individuals who could read
      and were anxious to acquire books and other literature for their personal enjoyment and to place in
      their libraries.

      The results may include, but not be limited to: a great increase in the demand for books which led to
      new industries of manuscript production, book binding, parchment and paper production. Private
      libraries were developed as well as book shops. Reading became an activity done for pleasure not
      merely as an official task. A great variety of books became available including encyclopedias,
      technical manuals, law texts, as well as history and biography. National identities were further
      established by the use of vernacular language, the writing of histories and tales of local heroes
      increased patriotic feelings. Vernacular languages allowed literacy to grow and made knowledge
      more accessible even to the illiterate who could listen to stories and information in their own
      language. Authors were encouraged to write and explore new genres and there was a major
      expansion of all types of information and knowledge.

24.   By what methods, and with what results, were classical ideas and knowledge transmitted from
      the Islamic world to medieval Europe?

      The methods for the transmission of classical ideas to medieval Europe may include, but not be
      limited to: the Crusades exposed many Europeans to the knowledge that had been collected and
      developed in the Islamic world. Much of this knowledge was from classical sources preserved and
      used by Muslims. Increased contact with the Byzantine Empire through the Crusades and trade
      brought classical materials that had been preserved in Constantinople to Europe. The increase of
      trade with the Islamic world, particularly from Italy, helped transmit classical materials to Italy and
      then Europe. The Spanish universities of the Islamic world were major centres for the preservation
      and study of classical knowledge. Many Christian scholars travelled to Spain to study and acquire
      these materials which had been translated into Latin by Muslim and Jewish scholars.

      The result of this transmission may include, but not be limited to: a great increase in knowledge of
      the physical world through renewed interest in science, mathematics and medicine. Classical
      philosophy encouraged a great deal of debate which challenged established religion, introduced new
      systems of thought and provided extensive materials for study in the universities, and inspired
      writers such as Thomas Aquinas who sought to integrate classical knowledge and philosophy with
      religious teaching. The twelfth century renaissance received enormous inspiration from the influx
      of classical materials. Significant advances in the understanding of the physical world resulted
      from the increase in knowledge provided by classical material.

Topic 5           Religion and the state

25.   Analyse the reasons for conflict between Church and State in the medieval world.

      Conflict between the Church and the State was endemic in the medieval period. The causes of this
      conflict may include, but not be limited to: monarchs wished to control the appointments of bishops
      and abbots in order to retain control of the lands held by the Church in their territories and to extract
      feudal dues and taxes for them. The size of church holdings made it crucial for monarchs to retain
      these revenues to support their governments, some monarchs wished to maintain legal authority
      over clergy so that they would be judged in royal courts and not be exempt from punishment, rulers
      wished to control church appointments as the Church was the major vehicle for communication to
      the populace and rulers wished to control the information going to the populace. Papal taxes and
      fees that were collected and remitted to Rome were a large drain on the economy of medieval
      countries and rulers wished to limit these payments or prevent them altogether.

      The Church opposed all of the above positions as it wished to retain its independence, it denied the
      right of lay persons to take part in the selection of church officials and refused to submit clergy to
      local laws. The Church also wished to have financial control and income from its properties for its
      own use and did not wish to have these interfered with by lay rulers. In addition, the popes claimed
      to be superior to lay rulers and in a position to judge their behaviour and, if necessary, remove them
      from office as was the case in the Investiture crisis. Rulers denied that the Pope had this authority
      as they claimed that they held their thrones from God.

26.   Assess the significance of either Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) or Dominic Guzman
      (1170–1221) for the medieval Church.

      Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153)
      The significance of Bernard of Clairvaux for the medieval Church has a number of aspects. These
      may include, but not be limited to: he was an extreme example of the asceticism admired by the
      church reform movement. As head of the Cistercian order, he attracted thousands of recruits and
      saw the number of Cistercian monasteries reach 343 in locations all over Europe. He encouraged
      and supported the foundation of the Templars and Hospitallers as models of the religious devotion
      and asceticism that he promoted.

      His ability to attract so many to the monastic life may have been a disadvantage to the Church over
      time. Many who were attracted by Bernard were not of deep faith, and the admiration of the
      monastic movement attracted generous donations, which made them wealthy and, in time, more
      worldly and open to criticism. His ability as an orator and writer, and his reputation as an ascetic
      and devout supporter of the Church made him a very powerful religious figure who often provided
      advice to popes and other church leaders. His preaching was a major encouragement to the sending
      of the Second Crusade. This was designed to recover lost territories but failed to do so.

      He was a strong orthodox defender of church doctrine and was a leading critic of the work of Peter
      Abelard that sought to question church doctrines. Through the influence of Bernard, Abelard was
      condemned as a heretic and banned from teaching. Bernard was not able to halt the influence of
      Abelard and others who sought to apply logic to church doctrines.

      Dominic Guzman (1170–1221)
      Dominic Guzman is of significance to the Church because he was the founder of the Dominican
      order. They were established as ascetic, scholarly defenders of the faith. This was crucial as the
      Church was confronting various heretical movements as well as intellectual questions about its
      doctrines from the universities and the philosophers of the twelfth century renaissance. The influx
      of Aristotelian and other classical material had created intellectual controversy, and the Church was
      in need of a method to answer these challenges.

      His model was for the monks to live in the community and work with the lay population on a
      regular basis as teachers and preachers. They were to reconnect the Church to the people. This was
      a crucial change and one that was necessary to stem the tide of disaffection that had resulted in a
      number of heresies and protest movements.

      Dominic Guzman founded the Dominicans to be an intellectual order, to act as teachers and
      lecturers in defence of the faith. They became the most important teachers at medieval universities
      along with the Franciscans. Thomas Aquinas is an example of the intellectual focus of the
      Dominicans. His work was crucial to the Church in its struggle to answer the challenges that it
      faced from the influx of new ideas. In later years, the intellectual and devotional qualities of the
      Dominicans were reasons for their selection as members of the Inquisition tasked with the
      eradication of heresy.

27.   Explain the reasons for the rise and decline of either the Kharijites or the Cathars
      (Albigensians).

      Kharijites
      The reasons for the rise of the Kharijites may include, but not be limited to: the Kharijites are
      known as “those who go out”, they were the first dissident sect of Islam. They withdrew their
      support from Caliph Ali at the Battle of Siffin because they felt he had betrayed Islamic principles.
      They disputed the method of choosing a caliph, saying that any Muslim could be caliph if he were
      truly virtuous and that anyone who was not virtuous should not be obeyed. They believed that all
      Muslims who failed to embrace their doctrines were sinners and apostates and could be killed.
      They waged war against other Muslims in support of their doctrine. They believed that one must
      demonstrate one’s strict adherence to the principles of Islam and not merely declare them. They
      attracted support from non-Arab Muslims who felt discriminated against, and from those who felt
      that the leaders of Islam had become corrupt and were not following the faith.

      The decline of the Kharijites occurred after Ali launched a major campaign to crush them in 661.
      They were further suppressed under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties but were not exterminated
      and continued to exist and exert some influence in North Africa and Arabia.

      Cathars (Albigensians)
      The reasons for the rise of the Cathars (Albigensians) may include, but not be limited to: they were
      individuals who found church practices corrupt and not following the ways of the scriptures and the
      true Church of early Christianity. The wealth and luxury of the Church, and its increasing distance
      from the common people encouraged unrest and the formation of dissident or heretical groups. The
      Cathars (Albigensians) existed at a time when other groups such as the Humiliati and the
      Waldensians had been formed to protest against the corruption in the Church. The Cathars
      (Albigensians) were the most extreme in their beliefs, and varied to the greatest degree from
      Catholic doctrine. Their views of poverty and a pure life attracted many, as did their respect for
      women and the moral uprightness of their leaders. Their movement grew in southern France where
      the Church was poorly administered and the political authorities weak. This allowed them to
      preach and live openly and attract more adherents. A general feeling of anti-clericalism also
      brought people to their cause. It was also suggested that there was a financial motive, as joining the
      movement allowed one to refuse to pay tithes and seize church lands.

      The reasons for the fall of the movement may include, but not be limited to: the Cathars
      (Albigensians) were crushed as the result of a crusade launched against them by Innocent III. The
      Cathars were defeated in 1213. Subsequently, their members were pursued by the Inquisition and
      many were burnt at the stake. Another reason for their suppression was the work of the Franciscan
      and Dominican orders who sought to bring back many to the Church through their example of
      poverty and devotion, and their life and work amongst the common people. The Cathar movement
      lived on in the south of France in secret for a few years but ultimately was exterminated.

28.   For what reasons, and with what results, was Sunni Orthodoxy established?

      The reasons for the establishment of the Sunni Orthodoxy may include, but not be limited to: the
      question of the succession after the death of Muhammad was a source of dissension and conflict for
      a few decades after his death. How should caliphs be chosen, what authority should they have, and
      could they be deposed?

      Sunni Muslims were drawn together by political factors. Their religion was experienced in a form
      decided by the community which affected one’s piety. Sunni Muslims revered Muhammad and
      accepted the first four caliphs as rightly guided. The unity of the community was a sacred value. It
      was crucial to accept the views of the majority and follow the tribal and community consensus. The
      unity of the community was considered an important religious and social value. The original
      converts to Islam had strong community values as tribal societies and this approach attracted them
      to this view. These principles were useful in establishing the succession to the caliphate and the
      various dynasties which ruled the empire. They defended the Sunni view against those of the other
      sects who disputed the succession. The majority of Muslims accepted the Sunni view.

      The results of the establishment of Sunni Orthodoxy may include, but not be limited to: conflict
      continued to exist in the Islamic world as those who rejected Sunni values and leadership engaged
      in rebellion against them, the Ismailis of the Fatimid Empire being an example. Conflict was never
      absent from the Islamic world as sectarian differences were not erased and led to periodic outbreaks
      of violence and rebellion. Sunni Orthodoxy did provide stability to the Islamic world as it was the
      path taken by the ruling dynasties such as the Seljuks and Ottomans, amongst others. It was a
      flexible system of belief which could be modified to accommodate changes in attitudes such as the
      rise of Sufism.

29.   Assess the origins and the significance of Sufi orders in the Islamic world.

      The explanation for the origins of the Sufi movement may include, but not be limited to: Sufism
      may be seen as a reaction to the institutionalization and formalization of Islam through the rules of
      jurisprudence and the schools of law. Sufis were seeking the possibility of further revelations and
      wished to open the spirit to new influences and to recognize other religious traditions that supported
      values of love and a search for truth. Sufis were seeking a closer, more intimate union with God
      which transcended legalistic interpretations of the faith. Sufis were mystics seeking truth and
      understanding through rituals, chanting, fasting and vigils in a search for inner illumination.

      The significance of the Sufi orders may include, but not be limited to: the Sufis who had been
      persecuted by the Abbasids were reconciled with Sunni Islam by the work of al-Ghazali who
      created a compromise between mysticism and orthodoxy. This allowed the Turkish and Mongol
      tribes, who had strong attachments to Sufism, to be reconciled with Sunni Orthodoxy. Both Sufis
      and Sunnis supported the same doctrines, although in different ways. This unified and strengthened
      many of the Islamic ruling dynasties. Sufism also provided an esoteric and spiritual quality to the
      legalism of Sunni Islam, which was very attractive to many of its followers. It was a great force for
      religious sentiment and loyalty. It also had a strong influence in literature and poetry.

30.   Assess the reasons for, and the success of, the attempts by either Gregory VII (1073–85) or
      Innocent III (1198–1216) to expand their religious and temporal authority.

      Gregory VII (1073–85)
      The reasons for Gregory VII seeking to extend his religious and temporal authority may include,
      but not be limited to: he was determined to continue the movement for church reform and saw an
      increase in the authority of the Papacy as a means to force the clergy to obey the new rules. He
      wished to establish the Pope as having full control of all Christians and able to correct the
      unrighteous as a means of maintaining the moral purity of the Church. He also wished to extend his
      religious authority in order to gain control of the appointment of bishops and other prelates, and to
      maintain the independence of the Papacy from powerful political forces. This was key to the
      maintenance of an independent church as well as the protection of church revenues, lands and other
      possessions.

      He sought to expand his temporal authority to give him power over lay rulers. He could remove
      those who failed to follow his instructions or whose behaviour was judged disobedient, heretical or
      perverse. This extension of his power into the temporal area made him the supreme ruler, and he
      protected the Church from incursions or mistreatment at the hands of lay rulers.

      The results of his attempts to expand authority may include, but not be limited to: the Investiture
      crisis, in which the Pope was in conflict with the Holy Roman Emperor. The result of Gregory’s
      struggles was the acceptance of the superiority of Church over the state, the end of lay investiture as
      agreed at the Concordat of Worms in 1122, and a further strengthening of church reform. The
      power of the Papacy had been asserted and would now be continued by other popes and play a key
      role in the medieval period.

      Innocent III (1198–1216)
      Innocent III’s motives were similar to those of Gregory VII on the religious front. He wished to
      continue to assert the power of the Papacy to control all aspects of the Church and enforce standards
      of behaviour on the clergy and all Christians. By asserting his right to dictate behaviour to
      monarchs, he could protect the independence of the Church, control the appointment of officials and
      maintain the independence of the Papacy. Monarchs were constantly seeking to limit the power of
      the Church or to control its activities within their borders. Innocent was determined to resist this
      tendency by asserting his right to punish those who failed to follow his directions. He asserted the
      right to use excommunication and interdict to support his goals.

      The results of his actions may include, but not be limited to: he was able to intervene in the election
      of the Holy Roman Emperor where both sides sought his support; he asserted his prerogative to
      crown the Emperor and asserted that the Holy Roman Empire was in fact a possession of the
      Papacy. He forced King John of England to submit to him in a dispute over the election of the
      Archbishop of Canterbury – he also intervened in Portugal, Spain and Norway to protect church
      interests against the monarchs. He successfully asserted the doctrine that his power extended over
      all temporal rulers. He was however, less successful in asserting authority over powerful and
      popular rulers such as Philip II of France. This would indicate that his powers were limited and that
      strife would arise if popes opposed a powerful ruler. This principle would continue to play a part in
      medieval politics for several centuries as the Papacy asserted its right to interfere in the affairs of
      individual countries and hear appeals against the behaviour of rulers.
