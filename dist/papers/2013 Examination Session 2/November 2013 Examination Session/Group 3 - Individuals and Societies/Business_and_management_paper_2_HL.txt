                                              SECTION A

Answer one question from this section.

1.    Scoot Fun (SF)

      Scoot Fun (SF) is a family-owned private limited company specializing in scooter rentals to a student
      market segment. Most of the scooters will need replacement in January 2014. SF will purchase
      20 new scooters at a total cost of $80 000. They are expected to have a useful life of four years and
      the total residual value (scrap value) of the 20 scooters is estimated at $4000.

      SF’s Finance Manager currently uses a straight line method of depreciation, but she has now decided
      to adopt a reducing balance method of depreciation. However, she is still considering the percentage
      rate at which the assets (scooters) should be depreciated. The Finance Manager is also looking for
      various sources of finance for the purchase of the new scooters.

      SF’s shareholders would like to receive higher dividends in the coming year. One way to do this is to
      find a legal way to reduce SF’s tax expense in the coming year.


      (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of a private limited company.            [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain two appropriate sources of finance that SF could use to purchase the
            20 new scooters.                                                                     [4 marks]

      (c)   (i)   Using the straight line method of depreciation, calculate the depreciation
                  for each year and the book value (value of scooters less depreciation) of
                  the 20 new scooters at the end of each year of their expected useful life
                  (four years) (show all your working).                                          [4 marks]

		(ii)            Using the reducing balance method of depreciation, calculate the
                  depreciation for each year and the book value (value of scooters less
                  depreciation) of the 20 new scooters at the end of each year of their
                  expected useful life (four years). Use a 40 % depreciation rate (show all
                  your working).                                                                 [4 marks]

		(iii) Explain one consequence of the Finance Manager’s decision regarding the
        percentage rate at which the assets should be depreciated.                               [3 marks]

      (d)   Examine the decision of SF’s Finance Manager to change the depreciation
            method from straight line to reducing balance.                                       [6 marks]

2.     Crisis management and Mapa


                                                Image removed for copyright reasons

       The Portuguese company Mapa manufactures a handheld global positioning system (GPS)*
       device. In the winter of 2012, Mapa received reports that its GPS devices often failed in extremely
       cold weather. According to the media, the problem first appeared in 2011, when mountain climbers
       with the Mapa GPS devices discovered inaccuracies in the coordinates the devices provided.
       Rumours of the GPS failure began to circulate in the climbing community. Then, after several
       accidents in the mountains, including fatalities, television news programmes began to report the
       problem. Only then did Mapa begin to take action.

       Engineers concluded that the problem resulted from where and when the quality testing was
       being performed. The production of a component part outsourced to a company in Iceland was being
       quality tested in Portugal in the summer. There was also poor communication between the producer
       of the component part and Mapa because of differences in language and culture.

       Mapa’s tall organizational structure, bureaucracy (and bureaucratic corporate culture) and centralized
       decision making meant that no manager acted until the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) formally
       apologized. As a result, Mapa had taken too long to admit that there was a problem and so consumer
       confidence fell and Mapa’s reputation suffered.

       The production process of the GPS device is shown in the table below:

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Recruiting a new CEO

      A company can spend a large amount of money to recruit a well-known and successful Chief
      Executive Officer (CEO) from outside the organization. However, recently published research
      suggests that recruiting externally is not only costly, but it is also risky, disruptive and demotivating.

      Two long-term studies of 36 large public limited American companies found the following:
      yy The companies that promoted CEOs internally performed better than those that recruited externally.
      yy “Outsider” CEOs (recruited externally) have a significantly higher failure rate than “insider” CEOs
         (recruited internally). 40 % of “outsider” CEOs stayed for two years or less.
      yy The average financial reward package for “outsider” CEOs, including salary, bonuses and
         profit-related incentives, was 65 % higher than for those appointed internally.
      yy “Outsider” CEOs feel empowered to impose rapid change and to assert their authority on the
         company, even before they really understand the organizational culture. The arrival of an
         “outsider” CEO is often quickly followed by the departure of senior managers.
      yy “Outsider” CEOs are very good at rapid cost-cutting and eliminating unprofitable products/
         activities, a skill that is very valuable when a competitive advantage needs to be gained or restored
         in a competitive environment.

      Apple, Dell™, Microsoft®, Intel®, McDonalds® and Nike® are successful American companies that
      appointed CEOs internally between 1998 and 2007.

      A comparison of average performance indicators between 1998 and 2007 is shown below:

                                                                      Companies led by               Companies led by
                                                                      an “insider” CEO              an “outsider” CEO
                  Return on capital employed (ROCE)                        20.3 %                        15.8 %
                  Revenue growth                                           11.9 %                         4.4 %
                  Earnings per share                                       13.9 %                         4.6 %
                  Net profit margin                                         7.9 %                         6.0 %

      Some critics of the two American studies argue that companies promoting CEOs internally usually
      have a strong corporate culture and are already efficient and profitable. These critics also argue that
      the performance indicators in the table do not measure the exact contribution of individual CEOs.

4.      Predicting the future

        Traditional secondary research to identify trends, to forecast and to provide data about seasonal and
        cyclical variation is increasingly outdated, particularly as many products are sold through e-commerce.

        Today online forecasting is becoming popular. Google™’s chief economist has found a correlation
        between sales of products (such as cars and holidays) and levels of online Google™ searches for
        information about those products.

        To make market predictions, market researchers are increasingly using social media* to collect online
        messages in order to understand consumers’ moods. They use web-based data to build a “real time”
        measure of consumer emotions and preferences and then use the results for predicting consumers’
        behaviour. Some companies such as Coca Cola®, Starbucks® and Disney already use social media
        for online market research.

        Dr Bollen of Indiana University, United States, found that:
        yy Twitter users’ collective mood changes coincide with national events.
        yy A correlation exists between trends in national mood (expressed in millions of Twitter messages)
           and changes in share prices. Three days after an increase in anxiety levels, share prices tend to fall
           (although it is unclear why this happens).
        yy Investors use social media to guide their decisions.

        Users of social media share information online about feelings and purchasing intentions. They are
        unconcerned by market researchers using software such as “Wise Window” to follow them constantly
        in order to forecast demand.

        Technologically advanced software can recognize sarcasm, double meanings and cultural references.
        However, interpreting slang expressions remains a challenge.

        Mr Watts, an Internet researcher at Yahoo!®, said that to be useful, a forecasting technique must add
        something new to what is already known. The use of social media will only add value to forecasting
        if other sources of information are limited. He warned that sophisticated methods based on the
        analysis of Twitter messages, blog postings or Facebook® pages have limitations.

5.    Kodak

      Kodak, after decades as the leading American camera and photography company, went bankrupt
      in 2012. Despite its large research and development (R&D) budget, Kodak concentrated on products
      related to its film-processing business, a market that Kodak had long dominated. However, digital
      technology had changed photography dramatically, and Kodak, unlike its competitors, failed to
      innovate.

      At least three times, Kodak misunderstood consumer desire to interact with photos and the external
      environment:
      yy Digital cameras – In 1975, Kodak invented the first digital camera but did not sufficiently develop
         this technology. Its cameras were always perceived as satisfactory products, but “nothing special”.
         Competitors innovated with features such as face-and-smile detection. Kodak only followed
         trends, never led them.
      yy Photo viewing – In 2002, Kodak entered the market of low growth, small margin products, such
         as digital photo frames. Kodak’s products did not have a unique selling point (USP) and were
         unsuccessful.
      yy Photo sharing – In 2005, Kodak developed the first WiFi camera, but sales were disappointing.
         Shortly thereafter, a new business opened, Eye-Fi, which proved Kodak wrong about WiFi.
         Eye-Fi created a successful business based on WiFi memory cards for cameras – the concept that
         Kodak had abandoned and not patented.

      The conclusions from Kodak’s bankruptcy are clear:
      yy “Cannibalism” – do not be afraid to develop a new technologically advanced product even if it
         causes the decline of your existing products.
      yy Innovation – do not be afraid to take risks. Kodak’s inability to give any of its digital products a
         USP shows its failure to take advantage of inventions. Innovation also requires strategic vision.
      yy New product design – do not be afraid if sales do not happen immediately. Kodak withdrew its
         WiFi cameras simply because the first model sold poorly.

      As the evidence shows, not taking risks in new inventions will reduce profit margins in the
      long run. Small, innovative business start-ups such as Canon can often successfully penetrate markets
      dominated by big companies unless those companies use their resources to keep up-to-date.
