Answer one question from this section.

1.    Belluno Frames (BF)

                                   Belluno Frames (BF) manufactures high-quality frames for glasses
       Image removed for copyright (spectacles). Like many other firms in the private sector in northern
                reasons            Italy, the business is small, family-owned, and operates as a private
                                     limited company. Giovanni and Elda Rizzo own 100 % of the shares,
      which their son Antonio will inherit. Giovanni designs the frames. Antonio and two employees
      produce them. Elda is responsible for the administration.

      BF is located in a building that Giovanni and Elda own, near their house, 42 kilometres outside
      of Belluno. Antonio and the two employees live in the same village as BF. The road to Belluno
      is narrow, with traffic that moves very slowly because of farm vehicles. Antonio, who wants the
      business to grow, has asked his father to rent a building in the industrial park in Belluno with good
      road access. BF’s new location would be closer to suppliers and customers. It would also improve
      BF’s visibility.

      Currently, BF sells on average 1300 frames per month. Each frame is sold at an average price of €24.
      Below are the costs (all figures in €) for BF at its current location and if it moved to the industrial park
      in Belluno.

      Monthly fixed costs:

                                                     Industrial park
                                    Current location (new location)
       Insurance                         400               400
       Rent                                 0            2200
       Salaries (Giovanni and Elda)     3600             3800
       Other employees’ salaries        3600             3900
       Lease on equipment               1400             1400

      Variable costs per frame:

                                                         Industrial park
                                        Current location (new location)
       Material                               14              13.5
       Delivery costs                           1               0.1

      Antonio believes that BF’s sales will grow on average to 1700 frames per month in the new location.
      To reach that level, Antonio suggests that BF offer extra financial rewards in addition to their usual
      salaries to employees after 1300 frames have been sold each month (the current monthly average).
      Giovanni and Elda are reluctant.

                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

		          (ii)   the margin of safety.                                                       [2 marks]

2.    Nha Trang Bicycles (NTB)

      Chinh Pham offers daily rentals of bicycles at the seaside resort of Nha Trang in Vietnam. He
      operates as a sole trader under the name Nha Trang Bicycles (NTB). The business rents mostly
      to young tourists, who enjoy riding bicycles on the roads that run alongside the beautiful beaches.
      Many other businesses in the area also offer bicycle rental. Because of the intense competition, the
      price of renting a bicycle is low.

      In addition to offering bicycle rental, NTB is considering two options:
       Option 1: offer motorcycle rental. Total initial cost to purchase 10 motorcycles: $120 000.
       Option 2: offer car rental. Total initial cost to purchase 5 cars: $110 000.

      The following shows the expected total net income from both options (all figures in $000s):

                    Year 1    Year 2    Year 3     Year 4    Year 5     Year 6
       Option 1       40        40        40         40        40         40
       Option 2       27        35        35         35        35         35

      The motorcycles would typically be rented by young tourists on a daily basis. The cars would be
      rented for longer periods (one week on average) by older customers with families. Chinh has no
      experience with this market segment. A concern for Chinh is the impact that the increased scale of
      operation will have on his ability to manage the business. A local pressure group argues that cars
      will harm the environment. Another concern is that motorcycles are very noisy and would disturb the
      quiet, peaceful feel of the seaside resort.


      (a)   Describe two appropriate sources of finance for NTB to acquire the
            5 cars (Option 2).                                                                  [4 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Calculate for Option 1, the payback period and the average rate of
                   return (ARR) (show all your working).                                        [4 marks]

		          (ii)   Calculate for Option 2, the payback period and the average rate of
                   return (ARR) (show all your working).                                        [4 marks]

      (c)   Comment on your results to part (b).                                                [3 marks]

      (d)   Analyse whether NTB should purchase the 10 motorcycles (Option 1) or the
            5 cars (Option 2).                                                                  [5 marks]

                                               SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Anigam

      Anigam is one of the biggest multinational companies operating in the animal drugs industry.
      In many countries, Anigam is well known for its promotional campaigns. It uses both above the line
      and below the line promotion.

      Anigam has a portfolio of animal drugs at different stages of their product life cycle:
      	Anitox is the first animal drug that Anigam developed and sold. It is a business-to-business (B2B)
         product used in veterinary clinics worldwide. Anitox has a high 25 % share of the global market.
         That figure has been stable for the last 10 years. Anitox is a well-established product in a market
         that is saturated and growing very slowly.
      	A range of animal drugs was launched four years ago. One of them, Anisan, helps prevent
         heart attacks in aging animals; it already has a high 15 % share of a rapidly growing market.
         Some other animal drugs, however, are not performing as well: for example, Aniplus, which is
         designed to strengthen animals’ immune systems against the flu and other contagious diseases.
         The market for products such as Aniplus is growing rapidly, but it is very competitive.
      	Last year, Anigam launched a new drug called Anislim which helps to reduce obesity in
         domestic animals. Thanks to significant introductory marketing efforts and an appropriate
         promotional mix, the first sales results were good. It is, however, too early to forecast whether
         present sales for Anislim will be maintained.



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

4.    Zeitim

      Zeitim is a chain of vegetarian fast food restaurants. Since the opening of its first restaurant in 1999,
      the restaurants have multiplied through franchising in the Middle East and around the Mediterranean
      Sea. More recently they have expanded into Asia, where they are becoming even more popular than
      McDonald’s®. The first American Zeitim will open next month. The size of a Zeitim restaurant varies
      from a small branch that mainly serves takeaway food, to large ones with over 200 seats. There is
      even a “mega-Zeitim” in Bangalore, India, with 800 seats. Zeitim restaurants are not only located in
      high streets (downtowns) and shopping areas, but also in business districts, train stations and airports.

      Zeitim’s unique selling proposition (USP) is serving only vegetarian food, unlike other restaurant
      chains that may have vegetarian dishes but mainly serve meat-based products. Zeitim’s other marketing
      aspects (such as price, promotion and physical evidence) are not much different to its competitors.

      According to Alejtin Berisha, Director of Operations, Zeitim has been successful due to a combination
      of three factors:
      	its use of flow production, ensuring quick preparation and service, which is essential for a fast
         food restaurant
      	its original branding, based on the use of the letter z, for example “Zeitim Zalads”, “Zeitim
          Zandwiches” and even branded drinks such as the “Zeitim Zmoothy”
      	its franchise system, which made it easy to spread the brand name quickly, ensuring a high level
          of brand awareness, even amongst people who have not eaten there yet.


      (a)   Describe flow production in the context of a fast food restaurant such as Zeitim.       [2 marks]

      (b)   With reference to Zeitim and other organizations of your choice, explain three
            ways in which businesses can differentiate their products from their competitors’.      [6 marks]

      (c)   Examine how branding may have contributed to the success of Zeitim restaurants.         [5 marks]

      (d)   With reference to Zeitim and one other organization of your choice, discuss the
            use of franchising as a growth strategy.                                                [7 marks]

5.     All the World is a Village (WV)

       All the World is a Village (WV) sells artisanal* products from many developing countries. Based
       in Appleton, Wisconsin, United States (US), WV is a non-profit organization founded in 1972 by
       Yvonne Osheim. During a month’s stay in Peru, she had seen numerous beautiful products made by
       Peruvian artisans. Fearing that their skills would be lost, she opened a retail shop selling artisanal
       products from Peru. In the 1980s, she also started importing and selling products from other
       developing countries.

       WV’s vision statement is: “Making the world a village by supporting local artisans”. Today, 297 shops,
       under the name “All the World is a Village”, operate throughout the US. Some shops are owned by
       WV itself and trade on a non-profit basis. Others are profit-based franchises whose owners agree to
       limit their salaries and dividends. This way, WV can follow its mission statement: “To help artisans
       in developing countries to earn fair incomes by using traditional skills in an environmentally friendly
       manner”. The company’s principles are: fair prices, fair credit, long-term commitment, working
       together, and sustainable development.

       Since the 2007 global economic recession, WV has faced several challenges. Turnover at almost
       all of the shops has declined significantly. Despite the franchise agreement, some franchises have
       begun to sell products manufactured inexpensively in large factories in Asia. These franchise owners
       claim that without the imported products, they would have to close their shops. In addition, in order
       to cut costs, many artisans in developing countries have started to use non-environmentally friendly
       materials in their products.

*	artisanal: high-quality, typically handmade products. These products are generally made in small quantities using
   traditional methods.



       (a)     Define the term dividends.                                                                              [2 marks]

       (b)     Explain the advantages for WV of operating both non-profit and profit-based
               shops.                                                                                                  [6 marks]

       (d)     Discuss whether Yvonne should allow artisans to use “non-environmentally
               friendly materials in their products” to cut costs.                                                     [7 marks]
