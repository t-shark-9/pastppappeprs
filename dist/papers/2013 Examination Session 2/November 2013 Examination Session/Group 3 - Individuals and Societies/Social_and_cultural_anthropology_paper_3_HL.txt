Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools of
thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations.
Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Compare and contrast a post-1960s anthropological school of thought with an earlier one.


2.    Examine the role of agency in one of the following schools of thought:

      • feminism
      • political economy
      • structural functionalism.


3.    Discuss the relevance of one or more of the following to the understanding of a social issue:

      • structure-centred perspective
      • conflict-centred perspective
      • diachronic perspective.


4.    Contrast the role of either particularistic or universalistic perspectives in two schools of thought.


5.    Examine why one ethnographer adopts either a materialist or an idealist perspective.
