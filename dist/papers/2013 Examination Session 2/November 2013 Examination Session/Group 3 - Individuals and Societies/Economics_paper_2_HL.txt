                                         Bolivia reacts to global economic change

           During the twentieth century, Bolivia experienced deteriorating terms of trade due to
            declines in prices of commodity exports on which the economy was highly dependent.
            Bolivia diversified its exports, but has remained highly dependent on commodity exports.
            These include natural gas, which accounts for nearly 40 % of export earnings and also silver
            and zinc.

           Bolivia succeeded in avoiding recession during the global economic downturn in 2009,
            though its rate of growth was affected by lower demand for natural gas from Brazil and lower
            prices for its key export products. Growth began again in 2010 due to the recovery of commodity
            prices and the global economy (Figure 1).

           Strong inflationary pressures have appeared with the recovery, partly due to the removal of
            fuel subsidies. A key government policy objective is to hold down inflation and imported
            input costs. About 80 % of Bolivia’s imports are used by the manufacturing sector in
            various industries. Since late 2010 the government has adopted a managed float to achieve
            appreciation of the Bolivian Boliviano (the Bolivian currency).

           Bolivia’s current account surplus reached a maximum in 2008–2009 (Figure 2) due to the
            recovery of commodity prices, which led to an improvement in its terms of trade (Figure 3).
            The resulting decrease in the surplus is due to a more rapid rise in imports than in exports.
            The current account surpluses have led to large increases in international reserves
            (reserve assets).

                                                     Japan fights recession

           Following statements by the Japanese Finance Minister that the yen was “strongly overvalued”,
            Japan intervened in the yen market by buying US dollars, one day after the Swiss central bank
            cut interest rates to lower the value of the Swiss franc. These moves risked criticism that Japan
            and Switzerland may be initiating currency wars, involving competitive depreciations.

           The Japanese intervention was the third in a year. The first intervention, nine months earlier,
            aimed to improve business confidence. It was criticized by United States officials, who
            argued that Japan was seeking to gain unfair trade advantages by undervaluing the yen.
            In the past, Japan has been accused of using other forms of trade protection to gain an advantage
            in international markets.

           The Japanese economy has been suffering a long-lasting recession, deepened by an earthquake,
            tsunami and nuclear crisis in spring 2011. It faces deflation which is currently –0.9 %, yet there
            is little room for action by the central bank as interest rates have fallen to zero.

           Japan has a current account surplus, which has increased pressure for the yen to rise.
            The rising yen was unwelcome because Japan is strongly export-oriented. Large exporters
            like Toyota, Honda and Nissan have complained about lower export earnings, which already
            had been negatively affected by the global recession and a rise in trade protection in their
            export markets. A strong yen also works to increase the downward pressure on the general
            price level.

           In view of Japan’s excessive dependence on exports, some analysts note that the economy must
            restructure to depend more on domestic consumption.

Answer one question from this section.

3.       Study the extract below and answer the questions that follow.


                         Chinese and Indian foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa

           The high growth experienced by many African countries has made them attractive to
            multinational corporations (MNCs), originating in China and India, which seek to expand and
            diversify their sources of energy and raw materials. In recent years, MNCs have begun to
            rapidly diversify into other sectors beyond oil and minerals.

           Chinese and Indian MNCs differ in their approaches. Most Chinese MNCs are large
            government-owned firms. They usually enter new markets by building their own new facilities,
            and buy most of their inputs or sell their output through their own branches. They buy a
            large portion of their inputs from China, and usually do not hire local managers and workers.
            Most sales in Africa are made to government bodies. Chinese MNCs tend to be focused on
            resource extraction.

           Indian MNCs are of varying size, and are mostly privately-owned. They usually enter
            markets by buying local, established businesses, and they buy far fewer of their inputs in
            Indian markets, preferring increasingly to buy them in other international markets. They often
            hire and train local managers and staff. Most sales in Africa are made to private firms rather
            than government bodies. Indian MNCs are expanding into telecommunication technologies,
            information technologies, education and health services and are encouraging diversification.

           Rapid economic growth in China, India and Africa, together with Chinese and Indian
            foreign direct investment (FDI), have strongly encouraged trade links between them.
            Africa’s bilateral trade with India increased from $1 billion in 2001 to $46 billion in 2010.
            Africa’s bilateral trade with China was $120 billion in 2010.

           Yet there are worries. Both Chinese and Indian MNCs have been accused of ignoring human
            rights violations and corruption by the government in countries they operate in. In some cases
            they have not been required to follow environmental laws.

                                       Economic growth and poverty in India

           Although India has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it is unlikely that
            the Millennium Development Goal of halving the rate of poverty by 2015 will be achieved.
            An important factor is growing income inequality. Calculations of Gini coefficients
            show that inequality increased by about 14 % between 2001 and 2011.

           India has about one third of the world’s population living in extreme poverty (living on less than
            $1.25 a day). Three quarters of its population live in moderate poverty (less than $2 a day).
            It is estimated that nearly half the Indian population suffers from malnutrition. Part of India’s
            poverty problem is a result of poor governance and failure to address the underlying causes
            of poverty.

           Growth averaged 8.6 % per year in the years 2005–2011 compared with the 10 % needed over
            20 years to lift the poor out of their poverty. The central bank governor says that the lack of
            steps to improve the supply-side of the economy will make it difficult for India to maintain its
            high growth rates.

           The Indian Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen argues that economic growth should not be
            “our ultimate objective, but a very useful means to achieve … a better quality of life”.
