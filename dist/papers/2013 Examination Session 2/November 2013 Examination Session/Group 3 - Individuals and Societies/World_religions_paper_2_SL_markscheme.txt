                                              SECTION A

Hinduism

1.   Justify the argument that Bhakti is central to Hindu understandings of religious experience.

     Candidates should be aware of the place of Bhakti in everyday Hindu religious life.
     Successful candidates would also be aware of the historical origins and development of Bhakti and
     the meaning of the term, especially in relation to religious experience. They could also consider the
     revolutionary aspect of Bhakti and its role in undermining Brahmin hegemony and democratizing
     Hindu religious life (women, low castes etc). Candidates would be aware of how various aspects
     of Bhakti (darshan, murti worship, Guru veneration etc) are now incorporated into normative Hindu
     practices and popular culture. Successful candidates would be aware of other alternatives to
     religious experience, for example, Yoga schools, Advaita Vedanta, Mimamsa, and how these
     provide alternatives to Bhakti dominated relationships with God/gods.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


2.   To what extent is the ideal of varnashramadharma essential to Hindu understandings of
     right action?

     Candidates should be aware of varnashramadharma and its significance in Hindu understandings of
     the appropriate life cycle behaviour and the successful adherence to dharma. They would also be
     aware of the centrality of dharma to Hindu understandings of right action. Successful candidates
     would develop an answer that indicates their awareness that very few Hindus in recent history or
     even historically have carried out completion of the stages of life as in the ashrama ideal.
     They would show awareness of pragmatic negotiation of the ashramas. In addition they would
     be aware that the ideal of varnashramadharma is part and parcel of high Varna classical
     Hindu tradition, sometimes known as “Brahmanism”. Other examples of how Hindus understand
     right action, for example, universal ethical behaviour, caste rules (jati dharma), and Hindu religious
     practices can be used to counter the argument of the essentiality of varnashramadharma.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Buddhism

3.   Compare and contrast the composition and compilation of the Theravada and Mahayana
     sacred texts.

     Students must cite both similarities and differences between the composition and compilation of the
     Theravada and Mahayana sacred texts, and demonstrate an ability to compare and contrast these.
     Students who concentrate only on compare or only on contrast should not move beyond band C.

     Compare
     • Both Theravada and Mahayana sacred texts are considered by believers to be the Word of
       the Buddha.
     • Both show the Buddha teaching his followers in different contexts.
     • Both give teachings that relate to the Noble Eightfold Path and the Three Marks of Existence.
     • Both were compiled by monks.
     • Both are internally diverse in terms of their form, for example both contain narratives,
       poetry and philosophy.
     • Both speak of different planes into which the human can be born, including heavens and hells.

     Contrast
     • The Theravada texts were eventually compiled by monks into a fixed canon of texts called
       the Tipitaka (three baskets), which contains the Vinaya Pitaka, the Sutta Pitaka and
       the Abhidhamma Pitaka. In contrast, the Mahayana texts were not formed into a fixed canon.
       Mahayana texts are numerous and diverse and include the Prajnaparamita literature,
       the Diamond and Heart Sutras and the Lotus Sutra.
     • The Theravada texts were transmitted and eventually written down in the Pali language.
       Many Mahayana texts were originally written in Sanskrit and were then translated into Tibetan
       and Chinese as Buddhism spread to these countries. Some can only be accessed now in their
       Tibetan or Chinese forms.
     • Most of the Theravada texts concentrate on the historical Buddha, Gautama. The Mahayana
       texts recognize many Buddhas and bodhisattvas.
     • Historically speaking, the Theravada texts can be traced back to the Buddha though
       oral transmission. The Mahayana texts emerged after the historical Buddha died.

4.   Discuss the meaning and significance of the Three Marks of Existence (anicca, dukkha
     and anatta) for Buddhists.

     Students who concentrate only on the meaning or only on the significance should not move
     beyond D.

     Meaning
     Anicca literally means “impermanence”. Everything in samsara is impermanent. It rises and falls,
     according to the law of dependent origination.

     Dukkha is a difficult term to translate but is usually translated as suffering, pain or
     unsatisfactoriness. There is something unsatisfactory at the heart of existence that is linked to
     impermanence. We are born only to grow old and die. We lose those we love. Each pleasure ends.

     Anatta is usually translated as non-self. It means that everything in the human person
     is impermanent. No unchanging soul or self can be identified. There is no permanent “I” within
     the human person to cling to or promote.

     Significance
     Students should show awareness both that these three marks of existence lie at the core of the
     Buddhist view of life within samsara, and that an understanding of them is essential if a Buddhist is
     to reach enlightenment or nirvana. An understanding of anicca helps a person to reduce craving for
     such things as possessions, power and status. If things do not last, there is no point in craving
     for them. An understanding of dukkha helps a person to see that there is a problem with human
     existence and to pursue the Buddhist path diligently. Some students may point out that dukkha is
     the first of the Four Noble Truths and that it is a Truth that must be understood if Noble Eightfold
     Path is to be followed. An understanding of anatta also helps a person to eradicate craving. If there
     is no permanent self, no “I”, then there is no need to act selfishly. A person is freed to act
     compassionately for the good of others, without relating everything to the self.

Sikhism

5.   To what extent is the Sikh view of marriage undermined by contemporary social values?

     Candidates should show awareness of the Sikh ethics and morals concerning marriage, with regard
     to the special religious teachings concerning marriage in Sikhism. Candidates should be aware of
     the sacred character of marriage and family life in the Guru Granth Sahib. The first Sikh Gurus
     challenged the Hindu ideal of renunciation, arguing that liberation was open to all,
     including women. Marriage partners and family life were perceived as pre-ordained in the
     teachings of the Gurus. Candidates should be aware that marriage is regarded as a sacred institution
     in which one develops spiritually as opposed to a social contract. Candidates should be aware of
     the implications of separation or divorce on a God-ordained sacred contract. For example, the Sikh
     ideal of a devoted relationship that is God-orientated is undermined. Good candidates would be
     aware of the teachings of the Gurus on adultery, and its relationship to the Sikh concept
     of manmukh. Candidates would be aware of how traditional arranged marriages are reinforced
     through Sikh religious values as well as cultural values. For the second part of the argument,
     candidates should be aware of the challenge to arranged marriages by the younger generation, rising
     divorce rates, increasing financial independence of Sikh women and the quest for individual
     fulfilment in younger generations.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


6.   To what extent can it be argued that nam simran is central to Sikh religious experience?

     Candidates would be aware of the centrality of nam simran in the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and
     be able to enunciate the Gurus’ understanding that the practice was not ritual but experiential,
     leading to an inner transformation in which the presence of God in the human being was felt as an
     awareness of intimacy or even union. However, it might be argued that the institutionalization of
     Sikhism has undermined the focus on experience and developed other dimensions of religion
     (pilgrimage, religious ritual, doctrines etc). Alternatively it could be argued that these
     developments of the dimensions of religion provide alternative possibilities for religious experience
     alongside nam simran or even replace it as the primary location of experience. Advanced students
     would be aware of the unease among some Sikhs that the original teachings of the Gurus have been
     undermined by the development of an institutional Sikh religion and how this had led to sectarian
     breakaways or reforms.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

Open-ended question

7.   Examine the extent to which ritual is important for the lay person in one religion,
     either Buddhism or Hinduism or Sikhism, citing at least one example of a ritual that is
     performed daily and a ritual that is performed at a particular time or times in the year.

     Students should state clearly which religion they have chosen and the significance of ritual to
     that religion. They also need to state which rituals they are going to focus on. With reference to
     this religion, they should demonstrate awareness that ritual is an essential part of the life of
     lay Hindus, Buddhists or Sikhs, that faith and belief are expressed through ritual, and that ritual
     reinforces and develops family and community identity. Students might also stress that it provides
     structure and meaning for the day or the year, and can mark events in the life of the individual and
     the community.

     When examining the extent to which ritual is important, students should point out that ritual is only
     one aspect of lay life in their chosen religion. It is not enough on its own. Striving to live a life that
     transcends selfishness, that is moral and that fulfils duties to family members and society is
     also important.

     Hinduism
     Students should show that they are aware of the diversity of practices within Hinduism.
     Daily rituals that a lay person might perform include: using light, incense, food and flowers to show
     devotion to a deity in their homes or in a temple (puja and arti); chanting mantras or singing
     devotional songs. Rituals that occur at one point in the year could include: the family and
     community rituals surrounding Divali; Raksha Bandhan; Navaratri; Holi; Dasara.

     Buddhism
     Daily rituals that a lay Buddhist might perform include: reciting the Three Refuges and the
     Five Precepts; offering flowers, incense or light in front of a Buddhist image or at a Buddhist shrine;

Judaism

8.   Compare the importance to Jews of the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud.

     Importantly, the question asks for a comparison of the Talmud and the Hebrew Bible (Tenakh),
     not the Torah. This opens the scope of the question.

     Candidates need to distinguish the Torah from the Nevi’im and Ketuvim and explain that whilst the
     latter two may be divinely inspired, the former is traditionally believed to be divinely written
     or dictated.

     Many Jews would regard the Talmud (Oral Torah) as also being divinely inspired or dictated.

     In contrast they may say that the Talmud is the work of rabbis over the centuries and is therefore
     clearly the product of humans not God. It is more difficult to claim that the Talmud is divinely
     inspired as it still continued to grow.

     Some may comment that certain groups of Jews, such as the Hasidim, place almost more weight
     and authority on the Talmud in terms of study because they believe it reveals what is hidden from
     sight in the Torah.

     Most are likely to conclude that the Tenakh is the more important on the basis that it includes
     the Torah.

     Candidates may refer to differences between Orthodox and Reform/Liberal and their interpretations
     of Tenakh and Talmud.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

9.   Explain Jewish eschatology.

     Candidates should be credited for giving a correct definition of eschatology.

     Candidates should deal with the two main principles in the subject guide:
     • Olam Ha-Ba, a fundamentally new age coming after the Messianic Age of peace and justice
        for humankind
     • Orthodox Jews believe that an individual Messiah, a human being “anointed” by God will usher
        in the Messianic Age.

     These two concepts, Olam Ha-Ba and the Messiah need to be explained in detail. There is little
     about Olam Ha-Ba in the scriptures but candidates should be familiar with the Messianic teachings
     of Micah, Malachi and Isaiah as well as later interpretations of these. They should also be able to
     discuss the difference between Orthodox and Progressive teachings about the Messiah as to whether
     this will be an actual person or instead a Messianic Age.

     Candidates may consider the implications of an end to rabbinic Judaism and a return to a Temple
     based sacrificial religion.

     Answers must not confuse Jewish Messianic belief with Christian ideas.

     Accept any other relevant answer.

Christianity

10.   “Women should not be ordained as religious ministers.” Discuss.

      Candidates should be aware of the ways in which Christian denominations consider the differences
      between priesthood and ministry. They should also be aware that many of the Protestant churches
      have appointed female church leaders for several centuries.

      Candidates should be aware of the argument used by the Orthodox and Catholic churches with
      regard to Apostolic Succession.

      They may say that women should follow the teaching of Corinthians and Titus and be subservient
      to men, keep quiet in church and cover their heads.

      They may argue that Jesus appointed no female disciples and that this showed his opinion.

      They may say that at the Eucharist the priest represents Jesus and speaks his words and that this
      should only be done by a man.

      Finally they may argue that with the majority group of Christians (Roman Catholic Church)
      not supporting women priests every attempt should be made to avoid disunity.

      Against this statement candidates may argue that Christianity stresses the equality of men and
      women as in Galatians.

      They may say that women had a prominent role in the first century Church for example, Priscilla,
      Dorcas (Tabitha) etc.

      They may mention the respect which Jesus showed to women. In particular they may refer to Mary,
      Martha and Mary Magdalene. Women who have campaigned for female priesthood will often
      argue that women were the first witnesses to the Resurrection.

      It can be argued that the patriarchal structure of the Church today is wrongly based on ancient ideas
      of the role, duty and importance of women.

      They may conclude that there is no reason why women should not have an equal right with men to
      be ordained.

11.   Explain why Christians disagree over the importance of the Apocrypha.

      The guide uses the term “Apocrypha” to refer to the intertestamental books which are generally
      collected into a volume placed between the Old and New Testaments. If however, candidates write
      about the New Testament Apocryphal books the answer should be accepted.

      They are likely to point out that the actual collections of books in the Old Testament vary between
      the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches with the latter including some parts of the Apocrypha
      into the Old Testament Canon.

      They may say that there is considerable doubt over the divine inspiration of some parts of the
      Apocrypha, for example, Bel and the Dragon and the extra chapter of Daniel.

      Candidates should be aware that there was considerable contestation in the early centuries of
      Christianity over what books should be included in the Canon. Some candidates may be aware that
      this debate was reopened in the twentieth century with discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
      Some may say that Irenaeus finalized the Canon and that it has always been accepted as it is
      without the Apocryphal books.

      Others may argue that there is sound teaching in some of the Apocryphal books and that therefore
      they should form part of the generally accepted canon.

      Some may point out that Luther, for example, felt that neither the Epistle of James nor the Book of
      Revelation should be in the New Testament Canon so that there is an argument for including books
      which are perhaps not accepted as authentic by the entire Church.

      Accept any other relevant answer.

Islam

12.   To what extent is “veiling” a requirement for Muslim women?

      Candidates should link the practice of female veiling to the overall concept of modesty, which is
      referred to in the Qur’an for male and female. They should be aware that veiling is disputed in
      Islam and should have some understanding of the differences between full covering and
      head covering. Candidates should also be aware that customs of female dress vary across the
      Muslim world and may cite specific examples. Candidates should also specify what they
      understand by a religious requirement and how it could be, in any way, legitimately enforced.
      Overall, whatever the argument, candidates should show clear awareness of issues of textual
      interpretation, authority and context.

      Candidates could address the question from a textual perspective or from historical/
      geographical/political perspectives. From a textual perspective they could refer to the two
      Qur’anic verses about female dress (Qur’an 33:59 on jilbab as outer garment, 24:31 on
      khimar/headscarf) and argue that the Qur’an does not indicate any specific parts of the female body
      to be covered except for the breast. Therefore on this evidence alone the full veil would not be a
      religious requirement.

      Candidates could use evidence from some hadiths referring to the Prophet’s wives or hadiths which
      specify that only the woman’s hands and eyes should be visible and draw their conclusions.
      They should show awareness of the precedence of the Qur’an to the hadith in terms of
      textual authority.

      Candidates could discuss the practice of veiling, in most cases not of full veiling, in some
      pre-Islamic societies (Iran, Mediterranean area). They could refer to tribal and cultural practices in
      countries such as Afghanistan and link full veiling to female seclusion and the concept of tribal and
      family honour. In this case the extent of it being a religious Islamic requirement could be limited.

      Candidates could elaborate on the understanding of religious requirement as being based on the
      opinions of religious authorities such as the “ulama” and the state. In this case they could use the
      examples of Saudi Arabia and/or Iran where the veil as an overall cloak is required and
      state-enforced for Muslim and non-Muslim women. They could address the issue of whether this is
      the result of religious, political, ideological or national considerations.

13.   Discuss the significance of angels in Islam.

      The belief in angels is part of the divine revelation. It is a belief shared with the People of the Book
      and forms part of the monotheistic Judeo-Christian narrative. The revelation of Islam confirms
      previous revelations and beliefs such as that in angels.

      Awareness that the belief in angels is one of the six core beliefs in Islam, together with the belief in
      Judgement Day etc, is essential. Allah created the angels before creating humankind and their
      presence and roles are referred to in the Qur’an and the hadiths. Angels’ main role is to obey Allah,
      but also to sing His praises, to guard humans and to weigh their deeds. Of foremost importance
      is Jibril, who, according to various interpretations, is the Angel of revelation. He was instrumental
      at the cave of Hira in conveying to Muhammad the divine message of the Qur’an.

      Only a few individuals were able to see angels (see Miriam’s annunciation in the Qur’an through
      the angel/s), so for the majority of Muslims, angels are a matter of faith which shows their trust in
      the divine message.

      Angels are agents of Allah, who created them and gave them tasks. They therefore testify to
      Allah’s greatness and pervasiveness. They obey Allah’s commands (see the reference to the angels
      being asked to bow down in front of Adam). Unlike humans, they are not endowed with free will,
      and are therefore not subject to reward and punishment. They were not chosen by Allah, like Adam
      and humans, to be His vicegerents on earth. This makes humans the pinnacle of creation.

      The presence of normally invisible beings in this world is an expression of divine immanence
      and providence. Angels support, guide and test humans, as well as being present at their death.
      Every human act is witnessed and accounted for by angels. The close link between angels and the
      reward and punishment of human beings is signalled also by the role of Israfil as the angel who,
      according to the hadiths, ushers in the Day of Judgment.

      Therefore, as agents from Allah in this world, angels serve various purposes of guardianship and
      guidance for humans. All of these roles were instituted by their Creator who, through them,
      is never far away from humans.

Open-ended question

14.   With reference to religious teachings on sexual conduct, examine attitudes to homosexuality in
      either Judaism or Christianity or Islam.

      Some candidates may choose to look at legal debates among religious scholars or authorities
      concerning homosexuality, to look at debates on the validity of gay partnerships or the legitimacy
      of gay religious ministers.

      Judaism
      One of the issues arising from the debates within Judaism about homosexuality is the extent to
      which sacred texts can be authoritative in informing modern attitudes. Textual evidence from
      Leviticus (18.22 and 20.13) is clear in its condemnation of homosexual practices between two men
      and the punishment is, in theory, death. Candidates can also refer to other examples of
      homosexuality in Jewish sacred texts. While most Orthodox branches would follow rabbinical
      interpretations in endorsing the textual prohibition of homosexual acts, some Progressive branches
      reject the above views. They re-interpret the passages in Leviticus as referring to male prostitution
      and see the need for new laws in view of the scientific biological understanding of homosexuality
      and go as far as supporting same sex civil partnerships.

      Christianity
      Three of Saint Paul’s letters reinforce the Old Testament view. However, what emerges from the
      current debates on homosexuality is the great variety of positions within Christian denominations.
      For instance, Roman Catholic leaders, but also Eastern Orthodox, continue to view homosexual acts
      as condemnable even though they recognize the biological nature of homosexuality,
      hence proposing abstinence as the only solution to avoid sin. Sexual orientation and sexual practice
      are usually clearly differentiated in ecclesiastical statements.

      Current debates within Anglican Christianity centre on the legitimacy of same sex marriages and
      on the ordination of gay bishops. These have great implications for the future of the
      Anglican Communion.

      Another issue arising from debates within Christianity is the interpretation of the pre-eminence of
      divine and human love and compassion which should, perhaps, overcome the scriptural
      condemnation which is seen as time or context bound.

      Islam
      Qur’anic references to the narrative of Lot (Qur7:80–4) are used by most schools of law as evidence
      for the condemnation of homosexual acts. The punishment for those acts, however, is by no means
      clear as only a few weak hadiths mention the death penalty, giving rise to varied positions among
      Islamic legal schools. One important issue is the modern legislation on male homosexual acts in
      specific Islamic countries. In some countries the death penalty, is used as a political and ideological
      tool by specific regimes. Across the Muslim world there are differing cultural attitudes towards
      homosexuality with some cultures regarding sexual behaviour between adolescent males before
      marriage as normative.
