            a tectonic hazard event on a community.” Discuss this statement, with reference to
            either earthquakes or volcanoes.                                                                  [10]

           (a)          (i)      Identify the farming system shown on the graph which has the highest energy
                                 output.                                                                                                                                                    [1]

                        (ii)     Identify the farming system which has the highest energy efficiency ratio.                                                                                 [1]

           (b)          Referring to the graph, suggest how mechanization contributes to the different
                        energy flows (inputs and outputs) for rice farming systems shown in China and
                        Japan.                                                                                                                                                              [4]

           (c)          Explain two changes in agriculture, other than mechanization, that have helped to
                        boost food production in some areas.                                                                                                                              [2+2]

                        shortages.” Discuss this statement.                                                                                                                                [10]

         (a)    Identify what Benefit A (environmental) and Benefit B (socio-economic) might be.                               [1+1]

		(ii)                  Explain how one of the benefits named on the diagram (excluding “Other”)
                        would reduce the city’s ecological footprint.                                                                 [2]

         (d)    Examine the reasons why economic activities (such as retailing, service and/or
                manufacturing industries) sometimes change location within an urban area.                                        [10]

      (a)   State which megacity is predicted to grow most rapidly.                                                       [1]

      (b)   Describe the global distribution of the megacities listed in the table.                                       [3]

      (c)   Using examples, explain why some large urban areas have much higher population
            growth rates than others.                                                                                     [6]

      (d)   “Sustainable strategies in cities can only succeed when cities have zero population
            growth.” Using examples, discuss this statement.                                                             [10]
