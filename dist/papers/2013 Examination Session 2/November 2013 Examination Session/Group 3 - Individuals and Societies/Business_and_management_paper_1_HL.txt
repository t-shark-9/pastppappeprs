Answer two questions from this section.

1.    (a)   Define the following terms:

            (i)    economies of scale (line 16)                                                 [2 marks]

2.    (a)   By the 1970s, Japanese companies had moved to just-in-time production
            (line 26).   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of just-in-time
            production.                                                                         [4 marks]

            (i)    for one internal stakeholder of RDB.                                         [2 marks]

            (ii)   for one external stakeholder of RDB.                                         [2 marks]

      (b)   Using information in lines 19–21, construct a position map of the ball bearing
            industry in the 1930s and place RDB and its two main competitors on it.             [4 marks]

                                              SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    As details about “RDB 2020” spread, several stakeholder groups began to express their concern.  
       One stakeholder group was the workers, who were upset because of the planned closure of their
       workplaces.  Another stakeholder group was the governments of Denmark, Germany and Sweden
       who wanted RDB to continue manufacturing in northern Europe.  The three governments agreed to
       offer two incentives for RDB to remain.

      1.    All three governments promised to pay 25 % of the budgeted cost of making the RDB factories
             “green”, if RDB chose to be a real “green” company.  The budget for the renovations would
             have to be approved by the three governments before the work on the factories could begin.  
             With this money from the government, RDB would not have to sell shares.   Details of the
             governments’ assistance and some of the implications were explained to Valdemar Holstein in
             a memo from Sofia de Carvahlo, RDB’s Chief Financial Officer (Item 1).

      2.    In addition, the Danish government promised to feature the story of “Green Bearings, an
             RDB Company” (Valdemar’s rebranding suggestion) as the lead article in the Danish Global
             Business Directory for 2015.  This directory is well respected and is published annually by
             the Danish government.  The directory is mostly purchased by public libraries and embassies.  
             Gloria Woolrich, a marketing consultant, informed Valdemar that this would not be sufficient
             for RDB to successfully rebrand (Item 3).

      Valdemar produced a simple decision tree framework to visualize the three strategic options:

                                               Option A: “RDB 2020”
                                               (Anna Holstein’s original proposal).




                                               Option B: Valdemar Holstein’s counterproposal with
                                               government incentives:
                                               • stay in Europe
                                               • cell production
                                               • “green” factories
                                               • government grants
                                               • form strategic alliances with ball bearing companies in
                                                 Brazil, China and India.
                                              Option C: Valdemar Holstein’s counterproposal:
                                              • stay in Europe
                                              • cell production
                                              • “green” in name only
                                              • form strategic alliances with ball bearing companies in
                                                Brazil, China and India.

      (b)   Using relevant information from Item 2, calculate:

            (i)    the current gearing ratio for RDB.                                            [1 mark]

            (ii)   the forecasted gearing ratio for RDB after the conversion to “green”

      (d)   With reference to RDB, examine possible marketing practices required for
            effective rebranding.                                                                [9 marks]

      (e)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 3, recommend to
            the RDB Board of Directors the most suitable strategic option (Option A, B or C).   [12 marks]

Additional Information

Item 1: Memo from RDB’s Chief Financial Officer to Valdemar Holstein

From:    Sofia de Carvahlo, Chief Financial Officer, RDB
To:      Valdemar Holstein, Chief Executive Officer, RDB
Subject: Implications of the governments’ 25 % grant for “green” conversions

Below are key financial data related to the upgrade of the three European factories instead of
“RDB 2020”.

Budgeted cost of converting the factories: €300 000 000.  

Financed by grants from the governments of Denmark, Germany and Sweden, which total
€75 000 000 and in long-term loans, which total €225 000 000:

		             Government grants           Long-term loans
Denmark        €20 000 000
Germany        €25 000 000                 €225 000 000
Sweden         €30 000 000 		
Total          €75 000 000                 €225 000 000

The €75 000 000 from the three governments will be recorded as retained profit on the balance sheet.

The impact on RDB will be significant.   Financial data is given in Items 2.1 and 2.2.   Of particular
note is the impact that the conversion will have on gearing.  Even though the governments will provide
€75 000 000 for the conversion, RDB will still have to borrow significant funds.

Item 3: Memo from Gloria Woolrich to Valdemar Holstein

From:    Gloria Woolrich, Marketing Consultant, Maia Marketing Associates
To:      Valdemar Holstein, Chief Executive Officer, RDB
Subject: Proposed article in the 2015 edition and issues related to rebranding

The proposed article in the 2015 edition of the Danish Global Business Directory will be about 10 000
words and will narrate the history and “green” practices of “Green Bearings, an RDB Company”.  A focus
will be on why Green Bearings is a company of which Denmark is proud.  As you know, the publication
format is printed (2000 copies).  Generally the authors of these articles do not say much about the nature
of a company’s product or its competitive position, as that would make it appear as though the publication
and the Danish government were promoting particular businesses over other Danish businesses.  
Danish Global Business Directory wants to be neutral.

I do not think that the article will be adequate for RDB to successfully rebrand as “Green Bearings, an
RDB Company”…
