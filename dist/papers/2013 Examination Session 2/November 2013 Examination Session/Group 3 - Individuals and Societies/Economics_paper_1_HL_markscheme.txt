Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Using a price ceiling diagram, analyse the impact a maximum price might
           have on the market for food.                                                       [10 marks]

           Answers may include:
            definitions of a price ceiling or maximum price
            an analysis of the possible impacts of a price ceiling. Shortages, inefficient
              resource allocation, welfare impacts, underground parallel markets and
              non-price rationing.       A consideration of the impacts on various
              stakeholders
            diagram of a market supply and demand diagram showing a maximum
              price as specified in the question
            examples of markets where such price controls have been used or might be

             unemployment. An explanation of how when injections are greater than
             leakages the size of the circular flow will tend to increase and the economy
             will tend towards expansion and inflation
            a diagram of the circular flow

(b)   Evaluate two government policies to reduce inflation.                              [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
       definitions of the two policies provided: fiscal policy, monetary policy,
        supply side policy
       an explanation of the use of fiscal policy, monetary policy or supply side
        policy to reduce inflation
       a diagram to illustrate the application of policies to deal with inflation
       examples to illustrate arguments
       synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may be: to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of the two policies discussed.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate examples.
