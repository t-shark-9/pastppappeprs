Marks     Level descriptor

0         The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3    There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
          understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
          question. The response makes no direct reference to the stimulus
          material or relies too heavily on quotations from the text.

4 to 7    The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
          accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
          addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
          question. The response makes limited use of the stimulus material.

8 to 10   The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
          the demands of the command term. The answer is supported by
          appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of qualitative
          research methodology.       The response demonstrates a critical
          understanding of qualitative research methodology applied to the
          stimulus material.
                                                  –4–               N13/3/PSYCH/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


1.   Explain considerations involved before conducting the semi-structured interviews
     in this study.                                                                   [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account, including
     reasons and causes, of relevant considerations that a researcher could have made before
     setting up the semi-structured interviews in the study described in the stimulus material.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Candidates may explain characteristics of semi-structured interviews and this is
     acceptable as long as the focus is on considerations involved in setting up the
     semi-structured interviews.

     Relevant considerations could include, but are not limited to:
     • preparations for a relevant interview guide
     • data recording, for example making reference to audiotaping and why it was used in
       this study (it is useful because it allows the interviewer to be more attentive to what
       the interviewees are saying and it is easier to make transcripts from recorded
       interviews)
     • sampling such as purposive or convenience sampling
     • ethics such as confidentiality, informed consent, briefing and debriefing.
     • training of interviewers, for example, taking into account that interviewers should be
       able to handle the doctors’ frustrations.

     Responses may explain a smaller number of considerations in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may explain a larger number of considerations in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses which explain considerations before, during and after conducting the
     semi-structured interviews should only gain credit for what is written about
     considerations before conducting the interviews.

     Responses which explain only ethical considerations should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [4 marks].

     Responses which explain the use of semi-structured interviews but fail to address
     relevant considerations in setting up semi-structured interviews should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [3 marks].

2.   Describe how the researchers in this study could use inductive content analysis
     (thematic analysis) on the interview transcripts.                               [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how the
     researchers in the study could use inductive content analysis on the interview
     transcripts.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not
     be penalized.

     In the context of this study, candidates could describe characteristics or features of the
     procedure of inductive content analysis. Relevant parts of the procedure of inductive
     content analysis in this study could include, but are not limited to:
     • Analysis of the transcripts of the interviews to identify possible themes that relate to
        how family doctors felt about weight management strategies and how the doctors’
        relationships with their patients could be affected negatively.
     • Following a systematic analysis of the transcript for emerging themes (for example,
        “patients’ belief that obesity was primarily a medical problem and therefore the
        responsibility of the doctor” or “doctors’ concern to maintain good relationships with
        their patients”). All themes should be supported by relevant quotations to support
        the choice of each theme.
     • Constructing a summary table of higher-order themes and subordinate themes.
     • Connecting the themes in the final interpretation of the transcripts to arrive
        at conclusions.
     • Confirming the interpretation of the data with other researchers or doctors who work
        within the same field (credibility check).

     Responses that do not describe how the researchers in this study use inductive content
     analysis in this study but merely refer to the themes mentioned in the stimulus material
     should be awarded up to a maximum of [3 marks].

3.   To what extent can findings from this study be generalized?                                   [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the degree to which
     findings from this qualitative study can be generalized.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not
     be penalized.

     Candidates may argue that sampling in this study seems to be based on specific
     characteristics of the participants (doctors treating obese patients), so the sampling
     could be either purposive or convenience, meaning that generalization in a statistical
     way is not possible and that this is not the aim of a qualitative study either. They may
     also say that the main goal of this qualitative research is to understand the subjective
     experience of the doctors in treatment of obese patients, perhaps in order to conduct
     further research. Responses may also refer to “thickness of data” as prerequisite for
     generalization in qualitative research, and this is acceptable.

     Responses may refer to representational, theoretical or inferential generalization
     (transferability) as applicable to the study, for example:
     • Representational generalization: findings from this study on family doctors’ attitudes
         to treatment of obesity could be applied to populations outside the study.
         For example, knowledge gathered in this study could be used to understand
         experiences of other doctors treating obese patients. Since the sample is relatively
         small the results cannot be statistically representative but if similar studies confirm
         the findings of this study, it could be argued that generalization is possible.
     • Theoretical generalization: if theoretical concepts and theory are developed in a
         study, they could be used to conduct further research and perhaps contribute to
         further development of theory. In this study, the inductive content analysis revealed
         a number of themes (for example, that doctors did not really believe in obesity
         treatments; or that they felt that patients themselves should take responsibility).
         This finding could contribute to development of theory that could be investigated in
         other studies.
     • Inferential generalization (transferability): in principle, findings from this study
         could be transferred to similar settings, that is, to other clinics that treat obese
         patients. For example, knowing that “doctors primarily saw obesity as a problem
         that had been caused by, and should be managed by, the patients themselves” is
         important knowledge and it could perhaps be transferred (or applied) to doctors
         outside the study. This is especially the case if other research studies support the
         findings from this study.

     Responses may refer to the possibility of comparing findings from one qualitative study
     to other qualitative studies without using specific terminology relating to generalization
     in qualitative research. Such responses should be awarded up to a maximum of
     [7 marks].

     Responses which refer to statistical generalization (used in quantitative research) and
     discuss this in relation to inferential generalization (or transferability) should be
     awarded credit. However, if responses refer only to statistical generalization without
                                            –7–              N13/3/PSYCH/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


any relevance to generalization in qualitative research, and there is reference to the
stimulus material, they should be awarded up to a maximum of [3 marks].

If there is no reference to the stimulus material and only statistical generalization is
discussed, award [0 marks].
