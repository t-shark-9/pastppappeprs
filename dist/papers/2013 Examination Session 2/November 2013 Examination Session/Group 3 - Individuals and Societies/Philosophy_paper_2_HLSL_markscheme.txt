Note to examiners
This markscheme outlines what members of the paper setting team had in mind when they devised the
questions. The topics listed in the bullet points indicate possible areas candidates might cover in their
answers. They are not compulsory points and not necessarily the best possible points. They are only a
framework to help examiners in their assessment. Examiners should be responsive to any other valid
points or any other valid approaches.

Paper 2 guidance
Examiners are reminded that in the examination paper it states that candidates are expected to
demonstrate the following skills. Since these skills are encouraged within the assessment criteria,
examiners should take them into account in their marking:
• argue in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy, and
   demonstrate an understanding of the author’s specific terminology
• show an understanding of the specific demands of the question
• give references to the ideas and arguments presented in the text
• present appropriate examples providing support for their overall argument
• identify and analyse counter-arguments
• provide relevant supporting material, illustrations and/or examples
• develop a critical evaluation of the ideas and arguments of the text
• offer a clear and philosophically relevant personal response to the position expressed by the author.

Using the assessment criteria
Candidates at both Higher Level and Standard Level answer one question on the prescribed texts.

Answers are assessed according to the assessment criteria set out on pages 4–5.

Paper 2 assessment criteria

A    Expression

     •    Has the student presented ideas in an organized way?
     •    How clear and precise is the language used by the student?
     •    To what extent is the language appropriate to philosophy?
     •    To what extent has the student understood the author’s use of specific terminology?

         Achievement     Descriptor
            Level
              0          The student has not reached level 1.
              1          The student expresses some basic ideas but it is not clear what the answer is trying to
                         convey. The use of language is not appropriate to philosophy.
              2          The student presents some ideas in an organized way. There is some clarity of
                         expression but the answer cannot always be followed. The use of language is not always
                         appropriate to philosophy. The student shows some understanding of the author’s use of
                         specific terminology but only in a limited way.
              3          The student presents ideas in an organized way and the answer can be easily followed.
                         The use of language is appropriate to philosophy and the author’s use of specific
                         terminology is satisfactorily understood.
              4          The student presents ideas in an organized and coherent way and insights are clearly
                         articulated. The use of language is effective and appropriate to philosophy. The student
                         shows a clear understanding and use of the author’s specific terminology.
              5          The student presents ideas in an organized, coherent and incisive way, insights are
                         clearly articulated and the answer is focused and sustained. The use of language is
                         precise and appropriate to philosophy. The student shows an assured understanding and
                         use of the author’s specific terminology.


B    Knowledge and understanding of the text

     • How well does the student know the text?
     • To what extent has the student understood the author’s ideas, arguments and key concepts?

         Achievement     Descriptor
            Level
              0          The student has not reached level 1.
              1          The student demonstrates a superficial knowledge of the text and there is only a basic
                         understanding of the author’s ideas, arguments and key concepts.
              2          The student demonstrates some knowledge of the text, with a limited understanding of
                         the author’s ideas, arguments and key concepts.
              3          The student demonstrates satisfactory knowledge of the text and the author’s ideas,
                         arguments and key concepts are satisfactorily understood. There is some insight into the
                         author’s arguments.
              4          The student demonstrates a good knowledge of the text and the author’s ideas, arguments
                         and key concepts are clearly understood. The student is able to show an understanding
                         of some of the more difficult or subtle points of the author’s arguments.
              5          The student demonstrates that the text has been thoroughly and carefully read.
                         The student shows an in-depth understanding of the author’s arguments, with a close
                         attention to detail.

C   Identification and analysis of relevant material

    • How well has the student understood the specific demands of the question?
    • To what extent does the student identify and analyse relevant supporting material?
    • How effectively does the student analyse the supporting material, examples and counter-arguments?

     Achievement      Descriptor
        Level
          0           The student has not reached level 1.
         1–2          The student shows little understanding of the specific demands of the question and
                      identifies relevant supporting material in only a limited way. There is little analysis and
                      few or no examples are given.
          3–4         The student shows some understanding of the specific demands of the question and
                      identifies and analyses some relevant supporting material. Some appropriate examples
                      are used.
          5–6         The student shows a satisfactory understanding of the specific demands of the question
                      and identifies supporting material that is nearly always relevant. There is a satisfactory
                      analysis of this material. Examples are appropriate and give some support to
                      the argument.
          7–8         The student shows an effective understanding of the specific demands of the question
                      and identifies relevant supporting material that is analysed in a sound and thoughtful
                      way. Examples are appropriate in their support of the overall argument. Some
                      counter-arguments are identified.
          9–10        The student shows an in-depth understanding of the specific demands of the question and
                      identifies supporting material that is always relevant. The implications of this material
                      are analysed in detail. Examples are well chosen and compelling in their support of the
                      overall argument. Counter-arguments are identified and analysed in a convincing way.


D   Development and evaluation

    • Does the student develop the argument in a coherent way?
    • How well does the student develop and evaluate the ideas and arguments of the text?
    • To what extent does the student express a relevant personal response?

     Achievement      Descriptor
        Level
          0           The student has not reached level 1.
         1–2          The student develops ideas and arguments in a basic way and there is little or no
                      evaluation of the text.
          3–4         The student develops some ideas and arguments but the development is simple, or is
                      asserted without reference to the text. There may be some basic evaluation of the ideas
                      and arguments of the text but it is not developed.
          5–6         The student develops ideas and arguments in a satisfactory way and evaluates them to
                      some extent. A limited critique of the ideas and arguments of the text is offered.
                      There is some evidence of a relevant personal response.
          7–8         The student develops ideas and arguments from a consistently held perspective, in close
                      response to the ideas and arguments of the text. Evaluation is thoughtful and convincing
                      and the student offers a critique of the text that goes beyond a statement of opinion or
                      belief. There is good evidence of a relevant personal response.
          9–10        The student develops ideas and arguments in an incisive and coherent way in detailed
                      response to the text. Evaluation is compelling or subtle, and convincing, and the student
                      offers a critique of the text that shows strong evidence of a relevant personal response.
                      The student shows an ability to challenge the assumptions made by the author and
                      explores different approaches to the text.

Bhagavad Gita

1.   Evaluate the claim that the three gunas (qualities, attributes or characteristics) function as the
     fundamental operating principles of all beings.

     This question asks for an evaluation of the nature of each of the gunas and their roles as the primary
     qualities of nature and of human personality. The answer might also show how the influence of
     each guna needs to be mastered sequentially by every person who wants to merge with the divine.
     In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • Matter is composed of eight elements (earth, water, fire, air, space, mind, intellect and identity)
        which develop according to three modes, the three gunas: Sattva (pure and binds the soul by
        attachment to happiness and knowledge); Rajas (passionate and binds the soul by attachment
        with action); Tamas (darkness and crudeness and binds the soul by attachment to recklessness,
        indolence and sleep)
     • In the Divine, the three gunas reside in perfect balance; disturbance in this balance creates other
        beings possessing the gunas in different proportions which determines every aspect of the nature
        of the being and its attachment and bondage to the physical world
     • The gunas compete with one another, changing the nature of the being in which they exist
        causing them to lose their understanding of themselves and their original oneness with
        the Divine
     • Transcending the influence of the gunas means self-realization, purity of mind and heart, release
        from suffering, freedom from the cycle of birth and death, release from bondage to
        worldly existence and attainment of the “supreme self”
     • If the three gunas are inherent in all beings, is transcendence from their influence possible?
     • Does the theory of the gunas have contemporary relevance for a philosophical understanding of
        personal identity?

2.   Evaluate the view that the Bhagavad Gita claims that focused, single-minded devotion (Bhakti
     Yoga) to Vasudeva-Krishna is the securest path to self-realization and liberation.

     At issue is an evaluation of bhakti yoga and its role in achieving self-realization and liberation from
     attachment to nature. Yoga indicates a comprehensive, unified perspective which encompasses a
     tranquil mind, skilful action and concentration on the nature of Self (Atman) and union with the
     Supreme Being (Brahman, Paramatma, Bhagavan). The term bhakti comes from the root “bhaj”,
     which means “to be attached to God”. Candidates might consider the key characteristics of this
     form of yoga and the qualities of the person who practises it. In addressing these philosophical
     issues, candidates might explore:
     • Bhakti yoga refers to attaining communion with the divine by means of single-minded devotion
     • The four types of humans who worship God are the distressed, the inquisitive, the wealthy, and
        the wise
     • Great souls (mahatmas) attain union with the divine by complete determination and
        single-minded devotion; God shows complete love and attention to those who maintain total
        devotion by rescuing them from mortal existence
     • The three gunas divert one’s gaze from God and turn it to the demons (asuras) and other gods
        who bind a person to rebirth
     • Total devotion leads to the state of a righteous soul (dharmatma)
     • Does the practice of bhakti yoga provide a credible view of the meaning of the relationship
        between a person and God?
     • Is the practice of bhakti yoga an effective technique to account for the purification of the inner
        self, the attainment of self-awareness and liberation from mortal existence?
     • Are the notions of self-awareness, self-realization, and liberation made sufficiently clear?
     • Is there a convincing argument for the belief that if a practitioner of bhakti yoga deserves it, God
        will bestow them with blessings and remove the hardships that the devotees face
     • Is it possible to practise complete and single-minded devotion to God while at the same time
        accepting competing beliefs in other gods?
     • In what ways might the practice of bhakti yoga have contemporary relevance?

Confucius: The Analects

3.   Evaluate the claim that The Analects offers an ethical view of deep significance for the present.

     The central conceptual framework of Confucian ethical views is li (rites, rules of propriety), ren
     (benevolence), and yi (rightness, righteousness). There is a fundamental role for ren in becoming a
     person, which involves the recognition that personal character is the consequence of cultivating
     one’s relationships with others. It is the practical consideration of one human being for another that
     defines humanity. Ren might be characterized as shared human flourishing. Much of
     The Analects is clearly concerned with learning from past experience in order to organize the
     future; Confucius has the task of such transmission. Confucius’s teachings are characterized by
     being permeable and adaptable; this flexibility might enable them to exert ethical influence today.
     In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • Confucius said that he was only a link in transmitting traditional culture; he adapted the wisdom
        of the past to his own present historical moment. Confucianism might act in a similar way in
        the present
     • The resonance of Confucius and Confucian ethical views in different cultures today, eg Korea,
        Japan and Vietnam
     • Virtue understood as overcoming difficulties with which many might identify, since it represents
        a central trait of the human condition
     • Confucian ethical teachings combine abstract aspects with concrete ones
     • What are some of the possible applications of the ethical view of The Analects to
        contemporary cultures?
     • Is the Confucian account of the role of the virtues more plausible than Western accounts of
        the virtues?
                                                  –9–                N13/3/PHILO/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Evaluate Confucius’s social philosophy.

     Individual identity is portrayed by Confucius as a web of relationships. The basic unit of humanity
     is one’s family and the complex of relationships that constitute it, rather than the private individual
     with family understood as a social organizing concept. Community is an extension of aunts and
     uncles, sisters and cousins; the teacher is “teacher-father” and one’s senior classmates are
     “elder-brother students”; the ruler is father and mother to the people, and is the son of “Heaven”.
     “Heaven” itself is a faceless amalgam of ancestors. To become a person one has to treat one’s
     family right; ren (becoming a person) implies cultivating one’s relationships with others.
     Confucius’s social philosophy emphasises the concept of “compassion” or “loving others”.
     Cultivating such concern for others involves being critical of oneself. In addressing these
     philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • The role of filial piety in social and familial relationships
     • Should we treat the others as family? To what extent would it be reasonable?
     • Is Confucian social philosophy reduced to a focus on oneself or small group relationships?
     • Confucius’s social philosophy orientates towards active political intervention in society;
        Confucius wanted to educate the next generation for political leadership
     • Rulership as a continuation of relationship. Superior rulership was characterized by the
        possession of de (virtue). It allows one to win a following without recourse to physical force; de
        also allows the ruler to maintain good order in the state
     • Does Confucian social philosophy have contemporary significance and application?

Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching

5.   Evaluate Lao Tzu’s claim that “The world is ruled by letting things take their course. It
     cannot be ruled by interfering”.

     This question invites an evaluation of the message in the Tao Te Ching about the art of government
     and how it offers advice that will influence this enterprise. Candidates might consider the Taoist
     conception of nature and show its applicability to political rule. Central to Lao Tzu is the
     application of the principle of wu-wei (non-action) to ruling. The best ruler enables the people to
     learn for themselves. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • The Taoist interest in nature and harmony and how the wise ruler will follow the path of nature
     • The call to observe nature in order to learn how to channel energy; the use of force as
        wasted energy
     • The qualities needed to rule
     • The rejection of authority in favour of the spontaneous actions of the people
     • An implication of the Tao for society is that there are no absolute values
     • The exhortation to embrace a feminine emphasis in ruling: “know the male, but keep to
        the female”
     • “If the sage would guide the people, he must serve with humility. If he would lead them, he must
        follow behind”
     • The reaction of Taoism against the centralisation and codification of government rule in its
        historical context
     • The application of the Tao to ruling in a non-agricultural setting
     • Lao Tzu’s criticism of bureaucracy and the accumulation of property
     • Might the Tao encourage anarchy?
                                                 – 11 –              N13/3/PHILO/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Explain and discuss the Taoist view that the world is in a constant state of flux.

     This question invites an explanation and discussion of a basic metaphysical assumption, as well as a
     stated position, about the relationship of nature (which includes humans) to change. The world and
     nature are constantly changing and the Tao is the dynamic force that runs through everything.
     Chi is the ever-present energy and wu-wei is listening to the lessons from flux in the world in order
     to achieve mastery which cannot be achieved by trying to control. In addressing these
     philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • Taoism encourages working with nature; observing nature will bring humans a sense of the inner
        workings of the universe
     • The one constant in a world of change is the fact that it changes; the individual must submit to
        the fact of change in order to be balanced and to grow
     • “Be still like a mountain and flow like a river”; is the place of nature in the teachings of the Tao
        unrealistic in an urban society?
     • The image of grass bending in the wind to illustrate the principle of wu-wei
     • The place of balance in Taoism as the route to avoiding chaos because of the force of opposites
        running through the world
     • The implications for social order and organisation of this constant flux
     • The approval of spontaneity in human affairs
     • Is Taoism subject to the criticism that natural states of the world cannot be applied to moral or
        evaluative judgments?
     • Modern physics with its picture of constant flux at a sub-atomic level, where appearances of
        solidity are just that
     • The constant opposition of yin and yang, the feminine and masculine aspects of the universe.

Plato: The Republic, Books IV–IX

7.   Evaluate Plato’s claim that for the ideal state to be formed, it is necessary to wipe the slate
     clean of human society and human habits.

     This question seeks an evaluation of the process of establishing an ideal state. The new social order
     needs a fresh start if it is to be a just society. Candidates might investigate how known values are
     applied to establish the nature of the ideal social order, with guardians as trained rulers presiding
     over other classes of individuals. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might
     explore:
     • The knowledge of Forms, which the Philosopher ruler has, allows for a “divine pattern” which
        should be imposed on a society
     • The parallel between establishing a new social order and an artist cleaning his canvas to start a
        new creation
     • The new structure would produce harmony and justice
     • The need for a new education to create citizens for a new community
     • Is Plato’s new order egalitarian? To what extent would social mobility be possible?
     • By being idealistic is the new society more dynamic than other societies?
     • Would the drive to produce the ideal limit individual freedoms?
     • How should Plato’s society respond to dissent?
     • Can justice be achieved in a controlled, stratified society?
     • Does Plato’s ideal state have application to our global political situation?

8.   Evaluate the nature, purpose and value of Plato’s educational programme.

     At issue here is the structure of the educative process and how it is based on Plato’s epistemological
     and metaphysical worldview. Candidates might indicate how the proposed educational programme
     fits in with Plato’s political views about the composition and rule of the state. The value of the
     programme will be seen in the distribution of key virtues necessary for a just society. In addressing
     these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • The idea that education was long term, beginning with a small child but only reaching the
         highest levels at perhaps the age of 50; intellectual, physical and moral aspects
     • The possible restricted access to the full programme of education; only the guardian would
         receive the full programme
     • The interrelationship of belief, truth, physical reality and the centrality of the realm of Forms

René Descartes: Meditations

9.   Evaluate the claim that methodological doubt relieves the mind of reliance on the senses so as
     to attain indubitable truths.

     At issue here is an evaluation of the method employed by Descartes. Methodological doubt frees us
     from preconceived opinions and previously held beliefs, factors which hinder the process of
     discovering indubitable truths and provides a strategic route to lead the mind to a critical assessment
     of sense-based information. Knowledge requires that we take a critical stance regarding the senses
     and distinguish things related to the intellect from corporeal things. Sensory fallibility during
     experiences while we are awake is extended to include the vividness alleged to characterize sensory
     reliability while we are dreaming. The introduction of the evil-deceiver hypothesis calls into doubt
     our experiences of external objects, our own body and even perhaps the truths of Mathematics
     assumed to describe a sensory world. Candidates might consider whether Descartes is obliged, in
     the end, to integrate the operation of the senses into his epistemology. In addressing these
     philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
     • Sense perceptions are operations of the intellect and the imagination, but clear and certain
         knowledge is potentially obscured by immersion in the senses
     • Is Descartes successful in exposing a non-sensory source of cognition which provides the means
         of attacking and rejecting the senses and sense-based beliefs?
     • In what manner do the senses and the intellect operate together to produce an imaginative
         representation of the physical world in both its primary and secondary quality aspects?
     • Is it the case that the intellect must carefully attend to sense perceptions so that we do not take
         the senses to be more veridical than they can be?
     • Is it possible or even desirable to eliminate entirely dependence on sense experience?
     • Is methodological doubt the most effective strategy to deal with opinions formerly held as
         true and certain?

10.   Evaluate the claim that Descartes’s example of the piece of wax demonstrates that what we
      can know with certainty are those things we know by our judgment, thinking and
      understanding of them in our minds.

      This evaluation might include a treatment of the nature of the cogito, the operations of the mind,
      and the difficulties that arise in the relationship between sense perception and knowledge. Sense
      perception and imagination reveal to the mind the object in its various forms. Only the mind
      (res cogitans) in its operations of judging, thinking and understanding can achieve a clear and
      distinct knowledge of the nature of an object, like a piece of wax, while it is presented by the senses
      in a variety of forms. Sensory perception has some value in achieving knowledge but cognition is
      of greater value; we tend to place greater emphasis on sensory perception and imagination than on
      judging, thinking and understanding. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might
      explore:
      • Cartesian doubt calls into question all previously held knowledge but leads to the absolute
         certainty that I am, I exist: cogito ergo sum
      • Further reasoning leads to the conclusion that I am therefore precisely a thinking thing that is a
         mind, intellect, with understanding, or reason
      • A thinking thing doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, imagines and senses
      • The mind understands abstract things like the nature of my existence, but it is with
         sense perception that we explore and examine physical things
      • The effectiveness of the example of a piece of wax: clear understanding of physical things by the
         mind rather than solely by the senses
      • Is Descartes arguing that it is more precise to claim that sense perception relies on the mind
         rather than claiming that the mind relies on sense perception?
      • Does Descartes’s epistemology endanger the ontological status of material objects?
      • Kantian and phenomenological critiques of Descartes’s rationalist framework.

John Locke: Second Treatise on Government

11.   Evaluate the claim that “Our contemporary language of individualist politics is grounded in a
      tradition which stretches back to Locke’s vision of man and society”.

      The Second Treatise is considered the ground from which political liberalism grew; it defines the
      horizon of subsequent political liberal culture. Both critics and defenders of modern liberalism
      agree on the central role of Locke’s ideas. Locke uses the concept of the state of nature to ground
      his political philosophy. The state of nature represents the human condition without the
      establishment of political society and government, as a free condition, but full of fears and
      continual danger. Individuals enter into a social contract to protect their natural rights and property.
      Candidates might consider the idea of the social contract which requires the consent of society’s
      members as the ground of moral legitimacy of a political society and the form of government.
      In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Elimination of absolutism: the idea of the community as the supreme power
      • The problem of political sovereignty
      • Actual consent versus tacit consent
      • Discussions on the central role of individual property
      • The extent to which individual rights might be central and dominant in the organization of
         civil society
      • The balance of power: Locke separates the powers into legislative, executive and federative; the
         judiciary, separated in Montesquieu’s system, is subsumed under the legislative power
      • The executive and federative powers are to be controlled by the legislative power
      • The legitimacy of resistance against tyranny, rebellion, revolution, eg Locke’s influence on the
         American Declaration of Independence
      • Does Locke’s position have contemporary political significance? If so, in what ways?
      • Does Locke focus so much on the individual and her/his rights that he excludes serious
         consideration of an overarching good for all?

12.   Explain and discuss Locke’s conception of natural law.

      Natural law applies to all human beings, because it is obligatory, independently of what the other
      forms of law stipulate. In the state of nature every man has a right to punish the offender, and to
      execute the law of nature (§ 8). Natural law surpasses all written, positive laws: “the Municipal
      Laws of Countries […] are only so far right, as they are founded on the Law of Nature, by which
      they are to be regulated and interpreted” (§ 12). A subject’s ultimate obligation is to the
      supreme power, which is the legislature, itself bound by the law of nature. Through natural law
      Locke formulates a justification of responsible, tolerant and broadly democratic political society.
      In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Grounds of the obligating power of natural law; God’s authority
      • The attempt to formulate a natural law which would serve as a norm for all, without considering
         religious differences
      • The rejection of innate moral knowledge, its connection with an empirical approach to
         human morality; virtue and vice as sanctioned by other people’s approbation and condemnation
      • If nations were to follow the precepts of natural law necessary for the maintenance of social life,
         would that constitute sufficient evidence of the innate character of natural law?
      • Human beings might follow the central precepts of natural law as rules of convenience
      • Relations between natural law, state of nature, peace and war
      • Are scholars right in seeing Locke’s theory of natural law as primarily concerned with making a
         point about the duties humans have toward others, rather than the rights they have as individuals?

John Stuart Mill: On Liberty

13.   Evaluate Mill’s view that a true society is one that allows the individual freedom of thought
      and discussion.

      “If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion,
      mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he … would be justified in
      silencing mankind.” The liberty of the individual is central to Mill’s claims about how a good
      society should operate. Mill allows for freedom of thought however “… immoral it may
      be considered”. The production of utility is affected by not allowing even a minority of one to
      express his or her opinion and the consequences are negative for both the individual and the society.
      In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Right opinions enable us to correct our own errors and the expression of wrong opinions enables
          truth to be further appreciated, and thus to develop; discussion guarantees that vitality of opinion
          is maintained
      • We must remember our fallibility and the fact that we could be wrong even when in a majority
      • Different cultures hold different beliefs about what is true, which shows that just being a
          prevailing opinion is no guarantee of truth
      • Offence is not in itself a harm
      • Truth is of great importance; it is part of an opinion’s utility, and of greater importance than
          other parts of an opinion’s utility, like how useful at a particular time such an opinion is
      • Is Mill consistent in contending that truth is of greater importance than other parts of utility?
      • Did Mill believe that truth was actually knowable? And by all? He says we can never be sure
          that an opinion is false
      • Received opinion and the modern term “political correctness”
      • Modern examples of censorship, legal cases concerning the suppression of information,
          discrimination, etc.

14.   Evaluate the claim that the Harm Principle must be applied to individuals before the
      principle of utility in society may be transgressed.

      The Harm Principle is the notion that the liberty of the individual must be protected except where
      harm is caused to others. Mill’s view is that utility is the fundamental goal for societies, and
      maintenance of individual liberty helps to ensure utility is increased. The core areas are the liberty
      to hold opinions, the liberty to act upon those opinions and the liberty to join with others so long as
      harm is not caused. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Disapproval and the right of individuals to maintain their opinions and behaviour
      • The tyranny of the majority
      • The Harm Principle and self harm; paternalism within societies
      • The possibility of an individual acting in any way that might not be harmful to another person
      • Other societies (in Mill’s time that he considered) not “mature” enough to deliver proper
         protection of individuals
      • Political maturity in the modern world; are there societies that are more able to uphold the rights
         of individuals than others?
      • Examples of governmental interference in private choices, eg sexual behaviour, drug use,
         political action
      • Protection for children and what constitutes the end of childhood; “Ordinary understanding” and
         those of limited capacity
      • Social norms and accepted practices change over time; how applicable is Mill in a different age?
      • Is Mill unduly optimistic about the individual’s ability to learn and develop?

Friedrich Nietzsche: The Genealogy of Morals

15.   Evaluate Nietzsche’s idea of bad conscience.

      Bad conscience is a sickness in humans. It is an awareness of a person’s own guilt which produces
      fear and weakens human action. Bad conscience causes remorse for one’s perceived bad actions.
      There is a contrast between conscience and bad conscience which has changed because of the
      development of science and the understanding of the psychology of humans. In addressing these
      philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • The relationship of bad conscience to punishment
      • The interaction of punishment and debt and its origins in the repaying of debt
      • Indebtedness is learnt and hence bad conscience is learnt; therefore it is not a natural
         phenomenon of humans
      • The role of the “aesthetic priest” in fuelling the idea of bad conscience; does the “aesthetic priest”
         have a positive influence on human behaviour?
      • On other understandings of bad conscience might it not produce beneficial changes in behaviour?
      • Is self-inflicted suffering good? Some reflection on religious sects and their rituals which
         involve self-harm might arise
      • If humans were more individualistic and self-assured, might bad conscience not exist?

16.   Evaluate Nietzsche’s claim that the will to truth requires a genealogical analysis.

      Nietzsche rejects absolute truth. The will to truth is an expression of the will to power but does not
      question truth itself. Humans should challenge the will to truth because in doing so they give
      meaning to pain, interpreting it as suffering, and this can, they think, achieve the aesthetic ideal.
      Candidates might show the centrality of the will to truth in art, philosophy and science, and how it
      requires a critique. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • How interpretation changes and corrupts truth, and science claims not to interpret; facts are a
         new absolute
      • Science and therefore truth is value driven; the truth it creates is the same truth in kind as the
         aesthetic ideal
      • Science, like religion, has faith in absolutes; scientists themselves then have a will to truth
      • For Nietzsche, science is focused on facts and nothing else. These facts form the basis of truth
      • Can a compelling truth be absolute if it cannot be universalized?
      • Nietzsche’s “perspectivism” means that truth is relative and there is no certainty in anything;
         is his perspectivism defensible?
      • Can a lack of certainty produce instability in humans and society or does it strengthen the
         individual as Nietzsche might claim?
      • Does the genealogical method provide a means to critique truth?

Bertrand Russell: The Problems of Philosophy

17.   Evaluate Russell’s claim that “Every proposition which we can understand must be composed
      wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted”.

      Knowledge by acquaintance in Russell’s theory involves two elements: the everyday notion of
      acquaintance and acquaintance as the fundamental relation that minds have to other objects; these
      two elements are in tension as is easily seen by considering propositions about non-existent objects,
      or propositions about universals, or, even more simply, by considering that those who never met
      Russell can still think about him and his ideas. Russell sought to remove this tension by
      distinguishing between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. For Russell, to
      know a thing by acquaintance is for it to come before the mind without the intermediary of any
      description; it is knowledge of things; by contrast, knowledge by description is knowledge that
      there is a unique thing without requiring any direct acquaintance with that thing; it is knowledge
      of truths. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • By using descriptions we can, according to Russell, think and say various things about objects
         with which we are not acquainted and about objects that do not exist
      • Every fact or proposition must have at least one universal as a constituent
      • For Russell, facts constitute the way things are, namely, particulars having properties and
         standing in relations to other particulars, whereas propositions represent particulars as possessing
         various properties and standing in various relations (thus enabling us to grasp various
         possibilities); true propositions correspond to the facts
      • Regardless of whether there are both negative and positive facts, it is clear that there are both
         negative and positive propositions
      • Russell’s account of propositions
      • Russell’s view that thinking requires acquaintance with universals and with particulars
      • Not all of our experiences can be considered to guarantee the existence of the objects that feature
         in our thinking about such experiences; idealism versus. realism
      • Russell thought the distinction between sensations and sense-data was crucial to understanding
         the mistake idealists make; we are acquainted with sense-data, which are signs of physical
         objects; sense-data are ingredients in all our thinking about the physical world; material objects
         and most of their properties are known only by description.

18.   Evaluate the capacity of Russell’s theory of descriptions to account for claims about things
      that do not exist (for example, “Shangri-La has a perfect climate” – where Shangri-La is
      understood to be a fictional kingdom).

      By using descriptions we can think, say and know various things about objects with which we are
      not acquainted and about objects that do not exist. Russell thought that the challenge posed to his
      principle of acquaintance by definite descriptions referring to individuals who don’t exist (as in, for
      example, “The present King of France is a great mountaineer”) could be met by way of his theory
      of descriptions. If a person is entertaining a proposition about an object and the person’s
      experiences do not guarantee that the object exists then she or he must be thinking about the object
      descriptively. Ordinary proper names were often abbreviations for definite descriptions.
      We should not consider “logically proper names” (eg “this”) as meaningful proper names unless we
      are immediately acquainted with what they name. In addressing these philosophical issues,
      candidates might explore:
      • The entertaining of a proposition about an object gives rise to the issue of the object’s
         ontological status; for a realist, like Russell, objects had to be either existent or non-existent
      • Thus the proposition one thinks when one has the thought that “Shangri-La has a perfect
         climate” requires only universals and particulars that really do exist and a description of
         Shangri-La
      • Propositions about non-existent objects as descriptive versus experiences of (real) objects
      • Following Descartes, Russell adopted a methodology of doubting the reality of the
         external world; our knowledge of the external world comes from our non-inferential knowledge
         of sense-data
      • Is Russell’s “logical constructionism” plausible? Can we infer that properties of, or relations
         among, experiences mirror properties of, or relations among, material objects? And, is it
         plausible to hold that we know the structure of matter but not its intrinsic nature?
      • Is Russell convincing when he claims that a world of material objects known only by description
         is the best explanation of sense-data?
      • Critiques of Russell’s framework by eg Wittgenstein and those influenced by Kant.

Hannah Arendt: The Human Condition

19.   Evaluate Arendt’s contention that the Western philosophical tradition from Plato onwards
      has subordinated the world of human action (the vita activa) to the life of contemplation (the
      vita contemplativa) and its concern with essences and the eternal.

      Arendt’s critique of the Western philosophical tradition for subordinating action to thought aligns
      with her admiration for the classical conception of democracy derived from the Greeks. Labour is
      repetitive but life-sustaining activity; work is activity involved in creating objects and the human
      world; and action is new, especially new political activity, involving shared enterprises. Action is
      the highest realisation of the vita activa; action is distinctively human. There are two obstacles to
      the vita activa: the attempt to “escape the earth” and the attempt to retreat from the world to the self.
      The role of speech (and communication more generally) enables the agents of action to be identified.
      In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Political activity is valued not because it may lead to agreement or to a shared conception of the
         good, but because it enables each citizen to exercise his or her powers of agency, to develop the
         capacity for judgment and to achieve political efficacy through concerted action
      • Arendt’s conception of politics is based on the idea of active citizenship, namely,
         civic engagement and collective deliberation about all matters affecting the political community
      • Freedom as the capacity to initiate
      • Plurality as the key both to human equality and individual distinctiveness
      • Thinking and the individual conscience
      • Judging as the external manifestation of the human capacity for critical thinking
      • The impact of totalitarianism on standards of judgment, interpretation and assessment
      • The need to appeal to imagination in light of the impact of totalitarianism so as to reinstate
         thinking, willing and judging
      • The impact of Arendt’s own experiences (eg under Nazism) on her philosophical reflections
         concerning politics.

20.   Evaluate Arendt’s conception of modernity.

      Modernity is characterised in a number of ways by Arendt: first, as “loss of the world”, namely, the
      restriction or elimination of the public sphere of action and speech in favour of the private world
      (especially the pursuit of private economic interests); second, as the age of mass society; third, as
      the rise of the social and of the victory of animal laborans over homo faber and the classical
      conception of man as zoon politikon; fourth, as the age of bureaucratic administration and
      anonymous labour, rather than of politics and action; fifth, as the age in which the
      institutionalization of terror and violence have given rise to totalitarian forms of government; sixth,
      as the age where conformity has replaced freedom, and human solidarity has been eroded; seventh,
      as the age where the past no longer yields certainty of evaluation, with the consequence that
      individuals, having lost their traditional standards and values, must search for new grounds of
      human community. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Arendt’s advocacy of revisiting the experience of the ancient Greeks to illuminate our
         present situation
      • Is Arendt’s conception of modernity indefensibly negative?
      • The tension, if not contradiction, between Arendt’s attitude to nature and her appeal to science
         and technology as the means to humanity’s recovery
      • Are there inadequacies in Arendt’s characterisation of “the social”? Eg does her separation of
         the social from the political belie their connectedness?
      • World alienation: the loss of a shared world of experience and action, the means by which we
         gain our sense of identity and of reality
      • Earth alienation which leads to the attempt to escape from earth’s confines via the development
         of technology
      • The rise of the social as a consequence of the expansion of market-based economies and of
         social wealth; the resultant commodification of life and the breaking down of the
         public/private distinction.

Simone de Beauvoir: The Ethics of Ambiguity

21.   Evaluate the claim that “Life in itself is neither good nor evil. It is the place of good and evil,
      according to what you make it”.

      At hand is the central line of thought of de Beauvoir’s position: the human condition as a making or
      realization of oneself in the world. The core notions of the ethics of ambiguity are ambiguity,
      freedom, responsibility and relations with others. Our fundamental ambiguity has its roots in the
      knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life from which we must draw our strength to live and
      our reason for acting. Human existence is always a combination of the internal freedom to
      transcend the given conditions of the world and the weight of the world which imposes itself on us
      in a manner outside of our control and not of our own choosing. In addressing these philosophical
      issues, candidates might explore:
      • The notion of “bad faith” as a way to refuse engagement
      • Human freedom requires the freedom of others for it to be actualized. Without the other can it
         be positive? Is it evident that my freedom is determined by the freedom of others? If I give up
         my freedom do absolute values, with an inhuman objectivity take its place?
      • Does the absurdity of the human condition limit the significance of freedom?
      • Subjective choices might change; does it mean that good and evil change according to what
         we make?
      • Authenticity as subjective ethical engagement might be compatible with a very different set of
         values proposed as objective
      • How could existentialism guarantee that what I choose is ethically right rather than good?
      • Is de Beauvoir’s conception of man as doer too general or simplistic to draw conclusions about
         moral behaviour?

22.   Explain and discuss de Beauvoir’s idea that to will freedom and to will to disclose being are
      one and the same choice.

      De Beauvoir establishes a connection, on the one hand, between revealing reality through science,
      technology, art, and philosophy, and freedom, on the other. Freedom realizes itself only by
      engaging itself in the world. Man’s project toward freedom is embodied for him in definite acts
      of behaviour. Science, technology, art, and philosophy are indefinite conquests of existence
      over being. Freedom takes a positive and constructive step which causes being to pass into
      existence in a movement which is constantly surpassed. In science the fundamental problem is to
      make the idea adequate to its content and the law adequate to the facts. Science finds its truth if it
      considers itself as a free engagement of thought in the given aiming, at each discovery, not at fusion
      with the thing, but at the possibility of new discoveries; what the mind then projects is the concrete
      accomplishment of its freedom. Technology actually aims at an indefinite disclosure of being by
      the transformation of the thing into an instrument and at the opening of ever new possibilities for
      man. In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • Art should not attempt to set up idols, but to reveal a reason for existence
      • Is de Beauvoir unrealistic on the amount of freedom allowed to us? Does the development of
         knowledge require freedom as depicted by de Beauvoir?
      • It is other men who open the future to me; but if, instead of allowing me to participate in the
         movement of constructing our freedom, they oblige me to consume my transcendence in vain,
         then they are cutting me off from the future, they are changing me into a thing
      • The extent of the separation between the world of the individual and the external world
      • It has been claimed that de Beauvoir is anti-science, her analysis of science as a way of
         disclosing being seems to refute this position.

Charles Taylor: The Ethics of Authenticity

23.   Evaluate Taylor’s view that authenticity requires recognition of, and openness to, the
      importance of respect for others and the shared natural world.

      Taylor contends that for individuals to be authentic requires not only being true to themselves but
      being respectful of, and attentive to, others and the natural world we all share. Authenticity is more
      than self-development; it requires self-discovery, self-understanding and wholeness of self.
      Developing the capacity for self-discovery and self-understanding, and for defining one’s identity,
      requires dialogue with others. We cannot live authentically if we have no more regard for the
      natural world than as a quarry containing raw materials entirely available for our unfettered use.
      In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • The three malaises of modernity: loss of meaning; eclipse of ends; losses of freedom and the
         consequences for political life
      • Individualism and self-absorption
      • Authenticity as a valid ideal (and alternative to individualism)
      • The roles of reason and argument in relation to values and their effectiveness
      • The rejection of subjectivism and relativism about values in favour of pluralism about values
      • The importance of challenges to, and defences of, ideals and values
      • The significance of sharing, and engaging in dialogue, with others
      • The need for external guiding structures if the perils of individualism are to be avoided.

24.   Evaluate Taylor’s claim that the fragmentation of contemporary social life threatens
      democratic government.

      Fragmentation results from identification with the concerns of specific groups rather than with those
      of the larger polity. There are tensions between accommodation of narrowly defined identities and
      those of the larger polity. There is a problem for democracy when those who do not identify
      primarily (or, at all) with the larger polity are excluded from effective decision-making or are given
      inadequate recognition. There is a further problem for democracy in overcoming “deep diversity”.
      “Deep diversity” is to be understood as requiring a social contract that all can accept even under
      circumstances in which certain groups demand special rights. Taylor asserts the importance of
      creative compromise when people desire a shared political life (and, hence, a shared identity space).
      In addressing these philosophical issues, candidates might explore:
      • The compatibility of the ethos of neutrality (under procedural liberalism) with respect
         for diversity
      • The importance for achieving participatory self-rule of shared common goods, ie goods whose
         value stems from shared experience of them
      • “Other-understanding” as one means to self-understanding and to the overcoming of
         fragmentation
      • The importance of cultivating overarching loyalties rather than limited loyalties
      • Decentralisation of political power as crucial for effective democratic decision-making
      • The reasonableness of the criticism often made of Taylor that he ignores the importance of
         protecting basic human rights and the meeting of unmet claims for distributive justice.
