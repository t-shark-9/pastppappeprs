Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total [40 marks]) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for stating one reason for including an observatory (The View) in
                  the design of the building [1 max].
                  visitor attraction;
                  create income by charging visitors to use the observatory;
                  make use of the height of the building;                                        [1 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for stating one reason for including a spire at the top of the
                  building [1 max].
                  to give the building status;
                  so the building stands out more in the landscape;
                  increase the height;                                                           [1 max]

           (iii) Award [1] for one reason for assembling the spire off-site before
                 re-assembling it at the top of the building and [1] for a brief
                 explanation [2 max].
                 to ensure it fits together;
                 so assembly on site is straight forward;

                  difficult to resolve any design problem at the top of The Shard;
                  troubleshoot problems in safe/accessible environment;                          [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for one reason why the restaurant area is larger than the
                  observatory area even though the observatory covers more floors and [1]
                  for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  prism/pyramid shape of the building;
                  so higher floors have less floor area than lower floors;                           [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for one reason why the restaurant area covers three floors and
                  [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  the restaurants will cater for different needs/offer a variety of food;
                  for example, office workers will mainly want to use it for lunch but hotel
                  guests will use it for breakfast;

                  flexibility of use;
                  different types of cuisines can be offered on different floors/floors may be
                  shut off at quiet times;                                                       [2 max]
                                              –5–               N13/4/DESTE/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   (i)    Award [1] for stating the number of floors not used regularly by people.
             19;                                                                                  [1]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point for some floors remaining mainly
             unoccupied [3 max].
             the building is very tall and is multi-purpose;
             at different levels there will be the need for specific services/storage
             areas etc;
             so some floors are left for use for noisy/smelly plant services/machinery;

             as it is a new building;
             to may take some time to attract business;
             to rent/occupy spare floors;                                                     [3 max]

(d)   (i)    Award [1] for stating one reason why solar heat gain will be less at the
             bottom of the building than at the top.
             shading from trees/other buildings;                                                  [1]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point explaining why the blind systems
             may not help to reduce the energy needs of the building [3 max].
             the blinds will block out daylighting on sunny days;
             this means that artificial light will need to be used more;
             which will increase the energy consumption of the building;                          [3]

(e)   (i)    Award [1] for one limitation of the blind system in relation to maintenance
             and [1] for a brief explanation.
             the system will need to be regularly maintained;
             and any repairs will be very costly as each glass panel is a sealed unit;            [2]

      (ii)   Award [1] for one limitation of the blind system for occupants of the
             building and [1] for a brief explanation.
             reliability;
             if the system breaks down it will affect the working conditions in the
             building dramatically;

             Occupants of the building will not be able to operate the blinds individually;
             In order to regulate the amount of heat/light for their working position;

             Lack of views;
             The blinds could make the office seem claustrophobic/closed off;                 [2 max]

2.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the percentile range used for adult shoe sizes in volume
           production.
           5th – 95th (male or female);                                                            [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point for a comparison of the use of
           qualitative and quantitative data when considering the ergonomic aspects of a
           design [3 max].
           quantitative data is data which can be measured in some way, for example, body
           dimensions or a temperature range etc;
           qualitative data is based on individual perception, for example, one person will
           find a particular temperature comfortable while another will find it uncomfortable;
           quantitative data is easier to use for designers as it is fairly constant/qualitative
           data is very varied;
           the balance required between the use of quantitative and qualitative data depends
           on the context of the design;                                                           [3]
                                                  –7–               N13/4/DESTE/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Award [1] for one reason why toughness is important in the use of timber for roof
           beams in domestic buildings and [1] for a brief explanation.
           so cracks will not propagate easily;
           roof beams need to last a long time/be very durable;

           cracks will not spread throughout the material;
           When joint are cut/holes drilled/fasteners used;                                      [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying how the structure of natural timber affects how a beam
           is cut to maximize its tensile strength and [1] for a brief description [2 max].
           beams are constructed so the grain runs along the length of the beam;
           the beam will be weak if the grain runs across the beam;                                  [2]


4.   (a)   Award [1] for stating one reason why the concept of clean technology was not an
           issue for most governments during the industrial revolution [1 max].
           governments were mainly interested in improving the economy;
           little quantitative data was available about the effects of industrial expansion on
           the environment;
           little public concern was raised about environmental issues;                          [1 max]


     (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point for an explanation of one reason why
           many approaches to clean manufacturing tend to be incremental [3 max].
           cost;
           a radical rethink of the whole manufacturing process will be costly;
           and many companies cannot afford such an approach;

           values;
           those who run companies may not be very pro-active in relation to environmental
           concerns;
           and so do only see the need to make minor changes to the process;

           legislation;
           legislation may not be in place which forces companies to make radical changes;
           so those in charge do only what they have to do;

           priorities;
           a large company may have many different conflicting priorities for spending time
           and money;
           clean manufacturing may not be a top priority for them;

           R&D;
           The nature of the required technological development for effective clan manufacturing;
           May be done gradually over a period of time;

           risk;
           Less risky than a radical approach as the whole system is not altered at once;
           and effects can be monitored gradually;                                               [3 max]

5.   (a)   Award [1] for describing how the structure of LVL differs from the structure of
           plywood and [1] for a brief description [2 max].
           plywood is created from thin layers of timber (veneers/plys) glued together with
           the grain of each layer at right angles to each other;
           while LVL is created from layers with the grain running in the same direction;           [2]

     (b)   Award [1] for outlining one limitation of the composition of particle board
           (chipboard) for use as a structural material and [1] for a brief explanation
           [2 max].
           suitable for internal use only;
           as the composition makes it very absorbent (unless specially treated);

           poor tensile strength;
           in comparison to most other manufactured boards/natural timber;                      [2 max]


6.   (a)   Award [1] for stating one limitation of installing a hydroelectric system [1 max].
           high capital/maintenance costs;
           needs to be located near a large, constant water supply;                             [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in comparing the overall efficiency
           conversion levels of using conventional coal and gas fossil fuels to create
           electricity [3 max].
           coal is less efficient than gas;
           but both are very inefficient;
           as the conversion rate for coal is approx 30 % compared to that of gas of 40 %;          [3]

7.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for an outline of one possible reason why Porsche decided to
                  produce bicycles as part of their corporate strategy and [1] for a brief
                  explanation [2 max].
                  image;
                  improves the “green” credentials of the company;

                  market pull;
                  the bicycle market has widened to include expensive products;                   [2 max]


           (ii)   Award [1] for describing the specific type of corporate strategy employed by
                  Porsche in deciding to produce bicycles and [1] for a brief explanation
                  [2 max].
                  diversification;
                  the company decided to produce a very different type of product to cars;            [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for an outline of one advantage of manufacturing the pedals of
                  the bicycle by high pressure die casting and [1] for a brief explanation
                  [2 max].
                  good accuracy;
                  important for such an intricate design;

                  good surface finish;
                  important for a quality/expensive product;                                      [2 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in explaining how work done by
                  the cyclist is converted into mechanical motion when riding the bicycle
                  [3 max].
                  human energy is converted to pedal rotations;
                  rotary motion of the pedals is converted by the gear mechanism to rotary
                  motion of the drive wheel;
                  rotary motion of the drive wheel is converted to linear motion of the bicycle
                  moving forward (forward velocity);                                                  [3]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for an outline of one reason why the pedals are designed so the
             cyclist has to wear specialist shoes and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
             it reinforces the specialist/high end market;
             and the status of the product;

             performance;
             the bike is high performance, therefore the pedalling efficiency is
             maximized by the use of specialist cycling shoes;

             market development;
             forces customers to purchase additional Porsche products;                       [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point for an explanation of each of three
             reasons why many governments promote the use of bicycles as a form of
             transport [3 max] per reason.
             health;
             cycling is a good form of exercise;
             governments have a responsibility to increase health awareness issues/
             promote healthy lifestyles;

             sustainable development;
             cycling does not cause pollution/depletion of energy resources;
             using bicycles instead of cars decreases environmental damage;

             social reasons;
             cycling can be done by most ages;
             so whole families can enjoy riding together which promotes social bonding;

             economics;
             cycling is a cheap form of transport;
             so available to all/cuts down fuel bills so releasing money to be spent on
             consumer goods;

             congestion;
             in many cities there is a problem with congestion on the roads caused by too
             many cars;
             bicycles take up much less space than cars;                                     [9 max]

8.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for outlining one reason why Honda decided to produce a hybrid
                  version of the NSX car rather than an all electric version and [1] for a brief
                  explanation [2 max].
                  with current technology electric vehicles are limited in the amount of
                  miles/kilometres they can travel before requiring a recharge;
                  hybrid vehicles provide some benefit of reduced environmental impact/
                  pollution but still allow the car to be driven for the same distance as a
                  comparable petrol/gas version;

                  if the user does not have the opportunity to recharge the car;
                  the car will still be able to be used;

                  cost;
                  hybrid vehicles are usually lower in cost than equivalent all electric vehicles
                  which widens the market for the car;                                              [2 max]

           (ii)   Award [1] for identifying how the introduction of electricity impacted on the
                  market for mass produced motor cars and [1] for a brief description
                  [2 max].
                  electricity made the assembly-line process quicker;
                  cars could be produced more cheaply which made them affordable to more
                  people;                                                                               [2]

(c)   (i)    Award [1] for outlining one reason why distribution costs will be high for
             the Geo Shelving unit and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
             the unit cannot be flat-packed;
             which means that much space will need to be used to transport it from the
             factory to the customer causing high transport costs;

             increased/more expensive packaging;
             due to the shape of the unit/to protect vulnerable parts;                         [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each for suggesting three considerations in the design of the
             Geo shelving unit relating to the effect of external loads on the unit during
             use [3 max] per consideration.
             external loads refers to objects placed on the unit;
             the unit is designed with smallest shapes at the top and largest at the bottom;
             so bigger items are stored on the lower shelves to ensure stability;

             external loads give rise to internal forces;
             tensile forces are caused by the external loading;
             and are balanced by compressive forces within the structure;
             to ensure equilibrium;

             the designer will have created a factor of safety;
             to ensure the structure can withstand higher loads than anticipated;
             as the designer will not know the exact type of external loading;

             the unit incorporates many glued surfaces;
             glue helps the internal forces to move smoothly through the structure;
             increasing stability;

             length of shelves;
             must not be too long;
             to prevent deflection/sagging;                                                    [9 max]
