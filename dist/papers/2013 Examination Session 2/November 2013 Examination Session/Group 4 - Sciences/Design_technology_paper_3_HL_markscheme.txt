Subject Details:              Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

4.   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of each of two types of food spoilage
     [3 max] per type [6 max].
     physical spoilage;
     protective outer layer of food is damaged, for example, by rough handling or pest
     damage;
     increases the chance of microbiological or chemical spoilage;

     chemical spoilage;
     leads to changes in the colour/taste of foods;
     for example, rancidity of oils/fats;

     microbiological spoilage;
     can be caused by bacteria, moulds or yeasts;
     use the food as a substrate for growth;                                                      [6 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one reason why food safety officers check that food is
           properly cooked and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           if not cooked properly any food poisoning bacteria are not killed;
           if then stored incorrectly (warm/in the temperature danger zone) they can
           multiply;                                                                                  [2]

           technology push has enabled the production of genetically modified organisms
           [3 max].
           technology enables the identification and isolation of specific genes responsible
           for particular characteristics;
           low market pull means low market demand/sales;
           this makes the product not viable in marketplace;
           so food retailers reduce/eliminate such products from stores;                            [3]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of one
           implication of low market pull for genetically modified foods, such as the
           Flavr Savr™ tomato [3 max].
           low market pull means low market demand/sales, this makes the product not
           viable in marketplace;
           resulted in low market demand/sales;
           so food retailers reduce/eliminate such products from stores;                            [3]


7.   Award [1] for each distinct point in each of three ways in which on-farm processing can
     enhance the sustainability of the rural economy [3 max] per way, [9 max] total.
     processed foods command a higher price/cost more than unprocessed materials;
     therefore farmers get a larger share of the food dollar;
     this contributes to economic sustainability;

     on-farm processing creates jobs in the rural economy;
     therefore people do not have to migrate from rural areas to find jobs;
     this contributes to social sustainability;

     consumer confidence;
     provenance is increasingly important for consumers;
     knowing where and by whom the food was produced makes it more attractive to consumers;

     on-farm processing reduces food miles/the distance that food travels from the production
     to consumption;
     less energy is invested in the production/distribution of the processed food;
     this contributes to environmental sustainability;                                          [9 max]
