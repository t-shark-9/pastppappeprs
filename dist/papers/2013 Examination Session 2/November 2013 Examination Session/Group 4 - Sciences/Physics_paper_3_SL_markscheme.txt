Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Sight and wave phenomena

1.   (a)   accommodation is the ability of the eye to bring into focus objects at different
           distances from the eye / OWTTE;
           the near point is the closest distance from the eye at which objects can be
           accommodated/seen clearly/brought into focus;
           the far point is the furthest distance from the eye at which objects can be
           accommodated/seen clearly/brought into focus;                                                [3]

     (b)   (i)    the ciliary muscles change the curvature/shape of the eye lens;
                  the ciliary muscles contract thereby decreasing its focal length;                     [2]

           (ii)   the ciliary muscles relax thereby increasing the focal length of the eye lens;        [1]
                  Award the first marking point in (b)(i) even if the answer only appears in (b)(ii).
                  Award ECF (b)(ii) if relax and contract are the wrong way round in both
                  parts of (b).



2.   (a)   observed/perceived change in pitch/frequency;
           when there is relative motion between source and observer;                                   [2]

           Award [0] for use of the moving observer Doppler equation.
           Award [2 max] for the use of +28 to give 345( m s 1 ) .
           Otherwise award only the first marking point for substitution of the incorrect
           values in the correct equation.

Option B — Quantum physics and nuclear physics

4.   (a)   (i)        electrons in the metal require a minimum amount of energy to be ejected
                      from the metal;
                      (according to wave theory) the energy of a wave is dependent on intensity
                      and not frequency;
                      so given enough time to absorb energy electron emission should take place
                      at any frequency no matter what the intensity / OWTTE;                                         [3]

           (ii)       photons have energy hf/proportional to frequency (of the light);
                      an electron may be ejected if this energy is equal to or greater than a
                      threshold value/work function;
                      the intensity determines the rate of release of photoelectrons, but not their
                      energy;                                                                                        [3]

           when VIN becomes  Vx , VOUT switches to –15 (V);

           (iii) only S’s clock measures proper time;

           (iv) according to S, Y moves towards/X moves away from the radio signal;
                the signal travels at the same speed/at the speed of light in each direction;
                therefore according to S’s clock the signal reaches Y before it reaches

      (c)   each colour/wavelength has a different refractive index / OWTTE;
            a range of wavelengths focuses different colours/wavelengths at different
            points/distances;
            reducing the range of wavelengths reduces the range of image distances/reduces

16.   (a)   net displacement of the medium;
            equals the resultant/sum of individual displacements;                                    [2]
            Award [1 max] for reference to amplitude rather than displacement.
            Award [0] for reference only to troughs and crests.

      (b)   (i)    division of wavefront so constant phase;                                          [1]

            (ii)   interference/superposition occurs at A;
                   between waves from each opening;
                   waves arrive in phase / path difference is one wavelength;
                   producing a (1st order) maximum;                                              [3 max]
                   Award [3 max] for clear points that appear on diagram.

            (iii) maxima occur when the path difference is an integral number of wavelengths;
                  because wavelength doubles, larger distances/angles required to achieve same
                  path difference;
                  successive maxima fringes are twice as far/further apart;                          [3]
                   or
                   quotes double slit/grating formula;
                   substitute 2 into equation and states all other terms stay constant;
                   successive maxima fringes are twice as far/further apart;

      (c)   Assuming spacing of openings stays the same.
            same separation of maxima;
            maxima increase in amplitude/intensity;
            maxima narrower/sharper;
            formation of secondary maxima;                                                       [2 max]
            Award [2 max] for other reasonable responses if the response clearly states an
            assumption that the openings are closer or further apart than before.
