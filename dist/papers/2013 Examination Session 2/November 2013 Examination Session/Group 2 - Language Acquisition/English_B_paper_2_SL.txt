Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.    Cultural diversity

      Your school board has proposed that students should use only English while on campus.  As the
      president of the student council, you have been asked to give a speech at the next board meeting,
      either agreeing or disagreeing with this proposal.  Write the text of your speech.


2.    Customs and traditions

      Last year, you celebrated the New Year in an English-speaking country.  You decided to write an
      article to be published in your school’s “end of year” newspaper edition in which you describe
      the event, and how similar or different it was to the New Year celebrations in your own country.


3.    Health

      Your local council recently received some money to improve the health services.  You feel strongly
      about a certain teen health problem.   Write a letter to the chairperson of your local council
      describing the problem and suggesting ways in which the money could be spent to address it.


4.    Leisure

      You and your classmates are going on a week-long expedition.   As the team leader, you have
      researched the area well, including possible dangers and risks.  To help your team members, write a
      pamphlet giving advice on how to stay healthy and safe during the expedition.


5.    Science and technology

      The town you live in lost electricity for two days!  Write a diary entry describing your life during
      these two days and reflecting on your experience.
