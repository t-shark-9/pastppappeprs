TEXT A




                              Tree Top Adventure


           Title [ – X – ]
            The best way to find out about us and
            our activities is to come along and
            see for yourself. But here are some
            answers to the questions we are
            asked all the time.

           Title [ – 1 – ]
            You will spend two or three hours
            in the trees. You can swing from tree to tree
            like Tarzan; you can climb trees with ladders made of rope
            or cross from one tree to the next on a wire. All the activities take
            place in some of the most beautiful forests in Great Britain.

           Title [ – 2 – ]
            Come for a special day, for example, a birthday party, or to have fun with friends.
            Come with colleagues from work or with family.

            Above all, come if you want an adventure. Life is so much more fun when you are
            jumping from a platform in a tree. That’s why we do it every day!

           Title [ – 3 – ]
            Anyone can. You do not have to be brave.

            Come even if you are afraid of heights. Lots of people have told us that they stopped
            being afraid of heights after they had been on one of our tree top adventures –
            and you could too.

            We’ve made the activities as open as possible to everyone. However, we do have
            a few restrictions. You must be:
            • 10 – 18 years old
            • Over 1.4 m / 4ft 7in tall
            • Under 130kg / 20.5st

           Title [ – 4 – ]
            There is a physical challenge and, therefore, there’s a certain risk. However, if you
            follow our safety instructions you cannot fall.

            Everyone wears safety equipment and one of our experienced instructors explains
            what to do. During your tree top activity we won’t supervise you. You’ll have
            more fun that way!

            “The staff were brilliant and very supportive. They helped us to not be afraid of
            heights.”
            Kate

            “Superb value for money. Fantastic fun for all ages. Staff extremely professional
            and fun.”
            Marie

            “Excellent fun! It was the best birthday party ever!”
            Caroline

            “Can’t wait for the next Tree Top Adventure. We totally enjoyed it and we want to
            try all the activities.”

                             The best way to learn English

            Although English is an official language of Hong Kong, many young Hong Kongers hesitate
            to use it. That is not because their English is bad but just that they are not confident of
            their speaking skills, say Isabella Ma Yee-nam and Matthew Shum Ho-hin.

            The couple, who have two children, wrote a book together called Slang* English which was
  5         published this month. The aim of the book is to make learning conversational English fun
            for students and young adults.

            Ma, an English teacher and oral examiner said about local students: “Their level of
            English varies. Some of them are very good. However, I notice that even if they have a very
            good result in English, they cannot communicate with Westerners in English. This is why we
10          published the book.”

            Students who use their book learn English through reading about topics like football,
            food and music. This is how Ma and her husband learned English. Ma explained that when
            she was at school teachers followed the text books and taught formal language. This type
            of learning did not inspire her. In fact, she thought that it was boring and she did not learn.
15          She told us: “I used to cheat at dictation because I did not want my parents to know how
            bad my English was”.

            Her husband said that he too failed at English. He only understood about 5 % of what the
            English teacher said even if the teacher spoke in English all the time.

            However, their English improved quickly. What changed? Like all teenagers they discovered
20          popular culture.

            Ma explained: “I listened to music and watched videos of our favourite bands. I watched
            again and again until I understood. I read their interviews in music magazines.”

            Her husband loved playing football. He was mad about the game and watched English
            football on an English TV channel. “We tried to understand what the commentator was saying.”

25          The couple hope that through their book they can share their experience and help others to
            learn English.



                                                                   ‘Slang Match’, 20 March, 2012. The Standard.

      The Next Generation
       Kirsty, 17, a pupil in Aberdeen, Scotland, gives her views on the world and her
       hopes for the future.

      What is your favourite subject and least favourite subject and why?

       My favourite subject is definitely history. If you understand the past of the individual,
       locality and nation, you have a much more informed perspective on the present day.
       However, physics and chemistry are both subjects I have never had much success in.

      What do you want to be when you finish your education?

       After my degree I want to get a postgraduate qualification in education so that I can teach
       history at secondary school level. I have a real enthusiasm for such an interesting subject
       and I would love to be able to pass this on to others.

      Where do you normally go on holiday and what do you do there?

       As a family we occasionally go [ – X – ] but our more recent [ – 23 – ] have been in Scotland.
       What we do while we’re away naturally depends on where we are, but generally in the day
       we do an [ – 24 – ] followed by a relaxing meal in the [ – 25 – ]. Although I prefer travelling
       overseas, I think that we often forget the wonderful [ – 26 – ] and attractions our country has.

      [ – 27 – ]

       Studying history has changed my perspective on many individuals I admired when I was
       younger. I now realise that popular myth is not the same as facts. Martin Luther, however,
       is one figure whose well-known story is true. I find his courage very inspiring.

      [ – 28 – ]

       Without doubt, the internet. The world wide web has really revolutionised the way we
       do things in society and has made the work of researching, producing documents and
       communicating a much faster process. From a pupil’s perspective, the internet opens access
       to a large amount of information from around the world that would be difficult to reach
       without it. It’s hard to imagine life without it.

      [ – 29 – ]

       I would try to end conflict, both individually and internationally. Organisations such as
       the UN and NATO have an important role to play in bringing peace to troubled nations.
       Although peace is a desirable objective, human nature seems to make it very difficult
       to reach.

      We should all take shorter showers




       The results of a survey in Cape Town on 400 people about how they use water
       were published yesterday at an event organized by Green Power to celebrate World
       Water Day.

       The survey found that people do not know about the importance of water
  5    sustainability. Will there be enough water for all in the future? Six in ten people
       do not know that if they use too much water, they cause environmental pollution.
       Two thirds of them have no idea that when they shower, they use most of the
       water they need in a day. Almost 20 % of the people interviewed shower for more
       than 20 minutes.

10     “The public do not pay attention when they use water because people do not
       know about water resources. Since the water supply seems dependable and costs
       are low, people do not realize the importance of taking care of water”, said
       Green Power senior environmentalist Mathew Sin Kar-wah.

       “People here use, on average, 220 litres of water every day. That is higher than the
15     global average,” Sin Kar-wah said.

       Water treatment also puts large quantities of carbon dioxide into the air which
       makes the city’s air quality problems worse.

       The survey also showed that people are afraid of using recycled water.
       More than 60 % of the people who answered the survey did not want it for
20     drinking or showering. Green Power said that attitudes to recycled water must
       change in order for there always to be enough water for everyone’s needs.
