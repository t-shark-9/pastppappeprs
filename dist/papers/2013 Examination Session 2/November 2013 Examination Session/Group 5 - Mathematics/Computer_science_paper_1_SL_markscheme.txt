Mark Allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

         Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
           semi-colon (;).

         An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
           be accepted.

         Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

         If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
           same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

         Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
           got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
           wrong.

         Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
           linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
           accuracy.

         Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
           subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
           the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
           be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.
