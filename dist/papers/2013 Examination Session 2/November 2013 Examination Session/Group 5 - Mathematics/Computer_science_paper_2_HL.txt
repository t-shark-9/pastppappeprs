Answer all the questions.

1.    A program is written to help farm management.  The following class is used to create
      objects representing fields in a farm.

      public class FarmField
      {
        String fieldName;    // Unique name for the field
        int fieldSize;       // Size of the field in square metres
        int soilType;        // A value indicating soil acidity
        int fertilizerType; // A value indicating the type of fertilizer
        int cropType;        // Crop type: 1=Corn, 2=Soybeans, 3=Alfalfa, etc.
      }

      (a)   (i)    Construct an empty FarmField object named firstField.                            [1 mark]

            (ii)   Construct the statements that will assign values of a 12,000 square metre
                   field named “Back forty” to the firstField object.                               [2 marks]

      The class Farm is used to store the information for each farm.

      Each Farm object contains:
      • the name of the farmer
      • an ID number for the farm
      • the number of fields in that farm
      • an array of FarmField objects called theFields.

      (b)   Construct the class Farm.                                                               [3 marks]

      The data for a number of farms is stored in the array allFarms[].  The array contains
      more elements than there are Farm objects.  The first part of the array contains Farm
      objects and the remainder of the array contains null elements.

      (c)   Construct the method findLargest that will return the size of the largest field
            from all of the farms that have data stored in the array.  It has been started below.

            int findLargest(Farm[] allFarms)
            {
            		       …
            }                                                                                       [6 marks]

      (d)   Describe, with the help of diagrams, how a new Farm object can be inserted at
            the beginning of the array allFarms[].                                                  [4 marks]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      The FarmPasture class is used to create objects representing fields in which animals
      are kept.

      public class FarmPasture
      {
        String fieldName;   // Unique name for the field
        int fieldSize;      // Size of the field in square metres
        int animalType;     // Animal type: 1=Cow, 2=Sheep, 3=Hog, etc.
        int animalNumber;   // The number of animals in the pasture
      }

      (e)   Suggest, with the use of code, how inheritance could be used to avoid duplication
            of common elements between the FarmField and FarmPasture classes.                   [4 marks]

                                                   –4–                N13/5/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

2.    A large collection of names is stored in a binary search tree of NameNode objects.

      public class NameNode
      {
           public String name;
           public NameNode leftChild;
           public NameNode rightChild;

            public NameNode(String newName)
            {
                 name = newName;
                 leftChild = null;
                 rightChild = null;
            }
      }


      (a)   Explain why, in the above class, the variable leftChild is of type NameNode.        [2 marks]

      The binary search tree is an instance of the Tree class.

      public class Tree
      {
           public NameNode treeRoot;

            public Tree()
            {
                 treeRoot = null;
            }

            void addNode(NameNode newNode)
            {
                 ... // Adds a node to a tree
            }

            boolean findName(String givenName)
            {
                 ...
            }

            void displayNames(NameNode root)
            {
                 ...
            }
      }

      (b)   Outline the result of executing the following code.

            Tree myTree = new Tree();
            myTree.addNode(new NameNode(“Charley”));                                            [2 marks]



                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      Further nodes are added to the tree.

      (c)   In parts (i) and (ii) below, you can assume that the corresponding method was
            passed the variable searchName.

            (i)    Outline the steps required to delete the appropriate node if the node
                   containing searchName was found to be a leaf node.                       [4 marks]

            (ii)   Explain how the process becomes more complex if the node to be deleted
                   has a single child (which is a leaf node).                               [2 marks]

      (d)   Construct the method findName() that will return true if givenName is already
            in the tree myTree and false otherwise.                                         [4 marks]

      (e)   Construct the recursive method displayNames() that outputs in alphabetical
            order the list of names stored in an instance of the Tree class.                [6 marks]

3.    A team of marine biologists is tracking the movements of a large number of whales.  
      Each whale has a device attached to it that transmits the whale’s identifier number and
      location every time it surfaces after a dive.  A computer in a research lab receives all
      of these location reports.

      The lab computer also maintains a direct access master file that includes a record for
      each whale being tracked.  These records contain:

      •     an identifier number for the whale
      •     the number of dives the whale has made
      •     the last recorded location of the whale
      •     the total distance the whale has travelled
      •     the date and time of the last location report.

      (a)      Identify the key field of the master file.                                           [1 mark]

      (b)      (i)    Suggest how the direct access master file should be organized,
                      including any conditions that should be placed on the key field.              [3 marks]

               (ii)   Describe the processing that would take place to allow a particular record
                      to be accessed.                                                               [3 marks]

      Each time a whale surfaces, its device sends the whale’s identifier number and
      current location.

      (c)      Outline how the appropriate record in the master file will be updated each time a
               location report is received.                                                         [5 marks]

      As each location report is received it is added to an archive file.  Over a period of time,
      this archive file will contain far more data than could be loaded into the
      lab computer’s memory.

      (d)      Describe how the archive file could be sorted by the lab computer.                   [4 marks]

      (e)      Discuss any ethical issues that should be considered before deciding whether to
               release this information into the public domain.                                     [4 marks]
