Text 1

Candidates are required to analyse an article by Eddy Patricelli from the online magazine,
ISLANDS, 7 February 2012.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• consider the intended audience as, perhaps, persons interested in travelling to island
  destinations, possibly the Mentawai islands in Indonesia, or the Kandui Resort
• consider the purpose of the article, perhaps seeing it as an attempt to entertain or inform
• consider contextual elements such as time, place and content. For example, the way it depicts
  an unusual “slice of life” view of the resort threatened by a tsunami after an earthquake in the
  region
• consider the different cultural backgrounds; for example, how the two different cultures view
  the game of ping pong or the spirit of competition
• identify features of the online magazine: embedded internet sites, ability to purchase a print or
  electronic subscription, tweet, comment on article, etc
• consider the layout of the article: varied fonts, the bold title, preface, an accompanying photo,
  links by phone or email to the Kandui Resort, etc
• discuss the style of the article: first person narrative, use of present tense to convey
  immediacy, the way the reader’s curiosity about this weird ping-pong game is aroused and
  brought to a climactic conclusion, the embedding of information within the narrative, use of
  dialogue, etc
• consider the title as gleaned from an understanding of the article itself, for example the “wild
  spin” as the projection of the ping-pong ball itself, the joy found in the quirks caused by the
  ball rather than by the game, the “spin” of the writer, etc.
                                                –4–           N13/1/AYENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A good to very good analysis will also:

• consider more closely the nature of the intended audience as, perhaps, the kind of traveller or
  reader more interested in culture than leisure
• seeing clearly that the purpose is both to entertain and to inform
• offer a more detailed analysis of contextual elements in text and photo. For example, give
  more careful consideration of the culture depicted: the characterization of the teens
  (their appearance, language, families in Padang, aspects of time, place and atmosphere
  (hanging out early in the morning, finding relief in the craziness of the game), the “sculpted
  paddle”, the words of the “elder”, etc
• explore language, style and format more closely: use of metaphor (for example, terms
  of assault) and simile, the short, staccato sentences, alliteration, onomatopoeia, variety of
  language (for example, non-standard English, narrative transitions, educated terminology, use
  of pauses, etc) and the structure of the article
• consider more closely the play on words in the title
• offer a closer analysis of the narrative voice: self-effacing, ironic, older/more thoughtful than
  the teens, anxious (bad dream), confused, in need of “joy”.

Text 2

Candidates are required to analyse a vintage advertisement for Campbell’s tomato soup from
TIME magazine, 12 November 1934.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• consider the purpose and intended audience for this advertisement in TIME magazine as,
  perhaps, the female readers, housewives, who would be likely to purchase this product
• consider the contextual elements as learned from the time period of the publication, the visual
  elements, the use of language, etc
• discuss some elements of persuasion, such as: the “richness” of the soup compared to the
  richness of the setting, the depiction of worry-free entertaining, the characterization of the
  housewife as a “hostess”, the “home-made” quality of the soup, the idea of getting “more” for
  less money, the “snob appeal” of the photo, the use of “stacking” of reasons why the product
  is good, the repetition of “Campbell’s” to link the reader to the product, the emotional appeal
  of being able to serve guests Campbell’s soup without being “afraid” and the ease of making a
  meal seem homemade without spending hours in the kitchen; there is even the implication
  that “you” will be more personally attractive if you use this product
• discuss the nature of the photographs and their relevance to the selling of the product.
  Observations might include the housewife as a poised and confident “hostess”
  (body language), the setting as elegant (dress, jewelry, iron railing, painting in the background,
  flowers at waist, graceful hands), the hostess as situated on the stairs so as to be “above” it all,
  the photo of the soup in a fine china bowl, and the smallest picture – the can of soup
• consider some stylistic features of the text, such as: the opening assertion, the singling
  out of key words and phrases in quotes, the polished diction (“assembled,” “demeanor,”
  “presiding lady”), the adjectives describing the soup and its preparation, the placement of
  exclamation points, noticing, perhaps, how the variety of fonts lead the eye to the can of soup
  at the bottom, or that the light bulbs of the candelabra at the top represent getting a good
  idea, etc
• consider the overall effectiveness of the advertisement.


A good to very good analysis will also:

• explore more closely the intended audience, perhaps considering that this advertisement
  occurred during the Depression and might have played on the desire of the common
  housewife to “escape” the routine dullness of a can of soup, or the “fear” of the wealthier
  hostess about serving canned soup to her guests
• consider more closely and thoroughly the elements of persuasion
• consider more carefully the underlying contextual implications of the text
• explore in greater depth and with more sophistication the overall effectiveness of this
  advertisement.
