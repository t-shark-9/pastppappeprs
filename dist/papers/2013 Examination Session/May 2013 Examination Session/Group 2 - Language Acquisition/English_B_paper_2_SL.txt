Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.    Cultural diversity

      Many of your friends have decided to have tattoos, but you disagree as this could have future
      negative consequences both socially and professionally.  Write an article for the local newspaper’s
      Teen Talk section explaining your thoughts.


2.    Customs and traditions

      A friend from a different country and culture has written to tell you that he/she has been invited for a
      weekend to celebrate a special event in your country but has no idea what will happen!  Write a set of
      guidelines explaining what will take place and what he/she should do.


3.    Health

      The local government in your town has decided to give free medical care to people who do
      not smoke; however, people who do smoke will be required to pay for all their medical care.  
      Write a letter to your local government representative expressing your viewpoint on this matter.


4.    Leisure

      Parents who attend their children’s competitive sports events are the best of fans, yet it could be
      argued that this puts more pressure on the children.   As the captain of a sports team, you have
      been asked to speak at the Parent-Teacher Association’s monthly meeting about this situation.  
      Write your speech.


5.    Science and technology

      Film directors frequently use computers to change the scenes they film.  Cloudy days are modified
      to blue skies and sunshine, for example.  Your teacher has set the weekly essay on this topic and the
      title is: “Computer Improvements to Films: More enjoyable or cheating?”  Write the essay.
