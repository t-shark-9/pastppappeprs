            Hinglish

            Talking about Hinglish 

            Today I met Aditya for lunch at the Pavilion Café in downtown Mumbai. He was
            very excited about the Indian Home Ministry’s decision to allow the use of Hinglish,
            a mixture of Hindi and English, rather than use the more difﬁcult words in Hindi.
 5          He said that kunjipatal is much more complicated to say than “keyboard” and
            sanganak doesn’t make as much sense as “computer” to most people.

            I argued that people will lose their identities as Hindi speakers and no longer know
            their ﬁrst language. My friend Aditya said that he’d grown up in Delhi and gone to
            a Hindi-speaking school; however, outside the classroom he was hearing so many
10          different Indian languages as well as English that he supposed he didn’t even realise
            how many foreign words, not just English, he used.

            I still felt that mixing two languages to make new words that don’t already exist is silly.
            Aditya almost agreed, but then insisted that ﬁlmi, for example, is a “good” word as it
            describes the dramatic situations typical of Bollywood ﬁlms.

15          Aditya said that language is meant to make communication quicker as well as to make
            sure that the other person understands clearly what you are trying to say. He said
            that if a word is correct in Hindi, but nobody uses or understands it, what’s the point
            of having it?

            I think he’s right! We have lots of words in English that were originally in different
20          languages, look at “shampoo”, which meant “rubbing” in Hindi, or “bungalow” or
            “pyjamas”!

            So, I agreed with Aditya that Hinglish isn’t such a bad idea – he even paid for lunch …
              
            Until tomorrow, I need to study for my maths test now, good night!

      The Symbolic Fish Eagle



       The national bird of Zambia is the Fish Eagle. Found in almost every part of Africa,
       Fish Eagles have a distinctive call that has become a symbol of Africa. Oddly, the
       females are larger than the males which are between 63 and 65 cm in length.
       They mainly eat ﬁsh, but can also feed on monkeys, lizards, frogs and terrapins.
 5     They are classiﬁed as “kleptoparasites” as they also steal the prey from other birds.
       They are able to catch ﬁsh of up to 1 kg in weight, although there are instances of
       heavy catches of up to 3 kg. The larger ﬁsh are not carried, but planed across the
       water’s surface.

       Contrary to popular belief, the Fish Eagles are not “eagle-eyed” as they cannot spot
10     prey when they are soaring up in the sky. Rather, the Fish Eagle will perch on a tree
       near the water’s edge, from where it swoops down and catches the prey with its
       wicked talon.

       When a Fish Eagle mates, it mates for life and the pair often share their catches.

       All is not well with the Fish Eagle: in some countries,
15     the eagles are under threat from Furadan, a highly
       toxic pesticide of which a single grain can kill a child.
       The poisoning is a result of local herdsmen feeding
       Furadan to ﬁsh in the hope of poisoning crocodiles who
       eat their goats when they come to the water to drink.

20     Further threats to their existence are the declining supplies
       of ﬁsh caused by overﬁshing and deforestation, as the
       eagles are very particular about where they build nests
       to breed.

       The Zambian Government is now taking steps to ban the
25     use of Furadan and to control ﬁshing and the cutting
       of trees.

                                                                              The Lowdown (2011)

            Tokyo in
            2 hours:
            Hypersonic jet
            flights by 2050
            A quick trip
            Anyone taking this new aircraft on the London to Tokyo route should not expect any in-flight
            entertainment – you’d reach your destination before the titles finished.

            [–X–]
 5          The futuristic, transparent jet would take a little more than two hours to complete the trip as,
            using three sets of engines, it cruises at the hypersonic velocity of 5000 kph (3125 mph)
            – more than four times the speed of sound – and will carry up to 100 passengers.

            [ – 23 – ]
            It would be one of the world’s cleanest aircraft, powered by biofuels made of seaweed, making it
10          one of the world’s most eco-friendly aircraft.  Innovation and technology director Jean Botti said
            that the plane would fly just above the top of the atmosphere at about 48 km (30 miles).  

            [ – 24 – ]
            Once at a suitable height, the pilot would engage a pair of rocket engines which would propel
            the aircraft to much higher speeds and soar above the atmosphere, allowing a final set of engines
15          known as ramjets to be utilised.  The cruising altitude will be just over 30 miles above the earth
            and Mr Botti told us that for conventional passenger jets it is around six miles.  “We have been
            working on this project for long enough now to know that it is viable.”  After a smooth glide to
            come down, the conventional engines will reignite to enable landing.

            [ – 25 – ]
20          At cruising speed, the plane – dubbed ZEHST, for Zero Emission Hypersonic Transportation
            – could fly from London to Malaga in southern Spain in just 20 minutes.  A flight to Istanbul
            would take 30 minutes and the plane could reach the east coast of the US in around one hour.  
            It would reduce by some nine hours the flying time to Tokyo, while the journey to Sydney would
            take around three-and-a-half hours.  But don’t rush to book tickets just yet – the plane will not
25          make its first commercial flight for about 35 years!


                                                                                          The Telegraph (2011)

             Teens texting bring back languages from the edge
             of extinction

             While some may complain about the possible
             death of the English language because of
             texting abbreviations (LOL!1), teenagers all
             over the world have actually kept endangered
    5        languages intact through SMS2 messages.

             Text messages written in regional,
             endangered languages by teens in Mexico
             and the Philippines are examples of
             languages reborn. Research into language
10           renewal was carried out by Samuel Herrera,
             head of the linguistics laboratory at the
             Institute of Anthropological Research in
             Mexico City.

             “Almost as soon as text messaging exploded on the world stage as a means to reach anyone,
15           anywhere and anytime, young people began to find a way to make it more exclusive and develop
             their own code to use on the popular devices,” he wrote.

             Professor Adam Michaelson, the director of the Institute for Endangered Languages of Corban
             University in Salem, Oregon, says that somewhere between the ages of six and twenty-five,
             people make a definitive decision as to whether or not they will stay or break with a language.
20           The fact that they have taken the old and changed it into the new is something that not only
             makes sense, but also drives the continuation of culture. In fact, according to Dr Gregory
             Anderson, who is a researcher in the same department, young people need to be the ones
             reviving a dying language. This is, of course, the language that they will nurture and use as
             their own. For this reason, he has high hopes for the future.

25           “If the language isn’t being used by their peer group, then they reject it outright,”
             Anderson concluded.

             So, while some text messages may seem like a foreign language — like “nom nom”3 — some
             may actually be in languages considered nearly gone. Who knows, maybe Latin will become
             popular? Only time will tell.

                                                                    Adapted from www.nbcnews.com (2012)
