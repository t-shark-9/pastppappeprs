TEXT A

             Choosing a university in South Africa
 Five people talk about their reasons for choosing a university and what they enjoyed best there.

 “I studied medicine at the University of Pretoria. I think that it is important to choose a university
 where there is a course you are very interested in. It is a decision which will inﬂuence your choice of
 profession and the rest of your life.

 In my opinion, in order to really enjoy university, a student should not just study all the time but take
 part in several university clubs and organizations. Sometimes I found it difﬁcult to do all the homework
 for my classes. I was busy all the time!”
                                                                                                Zanele

 “I studied at the University of Witwatersrand. I chose to go there because it is known for academic
 excellence. It is so important to get a good academic qualiﬁcation if you want to get a good job.

 When I was there I most enjoyed meeting people from different origins. I learnt to look at the world
 from different perspectives. Today I am still in contact with many people I met there when I was a
 student.”
                                                                                         Akhona


 “I went to the University of Cape Town because I wanted to have a complete change of lifestyle.

 Living on my own and learning to ﬁnd my own way in the world was the best aspect of university.
 On the other hand, I must say that after a few months, I missed the comforts of home!” Nsovo


 “I studied by correspondence and only went to class once a month. I decided to take this type of course
 because university costs were not very high. My experience of university was, of course, different from
 the experience of my friends who were going to classes every day.

 For me, the best moments were when I met other students in the monthly classes. We exchanged our
 ideas and opinions and I learnt so much from listening to other students. When I was in those classes,
 I really felt part of a student community.”
                                                                                      Noluthando


 “I studied environmental law at the University of Johannesburg. I chose this university because I wanted
 to be a lawyer and because the lecturers are qualiﬁed lawyers.

 I really liked the fact that we were always well prepared for the lecture because we could download the
 lecture notes from the web site before class. Even if there were many other positive aspects to life at
 university, personally I enjoyed the lectures most.”                                         Casey

        The Transport Department will soon begin a survey to find out about future transport
       services and facilities. It will take four months to finish. Transport Department officers will
       visit 50,000 homes and have face-to-face interviews with all members of the family, aged two
       and above. The people who are going to be interviewed will be told the date in advance.
 5     If someone is too old to answer the questions, other family members can reply for them.

        The questions will be about the working day – how do they travel to work, how much
       time do they spend waiting and travelling and what is the cost of travel. They will also be
       asked for their opinions on different kinds of travel. “In recent years, more and more people
       seem to be interested in walking or using bicycles,” transport officer Loo said. “We have asked
 10    questions about this too in the survey.”

        The people who are going to carry out the survey will wear dark blue jackets and
       carry bags with the official Hong Kong government logo. They are also going to have an
       identity card.

        Transport officer Loo said that some Hong Kong residents can choose to complete the
 15    questionnaire online if they are not at home for the Transport Department officers’ visit.
       However, they are encouraged to accept the home visit. They can call a special telephone
       number to arrange a date and time for the visit after they receive the letter about the survey.

                                          Help someone in need

                                                                                             December 2012

                    My dear friend,

                   For some people in Great Britain, winter is the coldest, loneliest and most difficult
                    time of the year. With your support our charitable organization can bring hope to
                    people in need – to someone who is homeless, to families who are poor and to isolated
     5              older people.

                   Our workers and volunteers go out onto the streets and give out much-needed hot
                    drinks, food and sleeping bags. We are also responsible for centres where poor people
                    can come for a meal, a shower and some clean clothes. If there is space, we offer them
                    a bed.

     10            Will you help us? With your help, we can help isolated older people who have only the
                    television for company. By supporting us today you will make sure that people in need
                    have the chance of a little happiness. Just £11*, for example, will help us to invite two
                    older people for a filling lunch, where they will enjoy not just good food, but also a few
                    hours of much-needed company and friendship. A little more money, for example £19,
     15             will help us to give a box of gifts to a family in need, full of healthy food and clothes
                    and toys for the children. Or, if you can, £47 will help us to offer a homeless person a
                    hot meal and a warm bed in one of our centres at one of the coldest times of the year.

                   Although this help is urgent, it will last for a long time after this cold season. In many
                    cases, the help will change lives. Once we have made contact, we stay in touch: we
     20             welcome people in need at our regular lunch clubs and we visit them in their homes.

                   I hope that you will join us by helping people in need. A gift from you today will bring
                    help and hope to many poor people this season.

                    Yours sincerely,
