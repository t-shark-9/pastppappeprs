Subject Details:              Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for stating one reason why craft-produced breads are generally more
           expensive than mass-produced breads.
           craft production is a labour-intensive process / smaller batches more work/time
           input per loaf;
           more expensive raw materials / specialist ingredients;                              [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying how gluten in flour contributes to the final texture of
           dough and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           gluten is the protein in flour which it hydrates to form an elastic matrix;
           this contributes to the elastic nature of the bread dough;                              [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of how the addition
           of yeast to bread dough contributes to the physical properties of
           bread [3 max].
           lowers the density of the dough/bread;
           yeast ferments sugar to carbon dioxide which aerates/produces small gas bubbles
           in the dough;
           the dough/gas expands during heating;
           cooking denatures the gluten so becomes inelastic/retains deformed shape/aerated/
           leavened bread;                                                                     [3 max]



A2. (a)    Award [1] for stating one advantage of the FlavrSavr™ tomato over traditionally
           grown tomatoes.
           can be ripened on the vine;
           are fuller flavoured;
           longer shelf-life / store/keep better;
           have firmer skins;                                                                  [1 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for a reason why the FlavrSavr™ tomato was withdrawn from the
           market and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           public concerns over the safety of genetically-modified organisms / consumer
           scepticism about GMOs;
           some people think that genetic modification is playing God and is wrong;
           reduced market demand makes product unsustainable/unless people buy a product
           it is not commercially viable and therefore unsustainable;                          [2 max]
                                                –7–              M13/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A3. (a)    Award [1] for one reason why it is important that governments raise public
           awareness of food-related health issues and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           eating the wrong balance of foods can result in a wide range of chronic/acute
           food-related issues, for example, obesity, diabetes, food poisoning;
           governments can reduce the incidence of these by providing educational materials
           to raise public awareness of health-related issues/reduce cost of healthcare
           provision;
           governments have a moral responsibility for public health;
           government policies educate public/advocate healthy eating;                        [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct points in an identification of why
           “The eatwell plate” system would not be appropriate for children below the age
           of two years [2 max].
           babies and very young children have different nutritional requirements to older
           children/adults;
           babies and very young children need energy-dense foods/their digestive systems
           cannot cope with the wide range of foods on the eatwell plate some of which are
           difficult to digest;                                                                   [2]



A4. Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of how travel and
    the media have promoted the development of an international cuisine
    [3 max] for travel and [3 max] for the media.
    Travel:
    through travelling and eating out more in restaurants people are exposed to different
    dishes;
    on their return home they want to recreate their holiday experiences;
    supermarkets/other food outlets now carry a wide range of authentic ingredients so they
    are able to do this;

     The media:
     cookery books/programmes/commercials/articles in newspapers/magazines present
     dishes from other cultures;
     they show people how dishes from different cultures should be prepared/served;
     people are able to experiment for themselves;                                                [6]
                                                 –8–               M13/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A5. (a)   Award [1] for describing one measure used to estimate the number of hungry
          people in a country and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
          global hunger index;
          a composite measure/multidimensional statistical tool that reflects the number of
          hungry people in a country;

          undernourishment;
          a state in which food intake is insufficient to meet basic energy requirements on a
          continuing basis;

          undernutrition;
          wasting/stunting/underweight results from prolonged low levels of food
          intake/poor absorption of food consumed;                                               [2 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for listing two criteria for food security [2 max].
          sufficient food is available;
          supplies of food are relatively stable;
          people in need of food can obtain it;                                                  [2 max]

    (c)   Award [1] for identifying one reason why international strategies for maintaining
          food security are important and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
          when a country is unable to respond to food insecurity resulting from warfare,
          drought/other natural disasters, etc;
          it is critical that the international community (usually through the auspices of the
          United Nations) intervenes/reacts to deal with the potential ensuing
          disaster/famine;                                                                           [2]


A6. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of one way in which
          proper cooking of food can help control food poisoning [3 max].
          cooking raises the temperature of food about 78 degrees Celsius;
          this kills bacteria;
          it is the growth/proliferation of food poisoning bacteria on food which causes food
          poisoning;                                                                                 [3]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of one way in which
          good personal hygiene can help to prevent food poisoning [3 max].
          coughing/spitting/touching of food can contaminate food with food poisoning
          bacteria;
          if food is not kept out of the temperature danger zone then the bacteria will
          multiply in food;
          consumption of the food will then cause food poisoning;
          hand washing (and other aspects of good personal hygiene) reduces bacterial load
          on hands/reduces potential for contamination of food when touching it;                 [3 max]
                                                    –9–         M13/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


A7. Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of each of three
    implications of urbanization for the food industry in developed countries. [3 max] for
    each factor.
    high population density / lots of people live in a small area;
    urban dwellers often totally reliant on the food industry for the provision of their
    dietary needs;
    they no longer have access to land for growing of food;

     food is a highly-perishable commodity;
     food processing (freezing, canning, etc) extends shelf-life of foods;
     this can facilitate distribution from rural areas where food produced to urban areas
     where food consumed;

     food manufacturers operate just-in-time (JIT) systems to deliver food to the point
     of sale;
     CIM/logistics enable this;
     they ensure the right amounts of food products are available as and when required by
     consumers;

     more food shops;
     provide access to food in urban areas;
     encourage/promote the development of new food products;

     better law enforcement;
     easier access for law enforcement officials;
     forces higher standards;                                                                [9 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for substituting appropriately into the formula T = CR and [1] for a
           calculation showing units [2 max].
           T = CR;
           T = 470  50000 = 23500000 microseconds ;
           T = 0.000470  50000 = 23.5 seconds;                                                     [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of how the circuit
           operates when the switch is opened [3 max].
           when the switch opens, the voltage on the capacitor rises;
           the timer starts;
           when the voltage on the capacitor meets/exceeds that of the R1 R2 divider the
           comparator switches low, so turning on/activating the relay;

           when switch opens, current from the resistor flows into the capacitor;
           capacitor charges / its voltage rises from 0V;
           after some time it goes above/exceeds the voltage at the +/non-inverting input and the
           output from the op amp switches over/becomes zero/low;
           turns on/activates relay;                                                                [3 max]
