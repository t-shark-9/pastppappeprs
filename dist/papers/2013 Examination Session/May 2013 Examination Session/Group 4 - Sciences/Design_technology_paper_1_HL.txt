28.   A salad spinner (Figure 8) can be used to dry salad leaves after washing.   It comprises a bowl,
      a basket with lots of holes and a lid with a handle.  The handle is linked to a small gear (A) with
      12 teeth which meshes with a large gear (B) with 48 teeth (Figure 9).  The large gear is part of the lid
      and fits into the basket so that when the handle is turned the basket spins inside the bowl and water is
      separated from the salad leaves and collects in the bowl.

Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

The Sieger can opener (Figure 11) was invented and patented in 1913.   It made can opening easy for
the first time and is recognised as a design classic.  The Sieger Eminent can opener was first produced
in 1949 to expand the product range and is still in commercial production.   It consists of a metal
(steel) cutting blade attached to a ratchet and a handle which acts as a lever.  Its design has changed little
since it was first invented.  The Sieger company now produces a range of can openers for commercial
and household use so it is an example of a robust design which evolved into a product family.
