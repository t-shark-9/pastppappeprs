Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                             Section B
Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

      It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts
       of the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the
       most evidence.

        Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain
         [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa). The important point is to be
         consistent in the awarding of the quality marks.

        Indicate the award of quality marks by stamping Qcl or Qst, or both in red at the end of the
         answer and enter a quality mark of 0, 1 or 2 in the mark panel.

              population

           allele/gene is on the X chromosome;
           Reject disease/hemophilia carried on X chromosome.
           (sex chromosomes in) females are XX while males are XY;
           Y chromosomes do not have the allele/hemophiliac males are XhY;
           males inherit their X chromosome from their mother/do not pass the allele to sons;
           males have only one copy so recessive trait/allele is not masked;
           males have a 50 % chance of hemophilia/receiving the allele if mother is a carrier;
           carrier is heterozygous for the gene/is XHXh;
           dominant/normal allele masks the recessive allele (so clotting is normal);
           females inherit one X chromosome from father and one from mother;
           affected/hemophiliac males have carrier daughters;
           hemophilia allele could have been inherited from either parent;                          [8 max]
