                                              SECTION B

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.    (a)   Using a diagram, describe how expansionary monetary policy might be used to
            close a deflationary (recessionary) gap.                                           [10 marks]

      (b)   Discuss why, in contrast to the monetarist/new classical model, an economy
            can remain stuck in a deflationary (recessionary) gap according to the
            Keynesian model.                                                                   [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain how labour market reforms may be used to promote economic growth.          [10 marks]

      (b)   “Market-oriented supply-side policies will always be more effective in promoting
            economic growth than demand-side policies.” To what extent do you agree with
            this statement?                                                                    [15 marks]
