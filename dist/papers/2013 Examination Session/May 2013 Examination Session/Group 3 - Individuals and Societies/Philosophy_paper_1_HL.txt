                                                           SECTION A

Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [30 marks].

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.       Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

         The 21st century is unprecedented in providing the possibility of complete escape … it offers the
         alternative of being “nobody”, a persistent passive recipient of sensation. The “nobody” world offers
         a here-and-now immediacy and sensory power that, for many, is the conscious context of many of
         their waking hours.
         Normally we learn to empathize from real conversations where we rehearse eye contact and learn
         to interpret body language and how and when to give someone a hug. We then progress to reading
         novels and understanding how differently people can see the world, how they feel and interpret the
         actions of others. However, in screen activities, such as in video games, the same insights are not so
         readily available: after all, this is a world of outward movement rather than inner feelings.
         (We) are perhaps heading towards a much weaker sense of identity by engaging in a world where
         we are the passive recipient of senses and where there is no fixed narrative of past and future but
         an atomized thrill of the moment. One could even suggest that the constant self-centred readout on
         Twitter belies a more childlike insecurity, an existential crisis. Similarly, the rising obsession to be
         seen by others, to live your life through the eyes of others, suggests a fragile sense of identity that
         needs instant and continuous feedback.

Answer two questions from this section, each chosen from a different Optional Theme. Each question in

      communities, for example, distribution of wealth?

Optional Theme 3: Philosophy of religion

7.    Explain and discuss the nature of religious experience.


8.    Explain and discuss the nature of faith in a Higher Being.



Optional Theme 4: Philosophy of art

      political experience.


10.   Evaluate the claim that any interpretation of art must include the intention of the artist.

Optional Theme 5: Political philosophy

11.   Evaluate the claim that the justice of a society’s rules and practices (for example, the definition and
      regulation of property, the division of labour, gender relations, and political and economic competition)

      the interests of past and future persons.


12.   Evaluate the claim that democracy is impossible without equality between the genders.



Optional Theme 6: Non-Western traditions and perspectives

13.   With reference to at least one of the non-Western traditions you have studied, explain and discuss

      what are the limits of authority in personal and social contexts.



Optional Theme 7: Contemporary social issues

15.   Evaluate philosophically the extent to which technological progress enhances or limits the possibility
      of living a better life.


16.   Evaluate philosophically the extent to which we are entitled to practise civil disobedience and
