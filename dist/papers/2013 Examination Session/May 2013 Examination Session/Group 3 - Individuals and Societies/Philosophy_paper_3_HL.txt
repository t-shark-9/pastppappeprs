     to philosophy

Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

Read the text below then write a response to it (of approximately 800 words).              Your response is
worth [30 marks]. In your response include:

   • a concise description of philosophical activity as presented in the text
   • an exploration of the pertinent issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text, relating this
     to your experience of doing philosophy throughout the whole course
   • appropriate references to the text that illustrate your understanding of philosophical activity
   • your personal evaluation of the issues regarding philosophical activity raised in the text.


             Philosophy (in general) has a constitutive relation to the distinction between legitimate and
      illegitimate forms of persuasion; between being, say, rationally convinced (the aim of philosophy
      proper) and being merely persuaded (the upshot of being taken in by, say, sophistry and illusion).
      Within analytic philosophy today … this distinction is most often cast in terms of the presence or
 5    absence in a text of a clearly stated argument. Such an argument would present something like a
      series of valid inferential steps from premises to conclusions. In the absence of such … “narrow
      argument” what one does cannot be a rationally “convincing expression of a philosopher’s claim on
      people’s attention”. Now, among the complaints one often hears directed against so-called continental
      philosophy is the perceived lack in it of clearly stated narrow arguments.

10          Socrates is often cited as a model of philosophical objectivity and integrity, famed for his
      willingness to “follow the argument where it leads”. Inheritances of philosophy that do not take the
      [narrow argument] path are often thought to have departed from … “the dialogue of reason” which
      takes Socrates as its model. On the other hand, however, Socrates is equally famed as the gadfly who
      addressed himself to others, the one who talked philosophically to other people. And, whether or not
15    one explicitly attends to the point in one’s own writing it is clear that who one is addressing makes a
      huge difference to one’s prospects of convincing by means of narrow argument. As Cora Diamond
      observes in the following passage, this issue is especially acute in relation to our moral thinking:

            “When we engage in philosophical discussion about such a subject as abortion, or the moral
            status of animals, whom should we think of ourselves as trying to convince? For if we
20          proceed by giving arguments, we presumably do not expect to be able to convince anyone
            who is incapable of following our arguments, or who is too prejudiced to consider them.

            And if we are talking about convincing human beings, surely it is a fact about many of them
            that one certain way of not convincing them is to try arguing the case … No one who urges
            another philosopher to give arguments thinks of arguments as capable of convincing everybody.
25          When we put forward arguments, or urge someone else to do so, we have a conception of what
            it would be to succeed in giving genuinely convincing arguments, and also of those who would
            nevertheless not be convinced, even should they attend to the arguments. Now, argument is
            simply one way people approach moral questions, and there are other ways of trying to convince
            someone of one’s view of animals or foetuses or slaves or children or whatever it may be.”

30          This is not an argument utterly against narrow argument. Diamond has no intention of suggesting
      any impropriety in the thought that developing such arguments is what “all [philosophers] do some
      or most of the time”. Indeed, as I have suggested, one is likely to find narrow arguments in all the
      writings of the major so-called “continental philosophers” too. However, what Diamond wants to
      encourage her readers to acknowledge is that it is actually quite perverse to think that this is all that
35    any philosophers do, … as if giving an argument in the narrow sense was the only thing which would
      represent a genuinely convincing expression of a philosopher’s claim on people’s attention.

             When he reflects on … analytic philosophy today, Bernard Williams is struck by how little
      attention is given to the fact that the recommended way of [doing] philosophy, namely the resort to
      narrow argument, would not actually convince many of those whose attention it claims [even though]
40    it is being held up as exemplary …

             Diamond, however, is not convinced that the [narrowly argumentative] way of thinking is
      genuinely exemplary, for she is not convinced that it correctly identifies “which human capacities
      are characteristically exercised in the development of [for example] someone’s moral life, and more
      specifically of what it is for someone to exercise his [or her] capacities as a thinking being in that
45    development” … [She, and Williams to some extent, disagree with seeing narrow argument as of
      first importance for philosophy, and thus the best way of reasonably convincing others, because it
      massively under-estimates the importance of imaginative capacities in our moral thinking.]

             Now, while there may be a certain poverty of imagination in thinking of narrow argument as of
      first importance for doing philosophy, … Diamond is not [just] calling for an imaginative supplement
50    to standard discussions. For Diamond, the imagination has a more ubiquitous and fundamental role
      to play because what it means to be a human being is something that is in itself imaginatively shaped
      and reshaped by us, it is in itself something we have creatively made something of in our thought
      and talk. On this view, unless we pursue […] philosophy in ways that involve our capacity to “bring
      imagination to bear on observation” or to “recognize that that has been done”, the development of
55    narrow arguments will prove “in a sense quite useless”: what we do in […] philosophy will have
      foregone the kind of thinking that can actually touch us or turn us round. So getting our imaginative
      capacities in play in, [for example,] moral thinking is not simply of supplementary assistance to
      achieving some kind of purely rational clarity about the evaluation of actions, or the solution of
      practical problems but is the sine qua non of bringing about the kind of lucid “seeing” that goes with
60    an alteration in a person’s moral view: of bringing a person to see something they had (by one’s own
      lights) hitherto failed to see. It should come as no surprise then that for Diamond the best model for
      such an effort is not narrow argument but imaginative literature.




2213-5603                                                                                          Turn over
                                                            –4–                      M13/3/PHILO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX

             On this view, what is at issue for a […] philosopher is not especially a concern with the evaluation
      of actions or the solution of practical problems, but is a matter of addressing others with the aim of
65    bringing about changes to what Iris Murdoch called “the texture” of someone’s being: that “vision of
      life” which shows up in all someone’s “reactions and conversation” … For example, of making them
      into more sensitive and more refined readers of what legitimately goes on in philosophy that is not
      reducible to science-inspired plain-speaking and narrow argument.
