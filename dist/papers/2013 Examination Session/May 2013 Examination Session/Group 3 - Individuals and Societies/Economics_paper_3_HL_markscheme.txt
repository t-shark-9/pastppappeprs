Notes for examiners:
1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in calculation,
   but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
   then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR on
   the script where you are rewarding this. To do this you will need to use the on-page comment
   annotation tool (   ).

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4 mark] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be given.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to 2 dp or,
   in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only be penalized
   ONCE per question (not per part) for each type of error.

1.   (a)   (i)    Calculate Q D and QS at a price of $14 per pack.                                    [2]

                  Q D = 700 − 25(14) = 700 − 350 = 350 packs                                          [1]

                  An answer of 350 (or 350 packs) without any valid working is sufficient for
                  [1 mark] .

                  QS =100 + 50 (14) =100 + 700 = 800 packs                                            [1]

                  An answer of 800 or (800 packs) without any valid working is sufficient for
                  [1 mark].
           (ii)   Calculate the price which would result in a demand of 475 packs per week.           [2]
                   = 700 − 25P

                  25P = 225
                  Any valid working is sufficient for [1 mark].

                  An answer of P = 9 (or $9) without any valid working is sufficient for [1 mark]
                  only.

(iii) Calculate the equilibrium price and quantity.                                [2]

     At equilibrium, Q D = QS
     700 − 25P =100 + 50P
     600 = 75P

     An answer of P = 8 (or $8) without any valid working is sufficient for
     [1 mark] .

     =
     Q D 700 − 25 ( 8 )
     Q D = 500 packs
     OR
     =
     Q S  100 + 50 ( 8 )
     QS = 500 packs                                                                [1]

     An answer of 500 (or 500 packs) without any valid working is sufficient for
     [1 mark] .

(b)   On the axes below, draw the demand and supply curves using a price range
      from $2 to $16 per pack. Each curve should be labelled.                                 [4]

      For a correctly constructed demand curve.                                               [1]
      For a correctly labelled demand curve (D).                                              [1]

      For a correctly constructed supply curve.                                               [1]
      For a correctly labelled supply curve (S).                                              [1]

      Candidates who plot curves incorrectly but provide appropriate labels should not be
      rewarded for labelling the curves. The dotted lines from the equilibrium point to the
      axes are not required.

      Candidates who do not use the specified price range of $2 to $16 per pack but who
      draw accurate curves may be awarded full marks.

(c)   In order to discourage the consumption of cigarettes, the government imposes a
      specific indirect tax of $6 per pack.

      On the above graph, plot the new supply curve to illustrate the effect of the
      indirect tax.                                                                              [2]

      For drawing a new supply curve parallel and above/to the left of the original
      supply curve.                                                                              [1]

      OR

      For accurately drawing the new curve parallel to the original supply curve and
      $6 above the original.                                                                     [2]

      N.B. Candidates who plot a new supply curve above and parallel to the original, but
      which is not $6 above the original, should be awarded [1 mark].

      It is not necessary to illustrate the effect of the tax in any other way (eg with arrows
      from the original price to the new price).

(d)   On the axes below, sketch a diagram and explain how the new supply curve
      would have been different if the government had imposed an ad valorem tax
      on cigarettes.                                                               [4]

                 For drawing an accurate, labelled diagram showing two supply curves, one of
                 which is above/to the left of the other, and which diverges as price increases or
                 for explaining that an ad valorem tax is calculated as a percentage of the price
                 of the product. Therefore, as price increases, the size of the tax also increases.
                 Thus the new supply curve would be above and steeper than the original.

                 price of the product. Therefore, as price increases, the size of the tax also
                 increases. Thus the new supply curve would be above and steeper than
                 the original.

           Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
           [3 marks].

           It is not required that the original supply curve be plotted accurately – the command
           term is “sketch”. A demand curve is not necessary.

     (e)   Calculate the total weekly revenue earned by the government from the
           specific tax.                                                                               [2]

           An answer of $2400 or 2400 without any valid working is sufficient for [1 mark] only.

           NB Candidates who use their answer to part (d) (ad valorem tax) for this part should
           receive [0 marks]. Candidates who have calculated the new equilibrium by using the
           new supply equation (rather than reading it from the graph) should be fully rewarded.
           If they do so, and the new equilibrium is calculated incorrectly but the result is used
           appropriately then [1 mark] may be awarded.

(f)   Calculate the change in weekly consumer spending on cigarettes in Burbia as
      a result of the tax.                                                                      [3]

      An answer of $4000 or 4000 without any valid working is sufficient for [1 mark] only.

      An answer of $4800 or 4800 without any valid working is sufficient for [1 mark] only.

      Change in spending = 4800 − 4000 = $800

      An answer of $800 or 800 with no valid workings is sufficient for [1 mark] only.

(g)   Explain why the value of price elasticity of demand is important for a
      government which is attempting to use taxation to discourage the consumption
      of a product.                                                                             [4]

            For explaining that the value of price elasticity of demand will influence the
            number of consumers who will be discouraged from consuming the product.

       2    The written response is accurate.                                                  3–4
            For explaining that if demand is price inelastic the resulting decrease in
            quantity demanded will be proportionately smaller than the increase in price.
            Therefore the government’s attempt to discourage the consumption of a
            product will be less effective.

            N.B. Candidates who explain the issue using an example where demand is
            price elastic (explaining that in this case the policy will be more effective)
            should be fully rewarded.

            For full marks, candidates must refer to the proportional or relative changes in
            quantity demand.

              their cost of living

            in price and quantity change, causing PED to change.

            For an explanation that as price increases along a straight line demand
            curve the percentage change in quantity demanded increases while the
            percentage change in price decreases. Therefore demand becomes more
            elastic.

            The following explanation is also valid: PED = slope × QP
            Since the slope is constant along a straight line, PED is equal to a
            constant number × QP whose value constantly changes along the demand
            curve. Therefore, as we move along the demand curve, PED changes.


            N.B. A similar explanation which refers to a price decrease is also
            acceptable

(f)   With reference to the graph in part (d), explain the difference between the
      break-even price and the shut-down price.                                                    [4]

      Level
       0 The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.                    0

       1     The written response is limited.                                                     1–2
             For an explanation that break-even price is the price at which a firm is able to
             just cover its average total costs while the shut down price is the price at which
             a firm is able to just cover its average variable costs OR for explaining that in
             the short run a firm may stay in business even if the price is below the
             break-even level provided that it is greater than or equal to the minimum
             average variable cost so that it makes a contribution towards its fixed costs.
