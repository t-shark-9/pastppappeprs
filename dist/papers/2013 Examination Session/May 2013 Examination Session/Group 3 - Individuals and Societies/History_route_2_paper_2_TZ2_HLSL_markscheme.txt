uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present, as will understanding of historical
        processes, but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
        evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1   Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   Assess the role of each of the following in causing the Second World War (1939–1945): the
     Peace Settlement after the First World War; the economic crisis of 1929 onwards; ideological
     extremism.

     Candidates should focus on the three factors listed. It is not necessary to deal with this as a “To
     what extent” question, but candidates are expected to link each factor to the outbreak of the war.

     Peace Settlement
     Candidates are not expected simply to list or catalogue various provisions of specific treaties, but
     instead to note the extent to which the decisions made in Paris resolved the tensions which had
     provoked conflict and prepared the ground for the future. Comment could be made on the
     territorial, economic, collective security arrangements discussed and implemented and the ways in
     which these satisfied and/or angered the powers – both victors and vanquished. What essentially
     was the legacy of the settlement in the shorter and longer term? The balkanization of Europe, the
     sense of revanchism/desire for treaty revision/the stimulus given to extremist movements as a result
     of humiliation (real or perceived) could be areas for investigation.

     Economic crisis of 1929 onwards
     Candidates could consider areas such as: the link between the economic crisis and the rise of
     political extremism – in Germany, Japan; the reluctance of powers to become involved in collective
     security operations because of domestic concerns; the expansionist moves of states in pursuit of
     answers to economic problems (desire to gain markets, raw materials); the need to mount a war of
     distraction to bolster a regime which had not successfully delivered on the promises made
     (eg Italy 1935–1936). Some candidates may link the policy of appeasement to the inability of
     certain powers to respond with confidence or strength to the moves of predatory powers in the mid
     to late 1930s especially.

     Ideological extremism
     Consideration of Fascism, National Socialism and Japanese ultra-nationalism and the glorification
     and use of force in pursuit of political/racial/economic goals (a link here in some cases to the
     previous factor of economic crisis) would form the basis for effective treatment. The use of the
     term “ideology” refers to a belief system of leaders/movements which, in this particular case,
     eschewed peaceful solutions to problems and advocated the use of force in the pursuit of the
     “national interest”.

     If only one factor is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]; if only two factors are
     addressed, mark out of a maximum of [13 marks].

2.   With reference to two twentieth century civil wars, to what extent do you agree with the claim
     that victory was decided by the nature and extent of foreign intervention?

     Note that there is no regional requirement for this question. Popular choices of civil wars are likely
     to be the Russian Civil War, Spanish Civil War and the Chinese Civil War, but Korea and Vietnam
     are also possible selections. Whichever wars are chosen, responses are required to focus on both
     nature and extent. This requires specific detail as to what type of aid was provided (financial/raw
     materials/military technology/military personnel etc) and consideration as to whether victory for
     one side in the conflict was a consequence of such intervention.

     To what extent needs to be addressed and so factors (in addition to purely external intervention) that
     played a role in the eventual victory of one side should be examined – for example popular support
     for one side, superior military strategy, possession of economic and logistical advantages,
     factionalism that weakened one particular side, failure of outside powers to maintain support
     originally given to one side etc.

     If only one civil war is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


3.   Compare and contrast the factors that helped and hindered attempts at collective security in
     the ten years after each world war.

     The periods that form the basis for examination are the years 1918/19–1929 and 1945–1955.
     Answers that go beyond these chronological limits cannot be considered as focused on the
     given task.

     The question requires candidates to compare/contrast and therefore a thematic approach would
     work well. Responses which consist of sequential treatments of both chronological periods
     followed by a brief attempt to identify similarities and differences are unlikely to meet the demands
     of the higher markbands.

     The “collective security” organizations likely to receive most attention are the League of Nations
     and the United Nations Organization. Other “collective security” organizations which some
     candidates may identify and justify could be NATO or the Warsaw Pact, for example. Candidates
     may begin by identifying the reasons for the creation of such organizations – such as the physical
     carnage, economic and psychological devastation caused by both world wars and the need to avoid
     a repetition of such conflicts in future. The willingness of such organizations to involve themselves
     in conflict resolution or deterrence of aggression may be illustrated by reference to specific case
     studies – the Åland islands dispute, Greek–Bulgarian dispute for the League of Nations for example
     – or Kashmir or the Middle East for the UNO.

     The hindrance to collective security attempts similarly may result in identification of themes such as
     revisionism/revanchism following the Great War, the rise of expansionist states such as Fascist
     Italy, the insecurity of states which led to the abandonment of collective security. For post-Second
     World War, the emergence of Cold War tensions which prevented effective action of the UNO
     would form a major part of any such answer. Generally, the lack of goodwill, mutual suspicion and
     the pursuit of national self-interest at the expense of international cooperation could be noted in
     both cases.

     If only one world war is considered, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

4.   Analyse the reasons for, and results of, either the Algerian War (1954–1962) or the Gulf War
     (1991).

     The Algerian War
     Reasons
     Candidates could refer to the longer-term reasons which caused resentment of French metropolitan
     rule and the status of Algeria as a province of France: the large settler (colon) population which
     controlled much of Algeria’s productive land, resources and political power despite the
     overwhelming Muslim majority; failure of peaceful attempts since the First World War by
     Algerians to gain an effective say in the running of the province; resentment at the failure of Paris to
     recognize the contribution of many Algerians to the Allied cause in the Second World War; the
     anger caused by the (May 1945) Setif massacres of Algerian demonstrators etc.

     Such longer term reasons could then be supplemented by reference to shorter term reasons:
     encouragement of the FLN (Front de Libération Nationale) by French defeats in Indochina (Dien
     Bien Phu); the examples of colonial nationalism witnessed in French protectorates in Morocco and
     Tunisia – both of which were able to achieve independence by 1956.

     Results
     Candidates could consider the human costs (estimated conservatively at 300 000 dead) and
     economic costs of the conflict for those involved – not only the FLN and France but possibly also
     the impact on the colons and those Algerians who stayed loyal to France up until the war’s end (the
     Harkis), after which they became “exiles”/refugees in France (figure in excess of one and a half
     million). Other results could include: examination of the types of warfare adopted by the sides in a
     conflict and its impact on relations between communities (FLN use of terror, French use of torture
     which exacerbated hostility even more); the crisis caused by colons and elements of the French
     military (General Salan) which challenged the Fourth Republic which appeared to them to lack
     sufficient will to hold on to Algeria by 1958; the coming to power of de Gaulle and the
     establishment of the Fifth Republic may be seen as a consequence of the Algerian Crisis; the
     independence of Algeria as negotiated at the Evian agreements in 1962.

     The Gulf War
     Reasons
     Candidates could identify a variety of reasons ranging from the ostensible casus belli – the Iraqi
     invasion and seizure of Kuwait which had occurred the previous year (August 1990) and Saddam
     Hussein’s refusal to comply with UN resolutions to withdraw to “other factors” longer and shorter
     term which helped initiate the war in January–February 1991.

     Candidates could refer to the justifications made by Iraq (as early as the mid 1930s) for the
     incorporation of Kuwait on historical grounds, the dispute over Kuwait’s alleged over production of
     oil which, according to Iraq, contravened OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries)
     agreements and drove down oil prices to the anger of Baghdad; the attempt by Iraq to impose
     regional hegemony and boost economic strength by accessing Kuwait’s oil reserves (especially after
     the costly Iran–Iraq conflict of 1980–1988) and the mistaken belief that the US in particular would
     not object. From the viewpoint of what became the “coalition” which opposed Iraq, the reasons for
     war ranged from the claim that it was necessary to protect the integrity of Kuwait and support the
     UNO which had already demanded withdrawal to the need to prevent the possibility of Iraqi control
     of oil sources in Kuwait – and possibly even Saudi Arabia whose ruler appealed for protection
     against the fear of attack.
                                                  –7–               M13/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


     Results
     Candidates could refer to: the losses suffered by the Iraqi military and civilian population (100 000
     and 10 000 respectively); the huge financial costs of the war; the growth of refugee populations not
     only in war affected areas but also in Arab states where governments expelled nationals of countries
     whose political stance was deemed hostile (for example Iraqi expulsion of Egyptian workers
     because Egypt backed the war against Saddam – or Saudi Arabia’s expulsion of up to a million
     Yemeni workers due to Yemen’s failure to back the war against Iraq); the promotion of unrest
     within Iraq by coalition partners who actively encouraged Kurdish nationalism and Shiite rebellion
     within Iraq (with disastrous consequences for both groups) and the liberation of Kuwait, the
     triumph of the coalition – but not the toppling of Saddam, whose popularity actually rose in parts of
     the Arab world because of his attempt to link his actions to the crisis in Palestine. The Scud
     missiles Baghdad fired at Tel Aviv during the conflict produced pro-Saddam demonstrations
     throughout parts of North Africa and the Middle East. The environmental consequences of the oil
     field fires may also be mentioned.

     Do not expect all of the above.

     If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


5.   Examine the extent to which the role and status of women was affected by their involvement
     in total war in the twentieth century.

     The question states “total war” and most answers will probably regard this as being the two World
     Wars of the twentieth century. Other wars could also be accepted as examples however – for
     example for the Vietnamese populations in North and South during the conflict in Indochina there is
     a case to be made that this war experience constituted a total war experience. Candidates would be
     advised to explain quite clearly what is understood by the phrase “total war”.

     The task does not state a particular number of examples – candidates are free to illustrate their
     answers by reference to more than just the First or Second World War if they so wish. It is possible
     for an accurate detailed investigation of one war to score highly. The task is to examine the impact
     of the selected conflict(s) upon women: how and why the war altered employment patterns, the
     perception of women’s contribution to society, the self-perception of women as a result of entering
     previously male dominated areas of labour and, in terms of status, how women benefited in the
     shorter and longer term (or not depending on the example(s) selected) in areas such as suffrage,
     legal right, educational and job opportunities.

     Candidates will need to include specific relevant detail to support the claims being made.

6.   “The contribution of guerrilla warfare to victory in the Chinese Civil War (1927–1937 and
     1946–1949) was greatly exaggerated.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question requires consideration of the extent to which guerrilla warfare was a significant factor
     in determining the outcome of the civil war in China. Descriptive accounts of this period (1927–
     1937 and 1946–1949) are unlikely to score well.

     Candidates could identify the reasons for/circumstances of the adoption of guerrilla tactics
     following the breakdown of the (First) United Front in 1927. The reasons for the eventual victory
     of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1949 could include a consideration of the ways in which
     guerrilla warfare was used to ensure the survival and expansion of Communist influence in China in
     relation to the conflict with the Guomindang (GMD) and the good will gained by Communist
     resistance to Japanese invasion after 1937.

     Other reasons which could be investigated could include: the errors made by the GMD; the relative
     appeal of the programmes offered by the GMD and CCP; the economic crisis by the later 1940s
     which produced a collapse in support for the GMD; the conversion of the CCP from guerrilla to
     conventional warfare by 1945/6–1949 – and why this was possible.

Topic 2   Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   “The greatest threat to democratic government came from internal rather than external
     sources.” With reference to one democratic state in the first half of the twentieth century,
     to what extent do you agree with this statement?

     N.B. Answers which deal with post-1950 examples cannot be credited.

     Possible choices could be Germany (1919–1933), Spain (1931–1939), France (1930s), and
     Czechoslovakia (up until 1938/39), but accept any democratic state which faced threats to its
     survival and/or stability from domestic or outside pressures. Non-European examples are likely to
     be rare.

     The nature and extent of the threats need to be identified and commented upon as to their relative
     importance. Some candidates may legitimately discuss governmental reactions to these threats in
     order for an effective conclusion to be reached concerning the seriousness of internal/external
     challenges.

     Whichever state is selected as an example, answers require relevant historical detail to support
     the argument.


8.   In what ways, and with what success, did Alfonsin and Menem deal with the challenges faced
     by Argentina (1983–1995)?

     Candidates need to identify the nature and extent of challenges faced during the period before an
     effective treatment can be undertaken. Challenges could be social, economic and political in their
     nature.

     Alfonsin
     Areas for investigation include: the re-establishment of trust in the concept of the rule of law
     following the end of the military regime (ie making sure that those guilty of abusing human rights
     in the past were brought to trial even though this could antagonise the military which was sensitive
     about such measures); dealing with high foreign debt levels incurred by the previous regime;
     addressing the problem of rampant inflation; tackling the problem of coups by disaffected military
     officers in 1987 and 1988 etc.

     Alfonsin attempted to deal with these challenges by: compulsory retirement of leading military
     figures and the trial of those held responsible for abuses and the Junta responsible for the Malvinas
     debacle of 1982; the imposition of a programme of austerity in order to deal with the debts and
     inflation. He failed to placate the military. Neither did his austerity measures please the workers or
     trade unions. By late 1988, early 1989 inflation was back to almost 1000 %. In the presidential
     election of 1989 Menem was victorious.

     Menem
     Menem inherited economic problems unresolved by Alfonsin, as well as a need to ensure the
     loyalty – or at least not to antagonize the military. Menem pardoned those officers previously
     found guilty of abuses by the Alfonsin government (ie abuses undertaken during the “dirty war” of
     the 1970s) as well as the Junta responsible for the Falklands war of 1982 – and those who had
     plotted coups against the Alfonsin administration. This placatory relationship with the military was
                                                  – 10 –             M13/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


     Menem’s attempt to defuse possible armed force intervention in politics and, to the extent that he
     faced no serious coup attempts, this proved successful.

     Economically Menem adopted liberal economic policies which concentrated on privatization and
     cuts in public sector expenditure. After initial setbacks and trade union resistance, by mid-1991
     inflation was under control and foreign loans were made available as confidence in Argentina grew.
     By 1994 economic crisis hit again with bank defaults, falling production and an explosion of strikes
     and unemployment. Despite this Menem was successful in the presidential election of 1995,
     extending his period in office until 1999.

     If only ways or success is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


9.   Identify the social and economic problems faced by Nehru (1947–1964) and evaluate the
     policies adopted to deal with them.

     The focus of the essay is domestic problems, though some candidates may argue that foreign policy
     concerns and troubled relations with neighbouring states (Pakistan) may be legitimately dealt with
     because of problems such as population displacement, the need for high expenditure on defence etc.

     During his premiership Nehru’s India faced a variety of social and economic problems. Candidates
     are required to identify these areas before they can undertake a successful evaluation of the policies
     undertaken to address them.

     Suitable areas for examination could include: linguistic issues (which produced tensions in the
     south of the country in relation to worries over employment should Hindi become the official
     language of India); population increase (from 361 million to 439 million between 1951 and 1961)
     and the need to cope with this demand; the question of caste; the position of women; the promotion
     of central planning models to develop heavy industry at the same time as trying to prevent too much
     foreign investment.

     Candidates could refer to the ways in which Nehru responded to such problems – whether by
     dropping proposed legislation over the language issue, the introduction of the Untouchability Act in
     1955, legislation which provided for female enfranchisement and equality in terms of inheritance of
     property; introducing free primary education; the introduction of the 1951 Five Year Plan as well as
     commitment to programmes of public works, irrigation and hydro-electric power production etc.
     The extent to which these were successful – that is, in terms of whether they achieved set targets, or
     whether they were simply legislative changes which lacked the means to make significant change,
     forms the basis for evaluation.

     N.B. The interrelationship between social and economic problems is great and that candidates may
     not always specifically and clearly differentiate. Be generous in interpreting their treatment of these.

     If only social or economic problems are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                   – 11 –             M13/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


10.   Analyse the methods used by, and the success of, movements for the attainment of civil rights
      in one twentieth century democratic state.

      Examples could be civil rights movements in the United States, Northern Ireland, the movements
      associated with indigenous peoples in Australia/New Zealand, Canada, etc.

      Candidates need to identify the specific methods used by the movements to attain their goals
      concerning grievances linked to issues such as lack of equitable treatment in areas such as
      education, employment, housing, religion, obstacles to social and political advancement. Such
      methods could include peaceful protest/passive resistance, the use of force, appeals to public
      opinion and international organizations, legal challenges to discriminatory practices.

      The success of such movements in terms of organization – whether the goals set were attained – or
      not, and why, require consideration for an effective answer.

      Candidates will need to include specific historical detail to substantiate claims being made.

      If only methods or success is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


11.   How successfully did one twentieth century democratic state attempt to deal with the issues of
      inequitable distribution of wealth and gender inequality?

      Inequitable distribution of wealth may be taken to refer to not only income disparity but to such
      issues as ownership of land, property, etc. Some candidates may quite legitimately link the issue of
      inequitable wealth distribution to associated problems produced by such maldistribution: lack of
      medical, housing, educational, pension, and employment insurance provisions. Accept such an
      approach. Specific details in relation to one democratic state are necessary to support effective
      answers. Generalized commentaries will not score well.

      In terms of gender inequality candidates could identify those areas of disparity which affected
      women. These could include areas such as: suffrage restriction; lack of educational opportunities;
      employment – in terms of availability of work and equal pay for the same work; laws governing
      inheritance, etc. Candidates will need to include specific historical detail to substantiate claims
      being made.

      If only one issue is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

12.   With reference to Canada, analyse the successes and failures of the democratic leadership in
      dealing with problems that faced the state between 1968 and 1984.

      The period 1968–1984 in Canada (with a six month break in 1979–1980) was marked by the
      premiership of Trudeau. Candidates need to identify the nature and extent of the problems which
      faced Canada before an effective assessment of success/failure can be undertaken.

      For Canada problems could include: the issue of separatism/Quebec nationalism which threatened
      the integrity of the Canadian state – and the associated need to amend the constitution to allay fears
      of those in Quebec who doubted the intentions of the federal government; the question of
      “patriation” which had been included in the 1931 Statute of Westminster and which allowed
      Britain’s parliament to amend the constitution of Canada; the attempt to establish what was referred
      to as a “Just Society”; dealing with rising unemployment.

      The need to work with the National Democratic Party (NDP) as a result of a drop in support for
      Trudeau’s Liberal party in the elections 1972 meant he had to commit to policies which decreased
      income tax while increasing pensions as well as protecting Canadians from the OPEC (Organization
      of Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil price rises from 1973.

      Trudeau’s administration in 1969 passed the Official Languages Act, making both English and
      French official languages to assuage the anxieties of Francophone Canadians. Extremist measures
      undertaken by the Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) such as bank robberies and kidnappings
      were countered by Trudeau’s “War Measures Act” of October 1970 which allowed the authorities
      wide ranging powers to eliminate such extremists. This “October Crisis” revealed the resolution of
      the state to deal quickly and effectively with threats to public order. While the methods of the FLQ
      essentially led to growing revulsion within most of Canada, Trudeau was also keen to reassure
      Quebec of the federal government’s good intentions in protecting regional and cultural identity.
      Candidates may refer to the 1980 referendum on Sovereignty Association. The question of
      “patriation” was resolved when, in 1982, the British parliament relinquished its right to amend the
      constitution of Canada leading to the creation of the Canada Act, albeit without the consent of
      Quebec.

      In pursuit of the “Just Society” Trudeau extended the provision of unemployment insurance to all
      and provided income support to all and, in particular, to communities or areas where the disparities
      were greatest – the Maritime provinces and Quebec. While well-intentioned, the funding of such
      schemes was partly responsible for the increase in the federal deficit in subsequent years.

Topic 3     Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   “Ideological appeal was less important than social and economic distress in the rise to power
      of single-party leaders.” With reference to two single-party leaders, each chosen from a
      different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The importance of “ideological appeal” requires candidates to provide knowledge of the chief
      elements of the ideology of the selected leaders. The main features of the ideology and the extent to
      which it was popular with the population (and why) and the extent to which the ideology was
      pursued – or pragmatically adapted – could form the basis for consideration.

      Arguably, the rise to power of single party leaders was linked closely to the inability of existing
      governments to deal with problems which affected the population of the selected countries.
      Distress may be seen in terms of falling standards of living due to economic crisis, unemployment,
      inequitable distribution of resources etc which resulted in the population generally (or in some cases
      sectionally – elites for example fearing loss of status) turning to extremist leaders in a time of crisis.
      Similarly, distress in social terms, can be interpreted not only as a loss of economic status but as
      distress caused by the introduction of policies which significant groups in society felt endangered
      their wellbeing (the religious/secular policies of the first administration of the Spanish Second
      Republic 1931–1933 for example).

      The impact of “other factors” such as outside invasion or resentment of foreign interference could
      be considered in cases such as Mao in China or Castro in Cuba – but the main focus is ideological
      appeal and social and economic distress.

      If only one single-party leader or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


14.   With reference to one totalitarian state, analyse the nature and extent of domestic opposition
      and the methods used to deal with such opposition.

      Nature and extent
      Candidates need to identify the types of opposition (real or imaginary in the eyes of the totalitarian
      state) which threatened the regime. This opposition could be seen as sectional (for example
      resistance of specific classes – the kulaks in the USSR or gentry in China), individual, institutional
      (church, army). The extent to which such opposition posed a real threat in terms of numbers,
      methods and organization needs consideration.

      Methods
      Candidates could consider a variety of means such as the use of force (secret police), arbitrary arrest
      and repressive laws, the fear induced by imprisonment/concentration camps (or labour/re-education
      camps), propaganda and the promotion of a personality cult, education and youth movements.
      Depending on the leader chosen, there could be examination of economic and social policies which
      did benefit the population (or at least sections of the population) in terms of employment, social
      advancement, etc. Candidates may also discuss the use of foreign policy to address national
      grievances and also to divert attention from domestic failures of the regime and promote the
      prestige of the leader.

      If only nature and extent or methods are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

15.   Compare and contrast the economic and social policies of two of the following: Nasser;
      Castro; Nyerere.

      Economic policies could include: policies of nationalization to free the economy from foreign
      control; programmes of agrarian reform, attempts to industrialize or alter the balance of the
      economy in terms of reducing dependency on particular commodities or foreign trading partners;
      wealth redistribution in favour of specific groups or classes; price controls and wage rises; schemes
      to promote employment and tackle inflation.

      Social policies could include: policies implemented in relation to the alleviation of poverty and
      inequality in the fields of education/literacy; housing; medical provision; gender.

      The policies adopted by the two selected leaders offer an opportunity not only to identify specific
      programmes but also to make critical commentary on the ways in which the aims were
      similar/different – and the extent to which these policies were successful.

      Be generous in interpreting what constitutes “social/economic” because of the interrelationship of
      such policies.

      If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


16.   Assess the importance of each of the following in the rise to power of Stalin: errors made by
      rivals; the use of propaganda; popular support.

      Emphasis in responses should be on the three stated areas or factors. The task requires candidates
      to analyse – that is, to identify the nature and extent of errors/propaganda/support and then make
      critical commentary on the role each factor played in the rise to power of Stalin.

      Rivals
      These should be named and an assessment made of the errors made in relation to their dealings
      with Stalin (up to 1929 approximately). Individuals (such as Trotsky or groupings, which included
      Kamenev and Zinoviev) could be examined and the reasons for their underestimation of Stalin
      explored.

      Propaganda
      Linked to the question of the errors/mistakes of rivals is the area of propaganda. Examples of this
      could include the (self) promotion of Stalin as the “natural successor” to Lenin and the setting out
      of the programme of “Socialism in one country” which was identified with Stalin in opposition to
      Trotsky’s Permanent revolution/Export of revolution platform.

      Popular support
      Whether popular support was in fact necessary in a single-party state is questionable and better
      candidates could comment on the extent to which popular appeal/support was much less important
      than support within the Party – a support which Stalin had cultivated since 1922 and his
      appointment as General Secretary of the Party with the power of patronage it provided him.
      Candidates may also refer to Stalin’s response to popular opposition in the cities to the NEP.

      If only one factor is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks], if only two factors are
      addressed, mark out of a maximum of [13 marks].

17.   In what ways, and with what results, was the status of women affected by the policies of either
      Hitler or Mao?

      Candidates at the outset could identify the existing status of women in either state prior to the
      coming to power of Hitler or Mao. This could include consideration of the legal, social and cultural
      position of women and the changes envisaged by each leader – and why. For Hitler, the place and
      function of women in the Nazi state contrasted greatly with the Weimar period and his policies were
      designed to reduce female participation in the workforce and encourage women as homemakers and
      mothers. Mao, from the Marriage Law of 1950 onwards, promoted the equality of women in the
      new China. Previous barriers to equality were removed permitting divorce, free choice of partner,
      equal rights of inheritance and access to education and employment.

      For results, candidates in relation to Hitler’s Germany could refer to the decline of female
      participation in the workforce (until the Second World War when this became necessary due to
      demands of the war economy), the exclusion of women from higher education, the provision of
      schemes and rewards to encourage motherhood and the growth of Germany’s population, the extent
      to which the birth rate was affected by the benefits offered to mothers depending on the size of
      families etc.

      In Mao’s China, government policies resulted in employment of women in all spheres of the
      economy – as witnessed for example in the first and second Five Year Plans. Educational
      opportunities also improved, as legally the status of women was recognized as equal to that of men.
      Whether in practice government legislation changed the attitudes (in many parts of rural China
      especially) is debatable. In this latter case it may be argued that the status of women remained one
      of subservience despite government policies.

      Despite the advocacy of gender equality, candidates may point out that the senior ranks of party and
      government still revealed a disparity in terms of male/female participation.

      If only ways or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


18.   Analyse the impact of single-party rule upon the arts in two single-party states, each chosen
      from a different region.

      The “arts” can be taken to mean areas such as literature, paintings, sculpture, theatre, dance, film
      etc. The task requires candidates to identify how exactly art/arts which have been selected have
      changed in the single-party state – and to comment critically on why and with what impact this has
      occurred.

      Depending upon the states chosen the emphasis will vary – for example Soviet Socialist Realism
      may be a focal point for candidates examining Stalin’s Russia, whereas candidates examining
      Germany under Hitler may explore film or literature and how these were affected. China under
      Mao could provide the opportunity to investigate the way in which culture and the arts were
      affected especially during the period of the Cultural Revolution.

      Specific detail is required to support responses.     Generalized comments which lack detailed
      substantiation will not score well.

      If only one single-party state or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 4    Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
           Eastern European states

19.   “The haste with which decolonization took place was the result of the weakness of the
      colonizing power rather than the strength of colonial nationalism.” With reference to two
      ex-colonial states, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Imperial powers experienced different problems in relation to their imperial possessions. In some
      cases, the imperial power accepted the need for rapid withdrawal from the formal commitments of
      empire (Britain and Belgium, for example), though, as some candidates could argue, “haste” was
      not always the case. For example, France attempted to hold on to Indochina and Algeria; the
      Netherlands to hold on to the East Indies; Portugal resisted nationalism in Angola and
      Mozambique; Franco’s Spain held territory in Morocco and the Spanish Sahara.

      Britain’s decolonization process, partly a consequence of exhaustion of resources and willpower as
      a result of the Second World War, could be seen in the case of its quitting of the Indian sub-
      continent and Palestine. Unable to meet growing nationalist pressure (passive as well as active) the
      decolonization process accelerated with the independence of Gold Coast/Ghana.

      Belgium’s very rapid withdrawal was arguably less due to the strength of nationalist forces in the
      Congo in 1960, than as a plan to produce sufficient chaos in the Congo to enable a Belgian return to
      “save” the former colony from the breakdown of order and guarantee the continuation of exports of
      valuable mineral resources by Belgian corporations.

      In other cases the strength of the nationalist movements in terms of popular support, military power
      and outside support combined with a deteriorating domestic economic and political situation (for
      example in France and the Netherlands) to encourage the decision to quit.

      Conditions/circumstances will vary according to the ex-colonies chosen but ensure that answers
      focus on answering the “To what extent” command rather than narrating the course of two
      nationalist movements.

      N.B. There is no regional requirement in this question.

      If only one ex-colonial state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

20.   Compare and contrast the methods used to attain independence in India (including Pakistan)
      in 1947 and Indochina in 1954.

      The attainment of independence from British and French imperial rule for many candidates will be
      seen as a straightforward case of Indian independence being a consequence of the work of Gandhi
      and the Indian National Congress (INC) – with an emphasis on passive resistance and civil
      disobedience – and the more violent measures undertaken by the Vietminh under the leadership of
      Giap and Ho Chi Minh.

      This contrast can be illustrated by reference to the various campaigns launched by the INC against
      British rule from the post-First World War years up to 1947 and examination of the armed struggle
      waged by the Vietminh. This struggle culminated in the independence of Laos and Cambodia and
      the defeat of French forces at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, which led to the Geneva Accords and the
      independence of Vietnam.

      Independence in India (and Pakistan) may also include reference to less peaceful methods adopted
      by movements to achieve their goal – for example the work of Bose and the Indian National Army
      which collaborated with Japan during the Second World War – or the mobilization of the strength
      of the Muslim League by Jinnah in the 1940s in order to pressure both Britain and the INC into
      accepting the case for Pakistan.

      In this sense, the use of force – whether through guerrilla warfare or through physical disruption
      and intimidation of political rivals to achieve a goal – could form the basis of a comparison.

      N.B. The Indochina date – 1954 – marks the limit of treatment of this part of the question.
      Candidates who focus on Vietnam and the American experience after 1954 are unlikely to score
      well.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

21.   For what reasons, and with what results, did challenges to Soviet control in Eastern Europe
      occur from 1968 to 1989?

      The starting point of 1968 allows for a consideration of the first major challenge (in this timeframe)
      to Soviet control with the developments in Czechoslovakia (“Prague Spring”) and subsequent
      challenges to Moscow’s influence in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia once more, Romania and
      East Germany – all by 1989.

      While some candidates may treat this as a series of compartmentalized accounts of individual cases,
      a thematic approach may be more effective. Reasons could include: resentment of existing
      repressive regimes and the desire by reformers (eg Dubček) to seek alternative paths to socialism;
      the desire for economic/material improvements in the various satellite states since the stagnating
      command economies failed to satisfy such needs (apparent in Czechoslovakia and especially Poland
      by 1980); the appearance of charismatic leadership in specific states (Dubček, Walesa, Havel); the
      encouragement of resistance by outside forces (United States, the Papacy); the belief that, after
      1985 in particular, Soviet willpower to repress was no longer evident – as witnessed by
      Gorbachev’s emphasis on accommodating differences in satellite states as opposed to the 1968
      Brezhnev Doctrine.

      Results vary depending on the states chosen and the period being discussed. The application of the
      Brezhnev Doctrine and the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 could be examined with reference to
      the consequences for the Czechoslovak state and the reformers. Candidates could examine the
      course of the resistance in Poland with the Solidarity movement, Havel’s “Velvet Revolution” in
      Czechoslovakia by 1989 or the liberalization of Hungary that accelerated the fall of the East
      German regime.

      Do not expect all of the above states to be discussed but identification of factors which promoted
      resistance needs to be the focus as well as results in terms of success and failure over the period
      since 1968.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

22.   With reference to one post-colonial state, assess the economic and political challenges it faced
      in the decade after independence.

      In some, though not all cases, newly independent states faced economic and political problems that
      prevented them from maintaining stable governmental and economic systems.

      Ex-colonies were often hindered because the metropolitan power established an economic system in
      the colony which was beneficial to an imperial economic system, but which did not provide the
      basis for a balanced economy in the new state. Heavy reliance on primary production and the
      vagaries of world commodity prices could also undermine the economy of the ex-colony. Limited
      educational opportunities provided by the metropolitan power could lead to a lack of trained
      personnel to administer the new state and the inability to provide effective management in the civil
      service that, coupled with corruption, led in some cases to a breakdown of order.

      Colonial borders often overlooked religious, tribal and ethnic rivalries which surfaced,
      or resurfaced, after independence in the form of civil strife and secessionist movements which
      endangered the integrity of the state. Similarly, in some cases the “importing” of labour from
      outside the colony by former colonial rulers led to the establishment of groups whose presence was
      resented in the period after independence and provided excuses for populist rulers to play upon
      xenophobic fears.

      Not all ex-colonies lapsed into governmental or economic chaos – and credit candidates who can
      illustrate this fact – but the first ten years was frequently a time of great instability.

      The impact of external aggression by neighbouring states, the influence of Cold War politics in
      which superpowers raced to establish spheres of influence and/or use states as stages for proxy
      wars, the role of the military in political life, corruption and inequitable distribution of resources in
      the new state etc all provide areas for assessment.

      N.B. Specific detail is necessary to effectively answer the question and the focus should be the first
      10 years. Neither Mao’s China nor Castro’s Cuba are relevant examples for this question.


      If only economic or political challenges are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

23.   Analyse the reasons for, and results of, the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

      Established after the First World War, the state of Yugoslavia consisted of a variety of ethnic and
      religious groups that coexisted, at times uneasily – as noted in the Second World War when
      antagonism between Serbs and Croats was apparent in bloody confrontations.

      The rule of Tito from 1945–1980 restored order and indeed the federal system, which was the basis
      for government (representing the six “republics” of Yugoslavia and two “provinces”) and was
      intended to ensure that regional and minority tensions would be alleviated by recognition of
      differences. With Tito’s death in 1980, the cement which held the federation together crumbled.
      Yugoslavia experienced the rise of older tensions exacerbated by economic problems
      (unemployment, inflation, regional disparity in terms of wealth) and the policies of Slobodan
      Milosevic who became increasingly associated with a Serb nationalism which alienated other
      groups.

      The break-up of Yugoslavia was triggered by a referendum held in Slovenia in which a majority
      supported the call for an independent state. When Slovenia declared itself independent (June 1991)
      a brief military confrontation occurred but Slovenia was successful in achieving independence.
      A similar declaration by Croatia which contained a significant Serb minority was forcefully
      resisted, leading to a Serb–Croat war which was temporarily halted by a ceasefire in February 1992
      backed by UN peacekeeping forces. Violence resumed in March that year when Bosnia-
      Herzegovina declared itself independent. The conflict drew in Serbia in support of the Bosnian
      Serb minority, Croatia in support of Bosnian Croats and the forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina
      struggling to preserve their territorial integrity. While the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s freedom
      was dealt with by 1995 in Paris following a conference organised in Dayton (USA) the previous
      month the settlement was precarious.

      Kosovo became (from 1995 onwards) the scene of new conflict between Milosevic’s forces and the
      Albanian majority in that province. NATO involvement to protect the Albanians in Kosovo and air
      attacks and economic boycotts on Serbia produced a Serb withdrawal from the province in 1999.

      The results of the process of dissolution could be witnessed in: the civil war that produced
      casualties not only in military terms but because of programmes of “ethnic cleansing”; the refugee
      problem produced by the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo especially; the involvement of
      international organizations and/or superpower leaders to mediate a resolution of the conflict (United
      Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), NATO, Clinton and Yeltsin); the ruination of the Serb
      economy by 1999 because of military and economic sanctions. The fall of Milosevic by 2001 and
      his indictment for war crimes may also be mentioned, but should not be the focus of “results”.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

24.   With reference to one ex-colonial African or Asian state or one Central and Eastern European
      state before independence, assess the contribution of social and economic issues to the growth
      of nationalism.

      Candidates need to ensure that the focus is on the period before the achievement of independence as
      they are being asked to make an assessment of the contribution of specific issues to the growth of
      nationalism. While candidates may question the extent of the contribution of social and economic
      issues, these must, nevertheless, be the focus of the response.

      Economic issues
      These could refer to: exploitation in terms of employment (wages, working conditions, seasonal or
      underemployment etc); the structure of the economy of the ex-colonial or Central/Eastern European
      state which was imposed by the metropolitan or foreign power for its own benefit (eg monoculture
      and/or specialism in production as part of a larger imperial economic system with little
      consideration for the ex-colonial state itself); fluctuation in living standards due to over reliance on
      commodity production which was subject to vagaries in world market prices; repatriation of profits
      to the disadvantage of the population etc.

      Social issues
      Areas such as discrimination (based on race, religion, language) could be examined alongside
      resentment of treatment of indigenous cultures as inferior by the dominant power. Lack of
      educational opportunities on offer or the insistence on a curriculum stressing the culture and values
      of the dominant power could also be investigated.

      Candidates could also identify other areas as being more, or less, significant for example: the
      impact of war in weakening the physical power or will of the dominant power to resist nationalist
      movements, the importance of outside aid in promoting the movement for independence;
      the emergence of charismatic leadership etc.

      Be generous in interpreting what constitutes “social/economic” because of the interrelationship of
      such policies.

Topic 5     The Cold War

25.   “Mutual fears and the search for security were the reasons for the breakdown of East–West
      relations between 1945 and 1949.” With specific reference to developments in this period, to
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      N.B. Regurgitation of historiography: that is summarizing of historians’ interpretations
      (traditionalist/revisionist/post-revisionist views etc) is not what is required. Such views should be
      used to supplement historical detail, not to replace it. Candidates who present learned responses
      which do little more than list or parrot such views will not score well.

      The focus of the period is 1945–49 and candidates could be expected to show a sound grasp of the
      main developments during this time – from Yalta through to the ending of the Berlin Blockade,
      the emergence of the two Germanies, the establishment of NATO and “loss” of China.

      Mutual fears – economic, political, technological – in the period should be identified and illustrated
      by reference to specific historical detail. The issue of security for the main protagonists also
      requires specific historical detail to support arguments. Candidates are required to identify what
      security concerns affected both sides in this time period and the actions and reactions to such
      concerns. The question of Eastern Europe, Iran, Greece and Germany etc are all appropriate areas
      for investigation – as well as concerns by 1949 in the Far East and South East Asia.

      It is not necessary to include all of the above for a good answer.


26.   Analyse the reasons for, and results of, the adoption and expansion of the doctrine of
      containment up to 1962.

      Candidates may begin with the introduction of the policy of containment in 1947 with the Truman
      Doctrine (and then added to by the Marshall aid programme) which was originally meant for the
      European theatre. The situation in Europe 1945–1947 that stimulated the United States’ involvement
      in this particular sphere would be relevant, as would an examination of the rationale (overt and covert)
      for the adoption of such a policy. The question does not require a narration of crises up to 1962 but
      rather the judicious selection of historical knowledge to allow for critical assessment of why the
      original doctrine was subsequently adopted on a global basis – for example Korea 1950–1953 and, by
      1962, Cuba.

      The task also requires consideration of the results of containment and these may include: military
      expansion; the growth of tension; the escalation of the arms race; the establishment of alliances; etc.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

27.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Sino–Soviet relations deteriorate after 1953?

      March 1953 marked the death of Stalin and the beginnings of a process of succession dispute and
      destalinisation within the USSR which is often considered to be significant in the deterioration of
      relations between Moscow and Beijing. In order to comment effectively on the “deterioration”
      candidates need to show awareness of the nature of the relationship prior to 1953. For some
      candidates this could entail examination of relations between Stalin and Mao/Chinese Communist
      Party (CCP) even before the establishment of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. For
      others a possible starting point may be the period 1949/50 and the Sino–Soviet Treaty and what its
      territorial, military and economic details reveal about the “partnership” which existed at that point.

      The relationship from 1950–1953, at least on the surface suggested a partnership (albeit a junior
      partnership in the case of the PRC as far as Moscow was concerned) and candidates could refer to
      the $300 million loan by Moscow; solidarity in relation to support for North Korea in the Korean
      War; Soviet help in China’s First Five Year plan (1950–1953); the provision of training for Chinese
      workers in the USSR; etc.

      From 1953 ideological differences which had in the past provided grounds for suspicion (Stalin’s
      criticism of Mao’s “peasant heresy” for example) were noted in: the breakdown of relations over
      Khrushchev’s “secret speech” with its attack on the cult of Stalin and advocacy of “peaceful
      coexistence”; the withdrawal of Soviet aid from China and Moscow’s criticism of the Great Leap
      Forward; the failure of Khrushchev to provide help in the construction of atomic bomb technology;
      Moscow’s failure to support China in the Sino–Indian dispute in 1962; China’s perception of Soviet
      weakness in defence of socialism at the time of the Missile Crisis in Cuba.

      Candidates may go further chronologically to cover tensions in the late 1960s over the use of the
      Brezhnev Doctrine.

      The results of the deteriorating relationship could include: border clashes; Soviet anxiety due to
      improving Sino–Soviet relations; the contribution of Soviet withdrawal of aid to the failure of
      Chinese economic policies; the pursuit of rival policies by both Moscow and Beijing in
      Africa/Asia); the Cold War impact; the beginnings of US–USSR détente.

      N.B. No end point is given in the question so allow candidates to explain/justify the end point
      they select. Do not expect all of the above but expect a balance of well-evidenced reasons and
      results for higher marks.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

28.   Assess the contribution of one of the following to the development of Cold War tensions: Mao;
      Kennedy; Reagan.

      Whichever leader is selected it is important that the focus of the response is upon that leader’s
      contribution to Cold War tensions. Answers which narrate the life story or background of the
      leader will not score well. Obviously the choice of leader dictates the material which will be
      focused upon.

      Mao
      Candidates could refer to: the importance of the “loss of China” and the US view of “monolithic
      communism” which accompanied this; China’s role in the Korean War and the Vietnam War; the
      Sino–Soviet split and its repercussions for relations with both Moscow and Washington; etc.

      Kennedy
      Candidates could refer to: the Vienna Summit; Berlin and the building of the Wall (1960-1961); the
      impact of the Kennedy administration upon developments in Cuba, from the Bay of Pigs to the
      Missile Crisis; policies to address the threat of Communist expansion in Laos and Vietnam, etc.

      Reagan
      Candidates could refer to: the early rejection of the policy of détente; neutron bomb development;
      Strategic Defense Initiative; cruise missile deployment in Western Europe; support for Mujahedeen
      forces in Afghanistan; support for National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
      forces in Angola; support for Counter Revolutionary (CONTRA) forces against the Sandinista
      regime in Nicaragua, etc.

      Each leader offers the opportunity to examine the manner in which tensions were intensified as a
      consequence of the policies/actions of the leader.

29.   Analyse the role of the war in Afghanistan (1979–1988) in hastening the decline of the Soviet
      Union.

      The communist coup of 1978 in Afghanistan, which resulted in the ousting of Daud Khan, was
      followed by a flurry of reforms by the new regime which proved less than popular in the country.
      A civil war broke out as anti-communist rebels and mutinous troops from the Afghan army
      challenged the new government of Muhammad Taraki who appealed for Soviet assistance. Initially
      reluctant, Moscow did not send troops until the overthrow of Taraki by his deputy Hafizullah Amin
      who was regarded as a liability by Moscow. Moscow backed the removal of Amin and his
      replacement with Babrak Karmal. This did not however prevent the growth of resistance to the
      Communist regime in Afghanistan by the Mujahedeen rebels.

      The role of the war could be examined in relation to the physical and financial costs of this draining
      conflict upon the USSR. What was intended to be a short-lived campaign in support of the Karmal
      regime – and in a sense in support of the Brezhnev Doctrine – turned into a huge drain upon Soviet
      resources. The USSR admitted officially to losses of over 13 000 dead and 35 000 wounded. For
      Moscow the war sapped not only military strength but also military morale and financial resources
      – contributing, along with the policies of Gorbachev, to the decline of the Soviet Union.
      Gorbachev’s decision (announced to the Politburo in November 1986) to pull Soviet forces out of
      Afghanistan by 1988 could be seen as a harbinger of the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. As well as
      the impact on economic and military strength candidates could examine the effect on Soviet
      prestige – as witnessed in the criticism of Moscow’s involvement in Afghanistan by Third World
      states in the General Assembly of the UNO.

      The focus of the answer should be on the Soviet–Afghan War, rather than other factors that
      contributed to the decline of the Soviet Union.

30.   With reference to two states, each chosen from a different region (excluding the United States
      and the USSR), examine the economic impact of the Cold War.

      There is no specific date set in this task and candidates are free to choose whether they wish to
      focus on examples which are limited to a particular chronological period, for example Germany
      1945–1949, Japan and the period of economic recovery attributable largely to the Korean War, or
      cover a longer period in the answer – for example the impact on China since 1949, Cuba since
      1959, etc.

      Economic impact could be dealt with by examining: the links between the economies of the chosen
      states and the superpowers; the structure of the economic system inside the state as a reflection of
      ideological beliefs (for example private ownership versus public ownership); control of the means of
      production and how the economy functions – free enterprise as opposed to command economy etc.

      Candidates could also consider specific economic policies undertaken by states whether it be the
      changing nature of Cuban trading and foreign investment and aid before and after 1959, or the
      consequences of economic packages such as that offered by the Marshall Plan in the late 1940s
      and 1950s.

      The responses regardless of the relevant examples selected must have specific evidence to support
      the claims being made. Generalized accounts cannot score well.

      If only one state or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
