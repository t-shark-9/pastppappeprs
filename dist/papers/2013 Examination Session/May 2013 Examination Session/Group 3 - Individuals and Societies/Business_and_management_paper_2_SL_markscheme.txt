                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the term tertiary sector.                                                        [2 marks]

           The tertiary sector of the economy, also known as the service industry, is related to
           the provision of services to customers and to other businesses. Activities in the
           tertiary sector include: retail and wholesale sales, transportation and distribution,
           entertainment, restaurants, tourism, insurance, banking and healthcare among
           others.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge
           and understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Identify two features of a sole trader.                                                 [2 marks]

           A sole trader could have the following features:
           • It is a business unit owned and operated by a single individual. The individual
              bears all the risks of loss or failure and receives all profits if the business is
              successful.
           • It is the simplest form of organization as it involves few legal requirements to
              set it up.
           • It has unlimited liability; the owner is personally liable for the debts of the
              business.
           • A sole trader enjoys unlimited freedom of action and decisions.
           • Legally, a sole trader and his business are considered as one. The business is
              not a separate entity from the owner.
           • In a sole trader business, capital to run the business is provided by
              the owner.
           • Accept any other relevant feature.


           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct feature of a sole trader identified up
           to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   (i)   Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for the bank contract for the first
            six months assuming Sayaka employs one new worker.                       [5 marks]

            balance


            Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR): if a candidate makes an error in one row and
            carries it through the remainder of the forecast, that is only one error.

            In addition, based upon the stimulus, a candidate may assume that Sayaka
            may have borrowed the $2500 before the beginning of the six-month period.
            Under this assumption, the cashflow would not have the line “cash inflow
            from bank” as listed above but would have instead an “Opening balance” of
            $4100. Candidates may present the cashflow in either way and still be fully
            correct.


            [1 mark]
            The candidate conveys some understanding of what a cash-flow forecast is,
            but otherwise the forecast is largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

            [2–3 marks]
            A cash-flow forecast is drawn, but either it is not in a generally accepted
            format or it is untidy, and the forecast contains two or more errors.
                                          –7–          M13/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



       [4 marks]
       The cash-flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a
       generally accepted format, but there is one error.

       [5 marks]
       The cash-flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally
       accepted format, and is error free.

(ii)   Calculate the impact on the monthly closing balance of the six month
       cash-flow forecast if the new employee is absent from work due to illness
       for two days per month. Assume Sayaka still pays the ill employee a
       monthly salary of $2000.                                                  [2 marks]

       Sayaka will have an additional monthly labour cost of $600.
       The impact on OC’s cash-flow forecast will be as follows:

                   Month Month Month Month Month Month
                     1     2     3     4     5     6
        Closing
                    1000     3750         500   3250       0         2750
        balance


       Award [1 mark] for each three correct calculations, up to a maximum
       of [2 marks].

       Candidates may approach the problem in a different way that shows the
       impact on the sixth month only, calculated as follows:

       Closing balance initially: $6350

       2 days per month x 6 months = 12 days (total) of replacement labour

       12 x $300 (daily cost of replacement labour) = $3600

       $6350 (closing balance initially) – $3600 = $2750
                                              –8–              M13/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Comment on the impact that the bank contract will have on the cash flow
      of OC.                                                                  [4 marks]

      If Sayaka accepts the bank contract and employs one new worker, the forecasted
      cash flow will be positive for all the time period considered. This means that her
      personal savings, the bank loan and the two-year contract with the bank will be
      enough to meet all the cash requirements.

      If the new employee gets ill two days a month, the cash-flow forecast will still be
      positive except for month 5. Such an imbalance cannot be perceived as very
      significant and there are chances that the new employee will not become ill.
      Sayaka could then take the risk to employ one new worker, accept the bank
      contract and expand the size of her business.

      Moreover, these are forecasts. The actual net cash flow could be lower. What if
      the employee is ill one month for more than 2 days?


      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

      [1–2 marks] The answer is basic and does not question the accuracy or reliability
      of cash-flow projections, or if the candidate fails to recognize that the trend of the
      cash-flow forecast is positive if one worker is employed.

      [3–4 marks] The candidate recognizes that the cash-flow projections, and
      extrapolations are affected by whether one worker is employed and whether or not
      they are ill each month.
                                             –9–              M13/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Analyse the impact on Sayaka’s role if she expands the size of her business.            [5 marks]

      If Sayaka expands the size of her business she will have to employ an additional
      employee to cope with the increased number of clients. Her role within the
      business will change as she will have to devote less time to doing the cleaning
      herself and concentrate more on managerial functions such as the following:
      • organizing worker and material resources to ensure a successful outcome for
         her business
      • supervising, guiding, motivating and eventually training her worker to make
         sure that the cleaning tasks are carried out properly and customer’s
         requirements are met
      • controlling and evaluating worker’s performance to ensure quality standards
      • planning, preparing the cleaning schedules, workforce needs.

      On the other hand, it seems that Sayaka is worried about the impact that OC’s
      expansion may have on her role. Sayaka has always liked the small size of
      her business. If OC grows, she will have to deal with employee absenteeism.
      Delegation could also bring problems to be dealt with, as it may create
      dissatisfaction among clients that were used to “her ways” of doing
      the cleaning.

      It seems that Sayaka is unsure of the responsibilities that her potential new role as
      a manager could entail. All in all, if Sayaka finally decides to expand her
      business, she will have to overcome her insecurities as they may erode her
      managerial and leadership skills in her new role.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Describe one appropriate source of finance other than a bank loan that KDS
           could use for the purchase of the cranes.                                  [2 marks]

           Ahmed could choose to use one of the following sources of finance to purchase
           the cranes:
           • Retained profit is not an appropriate response, as KDS has only $55000 in cash
              on the balance sheet. If a candidate writes “Retained profit”, award [1 mark].
           • Hire purchase – this is a system by which he could buy the cranes over a long
              period of time by paying monthly installments with an interest charge and a
              cash deposit at the starting period. During the payment period, ownership of
              the cranes will not be passed to Ahmed.
           • Through a leasing system he will be able to use the cranes for a specific period
              of time without the responsibility of owning them. He will have to make
              monthly leasing payments and at the end of the leasing period he could decide
              to purchase the cranes. An initial deposit is not required.

       generally accepted format but has one error, or award [2 marks] if there are
       two errors (OFR regarding debtors). Award [1 mark] if the candidate shows
       some understanding of what a balance sheet is, but the actual balance sheet
       constructed is not in a generally accepted format and/or has more than
       two errors.

       of X) but one that does not conform to a generally accepted format, award
       [4 marks] if, with the formatting, it has one major formatting error. Award
       [3 marks] if it has two major errors. An example of a major error would be,
       on a horizontal balance sheet, having fixed assets before current assets or, on
       either a horizontal or vertical balance sheet, having long-term debt out of
       place (either in equity or in current liabilities). A minor formatting error not
       to be penalized would be, for example, if a candidate places debtors within
       current assets but not in the generally accepted place.

(d)   Comment on the financial impact on KDS if Ahmed uses a bank loan to fund
      the purchase of the cranes.                                              [2 marks]

      If Ahmed decides to fund the purchase of the cranes with a bank loan, there will be
      borrowing associated costs. The gearing of the company will increase. At
      present, the company is not highly geared with a gearing ratio of 8.79 % . With
                                                     240                  
      the bank loan, it would increase to 36.64%         ×100 = 36.64%  . This is a

      significant increase in gearing.

      Using a bank loan will increase his costs as interest payments have to be made,
      thus reducing his net profits compared with if he financed the purchase through the
      use of internal sources of funds. However, it is unlikely that KDS could generate
      $200000 internally.


      Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(e)   Contrast the three options of who will operate the cranes.      [5 marks]

      If Ahmed decides to train his employees to operate the cranes, he will probably
      generate a positive impact on his employee’s motivation and productivity.
      His workers will gain additional job skills, job enrichment and experience. What
      is more, some have already shown interest in learning how to operate the new
      cranes. On the other hand, training is costly. Ahmed will have to hire an
      instructor or send his workers to a training course, and additionally pay for the
      additional insurance costs. Workers will be diverted from their tasks and this may
      disrupt the working day of the business. Training could be a risky investment if
      labour turnover at KDS is high; trained employees may end up working in rival
      construction companies.

      If Ahmed decides to hire two new experienced employees he will not have to incur
      training and additional insurance costs; there will not be any disruption in the
      working day of his company. However, the new skilled workers may have to be
      paid higher salaries than the rest. Ahmed will then have a permanent increase of
      his labour costs. His current employees may also feel disappointed and
      demotivated as they will not be given the chance of training and eventually
      promotion. Productivity may then be hampered such as the working environment.

      Finally, Ahmed could only rent the cranes to customers who themselves employ
      licensed crane operators. This option will not imply additional costs for Ahmed
      as he will operate the business with his current employees and training is
      not required. However, the opportunity cost of this option can be high.
      Ahmed may lose customers such as the many small construction companies that
      do not employ licensed crane operators; the potential growth of his business could
      be put at risk.

      Accept any other relevant contrast.

      maximum of [3 marks]. If only one option is examined, award a maximum

3.   (a)   Identify two ways in which the market for canoes may be segmented.             [2 marks]

           The market for canoes may be segmented in different ways, such as:
           • by age (for example young people in their 20s versus older people in their
              50s and 60s); this is the segmentation mentioned in the stimulus
           • by gender (as BC could design different canoes for men and women)
           • by residence (as occasional canoeists from urban areas may represent a
              different market from local people who use their canoe every day)
           • activity/lifestyle (fishing as a hobby rather than exercising as a hobby)
           • income/wealth (but not price).

(c)   Explain how the “marketing issues and the slower payments” would create a
      need for additional working capital.                                      [4 marks]

      Working capital is the money used by the business for its operational activities –
      in the case of BC; it is the money necessary to buy the raw materials to make the
      canoes, but also the money used in other parts of the business, for example
      marketing. BC would need more working capital for two reasons:
      • Firstly, BC will need to spend money in advance (before selling the smaller
         canoes) on promotional activities (to raise awareness, to create interest,
         to launch the product etc). Working capital is that portion of capital employed
         invested in current assets. Expenses are a reduction in equity, thus reducing the
         amount of total capital employed available for investment in working capital
         (and thus creating a need for BC to find replacement working capital).
         Another marketing issue is that sales revenue from the smaller canoes may take
         longer to materialize than BC anticipates, thus leading to a stock build up and
         lengthening of the trading cycle.
      • Secondly, if customers take longer to pay (for example in installments: a partial
         amount every month), BC will have less cash available (as the debtors owe the
         company money), so more working capital will be necessary (to support the
         operations of the business: buying raw materials etc). As payments slow, the
         debtor balance on the balance sheet increases. Funds to support that growth
         should come from total capital employed. Thus, an increase in debtors balance
         requires an increase in working capital. This too represents an increase in the
         trading cycle.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

(d)   Apply the Ansoff matrix growth strategies to BC.                                         [5 marks]

      The Ansoff matrix is a tool used to identify possible growth strategies, according
      to the product (is it existing or new?) and the market (is it existing or new?). It is
      represented as follows:

                                                         Products
                            Existing        Existing                   New


                                       Market Penetration       Product Development
                  Markets

                            New




                                       Market Development         Diversification



      Applying it to BC comes down to asking:
      • Are the smaller canoes a new product? Shareholders view it as such, although
        it could be argued that it is the same product (a canoe), just the size is different
        (a new product for BC would be canoeing clothing, for example).
      • Are the two target markets (people in the 20s and people in their 50s and 60s)
        a new market? Ashton thinks so, as presumably the current customers are
        people in their 30s and 40s; however, it could be argued that a new market
        would mean exporting canoes to another country.

      The shareholders consider the suggested strategy as a form of diversification
      (new product, new market), however other views can be defended (for example
      one could say it is market development, as the product is still the same: canoes).


      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

      If a candidate draws an Ansoff matrix, but writes nothing, award a maximum

      N.B. The “balanced analysis” required to achieve [5 marks] means showing
      awareness that the application of the matrix to BC is not clear cut; put another
      way, in order to achieve [5 marks], a candidate must explicitly write that more
      than one interpretation is possible (ie not necessarily diversification). However,
      just because a candidate has written that more than one interpretation is possible
      does not necessarily mean that the candidate’s response deserves [5 marks]. Other
      elements from the [5 marks] markband on page 3 must also be present.

(e)   Discuss Ashton’s proposal to start manufacturing and selling smaller canoes.            [7 marks]

      Ashton is keen to start producing and selling smaller canoes. His proposal has
      several advantages:
      • Market research has identified a need (a demand) for smaller canoes:
         this means a business opportunity. As BC has both experience and resources to
         start manufacturing this product, it would be a pity not to seize the opportunity;
         if BC does not do it, other competitors will. BC could have a first mover
         advantage. (Note: candidates are not expected to know this term).
      • Manufacturing seems quite easy: the stimulus states that “BC can easily
         manufacture 1000 small canoes” and this would not affect the existing
         production; it seems to be just an extra, like a baker offering loaves of bread of
         a different size.
      • Break-even seems achievable, at 600 canoes (allow candidate own figure
          rule (OFR)).
      • This new product could help BC strengthen its brand image and reputation.
      • This new product could help spread risks (in case the larger canoes stop
         selling).

      However, there are some disadvantages too:
      • As noted by the marketing director, there will be some marketing costs, higher
        than expected, to communicate about the new canoes (and money is needed in
        advance for that).
      • In terms of product life cycle, it will take time for the new smaller canoes to
        become an established product; the launch and growth phase might be long,
        especially in a period of recession, when buying a canoe will not be a priority
        for many people, especially the young people that Ashton wants to target
        (they may find a cheaper way to exercise in an environmentally friendly way,
        rather than buying a $2400 canoe).
      • Shareholders are not convinced; Ashton may not want to antagonize them,
        as ultimately they are members of his family.

      As in all strategic decisions, there is no correct answer, but Ashton will need to
      balance the arguments between various stakeholders. It would be advisable to
      seek additional market research to provide more support for the new development,
      or to provide counter arguments. Other means could be found to proceed, such as
      the use of strategic alliances, and/or joint ventures.

      “Balance” for this response means including both advantages and disadvantages to
      Ashton’s proposal to start manufacturing and selling smaller canoes. “Balance”
      also refers to the range of issues examined. If a candidate produces a response that
      includes advantages and disadvantages, supported judgements/conclusions, and
      references to the stimulus but otherwise focuses solely on (for example) financial
      considerations, award a maximum of [4 marks].

           Branding is an essential part of marketing. A brand is an identifying symbol,
           words, or mark that distinguishes a product or company from its competitors.
           The brand will have its own related customer perception as customers associate
           the brand with certain qualities. Usually brands are registered (trademarked) with
           a regulatory authority and so cannot be used freely by other parties.

           by Kabaret. For Matt and Shailah, the information in the business plan is
           important as it gives a roadmap for the operational and strategic development of
           Kabaret as a new business; it also covers a range of aspects they need to bear in
           mind, for example about how to market and promote their theatre company.

           Valid external stakeholders include Kabaret’s competitors as well as funding
           agencies such as a bank or an arts council. In order to set up Kabaret, Matt and
           Shailah may need to borrow money from a bank: for the bank, the information
           from the business plan is important as it shows the total start-up costs as well as
           the business’ chances to be successful and eventually repay the loan.

           N.B. Mr Lloyd could be described as an internal stakeholder (as he may be paid a
           fee by Matt and Shailah) or he could be described as an external stakeholder (as he
           may work on behalf of the local government to support new local entrepreneurs).
           Both approaches are acceptable.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Mark as 3+3.

      For each stakeholder (one internal and one external):

      Award [1 mark] for the correct identification of the (internal/external) stakeholder.

      Award [2 mark] for the correct identification of the (internal/external) stakeholder
      and a basic explanation that conveys partial knowledge and understanding. Here,
      the response may be more descriptive than explanatory or may lack detail.

      Award [3marks] for the correct identification of the (internal/external) stakeholder
      and a full, clear explanation that conveys knowledge and understanding of the
      importance of the information in the business plan for the named stakeholder.

      N.B. If a candidate has used two internal or two external stakeholders, the
      maximum they may achieve is [3 marks]. If a candidate has not correctly
      identified a stakeholder as internal/external, award a maximum of [2 marks] for
      that stakeholder. If a candidate has not identified a specific interval or a specific
      external stakeholder, award [1 mark] if the candidate demonstrates an
      understanding of what a business plan is and an additional [1 mark] if a general
      explanation of how stakeholders use it. Award a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Analyse the main problems that Kabaret, as a business start-up, may face.           [5 marks]

      As a business start-up, Kabaret may face several problems:
      • Problems in terms of marketing: the stimulus refers to “developing a customer
        base and branding”; Kabaret has to make a name for itself and to create a
        competitive advantage; this is always time-consuming and difficult for new
        entrants in a market (here: the local theatre scene).
      • Problems with finance: Matt and Shailah will probably need to borrow money;
        it is difficult for new businesses (especially in periods of economic recessions),
        as banks may hesitate to fund them. The fact that Matt and Shailah are young
        (having just finished university) and quite inexperienced is a disavantage for
        them, as it can make it even harder to obtain funding, although some agencies
        specialises in helping younger people set up new businesses.
      • Problems with cash flow: the stimulus refers to the fact that they do not know
        how much they should charge; pricing is one of the financial decisions they will
        have to make, but they will also need to learn how to manage their cash flow;
        according to page 11 in Paul Clark et al’s Business and Management Course
        Companion (2009) “many new start-ups fail, not because their product is poor
        or that they can’t make a profit, but because they don’t manage their cash flow
        in the early years”.
      • Accept any other relevant analysis.

      N.B. The “balanced analysis” required to achieve [5 marks] is not about a balance
      of difficulty and ease, but about a balance of problems covering several areas such
      as finance and marketing. In order to achieve [5 marks], a candidate must cover
      more than one problem.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                             – 21 –            M13/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Analyse the appropriateness of the two pricing strategies Mr Lloyd suggests
      and recommend to Matt and Shailah which one to use for the tickets to
      Kabaret’s shows.                                                            [7 marks]

      Two pricing strategies are mentioned in the stimulus: cost-based pricing and
      competition-based pricing.

      Cost-based pricing means that Matt and Shailah would calculate how much it costs
      to stage a play (taking into account all factors such as paying the actors, buying the
      costumes and props, advertising the play etc) and would add a mark-up for their
      profit margin. This may be easy to calculate, however it assumes that they would
      sell all the theatre tickets (ie that the theatre would be full) which cannot be
      certain, especially as they are not known yet.

      Competition-based pricing means that they will research and find out how much
      their competitors charge and decide accordingly. They may decide to charge less
      than other theatre companies, in order to attract theatre-goers and to build
      a reputation. This however assumes that their customers are price-sensitive and
      that Kabaret does not have higher costs than its competitors.

      Each pricing strategy has advantages and disadvantages. There is no right or
      wrong answer: Matt and Shailah could equally be advised to opt for cost-based
      pricing or competition-based pricing.


      Candidates need to include a recommendation with supported relevant reasons to
      achieve more than [5 marks].

      Accept any other relevant analysis with a recommendation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

5.   (a)   Define the term pressure group.                                                         [2 marks]

           A pressure group can be defined as an organized group of people who believe in
           the same cause and decide to join forces to act together, for example Greenpeace
           campaigns to protect the environment. This pressure group can put pressure on
           businesses and business developers (for example about pollution, or about the
           ecological impacts of airport expansions).


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the definition above.

     (b)   Explain the meaning of Sylvia’s statement that “for organizations, training
           volunteers is a form of investment”.                                        [2 marks]

           Investment usually refers to purchasing new machines, or financing new ventures
           in the hope that they will later result in financial gains; here, Sylvia applies this
           concept to organizations that employ volunteers in terms of human resources
           management: training volunteers takes time (and money), but organizations know
           that, through this workforce, they will reap the benefits in the long term.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic explanation that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding of Sylvia’s statement.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear explanation that conveys knowledge and
           understanding of the importance of Sylvia’s statement.

           Candidates are not expected to word their explanation exactly as above.

(c)   Distinguish between two forms of non-financial rewards that may be used by
      organizations to motivate volunteers.                                      [4 marks]

      Non-financial rewards that may be used to motivate volunteers include job
      enrichment, job enlargement, empowerment and teamwork. These methods of
      motivation are linked yet different, for example “job enrichment entails giving
      employees opportunities to make use of the different skills they have, while job
      enlargement involves simply increasing the range of tasks a worker has to do”
      (pages 127–128 in Paul Clark et al’s Business and Management Course
      Companion (2009)).

      If a candidate refers to something to the effect of “good feeling” as a reward, they
      need to clarify how an organization can offer the reward of "good feeling" rather
      than merely state “good feeling,” which could be viewed as a feature of
      volunteering rather than as a reward.

      Candidates may focus on the benefits of training and CV (resumé) building.
      Doing so is acceptable; however, whether training and CV-building is two rewards
      or one depends upon the candidate’s answer. For example, if the candidate writes
      “training, which makes the volunteer more employable” and “something to put on
      their CV”, the candidate has really written about two aspects of one reward: how
      to make oneself more employable.

      If the candidate writes “training, which makes the volunteer feel more valued” and
      “something to put on their CV”, the candidate has really written about two distinct
      rewards.

      If a volunteer is given benefits that have monetary value it must be considered a
      form of monetary reward. If the reward has monetary value and receipt of it is
      necessary for the performance of the volunteering (for example, travel to a
      location, paid for by the organization, to do the tasks of the volunteer), the reward
      is non-financial.

      Accept any other relevant point.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic answer showing some limited knowledge of
      non-financial rewards (for example naming methods such as empowerment and
      teamwork).

      Award [2 marks] for an answer which shows some knowledge and understanding
      of two forms of non-financial rewards (for example by defining the two methods,
      though not very clearly).

      Award [3 marks] for an answer which distinguishes between the two forms
      (showing the difference) yet remaining at a theoretical level (ie without reference
      to motivating volunteers).

      Award [4 marks] for an answer which distinguishes between the two forms
      (showing the difference) with explicit reference to motivating volunteers.
                                            – 24 –            M13/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Apply Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to the situation of an unemployed person
      who volunteers at a local non-profit organization.                         [5 marks]

      The lower levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs are about safety and security,
      as well as a sense of love and belonging. Depending upon their circumstances,
      an unemployed person may already fulfil them (for example their family may
      provide them with shelter and food); in some countries, the welfare state also helps
      unemployed people, through systems of benefits. More crucially, volunteering
      will help people fulfil higher levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, about esteem
      and self-actualization: being surrounded by colleagues and feeling useful will
      create a sense of self-respect; this may be particularly important for an
      unemployed person who could otherwise stay at home and have the impression
      that they do not contribute to society. By volunteering in a local non-profit
      organization, an unemployed person may meet other people, make new friends and
      maybe even get a new job through networking contacts.


      N.B. Theoretical knowledge of Maslow’s model should be credited: award up to
      [2 marks] if a candidate correctly draws the model using the right terminology.

      N.B. The balanced application (examination) required to achieve [5 marks]
      is about a balance between the lower and higher levels of Maslow’s model: in
      order to achieve [5 marks] candidates must cover both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                            – 25 –            M13/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of employing volunteers in
      profit-based organizations.                                         [7 marks]

      The advantages of employing volunteers in profit-based organizations could
      include the following:
      • They provide free labour (even though training them may require some
         investment, as suggested by Sylvia Warnecke); for a profit-based organization,
         this means less spending on human resources (so some savings – or at least the
         possibility to invest in other areas of the business, for example marketing and
         promotion).
      • They may provide a flexible workforce (as they may be employed at different
         times of the year, when the organization is busier); this may be important in
         terms of workforce planning (especially in sectors where seasonality is
         an issue).
      • They may provide much needed expertise (as the stimulus mentions that some
         volunteers are retired people, so not just inexperienced students); for example a
         new organization may particularly welcome the expertise of a retired
         businessman who could act as a mentor.

      The disadvantages of employing volunteers in profit-based organizations could
      include the following:
      • Possible tensions or resentment between paid workers and unpaid (volunteer)
         workers, especially if the latter have the impression that they work as hard and
         fully contribute to the company’s operations (and ultimately to its commercial
         success). This could create a negative atmosphere at the workplace.
      • Some volunteers may not always be reliable or may not be fully committed; this
         can be difficult in terms of human resources management, if some volunteers
         do not turn up or are late, they cannot be disciplined like other staff.
      • The legislation to employ volunteers is different from the employment law that
         the business managers may be familiar with; this may require preparing new
         policies or new types of contract, which could be time-consuming for a
         profit-based organization whose priority remains profit maximization.

      Accept any other advantage/disadvantage and discussion.


      N.B. The question is about “profit-based” organizations. In order to achieve
      [5 marks] and above, candidates must explicitly address that aspect.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
