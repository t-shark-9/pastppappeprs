                                                 SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    Just before the Board of Directors voted on “RDB 2020”, Anna Holstein had a serious car accident.  
      She would require years of physical therapy before working again.

      Board members now have two important decisions to make:
       Whether to approve the “RDB 2020” strategic plan.   Despite Valdemar Holstein’s opposition,
        some board members still supported it, especially because of a recent workforce planning study
        (Item 1).  To help them decide, the board requested and received a decision tree and critical path
        analysis (Items 2 and 3).
       Who would replace the 83-year-old Valdemar?  The succession plan had always been to promote
        his daughter Anna to Chief Executive Officer (CEO).

      There are two candidates for Valdemar’s post:
       Jens Holstein, 68, is Valdemar’s younger brother.   He currently manages the large law firm
        responsible for most of RDB’s legal affairs.   He understands all the legal issues related to
        “RDB 2020”.  He always pays close attention to detail.  In the law firm, he is well respected for his
        efficient management style, although some lawyers feel that he monitors their work too closely.
       Per Pederson, 44, is the manager of RDB’s Swedish megafactory.   Though originally hired
        because of his engineering degree, he was rapidly promoted thanks to his excellent “people skills”.  
        Quickly bored with budgeting and industrial planning meetings, Per preferred building
        relationships with employees and mentoring junior managers.  He loved talking to workers and
        giving speeches about RDB.   Valdemar was proud of having “discovered” Per, though some
        employees criticise his lack of attention to detail.

      Regarding the management succession, Valdemar said that “choosing between Jens and Per is the
      same as choosing between a manager and a leader: it is a key strategic decision for RDB”.


      (a)   Referring to Item 1, identify for RDB one opportunity and one threat as a result
            of demographic changes forecasted in the twenty-first century.                             [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain Valdemar’s statement that “choosing between Jens and Per is the
            same as choosing between a manager and a leader: it is a key strategic decision
            for RDB”.                                                                                  [7 marks]

      (c)   Using information in Item 2, calculate the expected values for each option using
            only the five-year net profit after interest and tax totals.  Interpret the results and
            information from the decision tree (Item 2) and the critical path analysis (Item 3)
            to help the board decide on whether to approve “RDB 2020”.                                 [9 marks]

      (d)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 5, discuss how
            RDB could plan strategically for any future crises.                                       [12 marks]

Item 4: Extract from The risky century: Crisis management in the twenty-first century (2012),
        by Toujours Paura

The twenty-first century will be the riskiest era for businesses since the fall of the Roman Empire.   
Technological change, environmental catastrophe, uncertain energy sources, employee theft and terrorism
are just some of the many risks that businesses will face.  Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) can no longer
imagine that their job is merely to manage their organization, to lead change, and to manage traditional
business risks.   The twenty-first century CEO must also be creative in anticipating potential threats,
both direct (traditional business threats) and indirect (crises of any variety).  They must have detailed
crisis management plans for every crisis imaginable, however unlikely …

Item 5: Extract from The creative century: How creative firms will win in the twenty-first century
        (2013), by Robert McFerrin

In the twenty-first century, business, especially Western business long accustomed to critical business
advantages, will have to be creative.  Because of their high cost structure, Western businesses must seek
to add value through creativity.  Many forces can prevent creativity and above all create a climate of fear
and kill creativity.  When Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) plan for every crisis possible, they foster a
climate of fear.  They communicate the message that any threat of loss matters more than the rewards
of innovation and adaptability.  The responsible CEO of the twenty-first century will reasonably plan
for contingencies, but never to the degree that it cultivates fear …  Any catastrophe must be viewed as
an opportunity.
