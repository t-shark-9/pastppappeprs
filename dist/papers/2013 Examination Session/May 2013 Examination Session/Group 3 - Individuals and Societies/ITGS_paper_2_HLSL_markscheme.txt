Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate range
of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure
to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

 The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

 The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
  the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
  when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
  should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
  necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

 When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
  they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
  piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
  that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

 Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
  if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should award
  the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

 Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
  acceptable.

 Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
  the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
  a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
  the work being assessed.

 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
  attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
  low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
  other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will produce
  any particular distribution of marks.

 The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

                                    Theme: Education and training

Criterion A — The issue and stakeholder(s)                                                         [4 marks]

1.   (a)   Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system in the article.

           The issues are about the reliability, security, efficiency and effectiveness of using
           the cloud provider service for school purposes (the school context must be
           included in the description of the social/ethical concerns). There are some
           specific concerns listed below.

           Social/ethical concerns may include the following:
            privacy/security of student files – sensitive data could be viewed by people
             gaining unauthorized access to student files which means the work may be
             copied or used or even changed
             - privacy is mainly about access to their profiles from a breach of security of
                 the cloud service provider. Some students will confuse this with the privacy
                 concerns associated with social networking sites. Some files may contain
                 private data eg photos, email addresses, home address
             - breaches of security where there is unauthorized access to the students files
                 due to weak passwords, not logging off, sharing of passwords
             - security impact – concern with the spread of viruses attached to files that are
                 shared
            digital divide – everyone does not have the same access to the internet or
             computers, laptops or tablets due finance, access to internet
            reliability of the cloud server – if the server is down students may not be able
             to access their work and therefore miss a deadline/student work may be lost
            reliability of the internet connection – if the internet connection is not working
             files may be inaccessible during the lesson, so class time or study time at home
             is wasted
            efficiency/effectiveness in use – the various stakeholders may not use / have
             access to the same cloud computing service which will create problems of
             access for teachers and students
            anonymity – reverse of it, which piece of work belongs to which student,
             where it is necessary to identify the work of an individual student this may not
             be possible, eg for assessment purposes. Could in effect link to the intellectual
             property of the student
            lack of policy – concerning misuse of the shared area, eg uploading and sharing
             of inappropriate materials, cyberbullying, plagiarism
            including intellectual property from other sources without referencing
             (plagiarism) and sharing in the public domain (due to public sharing of folders
             and files)
            lack of control of sharing due to the sharing options not being set appropriately,
             eg accidental sharing of private data, forwarding of sharing links to others that
             it was not intended for
            integrity of data – shared files can be altered by others who have access to
             them, deliberately or accidentally.

(b)   Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system in the
      article.

      Primary stakeholders may include the following:
       students – who store their files/work/data in the cloud / who use cloud
         computing /Google/Dropbox services to store/share files/work/data
       the cloud computing provider (ie Google/Dropbox) which provides storage and
         is responsible for the security of data
       teachers – who need to use the services eg marking, sharing of files; and to be
         aware of the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing and advise
         students accordingly
       school administration – setting policies for the use of the services
       the network manager and support staff – involvement with the cloud provider
         on behalf of the school, and helping students/teachers use the service in school,
         and helping with registration for the service
       staff associated with the cloud service if linked to the article.

            enter the email address of the person who will share the file
            choose to notify recipients by email
            add a message for the recipient
            choose to send a copy of the email to yourself.

           Answers provided in the article include the following:
           Storing, sharing, synchronizing with Dropbox:
            download the Dropbox application/client onto a desktop computer/mobile
              device
            the Dropbox folder is set up on the desktop computer/mobile device
            drag the required files/folders into the Dropbox folder
            files/folders are synchronized between the storage location in the cloud and any
              other devices set up with Dropbox
            changes to files are synchronized across all devices
            folders are selected for sharing and recipients are invited by entering their
              email addresses.

           Answers with additional information to that in the article may include the following:
            set up an account with Google/Dropbox
            choose a username and password
            mobile devices need to be connected to the internet by Wi-Fi or 3/4G
             connection
            use of web-browser
            protocols
            cloud servers in general, or specific Google/Dropbox servers
            other components (hardware or software) that are clearly part of the steps.

           Storing and sharing using Google Docs:
            create a new Google Doc/file for example document, presentation, spreadsheet
            save the file under a meaningful name to the Google servers
            ensure permissions for sharing are set to Edit if the recipient needs to add
              information
            request email notifications when comments are made on the document.

           Storing, sharing, synchronizing with Dropbox:
            the Dropbox executable file is downloaded and run
            the Dropbox executable file links the device (desktop/laptop/mobile phone) to
              the Dropbox server

       files/folders copied to the Dropbox folder on the student’s device are uploaded
        to the student’s account area on the Dropbox server by the Dropbox software
       files/folders are automatically downloaded from the Dropbox server to all other
        Dropbox enabled devices set up by the student and put into the folder on their
        device.

(b)   Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
      described in Criterion A.

      Answers may include the following:
      This not an exhaustive list – please see page 4 for all possible concerns. The most
      important consideration is that the concern in 1.(a) is explained here in 2.(b).

      Privacy would be a concern if data is not properly secured for example:
       if the permissions are not set properly others may be able to gain access
         to them
       if the ID and password of a sharer are known then access may be gained
         by others
       if the cloud server is not protected hackers could gain access to the student files
         which may contain private/sensitive information (a rare event for Google
         and Dropbox)
       if data is not encrypted during transmission hackers could gain access to
         student files during the synchronization process (a rare event as students are
         not often targeted).

      Reliability would be a concern:
       if the cloud server is down, students are prevented access to personal files due
        to a hardware failure (candidates must give an example of the hardware and
        its failure)
       if the student’s own device is down, they have difficulties accessing and
        sharing files
       if the internet connection is interrupted preventing synchronization between the
        Dropbox folders on the devices and the Dropbox cloud server, access to these
        files via the internet is not possible.

       Candidates are expected to make reference to relevant stakeholders, information
       technologies, data and processes. Candidates will be expected to refer to “how
       the IT system works” using appropriate IT terminology.

Criterion D — A solution to a problem arising from the article                                    [8 marks]

4.   Evaluate one possible solution that addresses at least one problem identified in
     Criterion C.

     Problem should be specified but if not it must be one identified in Criterion C.

     Answers may include the following:
     Solutions to the problem of privacy/security of student files:
      authentication of the user via username and password (and possibly a third item)
        Accept other identification methods such as biometric access to devices if it can be/is
        applied to the problem in an appropriate way.
      setting permissions on files – for example Google Docs can be published on a web
        page for public viewing, viewed by anyone who has the URL or set to private where
        viewers are invited to view the document. Permission can be granted to view or edit
        the document
      cloud providers ensure that data is encrypted for storage on the server / during
        transfer between remote devices and the cloud server using SSL encryption
      a firewall is installed to protect the cloud server from unauthorized access by hackers
        (this is part of the cloud service providers now but needs to be explained that there
        have been occasions when these large security systems have not worked)
      a detailed policy from the school about the safeguarding of username (and email
        addresses) and passwords.

     Solutions to the problem of reliability of the cloud server:
      redundancy is built in to the system – a backup server is in place in case the main
        server crashes (this is part of the cloud service providers now but needs to be
        explained that there have been occasions when these large backup systems have
        not worked)
      a backup internet website if the main one is crashed or suffers a DOS attack or some
        other problem
      school policies – students are advised to employ their own methods for backup
      school policies – include procedures / alternative upload schedule to address
        technical problems
      school policies – to handle unforeseen problems for example students who have not
        made backups or cannot hand in work due to technical problems.

     Solutions to the problem of the reliability of the student’s own devices and internet
     access:
      availability of other devices to access the internet
      other ways of accessing the internet (Wi-Fi hotspots, smartphones and mobile
        computer access)
      having backups on USB memory devices or portable hard drives
      school policies – students are advised to employ their own methods for backup
      school policies – include procedures / alternative upload schedule to address
        technical problems
      school policies – to handle unforeseen problems for example students who have not
        made backups or cannot hand in work due to technical problems.

Solutions to the problem of incompatible services:
 specific service/s need to be specified by the school so that a limited number of
   services are used by staff and students
 specific instructions/policies developed by the school that will allow the use of the
   various services to be successful.
