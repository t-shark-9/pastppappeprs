           dollar showing a shift of the demand curve to the right leading to a rise in
           the exchange rate or an explanation that increased demand for exported
           commodities will lead to increased demand for the Australian dollar,
           resulting in an increase in the value of the Australian dollar.

       2   There is a correct diagram and accurate written response.                         3–4
           For drawing an accurately labelled exchange rate diagram for the Australian
           dollar showing a shift of the demand curve to the right leading to a rise in
           the exchange rate and an explanation that increased demand for exported
           commodities will lead to increased demand for the Australian dollar,
           resulting in an increase in the value of the Australian dollar.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For the vertical axis, the label may be exchange rate, other currencies/Aus$, price
      of Australian $ in terms of another currency, or Aus$. For the horizontal axis,
      quantity of Australian $ or quantity is sufficient. A title is not necessary.

       1    There is a correct diagram or an accurate written response.                        1–2
            For drawing an accurately labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift to the
            right of the AS curve or for explaining that cheaper imported resources and
            consumer goods will reduce costs of production for Australian producers,
            leading to a reduction in inflationary pressure.

       2    There is a correct diagram and accurate written response.                          3–4
            For drawing an accurately labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift to the
            right of the AS curve and for explaining that cheaper imported resources
            and consumer goods will reduce costs of production for Australian
            producers as well as consumer prices, leading to a reduction in
            inflationary pressure.

      N.B. Candidates may also be rewarded if they shift AD to the left, explaining that
      the appreciation will make exports more expensive and/or imports cheaper, thus
      reducing demand for these exports and/or increasing demand for imports and
      therefore causing AD to decrease.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For the vertical axis, the label may be Average (General) Price Level or
      Price level. For the horizontal axis, real output, real national output, real income,
      real national income, real GDP or real Y. A title is not necessary.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations.
      Responses may include:
      Possible positive effects:
      • Australian tourists overseas benefitting from cheaper holidays (paragraph )
      • imported manufactured goods become cheaper boosting consumers’ living
        standards
      • imported capital goods become cheaper encouraging domestic investment and
        potentially increasing productivity
      • inflationary pressure is reduced through lower import prices (paragraph )
      • helps slow down interest rate rises (paragraph )
      • may permit the government to lower interest rates, which is likely to have an
        expansionary effect on the economy.
      Possible negative effects:
      • local exporters in the manufacturing and services sectors suffer because
        Australian exports become less competitive (paragraph )
      • increase in unemployment in export sector as demand for exports falls
      • fewer foreign students study in Australia (paragraph ) causing a fall in
        revenue for some Australian schools and universities
      • greater dependence on a narrow range of commodity exports which may lead
        to vulnerability to external shocks (paragraph )
      • fewer tourists coming to Australia (paragraph )
      • foreign investment may be discouraged as the cost of investment measured in
        foreign currency increases.
      Any reasonable evaluation on the relative strengths and limitations of the effects
      of an appreciating Australian dollar on the Australian economy.

           There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations.

      Responses may include:
      • explanation of market-oriented policies
      • explanation of government intervention/interventionist policies
      • explanation of economic development.

      Advantages of market-oriented policies:
      • greater opportunity/reward for innovation by producers
      • greater efficiency in production
      • freedom for producers to choose what to produce (paragraph )
      • freedom to vary price (paragraph )
      • improvement in efficiency of allocation of resources (paragraph )
      • the possibility that competition will lead to lower prices for consumers
        (paragraph )
      • reduction in the need for imports of food
      • the incentive function of the price mechanism may lead to a greater output of
        food (paragraph ).

Disadvantages of market-oriented policies:
• possibility of greater competition leading to lower incomes for farmers
  (paragraph )
• could lead to market failures
• could lead to inflation
• could lead to unemployment
• increase in income inequality
• the ending of subsidies will raise costs to producers (paragraph ).

Advantages of government intervention:
• purchase of subsidised seed and equipment from the government
  (paragraph ) reduces costs for farmers
• a monopoly over essential foods (paragraph ) may ensure equity of
  distribution
• fuller employment of resources due to planned production
• provision of needed infrastructure
• provision of social safety net
• possibility for income redistribution
• can redistribute income
• encourages investment in human capital
• possibility to correct market failures.

Disadvantages of government intervention:
• set prices for resources and goods and services possibly leading to inefficiency
• lack of incentives for economic participants
• poor planning and corruption remain a problem (paragraph )
• excessive bureaucracy may be a feature of the economy.

Any reasonable evaluation that assesses the relative strengths and limitations of
possible market-oriented and government intervention policies in promoting
economic development in Cuba.

       1   Few relevant concepts are recognized.                                           1–2
           There is basic knowledge/understanding.

       2   Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.             3–5
           There is clear knowledge/understanding.
           There is some attempt at application/analysis.

       3   Relevant concepts are recognized and developed in reasonable depth.             6–8
           There is clear knowledge/understanding.
           There is some effective application/analysis.
           There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • a definition of economic development
      • a definition of investment
      • a reference to the table noting that there has been economic development in
        Cambodia since 1990, but that Cambodia’s level of development remains low.

      Possible positive effects:
      • fill the savings gap
      • break the poverty cycle
      • increased/improved infrastructure (paragraph ) and the impact of
        infrastructure on economic development
      • increased opportunities for employment, increasing income and raising
        standards of living
      • improved technical and management skills and improved human capital
        (may be considered a positive externality of production)
      • improvements in technology
      • increase in tax revenue for the Cambodian government which may be used to
        invest in merit goods
      • trust shown by US and China encourages investment from other countries
      • exports which result from foreign investment may improve the trade balance
        and therefore the Cambodian balance of payments

•   increased economic growth may raise living standards and allow for greater
    access to health care and education
•   The desire of the US to invest in Cambodia may be encouraging the US
    government to cooperate on debt negotiations. Debt relief will free up money
    for investment in environmental areas or education which are key for economic
    development (paragraph ).

Possible negative effects:
• negative externalities – loss of water quality and a loss of biodiversity
  (paragraph )
• the motives for investment may not be consistent with Cambodia’s best
  interests
• the infrastructure provided by Chinese and US investments may be tailored to
  their own needs rather than Cambodian needs
• the possibility of the loss of sovereignty for Cambodian government to make
  decisions that are in the interests of the Cambodian people
• the benefits of foreign investment and economic growth may be distributed
  unequally amongst the Cambodian people, worsening income inequality
• capital intensive technology might not be appropriate, employing relatively few
  people and having little impact on domestic employment
• vulnerability if there is an outflow of foreign investment.

Any reasonable discussion of the way that foreign investment might or might not
contribute to economic development.
