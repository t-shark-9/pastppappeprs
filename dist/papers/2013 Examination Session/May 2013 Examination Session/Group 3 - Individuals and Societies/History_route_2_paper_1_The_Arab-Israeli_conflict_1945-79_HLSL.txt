The 1948–1949 exodus of the Arab population, created a refugee problem of immense proportions.
The refugees lived in makeshift camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Gaza Strip. The camps had been
set up as temporary shelters pending a solution to the refugee problem. The solution envisaged at the time
was the repatriation [return] of the refugees to the areas from which they had fled. However actions taken
by the Israeli government in the years immediately after 1948 made this unlikely. The Israeli authorities,
faced with a wave of Jewish immigration totalling more than 600 000 between 1948 and 1951, took over
vacant Palestinian villages, urban dwellings and farmland to house and feed the immigrants. The absorption
of Palestinian property into the Israeli economy made it next to impossible for Israel to consider repatriation.
Destitute and uprooted, the majority of Palestinians had no alternative to the miserable conditions of
camp life.

SOURCE C                United Nations General Assembly Resolution 393, 2 December 1950.

The General Assembly, having examined the report of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
(UNRWA) for Palestine refugees:

1.    notes that contributions sufficient to carry out the programme have not been made and urges
      governments to make every effort to make a voluntary contribution …;
2.    recognizes that direct relief cannot be terminated;
3.    authorizes the agency to continue direct relief to refugees, and considers that for the period July
      1951–June 1952 approximately $20 000 000 will be required for relief to refugees who are not yet
      reintegrated into the economy of the Near East;
4.    instructs the Agency to establish a reintegration fund to support projects for the permanent
      re-establishment of refugees and their removal from relief;
5.    considers that approximately $30 000 000 should be contributed to the agency for this purpose … for
      the period July 1951–June 1952;
6.    thanks the numerous religious, charitable and humanitarian organizations who have brought much
      needed supplementary [extra] assistance and urges them to continue and expand their work.


SOURCE D                Extract from The Palestine–Israeli Conflict: a Beginner’s Guide, by Professor
                        Dan Cohn-Sherbok and Dr Dawoud El-Alami (2009).

In January 1949 Egypt began negotiations for an armistice agreement with the Israelis and signed an
agreement in February. This was to form the basis of a peace agreement. The borders were drawn along
the lines marking the existing positions of the armies. Lebanon, Jordan and Syria signed armistice treaties
the same year.

The main issue was the refugee problem. A reconciliation committee was formed and Arab and Israeli
delegates were invited to Lausanne to discuss important issues, particularly the refugee problem. The
Arabs stated that the return of the refugees would be the basis for establishing peace in the area. The
Israelis felt this issue should be suspended until a final peace agreement was made. The Israeli delegates
agreed, however, to support a protocol consisting of three main principles:

1.    respect for the boundaries agreed in the partition plan;
2.    consent to Jerusalem becoming an independent city;
3.    the return of the refugees and the restoration of their property.

The Arab parties agreed to the protocol and signed it on 12 May 1949; on the same day Israel became a
member of the United Nations.

The two key issues were refugees and borders. Each of the Arab states was prepared to negotiate with Israel
from September 1948 and bargain about borders.

On the issue of Palestinian refugees, Arab states had less freedom of action. There was a clear and
consistent Arab League position, binding on all members. The position was that Israel had created the
refugee problem and it must not be allowed to evade responsibility for the problem. The solution had to be
in line with UN resolutions that gave the refugees the choice between returning to their homes or receiving
compensation for their property. This position allowed individual Arab states to cooperate with the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), on condition that this cooperation did not
compromise [undermine] the basic rights of the refugees.

Israel’s position on the problem was totally opposed to the Arab League’s. Israel claimed the Arabs had
created the problem by starting the war and that Israel was not responsible. It did not accept UN resolutions
that gave refugees the right of return or compensation.
