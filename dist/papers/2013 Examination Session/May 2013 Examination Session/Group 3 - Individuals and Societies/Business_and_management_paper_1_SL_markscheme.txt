                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    regional trading bloc (line 30)                                                  [2 marks]

                  A regional trading bloc is “an organization of countries which have formed
                  economic alliances for mutual benefit” (Clark, P. et al., 2009, Business and
                  Management Course Companion, page 391, Glasgow, U.K., Oxford
                  University Press) eg CARICOM (in the Caribbean Community),
                  EU (European Union). Regional trading blocks typically have some type of
                  written agreement (between states, regions, or countries) whereby rules
                  regarding trade are specified (such as reducing barriers between
                  participating states, regions, or countries).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   corporate social responsibility (lines 88–89).                                   [2 marks]

                  Corporate social responsibility is a voluntary approach by businesses that
                  recognises they have an obligation to assess and take responsibility for the
                  organizations effects on the environment and on social welfare. A socially
                  responsible business incorporates the interests of various stakeholders in a
                  way which is beneficial and correct (“right”) according to societal values, eg
                  a socially responsible ball bearing business will manufacture its products in
                  a way that limits pollution in the vicinity of its factories (which is not the
                  case of RDB). Socially responsible businesses often go beyond what is
                  required by law.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

(b)   Explain two reasons why innovation is important for RDB.                               [4 marks]

      Innovation is important for RDB for several reasons:
      • As mentioned at the start of the case study, the market size of the ball bearing
         industry keeps increasing. It is a very dynamic industry (as exemplified by the
         fact that there are ball bearings in fighter jets and space shuttles); with the
         development of new materials (lighter and stronger) and of new technologies
         (especially “green” technologies), there is a need to keep innovating.
      • To remain competitive: if RDB fails to innovate, it will lose its market share
         and maybe its reputation. RDB has successfully overcome several competitive
         challenges (eg against UAB and FIB in the 1930s, or against Japanese
         companies after the second world war) but sustaining a competitive advantage
         is key to any business strategy (this is in fact how Michael Porter defines
         strategy).
      • To attract potential customers: if RDB is to widen its pools of customers (not
         just from the manufacturing community but also from the design community),
         it may need to offer slightly different types of ball bearings; R&D are essential
         in terms of innovation, which is why Anna wants to invest in that part of
         RDB’s activities.
      • Innovation is required to save energy, which was RDB’s main aim and was a
         key element of the company’s credentials as a ‘green’ business.

      Accept any other relevant reason and explanation.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct reason identified and [1 mark] for
      an explanation of that reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Anna Holstein believes that “the marketing department should start carrying
      out market research” (lines 114–115). Analyse the roles that primary and
      secondary research could play for RDB.                                      [7 marks]

      Market research could play several roles:
      • Primary market research could help RDB’s marketing department find out
        more precisely from their existing customers what they need and want (the case
        study implicitly suggests that RDB has followed a product-orientation
        marketing strategy as opposed to a market orientation one). One of the tasks of
        the “engineers-turned-salesmen” could be to carry out primary research
        (eg through interviews) to feedback to the R&D department about ways in
        which RDB can produce competitive ball bearings.
      • Secondary market research could help RDB’s marketing department understand
        the current demand for ball bearings and trends in the market; it would offer a
        background picture, including an analysis of existing products offered by
        RDB’s competitors. This could provide useful indications to the R&D
        department about the directions in which they should develop new products
        (for example, greener ball bearings, or ball bearings adapted to the needs of the
        design community).

      Accept any other relevant analysis.
                                                  –7–              M13/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


           Candidates are not expected to refer to all the above points for full marks, but
           their analysis must be balanced in order to reach the top markband. This balance
           could be about primary vs secondary research, or it could be articulated in terms
           of supply vs demand, or product orientation vs market orientation.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


2.   (a)   Using a SWOT analysis framework, identify two weaknesses and two threats
           to RDB.                                                                  [4 marks]

           RDB weaknesses could include the following:
           • senior management does not always pay attention to some warning signals
             (eg the need for maintenance and technological upgrades)
           • there are high pollution levels near RDB factories (which has attracted some
             environmental campaigners), so they may need to review their operations,
             especially if they want to enhance their corporate social responsibility and their
             “green” credentials
           • the conflict between father and daughter, the two top figures in the
             family-owned business, could lead to problems for the company overall
           • marketing activities are limited, which is a weakness in any competitive
             business environment
           • no cultural understanding of customers.

           RDB threats could include the following:
           • Demand for ball bearings is slowing down in Europe, whereas growing
             substantially in countries such as Brazil, China and India. At present, RDB is
             not present in these countries.
           • Demographic changes in Europe may eventually undermine Valdemar’s vision
             of a “happy European family”.
           • Global economic interconnectedness: any economic crisis, such as the global
             banking crisis of 2008 or economic recession in almost any part of the world
             may affect RDB.
           • Competition past (eg Japanese companies in the 1970s) and present.

           Accept any other relevant weakness/threat.


           N.B. The threats must be explicitly about external factors (ie factors that could be
           identified through a PEST/STEEPLE analysis); the weaknesses must be internal
           (ie about finance, marketing, leadership etc).

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct weakness identified, up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Using data from the additional information on page 3, calculate RDB’s:

      (i)    return on capital employed (ROCE) in 1965 and 1975.                      [2 marks]

                      Net profit before interest and tax
             ROCE =                                      × 100
                           Total capital employed

                                    1965                               1975

              ROCE            22                                 34
                                 × 100 = 18.18%                      × 100 = 16.75%
                             121                                 203



             N.B. Do not penalize the absence of % sign. Candidates can give their
             responses to 1 or 2 decimal places.

             Award [1 mark] for each correct answer (no working required), up to a
             maximum of [2 marks].

             Candidates should not be awarded any marks merely for writing down a
             formula (as the formula is provided).

      (ii)   stock turnover in 1965 and 1975.                                         [2 marks]

             Stock turnover is calculated in one of two ways:

                         Cost of goods sold
             Method 1:
                            Average stock
                         = number of times stock turned over in a year

             or

                            Average stock
             Method 2:                        × 365
                         Cost of goods sold
                         = stock turnover in days

             COGS = Sales revenue – gross profit

             For 1965 COGS = 113 − 35 = 78
             For 1975 COGS = 194 − 56 = 138

    In the absence of an average stock figure being provided, or in the absence
    of two consecutive years’ figures, candidates should use the stock figure for
    the year requested. Thus, stock turnover for RDB would be:

                               1965                              1975
Method 1:          78                               138
Stock turnover        =                                 =
                   29                                54
(times per year)
                   2.69 times per year              2.56 times per year
Method 2:          29                                54
Stock turnover        × 365 = 136 days                  × 365 = 143 days
                   78                               138
(in days)


    N.B. Do not penalize the absence of units: times per year or days.
    Candidates can give their responses to 1 or 2 decimal places when using
    Method 1.

    Award [1 mark] for each correct answer (no working required), up to a
    maximum of [2 marks]. If the candidate incorrectly calculates cost of goods
    sold but otherwise performs the calculations correctly, award [1 mark]
    because of own figure rule (OFR).

    Candidates should not be awarded any marks merely for writing down a
    formula (as the formulae are provided).

(c)   Interpret your results from part (b).                                                   [7 marks]

      Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR) from calculations made in part (b).

      The comparison of the two sets of ratios suggests a company that has experienced
      a slight deterioration in efficiency between 1965 and 1975. The decrease in
      ROCE from 18.18 % to 16.75 % is not a dramatic decline, but it is not a positive
      indicator. Were ROCE to continue to decline by this amount for another two or
      three decades (as the case study implies), these minor negative concerns would
      grow into major concerns about efficiency. The increase in stock turnover is
      similar. Though the increase in stock turnover from 136 to 143 days is not a huge
      increase, it is not a positive sign. This ratio means that, on average, raw materials
      purchased by RDB and converted into stock is on the company’s books for
      136–143 days, between four and five months. Without industry comparisons, it is
      not possible to fully understand the implications of this length of time.

      Nevertheless, this stock situation seems like a long time to hold stock and that
      implies the company relies on a just-in-case stock control method. As with the
      ROCE, the increase is relatively minor but nevertheless a worrisome sign.
      In combination, the two sets of ratios suggest a slippage of the company in terms
      of efficiency, coming at a time when RDB is facing increased competition from
      foreign competitors (Japanese). One of the major issues facing RDB is just as
      these ratios indicate: a slow deterioration of its situation, one that Valdemar did
      not fully appreciate and which, by the twenty-first century, had become a much
      greater problem. Still a profitable company, a smouldering problem was
      occurring at RDB over many decades, and the changes suggested by the changes
      in these ratios are an indication of it.


      If a candidate uses only one of the sets of ratios (for example only ROCE), award
      a maximum of [4 marks]. For [6–7 marks], answers must be balanced, which is
      to say some recognition that the company is still healthy and profitable even
      though there are some worrying signs. Also the balance required for higher marks
      means that both efficiency ratios need to be interpreted.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    retrenchment (line 133)                                                        [2 marks]

                  Retrenchment occurs when a business cuts its workforce (by laying-
                  off/redundancy), closing factories / branches and is sometimes called
                  downsizing.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  N.B. Strictly speaking, retrenchment is not necessarily only about HR (as it
                  could imply streamlining production or downsizing a product portfolio,
                  however candidates are only expected to refer to the HR dimension).

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   commission (line 153).                                                         [2 marks]

                  A commission is a form of payment to an agent (eg salesperson) often
                  calculated on a percentage basis of sales made.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

(b)   With reference to RDB, distinguish between flow production and job
      production (lines 63–66).                                          [4 marks]

      Flow production (also called mass production and line production) means
      producing a standardized product using a continuous flow of production, typically
      through an assembly line. As mentioned in the case study, RDB manufactures its
      standard-sized ball bearings using a flow production process – this corresponds to
      the archetypal imagery of the conveyor belt on the shop floor of Fordist
      megafactories. It is about high volumes ie quantity.

      Job production, on the other hand, is not about quantity and standardization,
      but about designing and producing a special product that precisely fits the
      customer’s requirements; a typical example would be a wedding cake of a
      particular size and shape, or in the case of RDB: “one-off special orders, such as
      large ball bearing systems for power stations or mines”. The mark-up and the
      prices are then high, but it is much more expensive and complex to produce, as
      opposed to flow production.


      [1–2 marks]
      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some knowledge of flow production
      and job production. Award [2 marks] for an answer that refers to the difference
      between flow production and job production at a generic, theoretical level.

      [3–4 marks]
      Award [3 marks] for an answer that combines “theory” (ie definitions) and
      “practice” (ie reference to the case study). Award [4 marks] for an answer that
      fully and clearly distinguishes between flow production and job production with
      reference to RDB.

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for RDB of forming “strategic
      alliances with ball bearing companies in Brazil, China and India” (line 155). [7 marks]

      A strategic alliance is a collaborative agreement between two or more firms to
      pursue a set of agreed goals, but where the firms remain completely independent
      organizations. The alliance ends when the goals are achieved.

      Advantages:
      Demand for ball bearings is growing in Brazil, China and India. The proposed
      strategic alliances with companies based in these countries will provide cheaper
      options for RDB to sell directly to them by providing access to the markets and
      local knowledge of their specific cultures and characteristics. This would satisfy
      Anna’s objective to be closer to customers. RDB would be able to share fixed
      costs, technical knowledge and resources with its strategic partners and would
      gain access to new distribution channels.

      For Valdemar, it means that RDB would not need to close or downsize its
      European megafactories.

      Disadvantages:
      RDB may lose of control over important issues as product quality, operating costs
      and employees. The RDB brand may be damaged by partners who do not meet
      their high operational standards. In addition finding suitable partners may be time
      consuming and therefore costly, especially because potential partners are in three
      different countries in which RDB have not operated. There may be language and
      cultural barriers between RDB and its strategic partners and the possibility of
      conflicting objectives, strategies, corporate values, and ethical standards.

      Strategic alliances must be mutually beneficial, typically reducing overall costs
      (for the companies involved) and better satisfying customers. The strategic
      partners could probably benefit from RDB’s experience and long tradition of
      manufacturing high quality ball bearings, however RDB would have to convince
      them. With strategic alliances, the businesses remain independent and still
      compete on some markets, which might not be sustainable for RDB in the long
      term.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      Candidates are not expected to cover all the above-mentioned points.

                                            SECTION B

4.   (a)   Identify two causes and two consequences of the possible relocation of RDB
           factories.                                                                 [4 marks]

           Causes could include:
           • the market demand for ball bearings is shifting from Europe to countries such
             as Brazil, China and India
           • the current workforce (in the European factories) do not culturally understand
             their customers in those new markets; they could lose them to competitors that
             are local or are more culturally-aware
           • Anna believes that the sites of production (the factories) should be located
             closer to the sites of consumption (where customers are)
           • the cost of labour is lower in other parts of the world.

           Consequences could include:
           • relocating would eventually save time (without the delays due to transport,
             logistics and distribution)
           • relocating would eventually save money (without the costs of transport,
             storage, logistics and distribution)
           • relocating would require building/opening new factories
           • relocating would require hiring local workers as well as local managers
           • relocating would lead to job losses at current factory locations
           • relocation could lead to greater profitability.

           Accept any other relevant cause/consequence.


           N.B. The causes must clearly be reasons why RDB is considering the relocation;
           some candidates are likely to mix causes and consequences.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct cause identified, up to a maximum
           of [2 marks].

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct consequence identified, up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Explain why shortening the working capital cycle would be “an important
      benefit for RDB” (line 83).                                             [4 marks]

      The working capital cycle can be defined as “money tied up in the business and
      used to finance its day-to-day needs, such as buying raw materials” (Clark, P.
      et al., 2009, Business and Management Course Companion, page 149, Glasgow,
      U.K., Oxford University Press). In the case of RDB, the working capital cycle
      includes money spent to buy raw materials (eg steel) which then becomes (unsold)
      stock (eg ball bearings); when the stock is sold, consumers (debtors) pay for it
      (sometimes after a slight delay expressed in debtors days) and cash is returned
      into the business (to pay for new raw materials from suppliers as well as workers’
      salaries etc). Having factories in Brazil, China and India would mean that the
      customers based there would receive the goods more quickly (without delays due
      to distribution and delivery). This could ensure prompter payment which, in turn,
      could result in a faster purchase of new raw materials to produce more ball
      bearings (a sort of virtuous circle). Utilizing working capital more effectively is
      actually an internal source of finance that also enables the company (RDB in this
      case) to manage its stock better. Just as the Japanese companies adopting just-in-
      time (JIT) production in the 1970s (as mentioned in the case study), RDB could
      also consider that approach in order to further shorten the working capital cycle in
      its new, flexible factories.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic answer showing some limited knowledge of the
      working capital cycle (for example, a definition of “working capital”, but no
      reference to the cycle that includes raw materials, stock and payment).

      Award [2 marks] for an answer which shows some knowledge and understanding
      of the working capital cycle (yet without application to RDB).

      Award [3 marks] for an answer which correctly applies the working capital cycle
      to RDB.

      Award [4 marks] for an answer which correctly applies the working capital cycle
      to RDB and explains why shortening it would be an important benefit for the
      company.

(c)   With reference to RDB, contrast one advantage and one disadvantage of
      operating in the business-to-business (B2B) market.                   [4 marks]

      For RDB, advantages of operating in the B2B market include the following:
      • RDB is a well-established company known for the quality of their ball bearings,
        so they have a solid reputation with their business customers (they do not need
        expensive and wide-ranging campaigns to create brand awareness)
      • advertising to business customers in the B2B market is more focused than
        advertising to a very high number of individual customers
      • marketing in the B2B market place is likely to be easier, and possibly less
         expensive than B2C marketing, because RDB’s business customers are more
         likely concerned with the quality and function of its products rather than the
         image or brand perception of the company. RDB has a well-established
         reputation for quality and so the product may sell itself and minimize the
         promotional spend.

      For RDB, disadvantages of operating in the B2B market include the following:
      • there may be only a small number of business customers, who consequently
        may have strong bargaining power (reference to Porter’s Five Forces model) so
        they can negotiate contracts and discounts (which is not in RDB’s favour)
      • the impact of economic recessions may be more significant on capital goods
        industries and hence on RDB’s orders from these industries
      • the marketing channels for B2B are more restricted than for B2C. For
         example, it is likely to be more difficult to use the social media to promote
         industrial products, like ball bearings, rather than B2C products, where
         recommendations and word of mouth promotion can be important.

      Accept any other relevant contrasting advantage/disadvantage.


      N.B. B2B is different to direct marketing and is not about supply chain.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct advantage/disadvantage identified
      and an additional [1 mark] for the development of that point up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].

(d)   Discuss whether Anna Holstein’s “RDB 2020” plan is ethical.                           [8 marks]

      Anna’s plan may be presented as ethical for several reasons. One of the
      cornerstones of “RDB 2020” is “green” engineering (the topic that Anna studied at
      university); it is about energy efficiency and environmental friendliness.
      When she started working at RDB, implementing “green” approaches to
      manufacturing was her personal mission – and with “RDB 2020” she is turning
      this personal mission into a corporate strategy. Sustainable development is one of
      the values underpinning corporate social responsibility and business ethics in
      general. Anna’s plan aims to ensure the financial success of RDB in the 21st
      century (making sure the family business remains a key player in the ball bearing
      industry) – this is most ethical for the continuing survival of RDB in a
      global context.

      It is however possible to argue that Anna’s plan is unethical, when one considers
      some of the direct implications, especially about the workers of the European
      megafactories who are likely to lose their jobs. This actually goes further than
      just relocating, outsourcing and offshoring: as stressed by Valdemar, RDB has had
      almost a century of strong links with the local communities where it has been
      based, contributing to the development of “company towns”, working in
      partnerships with national governments and other stakeholders. Valdemar’s
      references to a “social contract” and to “a moral obligation to provide jobs in
      Denmark” are powerful counterparts to Anna’s own ethical views about
      sustainable development.

      Accept any other relevant discussion.


      It does not matter which conclusion candidates reach at the end of their discussion
      (ie whether they conclude that the plan is ethical or not), however for the top
      markband there must be a final conclusion.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
