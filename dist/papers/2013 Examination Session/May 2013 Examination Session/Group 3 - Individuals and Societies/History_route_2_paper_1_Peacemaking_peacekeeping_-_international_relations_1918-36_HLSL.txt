These sources and questions relate to the Ruhr Crisis (1923).

SOURCE A                Extract from a public statement made by the German president Friedrich Ebert,
                        10 January 1923.

Compatriots! Based upon military power a foreign nation is about to damage the right of self-determination
of the German people. Again one of Germany’s adversaries [enemies] invades German territory. The policy
of force, which since the conclusion of peace has been violating the treaties and trampling [crushing] on
human rights, threatens the principal German economic district, the main source of Germany’s labour,
the bread of German industry and the entire working classes. The French move is a continuation of wrong
and violence and a violation of the Treaty [of Versailles] aimed at a disarmed nation. Germany was willing
to pay within the limits of its capacity. Without being heard in Paris, it is going to be attacked.


SOURCE B                Extract from Crisis and Renewal in France, 1918–1962 edited by Kenneth Mouré
                        and Martin S Alexander, 2002.

The allies turned against France in the autumn. Britain had long been haunted by ideas of French
predominance [domination] and was now horrified by German collapse. Forgetting that both were
temporary conditions, Britain approached the United States about a new reparation inquiry with US
involvement; this was granted on an unofficial basis, adding US financial power to British views …
As 1924 began, the Dawes committee set to work, leaving French policy at Anglo–American mercy.
Diplomatic isolation, national weariness, and above all financial crisis drove Prime Minister Poincaré
from office in June. Others presided over France’s defeat at the London Conference of 1924, where the
Versailles Treaty was revised at the insistence of American bankers and British leaders, and led to
Locarno in 1925. There Britain succeeded in restoring Germany to equality and itself to the centre
of power. When the Locarno Treaties were signed, the Ruhr occupation had ended.

                        attacking Germany.

SOURCE D                Extract from Grandeur and Misery of Victory, memoirs of French prime minister
                        Georges Clemenceau, 1930.

When, on 26 September, Germany had given up passive resistance, we were obliged to go back to the
system of conferences and meetings of experts. Committees were set up, and were to meet in Paris.
But – and this was the great innovation! – the presidency of one of these committees was entrusted to General
Dawes of the US, and the president of the second committee was an Englishman, Reginald McKenna.

From the political point of view, the consequences were disastrous. The League of Nations was henceforth
to be in charge of the question of disarmament. The United States became the arbiters [mediators] for
everything connected with the implementation of one of the most important parts of the Treaty of Versailles,
which they had not ratified!

That was tying our hands forever and at the same time surrendering our complete independence, as well as
the rights conferred on us by the Treaty of Versailles.

The Ruhr invasion failed. While France met no military opposition to the occupation, she was condemned
by Britain and the United States. Moreover, German passive resistance deprived France of most of the
material advantages she had expected.

The Ruhr occupation also hurt Germany. The Germans lost more in revenue [income] from the Ruhr
in the nine months of passive resistance than they had paid in reparations in all the years since the war.
Further, the complete collapse of the German currency increased agitation from both the extreme left and
right and called into question the continued existence of the Weimar Republic.

There was no way the United States could escape the consequences of a German economic collapse.
Germany’s inability, or refusal, to pay reparations would make it impossible for the United States to collect
war debts from the allies. And Europe’s economic recovery, upon which the vitality of America’s European
trade and investments depended, would also prove impossible if Germany’s economy were ruined.
Further, an economically and militarily weakened Germany, it was feared, could not serve as an effective
barrier against Bolshevism, let alone remain a stable democracy.
