                                              SECTION A

Both texts are about the Imperial War Museum in London. The first is a review of a visit to the museum
on the international website, Trip Advisor, the second is a guide in London’s Time Out encouraging local
people to visit it.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• identify the different text types and their purposes commenting on some of the formal characteristics
  of each, including the ways in which the reader is addressed
• identify the different target audiences and their contexts; compare some of the ways in which both
  texts anticipate both the needs and the reactions of these audiences (such as the ways in which
  practical advice is given or the different uses of language and register)
• comment on the structure and layout of the guide, including the purpose and effect of the illustrations;
  comment on some of the features of the webpage layout such as symbols and rankings and some of the
  formal features of its text (use of quotation marks, parenthetical comments)
• comment on some of the differences of focus and tone between the two texts, for example the
  emphasis in the guide on the spectacular and the quirky, on the “feel good” experience of doing
  something “cultural”, in the review on practical advice for the visitor and, above all on what can be
  learned (from exhibitions, documents, newsreels, etc).


A good to excellent analysis may also:

• explore the contrast between the prescriptive flying visit the guide has in mind and the review’s advice
  that is a flexible compromise between the leisurely and the expeditious
• contrast the assumptions the guide makes about the visitor’s limited previous knowledge of the
  museum’s subject matter (as evidenced by the clichés, the stereotypes and the references to popular
  culture) with the tourist’s interest in history and his/her experience of similar museums
• analyse in more depth the different approaches to visiting the same museum which could include
  comment on the contrast between some of the following: trivialisation, parochialism and morbidity in
  the guide, subjectivity, compassion and internationalism in the review
• offer a concluding assessment of the effectiveness of the texts as guides to visiting the museum.

                                             SECTION B

The speakers in both these texts, a first person narrative by the Pakistani author, Mohsin Hamid and a
speech by a former British Foreign Secretary, express pride in their respective countries.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• comment on some of the similarities between the texts (such as both being types of speeches) as well
  as identifying some of the differences between them in terms of audience, context and purpose
• compare and contrast what the speakers have to say about their respective peoples and some of the
  ways in which they are proud of their countries
• notice that food is a common element in both texts and make some comment on what chicken tikka in
  particular represents for each speaker
• comment on some of the other differences of focus: for example the politician’s emphasis on
  the historical, the socio-economic, the conceptual and the celebratory in contrast with the physical –
  even sensual – and more overtly emotional and imagistic discourse of the narrator
• comment on the ways in which the speakers address their audiences, which could include observations
  about tone, register and the use of pronouns. Suggest some contextual reasons for these differences.


A good to excellent analysis may also:

• explore more fully the purposes of the speech in relation to the target audience in London and to what
  is implied about the interlocutor of the literary passage whose words are not reported
• analyse in more depth the similarities and differences between the speakers’ views of their respective
  countries’ pasts and presents
• contrast the politician’s views of inclusiveness and shared values with the narrator’s view of
  exclusiveness and difference
• comment more fully on the similarities and differences between the rhetorical strategies of the two
  speakers and explore their impact on the reader
• comment further on the references to food and its significance for the two speakers as a component of
  national identity
• draw attention to some of the ironies that derive from the pairing of these two texts.
