            Extract from a speech by Labour Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to the Social Market Foundation*
            in London

            London was first established as the capital of a Celtic Britain by Romans from Italy.
            They were in turn driven out by Saxons and Angles from Germany. The great cathedrals of
            this land were built mostly by Norman Bishops, but the religion practised in them was secured
            by the succession of a Dutch Prince. Outside our Parliament, Richard the Lionheart proudly
     5      sits astride his steed. A symbol of British courage and defiance. Yet he spoke French much of
            his life and depended on the Jewish community of England to put up the ransom that freed him
            from prison.

            The idea that Britain was a “pure” Anglo-Saxon society before the arrival of communities from
            the Caribbean, Asia and Africa is fantasy. But if this view of British identity is false to our past,
    10      it is false to our future too. The global era has produced population movements of a breadth and
            richness without parallel in history.

            Today’s London is a perfect hub of the globe. It is home to over 30 ethnic communities of at
            least 10 000 residents each. In this city tonight, over 300 languages will be spoken by families
            over their evening meal at home.

    15      This pluralism is not a burden we must reluctantly accept. It is an immense asset that contributes
            to the cultural and economic vitality of our nation. […] Our cultural diversity is one of the
            reasons why Britain continues to be the preferred location for multinational companies setting
            up in Europe.

            And it isn’t just our economy that has been enriched by the arrival of new communities.
    20      Our lifestyles and cultural horizons have also been broadened in the process. This point is
            perhaps more readily understood by young Britons, who are more open to new influences and
            more likely to have been educated in a multi-ethnic environment. But it reaches into every
            aspect of our national life.

            Chicken Tikka Masala is now a true British national dish, not only because it is the
    25      most popular, but because it is a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts
            external influences. Chicken tikka is an Indian dish. The masala sauce was added to satisfy the
            desire of British people to have their meat served in gravy. […]

            The modern notion of national identity cannot be based on race and ethnicity, but must
            be based on shared ideals and aspirations. Some of the most successful countries in the
    30      modern world, such as the United States and Canada, are immigrant societies. Their experience
            shows how cultural diversity, allied to a shared concept of equal citizenship, can be a source of
            enormous strength. We should draw inspiration from their experience.


                                         Adapted from www.guardian.co.uk (2001) Issue: Thursday 19 April 2001
