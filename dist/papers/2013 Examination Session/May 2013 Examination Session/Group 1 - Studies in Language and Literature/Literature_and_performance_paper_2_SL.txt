Answer one question. Refer closely to the works of at least two poets you have studied.

1.    In the works of some poets, there is often a sense of fatefulness, that certain things are destined to
      occur. In the works of at least two poets you have studied, evaluate how far this sense of fate is part
      of their poetic focus and how they have communicated this perception or even rejected it.


2.    Metaphors are comparisons that are often used in poetry to ask readers to think imaginatively.
      In the works of at least two poets you have studied, show how such comparisons ask readers to see
      the world in new ways.


3.    Poems can be delivered in language that is formal and structured or expressed in a manner that seem
      more like everyday conversation. In the works of at least two poets you have studied, show how one
      or both kinds of language have been used to good effect.


4.    Plant and animal life can be included in poems to provide interest and energy. In the works of at least
      two poets you have studied, show how poets have used such materials to engage their readers.


5.    Poets can offer strong criticism of human behavior in a variety of ways: through pointed, harsh
      judgment or through indirect approaches, such as humor or generalizing. In what ways have at least
      two poets you have studied used their art to criticize?


6.    Poets can develop their ideas in logical or linear ways, or in impressionistic, circular structures.
      In the works of at least two poets you have studied, discuss the ways in which they have effectively
      structured their poems.
