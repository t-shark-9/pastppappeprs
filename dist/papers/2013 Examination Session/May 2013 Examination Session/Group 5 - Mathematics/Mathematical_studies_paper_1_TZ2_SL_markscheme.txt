                                          Instructions to Examiners

Notes:     If in doubt about these instructions or any other marking issues, contact your team leader
           for clarification.

           The number of marks for each question is 6.

1    Abbreviations

     The markscheme may make use of the following abbreviations:

     M     Marks awarded for Method

     A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy

     C     Marks awarded for Correct answers (irrespective of working shown)

     R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning

     ft    Marks that can be awarded as follow through from previous results in the question

2    Method of Marking

     (a)   All marking must be done in scoris using the mathematical studies annotations and in
           accordance with the current document for guidance in e-marking Mathematical Studies SL.
           It is essential that you read this document before you start marking.

     (b)   If the candidate has full marks on a question use the C6 annotation, if the candidate has made
           an attempt but scores zero marks use C0. If there is no attempt use the No response button.
           If a candidate does not score full or zero marks then full annotations MUST be shown.

     (c)   In this paper, if the correct answer is seen on the answer line the maximum mark is awarded.
           There is no need to check the working! Award C marks and move on.

     (d)   If the answer does not appear on the answer line, but the correct answer is seen in the working box
           with no subsequent working, award the maximum mark.

     (e)   If the answer is wrong, marks should be awarded for the working according to the markscheme.

     (f)   Working crossed out by the candidate should not be awarded any marks. Where candidates have
           written two solutions to a question, only the first solution should be marked.

     (g)   A correct answer in the working box transcribed inaccurately to the answer line can receive full marks.

     (h)   If correct working results in a correct answer in the working box but then further working
           is developed, full marks should not be awarded. In most such cases it will be a single final answer
           mark that is lost, however, a statement on the answer line should always be taken as the candidate’s
           final decision on the answer as long as it is unambiguous.
           Accuracy of numerical answers is an exception to this rule – see Section 5.

               Markscheme                                 Candidates’ Scripts                          Marking

                                         (ii)    Working box: ( x  6) ( x  1)                        (A1)
                                                 followed by x  6 and 1 , or just 6,  1
                                                 in either working box or on answer line.              (A0)


3    Follow through (ft) Marks

     Errors made at any step of a solution affect all working that follows. To limit the severity of the penalty,
     follow through (ft) marks can be awarded. Markschemes will indicate where it is appropriate to
     apply follow through in a question with ‘(ft)’.

    (a)     Follow through applies only from one part of a question to a subsequent part of the question.
            Follow through does not apply within the same part.

    (b)     If an answer resulting from follow through is extremely unrealistic (e.g. negative distances or incorrect
            by large order of magnitude) then the final A mark should not be awarded.

    (c)     If a question is transformed by an error into a different, much simpler question then follow through
            may not apply.

    (d)     To award follow through marks for a question part, there must be working present for that part.
            An isolated follow through answer, without working is regarded as incorrect and receives no marks
            even if it is approximately correct.

     (e)    The exception to the above would be in a question which is testing the candidate’s use of the GDC,
            where working will not be expected. The markscheme will clearly indicate where this applies.

     (f)    Inadvertent use of radians will be penalised the first time it occurs. The markscheme will give clear
            instructions to ensure that only one mark per paper can be lost for the use of radians.

4   Using the Markscheme

    (a)   A marks are dependent on the preceding M mark being awarded, it is not possible to award
          (M0)(A1). Once an (M0) has been awarded, all subsequent A marks are lost in that part of the
          question, even if calculations are performed correctly, until the next M mark.
          The only exception will be for an answer where the accuracy is specified in the question – see
          section 5.

    (b)   A marks are dependent on the R mark being awarded, it is not possible to award (A1)(R0).
          Hence the (A1) is not awarded for a correct answer if no reason or the wrong reason is given.

    (c)   Alternative methods may not always be included. Thus, if an answer is wrong then the working
          must be carefully analysed in order that marks are awarded for a different method consistent with
          the markscheme.
          Where alternative methods for complete questions are included in the markscheme, they are indicated
          by ‘OR’ etc.
                                                                                                   sin 
    (d)   Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms. For example:                 for tan  .
                                                                                                   cos 
          On the markscheme, these equivalent numerical or algebraic forms will sometimes be written in
          brackets after the required answer.
          Where numerical answers are required as the final answer to a part of a question in the markscheme,
          the scheme will show, in order:
          the 3 significant figure answer worked through from full calculator display;
          the exact value (for example 3 if applicable);
          the full calculator display in the form 2.83163… as in the example above.
          Where answers are given to 3 significant figures and are then used in subsequent parts of the
          question leading to a different 3 significant figure answer, these solutions will also be given.

    (e)   As this is an international examination, all valid alternative forms of notation should be accepted.
          Some examples of these are:

          Decimal points: 1.7; 1’7; 1  7 ; 1,7 .

          Different descriptions of an interval: 3 < x < 5; (3, 5); ] 3, 5 [ .

          Different forms of notation for set properties (e.g. complement): A ; A ; Ac ; U  A;( A ;U \ A.
          Different forms of logic notation:  p ; p  ; p ; p ; ~ p.
                                              pq; pq; q p.

    (f)   Discretionary marks: There will be very rare occasions where the markscheme does not cover the
          work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used to indicate where an examiner has used
          discretion. Discretion should be used sparingly and if there is doubt an exception should be raised
          through scoris to the team leader.

The AP, FP and UP penalties no longer apply. Accuracy and units will be assessed in particular questions
and the marks applied according to the rules given in sections 5, 6 and 7 below.

5    Accuracy of Answers

     Incorrect accuracy should be penalized once only in each question according to the rules below.

     Unless otherwise stated in the question, all numerical answers should be given exactly or correct
     to 3 significant figures.

     1.    If the candidate’s unrounded answer is seen and would round to the required 3 sf answer, then
           award (A1) and ignore subsequent rounding.
     Note: The unrounded answer may appear in either the working box or on the final answer line.

     2.    If the candidate’s unrounded answer is not seen then award (A1) if the answer given is correctly
           rounded to 2 or more significant figures, otherwise (A0).
     Note: If the candidate’s unrounded answer is not seen and the answer is given correct to 1 sf (correct or not),
           the answer will be considered wrong and will not count as incorrect accuracy. If this answer is used in
           subsequent parts, then working must be shown for further marks to be awarded.

     3.    If a correct 2 sf answer is used in subsequent parts, then working must be shown for further marks to
           be awarded. (This treatment is the same as for following through from an incorrect answer.)

           These 3 points (see numbers in superscript) have been summarised in the table below and illustrated in
           the examples which follow.

                                                       If candidates final answer is given …
                                    Exact or
                                                  Incorrect to      Correct to    Incorrect to      Correct or
                                   correct to
                                                      3 sf            2 sf 3          2 sf       incorrect to 1 sf

     Rounding of an exact answer to 3 significant figures should be accepted if performed correctly.
                               1
     Exact answers such as        can be written as decimals to fewer than three significant figures if the result is
                               4
     still exact. Reduction of a fraction to its lowest terms is not essential, however where an answer simplifies to
     an integer this is expected.

     Ratios of π and answers taking the form of square roots of integers or any rational power of an integer
                 2
     (e.g. 13, 2 3 , 4 5 ,) may be accepted as exact answers. All other powers (e.g. of non-integers) and values
     of transcendental functions such as sine and cosine must be evaluated.

    If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
    the required accuracy. In all such cases the final mark is not awarded if the rounding does not follow
    the instructions given in the question. A mark for specified accuracy can be regarded as a (ft) mark
    regardless of an immediately preceding (M0).

6    Level of accuracy in finance questions

     The accuracy level required for answers will be specified in all questions involving money. This will usually
     be either whole units or two decimal places. The first answer not given to the specified level of accuracy
     will not be awarded the final A mark. The markscheme will give clear instructions to ensure that only
     one mark per paper can be lost for incorrect accuracy in a financial question.

Example:    A financial question demands accuracy correct to 2 dp.
