Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by
written working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      Forty families were surveyed about the places they went to on the weekend.
      The places were the circus (C ), the museum (M ) and the park (P ).

                  16 families went to the circus
                  22 families went to the museum
                  14 families went to the park
                  4 families went to all three places
                  7 families went to both the circus and the museum, but not the park
                  3 families went to both the circus and the park, but not the museum

      The cooking time of an additional 2.0 kg chicken is recorded. If the mass and
      cooking time of this chicken is included in the data, the correlation is weak.

                   that of the other eight chickens.
