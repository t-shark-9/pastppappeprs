1.   (a)   using the Euclidean Algorithm,
           332 = 3 × 99 + 35                                                               M1
            99 = 2 × 35 + 29                                                               A1
            35 = 1× 29 + 6
            29 = 4 × 6 + 5                                                                 A1
              6 = 1× 5 + 1                                                                 A1
           hence 332 and 99 have a gcd of 1                                                AG

      Note: For both (a) and (b) accept layout in tabular form, especially the brackets
            method of keeping track of the linear combinations as the method
            proceeds.
                                                                                                   [4 marks]

     (b)   (i)    working backwards,                                                      (M1)
                   6 −5 =1
                   6 − (29 − 4 × 6) = 1 or 5 × 6 − 29 = 1                                   A1
                   5 × (35 – 29) – 29 = 1 or 5 × 35 – 6 × 29 = 1                            A1
                   5 × 35 – 6 × (99 – 2 × 35) = 1 or 17 × 35 – 6 × 99 = 1
                  17 × (332 – 3 × 99) – 6 × 99 = 1 or 17 × 332 – 57 × 99 = 1                A1
                  a solution to the Diophantine equation is therefore
                   x = 17, y = 57                                                         (A1)
                  the general solution is
                   x = 17 + 99 N , y = 57 + 332 N                                         A1A1

            Note: If part (a) is wrong it is inappropriate to give FT in (b) as the
                  numbers will contradict, however the M1 can be given.

           (ii)   it follows from previous work that
                  17 × 332 = 1 + 99 × 57                                                  (M1)
                           ≡ 1(mod 57)                                                     (A1)
                   z = 332 is a solution to the given congruence                           (A1)
                  the general solution is 332 + 57N so the smallest solution is 47          A1
                                                                                                  [11 marks]
