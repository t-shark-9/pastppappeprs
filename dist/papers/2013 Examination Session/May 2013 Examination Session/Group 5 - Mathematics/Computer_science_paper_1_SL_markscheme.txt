Mark Allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

     Possible answers (there may be others)

     Performances drop;

           Access speed of secondary memory versus primary;

     May require more HW;
          Because part of the hard disk is reserved to virtual memory, hence additional
          storage space might be necessary;

     Increase power consumption;

                  Cost;
                  Time to develop/deploy;
                  Availability of documentation and training materials;
                  Suitability of the software for the task;

            Example expansions:
                 Cost –          Commercial software is usually cheaper to purchase than
                                 developing customized software;
                 Suitability – Commercial software is usually designed to appeal to a
                                 large group of potential customers and may not contain
                                 specialized features needed by the company / may contain
                                 needlessly complex tools to support functions not needed
                                 by the company;                                                  [4 marks]

      (c)   The customer could ask for modifications;
            Adding some new/different features that affect the current design;
            And that could affect the feasibility report in several ways;
            Such as costs, delivery time, technical requirements;                                 [4 marks]
            Accept these points if put in the context of “repeated analysis and design”.
