Answer all the questions.

1.    A games company employs a team of programmers for the development of
      online games.

      (a)   Identify two benefits that the online feature provides for the users of the games.      [2 marks]

      The company employs a modular approach to programme development.

      (b)   Describe two benefits that can be gained from using this approach.                      [4 marks]

      One of the games being developed is a version of Sudoku.  The game is based on
      3 % 3 grids (each consisting of nine cells).   In each grid, the user must enter all of
      the digits from 1 to 9 once only.   The grids can be represented by 2-D arrays as
      shown below.

                Grid 1                                                                 Grid 2
            0     1      2                                                         0     1      2
        0   4     2      7                                                    0    7     5      9
        1   1     6      3                                                    1    2     4      8
        2   5     9      8                                                    2    5     6      3


      Grid 1 (above) has been filled in correctly, however, Grid 2 is incorrect, as the
      digit “5” appears twice (and the digit “1” fails to appear).

      In the Sudoku program, the grid is represented by a 2-D array (called  grid).  
      For example, in Grid 1, the value represented by  grid[2][1] would be “9”.

      (c)   For Grid 2, state the value of grid[1][2].                                              [1 mark]

      When all of the cells have been filled, the program checks the number of times
      each digit has been entered, in order to see if the grid has been filled in correctly.

      (d)   Describe the data structure, digits, that would be suitable for storing the
            number of times that each digit from 1 to 9 has been entered.                           [2 marks]




                                                            (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      The method checkGrid() inspects each square of the grid and returns the
      message “Success” or “Failure” depending upon whether or not the grid has
      been filled in correctly.

      (e)   Construct the method checkGrid().                                                  [7 marks]

      One version of the game consists of nine such 3 % 3 grids joined together as shown
      below.  The grid has been partially filled in.

                                                  Grid 3
                                 0    1   2   3     4      5   6   7   8
                             0   2   3    6                    1   8   5
                             1   5   1    4                    7   4   9
                             2   7   8    9                    2   6   3
                             3
                             4
                             5
                             6
                             7
                             8



      For success, the conditions that must apply are:
      • each 3 % 3 grid must contain each digit from 1 to 9 just once (same as before)
      • each complete row must contain each digit from 1 to 9 just once
      • each complete column must contain each digit from 1 to 9 just once.

      In the example shown (Grid 3), there is a mistake in Row 1 where the digit “4” appears
      twice.

      (f)   Discuss whether the programming team will be able to reuse the
            checkGrid()  method to check all of these conditions.   You should include
            details of any modifications or conditions that would have to be made or met,
            to make this possible.                                                             [4 marks]

2.    A linked list is being used to hold the marks for a class of students.

      (a)   With reference to memory, explain how links are formed between consecutive
            nodes in a linked list.                                                                [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain why a temporary variable is used when traversing a linked list.                [2 marks]

      Each node in the list is a Student object, the Student class being shown below.

      class Student
      {
        String surname;
        int id;
        Mark firstMark; //points to the first node in a linked list of marks
        Student nextStudent; //points to the next Student node, or to null
      }


      As shown above, each Student object includes a pointer to a linked list which
      contains the student’s marks.  Each mark is contained in an object of the Mark class
      which is shown below.

      class Mark
      {
        int score;
        Mark nextMark;
      }


      (c)   Suggest why both the students and the marks are held in linked lists.                  [2 marks]

      The list holds the following data about two students:


                 Position in list      Surname        id             Marks
                        1              Kuyt           475            23, 12, 45, 12
                        2              Peters         386            54, 87



      (d)   Construct a diagram showing the linked lists, using the above data.                    [3 marks]




                                                              (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 2 continued)

      The class that is used by the system which manages the students’ marks includes the
      following methods:

      public double average(Mark firstMark){}
      //returns the average mark for the list pointed to by firstMark

      public Student locateStudent(int id){}
      //returns the pointer to a specific node in the student linked list

      public double studentAverage(int id){}
      // returns the average mark for a specific student or -1 for an
      // empty marks’ list

      (e)   Construct the method public double average(Mark firstMark).                     [7 marks]

      The average mark of a specified student is determined through the method call:

      double averageMark = studentAverage(id);


      (f)   Construct the method studentAverage(int id), making use of any
            previously defined methods.                                                     [4 marks]

3.    A hashing algorithm is used to locate records that are stored on a disk.  The algorithm
      operates on an id number (id) to produce a hash value.  This value indexes a location
      in a hash table.

      The hash table consists of an array of objects, each of which contains an id number
      and the memory location of the corresponding record.

                                       hashing
                       id                                     hash value
                                      algorithm



                                      hash table (array of objects)


      (a)   Outline one reason for choosing a hashing algorithm to access the records.          [2 marks]

      (b)   If the hashing algorithm used is id % 1000 (where % is the modulo operator),

            (i)    state the hash value produced when the id number = 24 456.                    [1 mark]

            (ii)   state another id number which would give the same hash value.                 [1 mark]

      The method hash() receives the id number and returns the hash value, which is used
      as the index to the hash table.

      Each entry in the hash table consists of an object of the class Node as shown below.

      class Node
      {
        int idNumber;       // id number of a record
        int memoryLocation; // identifies the memory location for that record
      }




                                                           (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 3 continued)

      The class that manages the hash table is partially shown below.

      class HashTable
      {
        Node [] table = new Node[?];                      // see part (c) (i) below

            void displayRecord(int memoryLocation){}
            // displays the record that is in the specified memory location

            void findRecord(int idNumber){}

            // Note: collisions are dealt with by allocating the next free space in
            // the array.
      }


      (c)     Given the hash algorithm in part (b), suggest, with reasons,

              (i)    a value for the size of the table array.                              [2 marks]

              (ii)   a value for the number of records.                                    [2 marks]

      When a record is to be displayed, the method findRecord() is called, which carries
      out the following steps:
      • the id number is passed as a parameter
      • the hash function uses the id number to calculate the array index (hash value)
      • the correct entry in the hash table is located
      • the complete record is displayed.

      (d)     Construct the method findRecord(), making use of any previously defined
              methods.                                                                     [8 marks]

      The programmer has the choice of using a hash table or a full index to access an
      individual record.

      (e)     Suggest reasons for choosing a full index and not a hash table.              [4 marks]

This question requires the use of the case study.

4.    (a)   With reference to page 4 of the case study, explain with the use of examples why
            RAM is also known as dynamic memory.                                                 [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify the data that would be stored in the firmware of a smartphone.               [1 mark]

      (c)   Describe two ways in which manufacturers have overcome the limited number
            of options that can be displayed on a touch screen.                                  [4 marks]

      (d)   Explain why the increase in use of 3G/4G phones might be of concern to
            Internet Service Providers (ISPs).                                                   [3 marks]

      (e)   By making use of both positive and negative examples, discuss whether students
            should be allowed to use smartphones during lessons at school.                       [6 marks]

      (f)   Outline why one of the chips inside a smartphone will contain an
            analogue-to-digital converter (ADC).                                                 [2 marks]

      (g)   Describe two consequences of the low power consumption of Bluetooth for
            smartphone users.                                                                    [4 marks]

      Scientists often make use of sensors when taking part in field studies.

      (h)   With reference to a specific example, describe how a smartphone could be used
            in these studies.                                                                    [3 marks]

      (i)   Suggest one reason for choosing a smartphone that makes use of a “kill” switch.      [2 marks]

      (j)   Explain why higher-pixel density leads to sharper images on a screen.                [3 marks]

      (k)   (i)    Describe a scenario in which an interrupt will cause a program to take
                   priority in a smartphone.                                                     [2 marks]

            (ii)   For the scenario in part (k) (i) outline how the program that was initially
                   running can be resumed.                                                       [2 marks]

      When a name is being searched for in a smartphone’s address book, entering the
      first letter of the name takes the user to the correct section of the book.   Entering
      the second letter then refines the search even more.

      (l)   With reference to both data structures and processing, suggest how the search
            process is carried out.                                                              [6 marks]
