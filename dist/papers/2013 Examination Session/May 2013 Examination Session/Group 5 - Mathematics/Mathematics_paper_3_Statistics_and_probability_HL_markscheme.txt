This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

It is the property of the International Baccalaureate and
must not be reproduced or distributed to any other person
without the authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.

                                      Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1     General

      Mark according to scoris instructions and the document “Mathematics HL: Guidance for e-marking
      May 2013”. It is essential that you read this document before you start marking. In particular, please
      note the following.

      Marks must be recorded using the annotation stamps. Please check that you are entering marks for
      the right question.

       If a part is completely correct, (and gains all the “must be seen” marks), use the ticks with
        numbers to stamp full marks.
       If a part is completely wrong, stamp A0 by the final answer.
       If a part gains anything else, it must be recorded using all the annotations.

      All the marks will be added and recorded by scoris.


2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

       Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked, and
        marks awarded according to the markscheme.
       It is not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding M mark(s), if
        any.
       Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, eg M1A1, this usually means M1 for an attempt
        to use an appropriate method (eg substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the correct values.
       Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks.
       Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
                                                 –4–            M13/5/MATHL/HP3/ENG/TZ0/SP/M


3   N marks

    Award N marks for correct answers where there is no working.

       Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
       There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
        penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.


4   Implied marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets eg (M1), and can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if
    implied in subsequent working.

     Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
     Marks without brackets can only be awarded for work that is seen.


5   Follow through marks

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s). To award FT marks, there must be working present and not
    just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer FT
      marks.
     If the error leads to an inappropriate value (eg sin  1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).
     Within a question part, once an error is made, no further dependent A marks can be awarded, but
      M marks may be awarded if appropriate.
     Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.


6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). A candidate
    should be penalized only once for a particular mis-read. Use the MR stamp to indicate that this has
    been a mis-read. Then deduct the first of the marks to be awarded, even if this is an M mark,
    but award all others so that the candidate only loses one mark.

     If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award fewer
      marks.
     If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (eg sin  1.5 ), do not award the mark(s) for the final
      answer(s).


7   Discretionary marks (d)

    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
    cover the work seen. In such cases the annotation DM should be used and a brief note written next to
    the mark explaining this decision.
                                                        –5–          M13/5/MATHL/HP3/ENG/TZ0/SP/M


8    Alternative methods

     Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
     specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt,
     contact your team leader for advice.

      Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
      Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
      Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
       alternatives start and finish.


9    Alternative forms

     Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

      As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
      In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
       brackets immediately following the answer.
      In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations), will
       generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the bracket or
       the form in brackets (if it is seen).
        Example: for differentiating f ( x)  2sin (5 x  3) , the markscheme gives:

               f  ( x)   2cos(5x  3)  5     10cos(5x  3)                            A1

        Award A1 for  2cos(5x  3)  5 , even if 10cos (5 x  3) is not seen.


10   Accuracy of Answers

     Candidates should NO LONGER be penalized for an accuracy error (AP).

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
     the required accuracy. When this is not specified in the question, all numerical answers should be
     given exactly or correct to three significant figures. Please check work carefully for FT.


11   Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
     crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.

12   Calculators

     A GDC is required for paper 3, but calculators with symbolic manipulation features (eg TI-89) are not
     allowed.

     Calculator notation
     The Mathematics HL guide says:
         Students must always use correct mathematical notation, not calculator notation.
     Do not accept final answers written using calculator notation. However, do not penalize the use of
     calculator notation in the working.


13   More than one solution

     Where a candidate offers two or more different answers to the same question, an examiner should only
     mark the first response unless the candidate indicates otherwise.
