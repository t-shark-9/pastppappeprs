Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, for example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

            A chicken crosses a road. It is known that cars pass the chicken’s crossing
            route, with intervals between cars measured in seconds, according to the random
            variable X , with λ = 0.03 . The chicken, which takes 10 seconds to cross the
            road, starts to cross just as one car passes.

                   before the next car arrives.

                  greater than 0.5.                                                               [6 marks]

            The rifleman scores 10 points if X ≤ 1 , 5 points if 1 < X ≤ 5 , 1 point if
            5 < X ≤ 10 and no points if X > 10 .
