Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
        structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than
        poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in quality
        and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped. The
        question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present
        but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited
        argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
        place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at
        a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered. Knowledge
        is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally placed in context,
        and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt
        at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the
        views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound
        understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
        approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always
        consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the question,
        and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used
        convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
        and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-developed and
        supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may challenge
        it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high level of
        conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
        historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated
        into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

 Following a review of marking practices it has been agreed that in order to add further clarity to the
 markscheme for Paper 3, all caveats with regard to the awarding of marks for questions that include more
 than one component (eg, compare and contrast; reasons and significance; methods and success) will be
 removed.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best fit’ to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Independence movements

1.   According to the Declaration of Independence, why did the United States desire to be free of
     British control?

     The question demands that the candidate show knowledge of the Declaration. In the Declaration,
     Thomas Jefferson stated that the British government was no longer protecting the rights of the
     colonists. In fact, Jefferson believed that the British government was infringing on their rights.
     Based on the writings of John Locke, Jefferson argued that governments exist in order to protect the
     rights of the people; therefore the people have the right to overthrow governments that do not do
     that and to establish new ones that will. Jefferson advocated respect for the ‘natural rights’ of man
     to ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’. Later in the Declaration, Jefferson enumerated the
     many wrongs that King George III had committed against the colonials. These could be used as
     additional reasons for declaring independence.

     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best
     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


2.   Assess the impact on Native Americans of one independence movement in the Americas
     after 1760.

     The South American independence movements of Bolivar and San Martín, the Mexican
     independence movement of Father Hidalgo and the American Revolution are only some of the
     examples of independence movements that candidates might use for this answer.

     In Mexico the earlier uprising of Father Hidalgo had Native Americans and the mestizo as the
     foundation for the movement, with promises of social and economic reform. As this early
     movement gave way to Creole leadership, the reforms promised to the Native Americans were
     neglected. Candidates may talk about some inclusion within society, but this will be on the edges
     with small exceptions.

     Native Americans were used by both Bolivar and San Martín as part of their forces with some
     promise of land and reform, but there was a limited positive gain. Some candidates could reference
     the abolition of slavery and address the fact that some of the native population was also affected by
     the tribute system and freed.

     For the American Revolution candidates may consider the impact of Native American assistance to
     the British and address the Treaty of Paris of 1783 and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1784, which
     abolished the boundary lines set out in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 (allowing for the settlement
     of the area) and the impact this had on Native American control of land in the area west of the
     Appalachian Mountains. Attempts at assimilation or isolation may also be discussed, as well as
     Native American involvement as British allies in the War of 1812, and the Indian Removal Act of
     1830. While relevant examples may be found well into the 1830s, candidates need to clearly
     demonstrate the links to the Revolutionary period.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best

Nation-building and challenges

3.   Examine the causes of the War of 1812.

     From the point of view of the United States, the major causes of the war were: Britain’s seizure
     of American ships and impressments of American sailors; American resentment of Britain
     (dating back to revolutionary days); the American belief that the British in Canada were arming the
     Indians and inciting them to raid American settlements in the Northwest Territories; and the
     United States’ desire for land, including the Midwest and the annexation of Canada and Florida.
     Candidates might also address the division within the United States between war hawks and doves.
     The examination of Great Britain’s actions (those that contributed to the causes for war) are also
     regarded as relevant.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best
     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


4.   Evaluate the reasons for the rise of caudillo rule in one nation in the Americas.

     Candidates may select any nation in the Americas, but popular choices will be Argentina, Mexico,
     Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru or Venezuela. Depending upon the nation selected, political, economic
     and social reasons for the rise of the caudillo may be utilized by the candidates. Reasons may
     include: the wars of independence, leaving nations more militarized; the post-war instability
     presented the military with an opportunity for a larger role in political affairs; the lack of effective
     transportation and communication infrastructure, which led to the development of regionalism and
     the regional caudillos. Stagnation of the economy also contributed to the rise of the caudillo.
     Depending upon the nation selected, individual issues, specific to that nation, should be addressed
     by the candidates. In order to successfully answer the question, the answer must be evaluative and
     not simply a descriptive list of reasons. Purely descriptive answers should not obtain high marks.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

United States Civil War: causes, course and effects 1840–1877

5.   “The Union strengths far outweighed those of the Confederacy at the beginning of the
     Civil War.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     A large number of candidates will agree with the statement, although some may question “far
     outweighed”. Strengths of the Union could include: population; industrial capacity; mileage of
     railroad track; established central government; dominant navy; economic strength with control of
     banking and financial capital. The strengths of the Confederacy may include: control of cotton
     exports; the possibility of British aid; fighting a defensive war with knowledge of the land and
     motivation to protect a “way of life”; the view that the lifestyle of the southerner was better suited
     for a military campaign; the quality of the Confederacy’s military leadership. The answer should
     address the strengths at the beginning of the war and not at the end of the conflict.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best
     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


6.   “The Reconstruction Amendments to the US Constitution failed to achieve their aims.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     The question asks the candidate to determine the degree to which the 13th, 14th and 15th
     amendments were effectively implemented. Candidates could argue that the amendments did in
     fact do all of those things in theory, but in practice the results were much different, especially after
     Union troops left the South in 1877. Slavery was abolished, but candidates might argue that
     sharecropping and the crop-lien and convict labour systems were not much different. African
     Americans were granted citizenship and equal protection under the law, but in many states, black
     codes and Jim Crow laws lessened that citizenship and protection. The closing of the Freedmen’s
     Bureau and the emergence of the Ku Klux Klan threatened African Americans. African American
     males did gain the right to vote in 1870 with the passing of the 15th Amendment, and in some
     states, particularly South Carolina and Mississippi, African Americans controlled state legislatures.
     Several African Americans were elected to the House of Representatives and two were elected to
     the US Senate. During the Redemption Period this ended, and African Americans were
     systematically denied the right to vote through literacy tests and poll taxes. The Civil Rights Act of
     1875 was declared unconstitutional in 1883. The Supreme Court ruling in Plessy v Ferguson
     protected discrimination based on colour.

The development of modern nations 1865–1929

7.   Evaluate the economic impact of railroad construction in one country in the Americas
     between 1865 and 1929.

     Possible countries for discussion would be the United States, Canada, Argentina and Mexico but
     accept any other country in the Americas as valid.

     Railroad construction boosted several aspects of the economy. Examples could be in employment,
     telegraph lines, land sales, travel and shipping. Shipping had a major impact in getting natural
     resources to industrial centres (particularly in countries in North America) and to ports overseas
     (especially in the case of primary-export countries in Latin America). It also allowed finished
     products to reach wider markets. Candidates may also demonstrate relevant knowledge by
     consideration of harmful economic effects, such as: concentration of capital; boom and bust cycles
     etc. Regardless of which country is chosen, candidates should offer specific material.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best
     fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


8.   Examine the impact of the philosophy of “indigenismo” on one nation in the Americas
     between 1880 and 1929.

     In answering this question candidates can use a number of Latin American nations, including Peru
     and Mexico. The successful answer should identify or explain the meaning of “indigenismo” as an
     attempt to achieve a more prominent role for the native peoples in the social and political life
     of the nation, and identify the role of programmes or policies that were implemented. The early
     Aprista movement in Peru and the Mexican revolutionary era are examples of where this
     philosophy was present. In Peru, the Aprista movement was a social and political movement which
     sought to end foreign ownership of natural resources and exploitation of native peoples. In Mexico,
     some of the causes of the revolution can be traced to “indigenismo”, but the major movement
     occurred in the 1920s during Obregón’s presidency when the still unresolved agrarian reform issue
     came to the fore: Obregón took up this issue and also renewed the feeling of pride in Mexican
     culture. Candidates may refer to Vasconcelos’s views on “indigenismo”. If a candidate uses a
     limited amount of relevant material outside of the question’s time frame this may be awarded credit,
     but the majority of the answer should stay within the question’s time constraints.

Emergence of the Americas in global affairs 1880–1929

9.    In what ways, and with what effects, was United States foreign policy applied to one nation in
      the Americas between 1880 and 1929?

      Many choices are possible. Most likely are Cuba, Mexico, or any other Central American or
      Caribbean nation. In nearly all cases the US intervened militarily and economically, restricting the
      sovereignty, politically and economically, of these nations. Regarding Cuba, candidates are likely
      to discuss American involvement in the Spanish–American War, the Teller and Platt Amendments
      and the Roosevelt Corollary. “With what effects” could include independence from Spain, US
      military presence and the inclusion of the Platt Amendment into the Cuban Constitution, allowing
      for continual American intervention.

      For Mexico, candidates could discuss initial American support for the Díaz regime, withdrawal of
      that support in 1910, and then subsequent involvement in the revolution. The United States
      attempted to control the revolution by oscillating between support for Madero, Huerta or Carranza.
      The Tampico incident, the occupation of Veracruz and US General Pershing’s raid into Mexico in
      search of Pancho Villa further strained the relations between the two countries.

      Other Central American nations might be Panama, Nicaragua, Honduras or Guatemala. Caribbean
      nations could include Haiti or the Dominican Republic.

      However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      fit’ to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


10.   Assess the impact of Canada’s participation in the First World War.

      Candidates could look at the impact of Canada’s participation both at home and on the battlefield.
      The First World War affected Canada economically, socially, politically and militarily.
      Economically, Canada experienced growth as a result of increased demand for agricultural and
      industrial products in support of the Allied war effort. Initially, Canada’s involvement in the war
      led to an increase in nationalism, particularly among British Canadians. The passage of the Military
      Voters Act, the Wartime Elections Act and the Military Service Act led to the Conscription Crisis
      of 1917 and division between French and British Canadians, impacting the nation both socially and
      politically. Candidates may also address Canada’s role, specifically at Halifax, as a staging location
      for convoys supplying resources for the Allies. They may then refer to the explosion of the
      munition ship which destroyed a great deal of the waterfront in Halifax. Militarily, candidates are
      likely to discuss Canada’s contributions of men and material, most notably for the battles at the
      Somme, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and in the final offensive in the autumn of 1918. After the
      war, Canada gained greater autonomy and recognition at the Paris Peace Conference and in the
      League of Nations.

The Mexican Revolution 1910–1940

11.   Compare and contrast the challenges faced by Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Calles in the
      efforts to reconstruct a post-revolutionary state in Mexico.

      Examples of challenges that may be addressed for this question include: the implementation of the
      Constitution of 1917; land reform; church–state relations; development of a political structure
      (including institutionalizing the revolution through the development of a political party); education;
      financial development; relations with the United States; labour reform. Candidates may decide to
      compare and contrast the effectiveness of both rulers’ efforts to reconstruct a post-revolutionary
      state in Mexico. Reward this but do not demand it. Direct linkage showing how each of the
      administrations dealt with the issues is necessary for the candidate to achieve upper level marks.

12.   In what ways were either the arts or education affected by the Mexican Revolution
      (1910–1940)?

      If the arts are selected, candidates might discuss the muralist movement, literature, music or dance.
      They could analyse one or two of the leading muralists, such as Diego Rivera, José Orozco or
      David Siqueiros, while focusing on the revolution’s impact on their work. The painter Frida Kahlo
      might also be mentioned. Literature tended to justify the revolution and glorify its leaders and
      participants. Likewise, music and dance were seen as celebrations of the revolution and its leaders.
      In the 1920s, the Obregón government initiated the development of the arts as a way to glorify
      Mexican culture.

      If education is selected, candidates could discuss the destruction of much of the educational
      framework during the revolution, though Pancho Villa’s improvement of education in northern
      Mexico could be mentioned. Between 1920 and 1924, under Obregón, extensive campaigns in
      education and literacy were begun as part of the Vasconcelos reforms. Under Calles, the Cristeros
      War resulted in the destruction of many schools in spite of his attempt to reform education. During
      Cardenas’s presidency, more state control was exercised over public schools – especially in rural
      areas. Candidates may refer to the so-called “socialist” education adopted as part of Cárdenas’
      educational policy.

The Great Depression and the Americas 1929–1939

13.   Assess the effectiveness of Mackenzie King’s economic policies during the Great Depression.

      Mackenzie King was prime minister at the beginning of the Great Depression, lost power in 1930,
      and returned to office in 1935. In assessing his economic policies candidates may comment on the
      lack of effectiveness at the beginning of the Depression, citing King’s view that federal aid should
      not be extended to the provinces and that there should be limited federal involvement with
      relief efforts. He felt the provinces and the municipalities should deal with the financial crisis.
      This is shown by his “a five cent piece” comment in the House of Commons, stating he would not
      give the provinces a five cent piece from the federal treasury. At the beginning of the Depression
      his view was that the solution would be a business-led recovery. He believed the answer was to
      increase capital through foreign investment. Based on King’s ineffectiveness and the worsening of
      the Depression, the Liberals and King were defeated by the Conservatives and R B Bennett in 1930.
      By 1935, after years of criticizing the Bennett government’s failure to solve the Depression,
      King and the Liberals were returned to power. This time, King implemented a number of actions
      aimed at countering the effects of the Depression. Ending the labour camps, lowering tariff rates
      with the United States (1935 and again in 1938), and passage of the National Housing Act (1938),
      the National Employment Commission (1938) and unemployment insurance (1940) were policies
      supported by King during the latter stages of the Depression. Though the reciprocal trade
      agreements with the United States improved the economy, Canada still suffered 12 %
      unemployment in 1939. Like many other countries, preparations for, and participation in, the
      Second World War ended the Great Depression in Canada. Responses that focus on the
      effectiveness of Roosevelt´s New Deal may have some relevance and may receive some credit since
      some of Mackenzie King´s policies were based on the New Deal.

14.   Examine the impact of the Great Depression on the arts in one country in the Americas.

      Answers will vary depending on the country chosen and on the focus area for the arts. The arts
      could include photography, the movie industry, the radio and literary currents. In nearly all
      countries, photography as a career became much less profitable. Many photographers became more
      focused on the daily struggles of the working class and on the government’s response to the Great
      Depression. The movie industry faced severe cutbacks, but that which survived became an avenue
      for escapism through entertainment. Radio became a popular choice for entertainment and for radio
      addresses by politicians and critics of society.

      The United States could be a popular choice in answering this question. Candidates might mention
      that many photographers were employed by the government to capture the images of the
      Depression. Some of the more notable photographers were Dorothea Lange, Walker Evans,
      James Agee and Marion Post Wolcott, along with numerous others. Hollywood made many
      gangster movies and comedies, which were seen as a form of escapism, but also produced success
      stories, which helped sustain national morale. Radio was also significant: radio addresses (fireside
      chats) were used by Franklin D Roosevelt to explain government actions and to raise the morale of
      the country; critics, such as Father Coughlin, used radio to spread their message; and radio shows,
      whether mysteries or comedies, were a diversion for most people. Literature also suffered setbacks
      during the Depression, but the Works Progress Administration employed hundreds of writers in
      many settings. Candidates might also discuss notable works, such as Steinbeck’s Grapes of Wrath.

      Exemplars from outside the US may be rather limited, but give some credit for understanding of
      impact.

The Second World War and the Americas 1933–1945

15.   Compare and contrast the treatment of Japanese Canadians and Japanese Americans during
      the Second World War.

      In both nations, the Japanese were removed from society and placed in internment camps, with
      Canada using the War Measures Act and the United States using Executive Order 9066 to authorize
      the internment. In Canada roughly 23 000, and in the US nearly 120 000 were resettled in these
      camps. In both countries, the Japanese lost property and many of their personal possessions, as they
      were only allowed to take what they could carry. This was done within a very limited time frame in
      both nations. In general, conditions were poor in both countries, though most agree it was worse in
      Canada. In Canada, internees often lived in barns and stables until they built the camps, whereas in
      the United States the camps were already built. In Canada, men who were able to work were often
      separated from their families and sent to work building roads. In the US, internees could leave the
      camp for nearby work, which was rare in Canada. A successful answer will address both
      similarities and differences. To reach the upper level marks a running comparison with clear
      linkage should be used.

16.   Examine the reaction to the Holocaust of one nation in the Americas.

      This answer will vary depending upon the nation chosen. Most candidates will address the reaction
      of nations to Jewish refugees fleeing persecution, or policies implemented by the nations to stop the
      actions taking place in Germany during this period. The lasting impact of the Depression, nativism
      and anti-Semitism are all general reasons behind the reactions of nations in the Americas to limit or
      not accept Jewish refugees. The voyage of the St Louis may be used as an example of this attitude,
      as the Jewish refugees on this ship were denied entry by Cuba, the United States and Canada.
      Acceptance of refugees slowed in most nations of the Americas from 1939. Candidates may
      discuss specific actions taken by the government of the nation selected. The actions of nations
      during and after the Holocaust are also appropriate factors for candidates to examine. An example
      of a reaction to the Holocaust during the Second World War would be the Allied War Crimes
      Declaration of December 1942, which specifically condemned Germany’s extermination of Jews,
      although policies designed to counter these actions were not immediately implemented.

Political developments in the Americas after the Second World War 1945–1979

17.   Analyse the causes leading to Canada’s Silent (or Quiet) Revolution.

      In answering this question candidates will need to make sure that they are analysing and not simply
      listing the causes. The French Canada of Quebec premier Maurice Duplessis had emphasized a
      more traditional way of life in Quebec with limited industrial development. The Duplessis
      government was criticized for being reactionary and corrupt, while French Canada in the 1950s was
      growing more urban and less rural. The power and authority of the Catholic Church, agricultural
      ruralism, limited rights for labour, the lack of technological development, limited higher
      educational opportunities and the lack of state intervention in social reform are all issues that led to
      changes that became a part of the Quiet Revolution. The criticisms in the journal Cité Libre were
      examples of concerns that would be addressed in the Liberal government of Jean Lesage.

18.   Evaluate the successes and failures of one authoritarian, non-Communist regime in the
      Americas between 1945 and 1979.

      Answers will vary depending on the country chosen. Some popular choices might be Pinochet in
      Chile, Batista in Cuba, Velasco Alvarado in Peru, Somoza in Nicaragua, Trujillo in the Dominican
      Republic, Branco and others in Brazil, Stroessner in Paraguay and Barrientos in Bolivia. Accept
      both regimes that came to power by a military coup as well as those that were established legally
      but became authoritarian (ie Juan Domingo Perón in Argentina). Do not credit any material outside
      the time frame of the question.

The Cold War and the Americas 1945–1981

19.   For what reasons, and with what effects, did McCarthyism occur in the United States in
      the 1950s?

      Candidates might cite any of the following reasons for McCarthyism: the Cold War; Truman’s
      loyalty oaths; Soviet development of the atomic/hydrogen bombs; the Rosenbergs’ convictions;
      the Alger Hiss conviction; Joe McCarthy’s personal desire for fame. Effects of McCarthyism might
      include: loss of civil liberties; hundreds of people, especially in entertainment, blacklisted;
      university professors forced to resign; the House of Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)
      hearings; increased strength of the Republican Party; general fear and suspicion in the US.

20.   Describe the impact of the Nixon Administration’s covert operations on the government of
      Chile in the early 1970s.

      In answering this question, candidates will most likely address the actions surrounding the election
      and administration of Salvador Allende. This would include both the attempts to block his
      inauguration as well as the actions that attempted to destabilize the economy (indicated by President
      Nixon’s desire to “make the economy of Chile scream”) and encourage a military coup of the
      Allende government. Operation FUBELT, also referred to as Track II, was the code name given to
      the attempts by the US to covertly influence and destabilize the economic and political systems in
      Chile. Actions that may be used to describe the attempt by the US to destabilize Chile could
      include: propaganda and financial support for opposition parties; financial support for a major
      truckers’ strike which evolved into a general strike; pursuing an invisible blockade on Chile while
      influencing decisions on loans to Chile from institutions such as the World Bank and the
      International Monetary Fund (IMF); subsidies for the Chilean opposition press and encouragement
      of opposition in the military. These actions were designed with the idea that they would aid in the
      destabilization of the Allende government. In order to answer the question successfully it will be
      important for candidates to not only discuss the covert actions, but to elaborate on the impact of
      those actions on the government of Chile. Answers that only describe the covert actions without
      reference to impact cannot score high marks.

Civil rights and social movements in the Americas

21.   “Dr Martin Luther King was the most influential leader of the Civil Rights Movement in the
      United States.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are likely to agree with the statement, though they do not have to. Those in agreement
      should cite specific examples of King’s influence. Most candidates will offer a recounting of
      King’s actions, probably beginning with the Montgomery Bus Boycott, through the March on
      Washington and concluding with his assassination. Top candidates will also focus on “most
      influential” and could discuss other civil rights leaders’ contributions. Those who disagree would
      also focus on other civil rights leaders and perhaps what some perceived as the slow pace of reform.
      Regardless of whether candidates agree or disagree, the question asks for a clear focus on Dr King.

22.   With reference to one nation in the Americas, explain the impact of the youth culture of the
      1960s and 1970s.

      Answers will vary depending upon the nation chosen by the candidate. Negative attitudes toward
      the cultural values and conventions of the middle class led to differing views toward politics,
      freedom of expression, sexuality, music, dress and drug use. It is important that the candidate
      addresses the impact of youth culture and not simply describes its characteristics. In the US
      examples of the impact of youth culture could include the development of the New Left, including
      groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Students for
      Democratic Society (SDS) and their actions in support of civil rights and in opposition to war. For
      Latin America, candidates may relate the impact of youth culture to the increasing commitment to
      social and political activism, normally associated with the left. Changes in education, method of
      protest and alternative lifestyles are other examples of possible topics of discussion. The
      explanations and specific examples used to determine the impact of the youth culture will be
      determined by the nation selected for discussion.

Into the twenty-first century – from the 1980s to 2000

23.   Examine the challenges to the restoration of democracy in Latin American nations during the
      latter decades of the twentieth century.

      This question asks the candidates to address the issue of “challenges to the restoration of
      democracy” for Latin America in general, but it does not preclude the in-depth assessment of one
      nation used as an exemplar. Issues that may be examined include: foreign debt and economic
      stagnation; poverty and income inequity; continued political influence by the military; internal
      threats from rebel forces within the country; political institutions such as civil service, the judiciary
      and legislatures remain weak after years of authoritarian rule. All of these and other issues remain
      challenges to the successful restoration of democracy.

24.   Assess the influence of the media on political campaigns in one country in the Americas
      between 1980 and 2000.

      Answers will vary according to the country chosen. Media could include television, radio,
      newspapers, magazines and even the internet, though in a rather limited fashion for the dates listed.
      Campaign advertising and its cost will probably also be mentioned, as well as the immediacy of
      coverage and the increased importance of sound bites. Candidates could pick one or two political
      campaigns and offer specific detail to evaluate the media’s influence.
