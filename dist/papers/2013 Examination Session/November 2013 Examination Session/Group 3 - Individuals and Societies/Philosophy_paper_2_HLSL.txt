      human society and human habits.


8.    Evaluate the nature, purpose and value of Plato’s educational programme.



René Descartes: Meditations

9.    Evaluate the claim that methodological doubt relieves the mind of reliance on the senses so as to
      attain indubitable truths.

      with certainty are those things we know by our judgment, thinking and understanding of them in
      our minds.



John Locke: Second Treatise on Government

11.   Evaluate the claim that “Our contemporary language of individualist politics is grounded in a tradition
      which stretches back to Locke’s vision of man and society”.


12.   Explain and discuss Locke’s conception of natural law.



John Stuart Mill: On Liberty

13.   Evaluate Mill’s view that a true society is one that allows the individual freedom of thought and

Bertrand Russell: The Problems of Philosophy

17.   Evaluate Russell’s claim that “Every proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly
      of constituents with which we are acquainted”.


18.   Evaluate the capacity of Russell’s theory of descriptions to account for claims about things that do
      not exist (for example, “Shangri-La has a perfect climate” – where Shangri-La is understood to be a
      fictional kingdom).



Hannah Arendt: The Human Condition

19.   Evaluate Arendt’s contention that the Western philosophical tradition from Plato onwards has

      contemplativa) and its concern with essences and the eternal.


20.   Evaluate Arendt’s conception of modernity.



Simone de Beauvoir: The Ethics of Ambiguity

21.   Evaluate the claim that “Life in itself is neither good nor evil. It is the place of good and evil,

      the same choice.



Charles Taylor: The Ethics of Authenticity

      respect for others and the shared natural world.


24.   Evaluate Taylor’s claim that the fragmentation of contemporary social life threatens democratic
      government.
