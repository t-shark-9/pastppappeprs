Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

(b)   (i)    Explain one reason why encryption is used in this case.                         [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              to prevent unauthorized access to data when data is transferred over the
               network to server
              to ensure that the customer’s personal details and banking information
               are safe (ie information cannot be accessed without encryption key)
              to protect from credit card fraud or identity theft – information cannot be
               accessed without encryption key
              wireless network encryption – used to protect wireless data transfer
               against “eavesdropping” and “spoofing”.

             Award [1 mark] for the reason identified, and [1 mark] for the appropriate
             explanation of it. Award a maximum of [2 marks] for the response.

      (ii)   Explain two disadvantages for the customer of using “the wallet”.               [4 marks]

             Answers may include:
              cell phone battery may not be charged – cannot use cell phone to make
               purchases
              reliability – signal from RFID may not be available to process payment,
               cannot purchase groceries
              stores may profile user data and send unwanted emails/texts to customers
              availability – wallet may not be available at all stores, users would be
               required to use another payment method
              the store will collect information from customers using the wallet about
               their shopping habits (ie could invade customer privacy)
              if the wallet gets lost or stolen, other individuals may be able to perform
               transactions causing a financial loss to the customer (ie some clients have
               the bad habit of storing their cards pin numbers in the cell phone).

             Do not accept hacking the account. This is not related specifically to “the
             wallet”.

             Award [1 mark] for each disadvantage identified, and [1 mark] for an
             explanation of that disadvantage. Award a maximum of [4 marks] for the
             response.
                                              –6–                N13/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   To what extent are the security measures used by the store during purchases
      appropriate?                                                                             [8 marks]

      Answers may include the following security measures indicated in the scenario:
       secured access to data – the setup only allows authorized users access to data
       credit card verification – PIN is required to verify user
       data backup – to ensure data is not lost, data can be recovered
       antivirus software – installed to protect system from viruses
       encryption of data – data is encrypted so if it is intercepted it is not possible to
        read information without key
       uses NFC (Near Field Communication) – an RFID with a short range so
        hackers would have to be very close to steal data
       WiFi security – the encryption of wireless network to protect data that is
        transferred between devices and servers.

      Weaknesses of the security measures. Additional security measures that the store
      should have considered:
       data backup – to ensure data is not lost, data can be recovered
       antivirus software – installed to protect system from viruses
       sharing information policy – store has a policy agreeing not to sell data to third
         party companies
       database server location/access – location of servers is within the same country
         of store so external governments or other political entities do not have access to
         it.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   Ultra Violet has policies on its website describing the user agreement.
      Explain two policies that might be included and how they protect the rights of
      users.                                                                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       user’s personal information is kept secure – user information will not be
        changed or manipulated by company
       secure data – user information will be saved in the database and cannot be
        accessed by search engines
       data sharing – user information will not be shared with third party companies
       security – user data will be protected from viruses with software and hardware
       secure data transfer – user information will be encrypted (eg personal details,
        credit card information)
       data backup – servers will be backed up so user data will not be lost, and
        access will not be compromised
       users will only be able to access Ultra Violet media using Ultra Violet –
        provides user access to age-appropriate media.

      Award [1 mark] for each policy identified, up to [2 marks] for each appropriate
      explanation he policy and how it protects the rights of users. Award a maximum
      of [6 marks] for the response.

(c)   Customers may either purchase their movies from online services such as
      iTunes by downloading them and storing them on their computer or
      streaming them from Ultra Violet. Evaluate these two options.           [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      iTunes
       anytime-anywhere access – iTunes movies can be downloaded directly to
         device, and no internet required to view files once purchased
       need a significant amount of storage on device if you want to download several
         movies
       ease of use – many users already have an iTunes account
       accessibility – can access media from computers and mobile devices
       viewing – can be viewed on home televisions using devices such as an
         AppleTV.

      UltraViolet
       streaming is limited to amount of bandwidth – movies could have buffering or
         playback problems
       requires internet access to stream from the cloud
       up to 12 devices can be accessed at a time
       does not require large amounts of storage on computer
       can have both the DVD and streamed version of the movie.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS

           (ii)   There have been issues with the accuracy of the information held in the
                  database. Describe how validation and verification are used to ensure
                  data is accurate.                                                       [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  Validation
                   automatic process to check that the data entered is reasonable using a set
                    of rules
                   validation types used to check data, such as: format, length, range, type,
                    lookup
                   process of checking data against set of validation rules is used to ensure
                    data is accurate
                   validation process does not check the accuracy of data, checks if data is
                    reasonable.

                  Verification
                   ensures the data entered exactly matches the original source
                   ensures database contains as few mistakes as possible
                   double entry verification – entering the data twice and comparing the two
                    copies (eg passwords entered twice for verification)
                   proofreading data verification – visually checking the data entered
                    against the original paper document.

                  N.B. Both validation and verification must be described in the response.

                  Award [1 mark] for each requirement identified up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks] and award [1 mark] for the description of each requirement up to
                  a maximum of [2 marks]. Award a maximum of [4 marks] for the answer.

(b)   Explain three technical issues would be needed to be addressed in order to set
      up an effective videoconferencing system.                                      [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       bandwidth – video latency and buffering issues arise due to insufficient
        bandwidth
       security – protection against unauthorized access during transmission
       hardware specifications – workstations must be able to support video
        conferencing (eg processing power, headset, webcam)
       software – software will need to be installed to run the videoconferencing
        system that meets requirements (eg screensharing, accommodates the required
        number of participants)
       providing the necessary physical components to avoid interference (ie forests,
        hills, curves, etc).

      Award [1 mark] for each type of information identified, and [1 mark] for each
      appropriate explanation of it. Award a maximum of [6 marks] for the response.

(c)   The nursing home technical staff are considering replacing the existing
      database with a new one. The two options being considered are:
      purchasing a commercial package that has been developed for institutions
        such as nursing homes
      developing the database themselves.

      Evaluate these two options.                                                           [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Commercial packages
       cannot be customized – may only partially meet needs of the nursing home
       templates – reports are already designed and ready to use
       initial cost – more expensive initially for nursing home
       nursing home staff will find it easier and more intuitive to use
       nursing home can receive customer support from the company online or on the
        phone
       looks more professional
       nursing home does not have to dedicate any of their time to the development
        process (eg specifications, design, testing etc)
       nursing home may have to alter the way they work in order to fit in with the
        way that the software has been designed
       there will probably be operations required by the nursing home that cannot be
        done with the software.
      Database created by nursing home
       the program can be customized to suit needs of nursing home
       hard for the nursing home to design if not experienced, which can be very time
        consuming
       the software used for development tends to be relatively cheap to purchase, the
        major costs come from the time to design and develop product
       support is available for the software program as there are many other users
        using the same software
       it is easy to share files produced by the software with others as they may have
        the software available to open the file
       the nursing home can make the database work the way they want, rather than
        having to adapt the way they work to meet the restrictions of the software
       nursing home may expect to pay more for it than for a packaged solution (both
        in time and money) and need a professional developer on staff at nursing home
       it has been specifically designed for particular requirements and can be tailored
        to fit with the nursing home’s needs
       it can be customized to work to interface with other software at the nursing
        home to provide a fully integrated IT system
       it is much more flexible than commercial software and can be modified and
        changed over time as requirements and nursing home practices change
       a large investment of their time is required during the development process,
        will take longer to implement than commercial package
       it can be difficult to get support
       the design of the database may not be well-documented and difficult to update
        later
       no commercial training materials exist and must be developed specifically for
        this database.

(c)   Discuss whether project management tools such as Gantt and PERT charts
      enable IT projects, such as the Crystals Fitness Centre video project, to be

      Answers may include:
       tools such as Gantt charts provide a framework, but may stifle creativity and
        ingenuity
       provides an excellent presentation tool for illustrating sequence of the task and
        demonstrating individual resources scheduled to time, but different scheduling
        possibilities cannot be shown in the same chart
       visualizing the project schedule makes it very easy for the project manager to
        communicate the project schedule to various stakeholders as well as to the
        project team, but Gantt charts are not well suited for conveying complex
        dependencies or projects having significant potential variability in completion
        dates
       allows visibility into possible extreme delivery dates, but if some activities take
        longer than expected, the critical path originally being managed to might end
        up being wrong.

        department regarding issues with hardware and software
       the technical support consultant must attempt to contact the user who reported
        the problem within the established response time goal, eg within 24 hours
       IT support services must make all effort to resolve problems in an appropriate
        timescale, eg log in issues within five minutes
       if the normal support process does not produce the desired results, or if the
        problem has changed in priority, the problem will be escalated to the next level
        of support following established guidelines
       IT support services must safeguard data sent from the company or on company
        IT systems abiding by the established rules that guide the protection of
        confidential information, eg use of passwords, levels of hierarchy for access,
        etc.

(c)   The Senior Managers at OBI International chose to have its IT support
      provided by outsourced companies rather than the in-house IT department.

      Evaluate this decision.                                                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      In-house IT department
       firsthand knowledge of specific IT structure
       immediate response to problems
       limited expertise
       high cost (ie IT support salaries, cost of specialized support software, training
         for IT support staff).

      Outsourced companies
       combined knowledge and expertise across a wide range of IT areas
       personalised service and protection
       24/7 expert availability to fix problems
       more cost effective (ie do not need to maintain an IT support department)
       privacy concerns (ie access to data stored on company IT systems).

             Answers may include:
              Samba will use sensors such as those which gather data about the
               reflectivity of the carpet, ie how clean or dirty it is
              if the reflectivity of the carpet does not meet the value expected in the
               system, the fuzzy logic will override this setting and either shorten or
               lengthen the time for cleaning
              the carpet is cleaned to the standard required and saves energy for
               cleaning that is not needed.

             [3–4 marks]
             A detailed response with a detailed knowledge and understanding of the
             topic making explicit references to the scenario. Appropriate ITGS
             terminology is used throughout the response.

(c)   To what extent will voice recognition systems be effective in future models of
      the Samba?                                                                     [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
       poor quality audio input device
       background noise
       use of preset vocabulary
       enunciation of commands
       different language/dialect/accents acknowledged
       multiple users may not be recognised by the system.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.
