Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

    0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
            appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
            detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
            are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
           limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
           but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant historical knowledge
           is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
           There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
           commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
           an understanding of historical processes has been made. An attempt at a structured
           approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
           Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
           generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
           are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
           and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
           top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant, in-depth
           knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to
           indicate some in-depth understanding, but it is not consistent throughout. Events are
           placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
           comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
           substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently
           integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
           question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
           knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
           such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
           interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
           balanced, and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
           commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
           may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
           may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
           present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
           contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
           well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   Assess the impact of monastic orders founded after 900.

     Many new orders were founded that attracted thousands of men and women. These orders became
     the spearhead in church renewal and provided many influential leaders, including popes. Religious
     devotion and piety increased as a result of individuals joining the orders and many supporting them
     financially. Orders such as the Cistercians led the way in practical arts such as agriculture, and
     taught many farmers how to improve their practices. New orders increased the number of schools
     and libraries and the literacy rates for the population increased. New orders were involved in
     charitable activities: hospitals, orphanages, hospices and shelters for the poor were established to
     counteract the difficulties of medieval life. New monastic orders also had a significant impact on
     the economy as they built a large number of new religious buildings. The Templars and the
     Hospitallers supported pilgrims and defended the Holy Land. They were strong supporters of the
     crusading movements both in the East and in Europe. The Franciscans and Dominicans proved
     effective in countering many of the opposition movements and criticisms of the Church. They also
     provided a great number of teachers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Aquinas, as well as taking
     a leading role in the suppression of heresy.

     One of the ironic impacts of the success of the new orders was that they attracted a great number of
     gifts and donations. They became wealthy and many of the old problems of corruption and moral
     laxity reappeared. Their political power caused friction with monarchs, which led to clashes
     between rulers and the Church. These developments eventually led to further criticism of the
     Church and helped to weaken its influence. Credit other relevant responses.


2.   Examine the political, economic and religious causes of the Investiture crisis (1075–1122).

     This will be a popular question. Candidates must address all three elements in their response,
     although some sections may contain more material than others. All responses must be in proper
     analytic structure supported by relevant content and specific examples.

     The political causes of the Investiture crisis may include, but not be limited to: the desire of the
     Holy Roman Emperor to control the appointment of bishops in Germany in order to maintain their
     loyalty and receive the feudal obligations from their estates. The Holy Roman Emperor wished to
     control all land grants in order to maintain his authority. In Italy the Holy Roman Emperor wished
     to control the appointment of bishops to maintain his power. The conflict was also sparked by the
     emperor’s desire to control the election of the Pope. Church reformers wanted to control the
     appointment of bishops and the Pope in order to protect Church independence and power.

     The economic causes of the Investiture crisis may include, but not be limited to: a dispute over
     church revenues and taxes. The Holy Roman Emperor wished taxes collected in Germany to
     remain in Germany while the Church wished to have them sent to Rome. The emperor also wanted
     to retain control of church lands as they were important sources of revenue to him.

     The religious causes for the Investiture crisis may include, but not be limited to: the movement for
     church reform wished to eliminate all lay influence in the appointment of bishops and the Pope. In
     addition, the sale of offices was to be stopped as well as the practice of lay investiture of bishops.
     The Pope also asserted that he was superior to all lay rulers and could depose those who failed to
     follow the teachings of the Church. This led to conflict when he declared Henry IV
     excommunicated and urged his subjects to rebel against him.

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   Assess the reasons for the rise of the Fatimid Empire.

     The reasons for the rise of the Fatimids may be seen as having both long- and short-term causes.
     These may include, but not be limited to: the changing nature of the Islamic Empire made it
     increasingly difficult for the caliphs in Baghdad to exercise control; the empire was too large to be
     administered effectively and the Spanish territory had already broken away. The changing social
     structure brought on by increased urbanization, growing wealth and the presence of a variety of
     cultures provoked dissent and unrest. New intellectual developments and widespread education led
     to the rise of different views, sectarian movements and dissent from the previous orthodoxy. These
     were seen in movements such as the Carmathians, the Ismailis and other religious mystics and
     commentators. This environment encouraged the rise of dissident elements who wished to
     challenge the rule of the caliphate.

     The immediate reasons for the rise of the Fatimids may include, but not be limited to: they
     established an effective missionary movement that succeeded in attracting great support,
     particularly in North Africa amongst the Berber tribes. The Fatimids attracted supporters because
     they offered both a new political and intellectual outlook. They wanted to renew Islam and claimed
     to be the rightful rulers of the empire. They offered a new leadership with a new message to those
     disaffected by life in the Abbasid Empire.

     On a practical level they were powerful militarily due to their Berber converts, possessed a strong
     navy and attracted great support from commercial interests due to their promotion of trade and
     commerce in the Mediterranean and other areas of the Islamic world. They also attracted support
     due to their tolerant policy towards minorities and non-Muslims, and they did not force their Sunni
     subjects to convert to the Ismaili doctrine. These factors allowed them to conquer all of North
     Africa including Egypt, and to expand their power in the Middle East, even to Baghdad.


4.   Why were Fatimid claims to the caliphate unsuccessful?

     The failure of the Fatimids to make a successful claim to the caliphate may include, but not be
     limited to: the decline of Fatimid power after 1094 meant that they were not able to maintain or
     expand their territory and conquer Baghdad after 1094. Internal disputes and civil war reduced their
     influence, as did their defeat by the Crusaders and the opposition of the Seljuk Turks who supported
     the Sunni majority and were becoming more powerful. In addition, they failed to win over the
     Twelver Shi’ites to the Ismaili cause – this caused a further division in the Islamic world and
     weakened their ability to seize and hold the caliphate.

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   By what means, and with what results, did Louis VII (1137–80) attempt to expand royal
     power in France?

     Candidates should address both parts of the question.

     The methods used by Louis VII to expand royal power may include, but not be limited to: the fact
     that he continued his father’s programmes, which had been designed to increase royal authority.
     These included expanding the authority of the royal courts over the majority of his vassals,
     punishing lawbreakers, and maintaining a strong alliance with the Church. He favoured the middle
     class over the nobility in royal administration, and gained economic and political support from the
     towns and the merchant class. He maintained Suger as head of the Curia and increased its
     efficiency and authority. He continued to work towards expanding his prestige, the loyalty of his
     subjects and the enforcement of feudal obligations. His own character, which was seen as pious,
     upright and benevolent, gained him great respect and support from the population. He sought to
     increase his authority by weakening opponents, notably Henry II of England, by encouraging
     disputes between Henry and his sons in an attempt to weaken Angevin power in France.

     The results of Louis’ efforts may include, but not be limited to: he maintained and expanded royal
     power in France and laid a firm foundation for the increased strength of the monarchy under his son
     Philip. His establishment of an efficient bureaucracy, system of courts and increased revenues were
     the backbone for further increases in power. He was less successful in dealing with rivals such as
     Henry II, to whom he lost territory and power in some areas such as Aquitaine and Normandy.
     He was not able to control the behaviour of his most powerful vassals such as Geoffrey of Anjou.
     He did, however, expose the weakness in the Angevin family, which would later be exploited by
     his son.

     If only means or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

6.   “William I (King of England 1066–87) was an extremely successful ruler.” To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     This will be a popular question.

     Candidates who agree can explain William’s success as a ruler by a number of factors. These
     would include his experience as an effective ruler in Normandy prior to the invasion of England; his
     military power which defeated and eliminated rivals to the throne; his military control of the
     country through the erection of castles to control the country and his ruthless suppression of revolt.
     His political skills were also crucial. His coronation at Winchester was an important symbol of his
     power, as was his gaining of support from the Pope for his claims to be ruler.
     The institution of Norman feudalism gave him control of all the land and the nobles over whom he
     exercised strong control. His control of the Church was also crucial as it gave him valuable support,
     wealth and prestige.

     His unification of the Anglo-Saxon and Norman legal system and his retention of many
     Anglo-Saxon administrative methods such as the sheriffs helped to unify the population as well as
     reduce opposition and help him establish strong administrative control. This was illustrated by the
     Domesday Book which gave the royal government important information through which to collect
     taxes, control the barons and expand its administrative power.

     William was successful in unifying the country, establishing a strong bureaucracy and legal system
     and avoiding internal disputes. He could pass on to his successors a well-functioning government.
     The strength of the administration and legal systems that he passed on to his successors is a mark of
     his own skill as a ruler.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   “Religious devotion was the most important reason for the success of the First Crusade
     (1095–9).” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This will be a popular question. Candidates may show that other reasons were more important, but
     they must address the importance of religion in their response. All answers must be in an analytic
     format supported by relevant content.

     The evidence of religious devotion as the reason for success may include, but not be limited to: the
     numbers of individuals who joined the Crusade; their enthusiasm for the goal of recovering
     Jerusalem; their willingness to endure great hardship in pursuit of their goal; the promise of
     salvation for those who undertook the Crusade inspired them; miraculous occurrences such as the
     discovery of the Holy Lance of Antioch boosted morale and determination.

     The non-religious reasons for success may include, but not be limited to: their military skills gave
     them an advantage; the Muslim opposition was disunited and weak; they had considerable
     assistance from the Byzantine Empire and the Italian maritime cities; they were motivated by the
     promise of land and wealth, which encouraged many to go on Crusade and endure tough conditions.


8.   Analyse the reasons for the decline of the crusading movement by 1291.

     There are a number of reasons for the decline of the crusading movement from the time of the First
     Crusade until the fall of Acre in 1291. They involve both an increase in the strength of the Muslim
     powers in the Middle East and a decline in the strength of the crusading movement.

     The increase in Islamic strength may include, but not be limited to: the increasing unity of the
     Muslims in opposition to the Crusaders beginning with Nur al-Din, Salah al-Din, the Mamluks and
     Baybars. They gradually eliminated the Frankish states and raised Muslim power and morale.

     The decline in the crusading movement may include, but not be limited to: internal political
     divisions in Outremer, which weakened their resistance to the Muslim forces; lack of support from
     Europe as the nations failed to unite to support the Crusades; antagonism between powerful
     monarchs such as Phillip II and Richard I; diversion of resources into European Crusades such as
     the Reconquista; declining religious fervour and weaknesses in the Church; and the decline of the
     Byzantine Empire which had provided support.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.    Assess how the Mongol invasions had both negative and positive impacts on the Islamic world.

      The negative impact of the Mongols on the Islamic world may include, but not be limited to:
      widespread physical destruction of cities and populations, they captured Baghdad and overthrew the
      caliphate, and destroyed Iraq as the religious, political and economic heart of the Islamic world.
      They allowed an expansion of Christian power into the Middle East through their alliance with the
      Christians against Islamic states, many Muslim scholars, schools and libraries were destroyed by
      the invaders, which was a setback to the intellectual and cultural life of Islam.

      The positive impact of the Mongols on the Islamic world came in the period after the initial
      conquest. The Mongols converted to Islam and became strong supporters of science and Islamic
      culture. They spread Islam to India and Asia and created unity in much of the Islamic world. They
      created a more stable political world and promoted trade, the growth of towns and provided an
      effective system of communication throughout their territories.

      If only one part of the question is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


10.   Analyse the reasons for the success of Genghis Khan as a conqueror.

      The reasons for the success of Genghis Khan may include, but not be limited to: the power of his
      army based on skill, tactics, weapons, organization and mobility; his skill in psychological and
      propaganda warfare which intimidated and frightened opponents into surrender; the weakness of his
      opponents who were often divided by religious and cultural tensions, and who failed to resist.
      Rulers were not supported by their subjects, who saw the Mongols as preferable. The Islamic world
      was divided into many factions and the caliph had no ability to organize resistance. Genghis Khan
      rewarded merchants, scholars and craftsmen and offered them protection and employment without
      persecution. The Mongol Empire was peaceful and orderly, which appealed to many and attracted
      support.

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   Why were the Berber dynasties, Almoravids (1061–1147) and Almohads (1147–1269), unable
      to maintain Muslim power in Spain?

      The reasons that these two Berber dynasties were unable to maintain power are found in both
      internal and external causes. Candidates may choose to discuss the reasons for the collapse of each
      dynasty separately or in combination by noting certain common factors. Whichever approach is
      chosen, a proper analytical method must be used.

      The reasons for the failure of the Almoravids and Almohads may include, but not be limited to:
      their rule in Spain was quite harsh and puritanical in comparison to the more accommodating
      regimes that they replaced. This caused many Christians and Jews who were serving in al-Andalus
      to leave and join the opposing Christian states. Many Muslims were alienated by the rigid
      fundamentalism of these dynasties and also saw them as crude and unsophisticated. This reduced
      their support amongst Muslims. They undermined each other’s strength – the Almohads overthrew
      the Almoravids to take power in 1163, in turn the Almoravids returned in the thirteenth century to
      attack and weaken the Almohad hold on Spain. Both were faced with growing Christian strength
      and fought numerous battles against the Spanish kingdoms. The defeat at Las Navas de Tolosa in
      1212 marked the beginning of their decline in the face of growing Christian power. The Almohads
      collapsed as a result of internal political dispute over the succession.


12.   Explain the significance of one of the following in the history of Spain: ‘Abd al-Rahman I
      (756–788); ‘Abd al-Rahman III (912–961); Ferdinand and Isabella (1452–1516).

      ‘Abd al-Rahman I (756–788)
      ‘Abd al-Rahman I was an Umayyad prince who escaped execution by the new Abbasid dynasty.
      He fled to al-Andalus where he became the ruler for 32 years. He eliminated all Muslim opponents
      and unified all the Muslim territory in Spain. He developed the character of Muslim Spain. He
      showed tolerance to Christians and Jews and took advantage of their talents to administer and
      enrich the kingdom. He set the tone for the next three centuries of a unique society where all three
      groups lived together and produced a society of physical and cultural wealth.

      ‘Abd al Rahman III (912–961)
      ‘Abd al Rahman III spent much of his rule suppressing revolts amongst the other Muslim states in
      Spain and defending Muslim territories against the incursions of the Christians. In this he was
      largely successful and was able to maintain and unify Muslim territory. He also defended
      al-Andalus against the Fatimids and built a navy to protect trade with North Africa. He proclaimed
      himself caliph as a direct challenge to the Abbasids and the Fatimids, and as a symbol of the power
      and influence of al-Andalus. His palace north of Cordoba was of extraordinary magnificence and
      was symbolic of his wealth, his position as caliph and the strength of al-Andalus. He maintained
      the excellent relations amongst Christians and Jews especially in the areas of culture and
      scholarship. The capital at Cordoba was the leading intellectual centre in Europe, and its library
      the largest.

Ferdinand and Isabella (1452–1516)
Ferdinand and Isabella created a powerful unified Christian Spanish state. They completed the
Reconquista to end Muslim power in Spain, conquering Granada in 1492. Muslims were forced to
convert or be expelled. The Jews also were expelled in 1492 or forced to convert. The Inquisition
was created to ensure that these new converts did not revert to their former faiths. This ended the
Spanish tradition of tolerance and convivencia that had existed for several centuries and had
enriched Spanish intellectual, cultural and economic life. The expulsion of Jews and Muslims
weakened Spain as many talented individuals were forced to leave – it strengthened the Islamic
world, notably the Ottomans who welcomed the refugees, both Muslim and Jewish, and used their
talents to the advantage of the empire. The power of the Spanish nobility was broken and a strong
central government put in place. Spain became a despotic state under the monarchy – the Cortes
was forgotten and strict supervision of all institutions was carried out by royal officials and the
Inquisition. Ferdinand and Isabella supported the voyages of Columbus, which led to the founding
of the Spanish Empire in America and a great increase in wealth and power.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   Why were Frederick I (1155–90) and Frederick II (1220–50) unsuccessful in their attempts to
      establish their authority over the Holy Roman Empire?

      The reasons for the inability of Frederick I and Frederick II to establish their authority over the
      Holy Roman Empire may include, but not be limited to: their strength in Germany was limited by
      powerful vassals, lack of a strong administrative organization to enforce royal authority and the lack
      of an effective judicial system. Feudalism in Germany limited the sovereign’s power in many areas
      and forced him to fight wars to maintain his territory and defeat rival claimants. He was forced to
      limit his ambitions in Germany in order to gain support for other policies: Italy and the Crusades.

      The ambition of both rulers to control Italy meant that they were absent from Germany for long
      periods of time which further weakened their ability to control it. The large amounts of money and
      manpower that were devoted to their Italian campaigns further weakened their power. Their
      authority was challenged by the Papacy, which felt threatened by their efforts to control Italy and
      the Church. This led to numerous wars, diplomatic opposition, excommunication and the Church’s
      attempts to undermine their authority and support rival claimants. Their prestige and power were
      weakened by their failures to control the Italian towns, which refused to submit to their authority
      and used their wealth to oppose the Emperor and cause them further loss of power and prestige.
      The size of the Empire was too large to be administered effectively. If they had focused on one area
      exclusively, they might have been able to exert more effective control.

      If only Frederick I or Frederick II is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   For what reasons, and with what results, was royal power challenged during the reign of
      either John (1199–1216) or Henry III (1216–72)?

      Candidates must address both parts of the question for whichever ruler they choose.

      John (1199–1216)
      The reasons for challenges to the royal authority during his reign may include, but not be limited to:
      his weakness as a military leader and the loss of land in France made him unpopular and lost him
      the respect of the nobility. His murder of Arthur of Brittany added to his unpopularity as did the
      new and higher taxes that were imposed by his administration. His quarrels with the pope and the
      placing of England under an interdict were other causes of opposition and questioning of his
      leadership. His defeat at Bouvines by the French further damaged his reputation and made him
      appear weak. Many nobles lost valuable lands and wealth as a result of these defeats and this
      caused further unrest.

      The results of the challenges may include, but not be limited to: the king was forced to accept
      Magna Carta which limited his authority as he had to accept that he was bound by customs, and had
      to follow legal precedents in his dealings with his subjects. He could not act in an arbitrary fashion.
      In addition, any further taxes would have to be approved by the Council of 25, who were set in
      place to supervise the king’s policies. This established precedent for kings having to consult before
      imposing new taxation. This was a major landmark in establishing the limits of royal authority, and
      set a precedent for all future kings. In addition, it showed that the nobility had regained some of the
      power that it had lost under previous monarchs.

      Henry III (1216–72)
      The reasons for challenges to Henry III may include, but not be limited to: Magna Carta was
      reaffirmed in 1225 and thus reminded the people that the king was not an absolute ruler and could
      be called to account. Henry had a number of unpopular policies which caused opposition. His
      favourites and closest advisers were from France which caused resentment, particularly as they
      were considered extravagant and corrupt. The king had extravagant spending habits, which
      required the imposition of higher taxes. His foreign policy was disastrous – he was defeated and
      lost land in France, and he engaged in a futile and expensive campaign in Sicily. His alliance with
      the Papacy led to higher papal taxes and his attempts to increase the power of his central
      administration caused resentment amongst the nobles. His power was challenged in 1258 when he
      asked for a further grant of taxes. This was refused unless he banished his foreign favourites and
      submitted to a commission of reform.

      The results of this challenge were the Provisions of Oxford, which set out to limit the king’s power
      through a supervisory Council of 15 and an expansion and revision of parliament by including the
      lower nobility and middle classes. The result was civil war. At the conclusion, the statute of
      Marlborough was accepted which incorporated most of the principles of the Provisions of Oxford.
      Parliament had a more important role and it was now accepted by the king that all new taxation
      would have to be discussed and agreed to by parliament. This was a major foundation for the later
      establishment of democracy.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   Assess the principal results of the Wars of the Roses.

      Candidates must provide a response in proper analytical form supported by relevant content.

      The principal results of the Wars of the Roses may include, but not be limited to: the wars reduced
      the wealth, power and prestige of the nobility; the wealth and influence of towns and the middle
      classes increased; society supported a strong central government to eliminate strife and restore order;
      Henry Tudor became King of England and passed laws to weaken the nobles by eliminating their
      private armies, and he employed the middle classes as royal officials to enforce an efficient
      administration and strong central government. England moved from a feudal state to a modern
      central government under the king. Physical damage during the war was quite limited and
      casualties were not extensive.


16.   “The deposition of Richard II (1377–99) was the result of his own actions.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Richard’s actions or policies that led to his removal as king may include, but not be limited to: his
      constant financial mismanagement leading to government debts and higher taxes; his attempts to
      increase royal authority and become an absolute monarch; his attempts to reduce the power of
      parliament; his arbitrary executions and other illegal punishment of opponents; his unwillingness to
      accept the advice of his council and his reliance on his favourites at court caused opposition in both
      the nobility and the Church. His failure to win the support of the public and his alienation of
      landholders in both the nobility and middle class raised further opposition.
      Richard may also have been the victim of changing circumstances: the deposition of Edward II had
      given the nobility a sense of power that they were anxious to exert; the existence of large private
      armies meant that the king was always faced with the possibility of armed rebellion; there were
      many sources of unrest and dissension in the country: the aftermath of the Black Death and the
      Peasants’ Revolt; religious dissension brought on by the spread of the Lollards; the effects of the
      war with France that was increasingly unsuccessful and unpopular; changing social structures as the
      commercial classes sought to increase their influence. These factors made England very difficult to
      rule as is evident in the events of the next hundred years.

Fourteenth century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   Analyse the changes to society as a result of the Black Death.

      The changes caused by the Black Death are evident in all areas of society including religion, the
      feudal and manorial systems and social structure, demographics, economic development,
      psychological impacts and political unrest and changes.
      Candidates should select a number of the areas above and develop a clear analytical response
      supported by relevant content.


18.   For what reasons, and with what results, did famines occur in Northern Europe in the early
      fourteenth century?

      Responses must be in proper analytic form and supported by relevant content.

      The reasons for the famines in the early fourteenth century may include, but not be limited to: a
      series of unusually wet and cold summers and severe winters between 1315 and 1322 reduced crop
      outputs between 25 and 50 %; livestock was reduced by similar or greater amounts due to disease;
      population had increased to the point where it was not possible to accumulate a surplus of food; any
      reduction in output led to starvation; agricultural yields were not increasing while population was;
      peasants had no food reserves; destruction caused by wars further reduced output; governments
      were unable to provide food supplies due to lack of transportation, high costs and inefficient
      administration.

      The results of the famine may include, but not be limited to: a drop in population of up to 10 %;
      land and villages were abandoned; population migrated to cities; lords increased dues and taxes to
      maintain income; anger at the conditions, higher taxes and dues led to numerous revolts and
      outbreaks of violence during this period (Pastoreaux revolts) in Flanders and France; angry peasants
      persecuted lepers and Jews in the belief that they were responsible for the problems. Living
      standards declined for peasants who were worse off than in the thirteenth century.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453.

      The reasons for the fall of Constantinople are a combination of the decline of the Byzantine Empire
      and the overwhelming strength of the Ottomans. The Byzantine Empire had lost all of its territory
      except the city of Constantinople by the mid-fifteenth century. It was surrounded on all sides by
      Ottoman territory. The garrison was weak and no reinforcements arrived from the west. The west
      was unable to organize significant support and a dispute with the Roman Church also limited the
      chance for support to be sent. The Ottomans were not only overwhelming in numbers but they had
      acquired the latest artillery and had developed a sound strategy to reduce the city. They were
      determined to succeed and were prepared to use all of their resources to do so.

      The results of the Ottoman conquest were very significant. The Ottoman advance into the Balkans
      opened all of central Europe and the Adriatic to invasion. Significant amounts of territory were lost
      as the Ottomans reached the gates of Vienna. Fear of an Islamic conquest of Europe was a reality
      for a period of time. European countries were forced to enter into diplomatic relations with the
      Ottomans and in some cases became their allies in struggles against other Europeans. Cities such as
      Venice established trade relations with the Ottomans in an effort to maintain their prosperity.
      Ottoman government and culture became a study in Europe as it was noted that many Christians
      preferred to live in the Ottoman Empire as it was more effectively governed.

      European exploration received some impetus from the fall of Constantinople as all the spice trade
      was now controlled by the Ottomans. Europeans sought to outflank their monopoly and eventually
      attack their territories. The Mediterranean became a naval battleground between Europe and the
      Ottomans for several centuries. Ottoman styles of dress, architecture and cuisine were adopted in
      varying degrees in Europe.

20.   Examine the changes the Ottomans brought to the Islamic world.

      The Ottomans did not always institute great changes in the Islamic world but continued many of the
      traditions of previous rulers. These included maintaining and guarding the holy places such as
      Mecca and maintaining the pilgrimage routes to Mecca. They also maintained the sharia through
      the Hanafi school of law. Ottoman government also made minimal changes to the Islamic world as
      it allowed for considerable local influence in the provinces. As long as tax revenues were submitted
      and general instructions followed, the Ottomans did not seek to make significant changes to the
      local leadership in the conquered areas. The intellectual traditions of Islam were continued and
      expanded in science and law as well as literature and philosophy. Arabic was maintained as a major
      language of scholarship although Persian was also used.

      The changes that occurred in the Islamic world after the Ottoman conquests may include, but not be
      limited to: the Islamic world was unified from North Africa to the Red Sea and Arabia, and
      extended into Europe through the Balkan Peninsula and Greece. The other parts of the Islamic
      world were under the control of the Safavids in Persia and the Mughals in India. These three
      groups were in conflict with each other for territory and influence. The Ottomans supported the
      Sunni version of Islam which placed them in competition with the Safavids in Persia who supported
      Shiism. The Sufi orders expanded under the Ottomans but were also subjected to some controls.
      The Ottomans also developed their own law codes to deal with all forms of administrative matters
      such as tax-collection and criminal offences, and they also sought to standardize rules and
      regulations in the conquered provinces with the Ottoman practices. The fiscal policy of the
      Ottoman Empire and its growing trade and interaction with Europe led to an increased importance
      and status for Christians and Jews. They became important and wealthy bankers and merchants in
      many of the Ottoman cities. Ottoman architecture was adopted throughout the empire.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500

21.   “The growth of trade and commerce was the most important reason for the Renaissance of
      the fifteenth century.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This may be a popular question. Candidates have the opportunity to support the statement or
      challenge it. All responses must be analytical and supported by relevant content.

      The responses in support of the quotation may include, but not be limited to the facts that trade and
      commerce, particularly those of the Italian cities such as Venice, Pisa, Genoa etc played a crucial
      role in the origins of the Renaissance. Their wealth supported scholars, universities and the study
      of key subjects such as medicine and law. These provided a range of new ideas to challenge the
      past and promote change, inquiry, and human understanding of the physical world. Their wealth
      also supported the arts and encouraged the development of new styles and the revival of classical
      ideas and forms, which challenged medieval traditions and celebrated the concepts of humanism.
      Their interaction with the Muslim world and Constantinople had introduced many new ideas, new
      knowledge and techniques that challenged old ideas and promoted change. New and powerful
      groups such as merchants, bankers and guilds had emerged to challenge traditional ideas and
      support ideas of progress and change. Their interest in a more secular world and confidence in their
      abilities supported a more humanistic and worldly philosophy, which challenged religion and other
      traditional views. The freedom of Italian cities and towns from the feudal system of government
      made them progressive and dynamic environments that were not restricted by medieval traditions
      and institutions.

      Challenges to the quotation may include, but not be limited to: the fifteenth century Renaissance
      was a continuation of the twelfth century Renaissance which had occurred throughout Western
      Europe as the result of the influx of classical knowledge and the growth of education as seen in the
      universities. New ideas had come to many parts of Europe as a result of the Crusades, and new
      ideas in science had occurred in many countries: France, England, etc. The medieval world was
      experiencing changes on many fronts as a result of climate changes, plague, wars, new industrial
      and commercial developments, urbanization, religious conflicts and dissent. The Renaissance was
      in some ways a culmination of many trends that were working to change the medieval world,
      culture and outlook.

      Some combination of the above which acknowledges that while one view may be dominant, the
      other had some role to play is acceptable.

22.   Analyse the importance of rivalries between Italian cities for the development of the
      Renaissance.

      The importance of inter-city rivalry in Italian history is difficult to overemphasize. The
      Renaissance is no exception.
      Italian states competed for wealth, power and prestige. To this end they poured significant
      resources into the patronage of the arts in all forms. This helped create the enormous cultural
      flowering of the Renaissance. They also competed to dominate intellectually through the support of
      universities and scholars – this competition rewarded scholars and encouraged many others to take
      up all forms of academic pursuits which promoted science, law, literature, political studies and
      mathematics. The wealth that they acquired through their efforts to surpass each other made the
      Renaissance and its institutions possible. The rivalry between families who were associated with
      each city further heightened the competition and the quest to reach new heights. The Renaissance
      was centred in the great cities such as Florence, Milan, Pisa, Venice, Genoa, Rome and Siena.
      Without their efforts to outdo each other, the resources and energy to create the Renaissance period
      would have been lacking.

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   Assess the significance of two of the following in the process of exploration and/or travel:
      Ibn Battuta (fl1350); Henry the Navigator; Columbus; Ferdinand Magellan (d1521); Piri Reis
      (d1554).

      Ibn Battuta
      Ibn Battuta was a Moroccan who travelled throughout the Islamic world in the fourteenth century.
      His travels appear to have taken him from Morocco to China throughout the Islamic world. The
      distance exceeded 100 000 km in the course of 29 years.
      He wrote an account of his exploits called The Journey. It was written from memory so some of the
      details may not be entirely accurate, and some commentators dispute his ability to have visited all
      the places described. Nevertheless, it served as a very useful description of most of the parts of the
      Islamic world in the fourteenth century. It was part of an important tradition of long-distance travel
      in the Islamic world that had existed for centuries, and emphasized its unity and strong
      communications networks and interest and curiosity in gaining knowledge about the different parts
      of the world.

      Henry the Navigator
      Henry was a Portuguese prince who sought to expand Portuguese territory into Africa and Asia for
      commercial and religious reasons. He participated in military expeditions to Ceuta to establish
      Portuguese trading posts in North Africa to challenge the Islamic monopoly on African trade. He
      funded and encouraged voyages of discovery along the African coast, during which the Azores and
      Madeira were discovered and settled. He supported the study of cartography to aid the voyages of
      discovery, and was intent on the circumnavigation of Africa. He died before this was achieved but
      the Portuguese continued the process of exploration and were rewarded when Vasco da Gama
      rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1498.

      Columbus
      Columbus was a Genoese ship captain who sought support from the Spanish crown for a voyage of
      exploration to the East Indies. He was part of the movement along with the Portuguese to reach the
      spice islands of the east and thus gain riches for themselves and their sponsors. Columbus proposed
      to sail west across the Atlantic instead of around Africa as he believed that China and the Spice
      Islands could be reached more quickly that way. He made four voyages of exploration and in the
      course of these he discovered the Americas, established permanent settlements in the region and
      began the process that led to extensive Spanish and European colonization of North and South
      America.

      Ferdinand Magellan
      Magellan was a Portuguese explorer in the employ of the King of Spain. He was the first to
      circumnavigate the globe and to discover a passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This was
      significant to the Spanish who could not get to Asia by the Eastern route as a result of the Treaty of
      Tordesillas. Magellan opened the Pacific and many of its islands to Spanish colonization. The
      results of his voyage led to the establishment of the International Date Line.

      Piri Reis
      Piri Reis was an Ottoman admiral who made significant contributions to navigation and cartography.
      His Book of Navigation (Kitab i Bahriye) was a highly detailed compendium with specific
      instructions on navigation, including charts and descriptions of Mediterranean ports. He also
      included sections on the use of navigational instruments and charts. He is also famous for two
      world maps, which he prepared. The second showed areas of North and South America. He did not
      explore these areas but compiled the map from a great variety of sources and accounts. As a naval
      officer he defeated the Portuguese in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf and reclaimed territory for the
      Ottoman Empire.

24.   Discuss the importance of religion for the development of Western exploration and expansion.

      Candidates will have to assess the importance of religion versus other factors as motives for
      Western exploration and expansion.

      The religious motives may include, but not be limited to: a search for allies or converts in Africa
      and Asia to help oppose the power of Islam after the fall of Constantinople. The missionary nature
      of Christianity, which constantly seeks to expand the number of Christians, efforts by the Catholic
      Church to expand its numbers in order to oppose the strength of the Protestant churches. The desire
      to establish outposts in India and the Far East.

      The non-religious motives may include, but not be limited to: desire to gain access to spices and
      silks from the East, establish strategic outposts and colonies to promote and defend trade, gain
      financial and territorial advantages over other countries, satisfy individual ambitions of monarchs,
      explorers and merchants. In addition, new ship-building and navigational technology made long
      voyages more possible.
