Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate range
of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure
to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
  the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
  when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
  should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
  necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
  they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
  piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
  that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

• Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
  if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should award
  the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
  acceptable.

• Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
  the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
  a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
  the work being assessed.

• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
  attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
  low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
  other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will produce
  any particular distribution of marks.

• The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

                                  Theme: Education and training

Criterion A — The issue and stakeholder(s)                                                     [4 marks]

1.   (a)   Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system.

           Social/ethical concerns may include the following:
           • privacy/security: access by university admissions officers to personal
             information on the applicant’s social networking websites, especially
             information that is not meant to be linked or used for university applications.
             Information on Facebook does not have the purpose for use in academic
             applications but sharing with friends and family, hence inappropriate use by
             university
           • security: applicants may not have used appropriate settings or unknowingly
             revealed information by allowing access to their social networking website
             account
           • digital citizenship: detrimental information about the applicant may be posted
             by “friends” on social networking websites
           • misuse of information: applicants are unaware that university admissions
             officers use the information from the applicant’s social networking websites to
             determine if they will be accepted in university
           • policies and standards: lack of university policies regarding the access/use of
             applicants’ social networking websites in the application process.

(b)   Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system.

      Primary stakeholders may include the following:
      • student who is applying to university and has posted information on social
         networking websites and/or whose acquaintances may have posted information
         about them
      • university admissions officers who access information posted by the student on
         social networking websites
      • university admissions officers who use questionable practices to obtain
         information from a student’s personal social networking websites.

2.   (a)   Describe, step-by-step, how the IT system works.
           IT system: social networking websites are used by university admissions
           officers to access student information.


           Answers provided in the article include the following:
           • student has posted information (text, photos, videos or other media) on social
             networking websites such as Facebook
           • university admissions officers have access to the student’s public information
             on Facebook
           • university admissions officers may use methods to gain access to student’s
             personal social networking websites.

           Answers with additional information to that in the article may include the
           following:

           Admissions Officer
           • admissions officer creates an account on a social networking website, for
             example Facebook, and enters personal information
           • uses web-browser to do so
           • logon to gain access to pages on social website using username and password
           • search for candidate name on social website
           • uses link from search engine
           • uses posts from “friends” who tag a candidate
           • downloads material from website – images, comments, etc
           • access data if allowed too by the security settings set up by the student
           • the university admissions officer requests to be a “friend” of the applicant or
             use some other means for gaining access
           • the applicant accepts the invitation
           • the university admissions officer can also access the information posted by
             “friends”.

           Technical references may include the following: servers, databases, passwords,
           encryption, https, URL, HTTPS, database query, privacy settings, search
           engine/bar in Facebook, search engine.

Question 2(a) continued


           Student – similar to admissions officer steps but can include the following:
           • student creates an account on a social networking website, for example
              Facebook, and enters personal information
           • the applicant may not have set the security settings on the Facebook account,
              allowing anyone access to personal information such as postings, photos,
              memberships in groups
           • the applicant may have linked to “friends’” pages where there are undesirable
              messages or photos
           • “friends” of the applicant may have posted negative messages or photos about
              the applicant on their homepages
           • websites such as Facebook provide face recognition features to identify
              additional photos of the applicant.

           N.B. “Friends” are persons that the student approves to access their personal
           pages on a social networking site such as Facebook.
           Accept if the student talks about one social networking website (for example
           Facebook, Twitter, or other).
           Steps do not have to be in this order.

(b)   Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
      described in Criterion A.

      Answers may include the following:
      Privacy/Security would be a concern if:
      • the privacy settings have not been set and so allow access to the personal
         information on the social networking website
      • the university admissions officer takes advantage of the lack of security of the
         student’s information on social networking website(s) to gain access to it
      • the university stores information about the student from the student’s social
         networking website(s). Possibly that information can be accessed by other
         persons at the university.

      Digital citizenship would be a concern if:
      • detrimental content is posted by “friends” either in text or photos
      • the university considers information about the applicant that was posted by
        “friends” without attempting to verify the content.

      Misuse of information would be a concern if:
      • information from social networking website(s) becomes a part of the
        applicant’s record at the university.

      Policies and standards would be a concern if:
      • lack of university policies regarding the access to and use of an applicant’s
        social networking website(s) in the application process leads to unethical or
        fraudulent practices. (how – link between Facebook and policy needed to
        use/manage the data on Facebook, why – weakness – not present or
        inadequate).

      Candidates are expected to make reference to relevant stakeholders, information
      technologies, data and processes. Candidates will be expected to refer to “how
      the IT system works” using appropriate IT terminology.


                                                                                       continued …

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                          [8 marks]

3.   Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders.



     Positive impact for the applicant may include the following:
     • the university admissions officer may be impressed with the work the applicant has
       posted online
     • the applicant can present work that may give him an advantage over other applicants
     • applicants can continuously update their achievements online
     • applicants can control what information they post about themselves online.

     Negative impact for the applicant may include the following:
     • applicants do not realize that information that they posted when they were younger
       can have long range consequences
     • information that has been erased from a social networking website may still exist in
       other places
     • some information posted about the applicant may not be valid
     • personal photos may be tagged and viewed by others
     • the applicant has no control over the information posted about him by “friends”
     • the applicant may not have any knowledge of the detrimental information that caused
       his rejection by the university.

     Positive impact for the university admissions officer may include the following:
     • they gain an insight from the information in Facebook and other social networking
       websites about the applicant that that they would not have gained otherwise
     • the postings may lead to excellent questions to ask in the interview with the applicant
     • the admissions officer can follow up on the information that they found on the social
       networking website.

     Negative impact for the university admissions officer may include the following:
     • the information may be misleading and not present a true picture of the applicant
     • the university may not support some practices used by the admissions officer to
       collect additional information about applicants
     • rejection on the basis of postings on social networking websites could lead to legal
       action against the university/university admissions officer from the applicant.

     Positive impact for Facebook/social networking site may include the following:
     • increased use of Facebook by Universities – more targeted advertising on SNS sites.

     Negative impact for Facebook/social networking site may include the following:
     • less activity by students who may switch to a different social media not popular with
       universities
     • loss of reputation if linked with privacy issues related to the universities use of
       personal data.

4.   Evaluate one solution that addresses at least one problem identified in Criterion C.

     Answers may include the following:
     Solutions to the privacy/security problem of how to prevent access to applicant’s
     information on social networking website(s):
     • keep social networking website(s) protected (ie update privacy settings, untag from
        friends’ photo albums); evaluation: only partially effective due to “friends’” postings
        and they may accept unknown friend requests
     • keep user names and other identifying information private in any correspondence
        with the university; effectiveness: limited because the university can find out these
        details by other means
     • setup a special account for application purposes, but first must hide the other account
        which may be difficult to do, and it could still be searched for and found – many
        people do this with email and social media accounts
     • do not accept invitations on social networking websites from unknown persons;
        effectiveness: stops access to private information
     • universities develop clear and transparent policies about the use of information on
        social networking websites relating to prospective students. Effectiveness: prevents
        applicant information becoming a part of official records, but does not stop informal
        browsing by university admissions officers. Policies may include statements about:
        - digital citizenship
        - authentication and verification
        - data storage
        - data protection and security
        - data integrity.

     Solutions to the problem of how to identify/remove undesirable information from an
     applicant’s social networking website(s):
     • the applicant “scrubs” their own digital footprint of any detrimental information (ie
        text, images, videos and files; evaluation: partially effective, total elimination is not
        possible
     • students are advised on how to create a positive digital footprint (ie update profile,
        post new information that creates a positive impression. Effectiveness: the more
        recent positive online activities will cause those to rise to the top of online searches
        and make earlier postings appear further down in the results.
