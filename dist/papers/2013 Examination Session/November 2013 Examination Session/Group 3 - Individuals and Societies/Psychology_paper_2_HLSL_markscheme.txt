Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss concepts of abnormality.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
     concepts of abnormality that includes a range of arguments and factors.

     Candidates may refer to the concept of normality in order to clarify their discussion of abnormality
     and this approach is appropriate.

     Responses may include, but are not limited to:
     • statistical deviance
     • dysfunctional behaviour
     • deviance from social norms
     • mental health criterion
     • medical model and classificatory systems
     • etic versus emic definitions of abnormality.

     Candidates could discuss concepts of abnormality by:
     • referring to the validity of explanations for abnormality
     • providing support from empirical studies
     • addressing usefulness of concepts
     • addressing cultural bias
     • addressing ethical considerations, for example, stigmatization.

     Candidates may discuss a smaller number of approaches to the understanding of concepts of
     abnormality in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of
     approaches to the understanding of concepts of abnormality in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                –5–              N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Discuss ethical considerations in diagnosis.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
     ethical considerations in diagnosis that includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses.

     Ethical considerations may include, but are not limited to:
     • consequences of an incorrect diagnosis on treatment and the health of the client
        (self-fulfilling prophecies)
     • effects of labelling
     • the possibility of stigmatization once a client is diagnosed
     • confidentiality of diagnosis
     • over-diagnosis of certain disorders (for example, in relation to gender and culture)
     • potential bias in diagnosis by the doctor.

     Candidates may refer to ethical considerations related to treatment, institutionalization,
     cultural/gender or other issues, and these should be credited if they are explicitly linked to
     diagnosis.

     A discussion of positive ethical considerations is also a legitimate approach to the question and
     should earn marks, for example an accurate diagnosis can result in quick and effective treatment.

     Candidates may discuss a smaller number of ethical considerations in diagnosis in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of ethical considerations in
     diagnosis in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                  –6–               N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Contrast two approaches to the treatment of one disorder.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the differences between
     two approaches to the treatment of one disorder.

     Candidates should refer to two different approaches to the treatment of one disorder.
     Candidates may address biomedical, individual, and/or group approaches to treatment, for example,
     a candidate may contrast one biomedical treatment with one individual treatment, or alternatively
     contrast two biomedical treatments. Consideration of an eclectic approach is an appropriate
     response to this question, but it can only be counted as one approach. If candidates discuss an
     eclectic approach, they still have to contrast this approach with another one, for example, individual
     or biomedical.

     Candidates may address approaches to treatment of a general disorder (for example, an eating
     disorder) or a more specific type of disorder (for example, anorexia/bulimia). Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

     Candidates may address two broad approaches to treatment of one disorder (for example, cognitive
     versus biological) or two specific treatments of one disorder (for example, CBT versus Prozac).
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses may include, but are not limited to:
     • the role of the therapist
     • the efficacy of the treatment
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • ethical considerations
     • cost in time and money
     • strengths and limitations of the approaches to treatment
     • etiological assumptions influencing the treatment.

     If a candidate contrasts approaches to the treatment of more than one disorder, credit should be
     given only to the first disorder.

     Since the command term “contrast” requires a focus on differences, responses (or parts of the
     response) focusing only on similarities should not earn marks.
                                                 –7–              N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Developmental psychology

4.   Discuss how social and/or environmental variables may affect cognitive development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
     social and/or environmental factors that may affect cognitive development.

     The variables discussed do not have to be specifically identified as social or environmental as the
     two are arguably very much related.

     Candidates may discuss social and/or environmental variables in relation to specific aspects of
     cognitive development, for example, memory/attention, or discuss cognitive development in
     general. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may discuss positive influences of social and/or environmental variables (for example,
     Head Start programmes or parental training) as well as negative influences (for example,
     deprivation or trauma) on cognitive development. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses may include, but are not limited to:
     • interactions with parents, siblings, peers, teachers and other significant figures
       (Farah et al., 2008)
     • cultures differ in the kinds of cognitive skills that are valued and consequently encouraged and
       developed
     • children living in poverty are more likely to suffer from learning disabilities and developmental
       delays (for example, Rutter’s studies; Krugman, 2008)
     • malnutrition can influence cognitive development. Bhoomika et al. (2008) found that
       malnourished children scored lower in tests of attention, working memory and
       visio-spatial tasks. Research has also shown that early nutritional supplements in the form of
       protein and increased calories can have positive long-term consequences for cognitive
       development.

     Animal research may be used as long as a clear link is made to human cognitive development.

     Candidates may discuss a smaller number of factors in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
     may discuss a larger number of factors in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate discusses how social and/or environmental variables may affect biological, social or
     emotional development (for example, attachment), this part of the response should not earn marks
     unless the candidate directly links the discussion back to cognitive development, for example, the
     social/environmental variable of poverty can lead to malnutrition which can retard brain
     development and therefore negatively affect cognitive development.
                                                  –8–               N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Evaluate one theory or one study related to adolescence.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of one theory or one study related to adolescence. Although a discussion
     of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high
     marks.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • traditional theories of “Storm and Stress”
     • Coleman’s focal theory (1974)
     • Baethge’s (1989) cultural theory
     • Elkind’s theory of adolescent egocentrism (1967)
     • Erikson’s theory of identity versus role confusion (1959).

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Marcia’s (1966) studies on the different types of identity status
     • Mead’s (1935) anthropological studies
     • Rutter et al.’s (1976) studies on the relationships between adolescents and their parents
     • Steinberg’s (2001) studies on parent–adolescent conflicts
     • Studies related to teenage brain development.

     Evaluation of the selected research may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological considerations
     • cultural and gender considerations
     • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
     • contrary findings or explanations
     • the productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
     • the applications of the empirical findings.

     If a candidate evaluates more than one theory or study, credit should be given only to the evaluation
     of the first theory or study. However, candidates may address other theories or studies and be
     awarded marks for this as long as these theories or studies are clearly used to evaluate the main
     theory or study addressed in the response.

     If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of
     [2 marks] for criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A,
     knowledge and comprehension.
                                                 –9–              N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   To what extent does deprivation and/or trauma in childhood affect later development?

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of the
     potential effects of deprivation or trauma in childhood on later development.

     Candidates may address both deprivation and trauma experiences or candidates may choose to
     discuss only deprivation or only trauma experiences. In either case, these experiences do not have
     to be specifically identified as deprivation or trauma situations.

     Candidates may address biological, cognitive and/or social aspects of later development.
     All approaches are equally acceptable.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • Cyrulnik’s (2005) theory of resilience
     • Bowlby’s (1951) maternal deprivation hypothesis
     • Spitz’s (1946) psychodynamic theory
     • Tedeschi and Calhoun’s (2004) theory on positive aspects of trauma experiences.

     It would also be appropriate to refer to studies related to short-term or long-term effects of
     deprivation and/or trauma, such as:
     • Robertson and Bowlby’s (1952) studies showing that maternal deprivation may cause physical,
        mental and emotional growth retardation
     • Rutter et al.’s (2001) studies demonstrating that the consequences of deprivation vary with the
        severity and duration of the depriving experience, the age of the child at which the deprivation
        occurs and the adequacy of substitute measures such as the quality of the caretaker
     • Cockett and Tripp’s (1994) study on long-term attachment deprivation effects.

     Candidates may refer to animal studies as part of their response, and credit should be awarded for
     this as long as they relate the findings to human development.

     Deprivation and/or trauma may have detrimental effects, may not have long-lasting effects or may
     even lead to growth (for example, resilience) in later development. In order to gain high marks,
     responses should include some consideration of non-detrimental effects.
                                                 – 10 –             N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Health psychology

7.   Evaluate two strategies for coping with stress.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations of two specific strategies for coping with stress. Although a discussion of
     both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Relevant strategies (including models and techniques) may include, but are not limited to:
     • Lazarus and Folkman’s (1975, 1988) model (known as the Transactional Model) which proposes
       that stress can be reduced by helping stressed people change their perceptions of stressors,
       providing them with strategies to help them improve their confidence in their ability to do so
     • the health realization / innate health model of stress proposes that helping stressed individuals
       understand the nature of thought, providing them with the ability to recognize when they are
       having stressful thoughts, disengaging from them, and focussing on positive thoughts, will
       reduce their stress
     • forms of CBT such as stress inoculation training (Meichenbaum, 1985)
     • social support groups/networks
     • mindfulness-based stress reduction strategies.

     Evaluation of the strategies may include, but is not limited to:
     • research supporting or refuting the effectiveness of these strategies
     • an evaluation of the strategies by presenting possible methodological, ethical or cultural
       considerations of the research referenced relating to the coping strategy
     • a comparison and/or contrast of the two strategies.

     Candidates may also address ineffective or unhealthy coping strategies, such as:
     • drug taking
     • alcohol abuse
     • smoking
     • over-eating
     • use of defence mechanisms.

     If a candidate evaluates only one strategy, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of
     [5 marks] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4 marks] for
     criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C, organization.

     If a candidate evaluates more than two strategies, credit should be given only to the first two
     evaluations. However, candidates may address other strategies and be awarded marks for this as
     long as these strategies are clearly used to evaluate the main strategies addressed in the response.

     If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
     criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
     comprehension.

8.   To what extent do sociocultural factors influence health-related behaviour?

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of the
     argument that sociocultural factors influence health-related behaviour.

     Stress, eating disorders, substance abuse and other health-related behaviours are equally acceptable
     for answers to this question. Candidates may approach health-related behaviour as a whole or use
     specific examples of health-related behaviour. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Sociocultural factors may include, but are not limited to:
     • socio-economic status
     • education
     • cultural history
     • sociocultural norms, for example, sedentary lifestyle and attitudes to exercize/diet (Lakdawalla
       and Philipson, 2002)
     • influence of media (Huhman et al., 2005)

     Each factor that is identified should be related to health-related behaviour. Where this connection is
     not made then no marks should be rewarded for the mere listing or description of sociocultural
     factors.

     It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address biological and/or cognitive factors in order to
     address the command term “to what extent”.

     Candidates may address a smaller number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may address a larger number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate breadth
     of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                 – 12 –              N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.   Discuss two models and/or theories related to health promotion.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors and hypotheses related to models and/or theories of health
     promotion.

     A candidate may discuss two theories, or two models, or one theory and one model. All of these
     approaches are equally acceptable.

     Relevant theories/models may include, but are not limited to:
     • the health belief model (HBM)
     • stages of change model
     • theory of reasoned action
     • non-Western health promotion
     • cognitive dissonance theories
     • social learning theory
     • theory of unrealistic optimism
     • behaviourist approaches.

     Candidates may use studies and applications to discuss models and theories of health promotion.

     If a candidate discusses more than two models or theories, credit should be given only to the first
     two discussions. However, candidates may discuss other models or theories and be awarded marks
     for this as long as these models/theories are clearly used to evaluate the main models or theories
     addressed in the response.

     If a candidate discusses only one model or theory, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [5 marks] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of
     [4 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C,
     organization.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   To what extent do sociocultural factors influence human relationships?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of the
      degree to which sociocultural factors influence human relationships.

      Candidates may address one or all areas of the option: social responsibility, interpersonal
      relationships and violence.

      Factors which may be addressed include, but are not limited to:
      • gender and cultural norms (for example, the role that culture plays in the formation and
        maintenance of relationships, violence, or perception of attractiveness)
      • proximity
      • modelling
      • social identity.

      Candidates may refer to animal studies as part of their response, and credit should be awarded for
      this as long as they relate the findings to human relationships.

      It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address biological and/or cognitive factors in order to
      address the command term “to what extent”.

      Candidates may consider a smaller number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate depth of
      knowledge, or may consider a larger number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate
      breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                  – 14 –            N13/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


11.   Discuss the effects of short-term and/or long-term exposure to violence.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes different effects of short-term and/or long-term exposure to violence.

      It is not necessary for candidates to distinguish between short-term and long-term exposure to
      violence.

      Responses could focus on the effects of violence on individuals and/or groups.

      Examples of violence may include, but are not limited to:
      • bullying
      • domestic violence
      • terrorism
      • genocide.

      Effects of exposure to violence may include, but are not limited to:
      • physiological responses to stress (for example, fight or flight)
      • cortisol depletion leading to chronic fatigue
      • effects on mental health, for example, anxiety, low self-esteem, PTSD, depression, suicide
      • lower performance in school
      • the circle of violence, that is, the transmission of violent behaviour across generations through
         social learning (for example, Totten’s (2003) study of domestic violence)
      • attachment and the ability to form and maintain relationships
      • delinquency.

      Research may include, but is not limited to:
      • Shalev and Freedman’s (2005) study on PTSD following terrorist attacks
      • Shuster et al.’s (2001) study of stress responses to exposure to terrorism during 9/11
      • Wang et al.’s (2010) study of cyber-bullying and depression
      • Hyman’s (1990) study of long-term exposure and depression.

      Examples of discussion may include, but are not limited to:
      • resilience (as an alternative argument)
      • difficulty in obtaining empirical evidence
      • difficulty in defining terms, for example, what is considered bullying?
      • gender and cultural differences.

      Candidates may discuss a smaller number of effects in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or
      may discuss a larger number of effects in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge.
      Both approaches are equally acceptable.

12.   Evaluate two examples of research (theories and/or studies) investigating the role of
      communication in maintaining relationships.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations of two examples of research investigating the role of communication in
      maintaining relationships. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it
      does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      Examples of research may include, but are not limited to:
      • gender or cultural differences in communication patterns (for example, Tannen, 1990)
      • the role of attribution in relationships (for example, Bradbury and Fincham, 1992)
      • the value of disclosure (for example, social penetration theory)
      • the role of communication of emotions in maintaining relationships (for example, Gottman and
        Levenson, 1986)
      • studies on marital satisfaction (for example, Fincham, 2004).

      Evaluation of the research may include, but is not limited to:
      • methodological considerations
      • cultural and gender considerations
      • the accuracy and clarity of the concepts
      • contrary findings or explanations
      • the productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
      • the applications of the empirical findings.

      If a candidate evaluates more than two examples of research, credit should be given only to the first
      two examples of research. However, candidates may discuss other theories/studies and be awarded
      marks for this as long as these theories/studies are clearly used to evaluate the two main examples
      of research addressed in the response.
      If a candidate evaluates only one theory/study, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of
      [5 marks] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4 marks] for
      criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C, organization.

      If a candidate discusses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for
      criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A, knowledge and
      comprehension.

Sport psychology

13.   Discuss two or more theories of motivation in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
      theories of motivation in sport that includes a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses.

      General theories of motivation can be applied to individuals or groups involved in sport.

      Theories of motivation in sport include, but are not limited to:
      • cognitive evaluation theory (Deci, 1975)
      • achievement motivation needs theory (McClelland and Atkinson, 1961)
      • intrinsic motivation (Ashford et al., 1993)
      • extrinsic motivation (Smith et al., 1979)
      • self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977)
      • competence motivation theory (Harter, 1978).

      Candidates may discuss different theories of motivation by:
      • addressing strengths and weaknesses of the theories
      • distinguishing similarities and differences among the theories
      • considering the practical applications and efficacy of the various theories
      • addressing cultural and/or gender considerations
      • using studies to support or contradict the theory/theories.

      Candidates may discuss two theories in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a
      larger number of theories to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
      acceptable.

      If a candidate discusses only one theory of motivation, the response should be awarded up to a
      maximum of [5 marks] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of
      [4 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C,
      organization.

14.   Examine reasons for using drugs in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider an argument or concept in a way that
      uncovers the assumptions and interrelationships of why people involved in sport use drugs.

      Candidates do not have to distinguish between assumptions and interrelationships.

      Candidates may focus on individual/personality (biological, cognitive) factors and/or on situational
      (sociocultural) factors.

      Candidates may focus on a range of assumptions about drug use in either professional or amateur
      sport.

      Assumptions could include that drug use will:
      • enhance training
      • enhance “game time” performance
      • prolong a career
      • reduce pain
      • speed healing
      • enhance attractiveness.

      Interrelationships between drug use and other factors include:
      • short term benefit versus long term damage
      • loss of reputation if discovered
      • loss of income if discovered
      • modelling effects
      • peer pressure to use drugs.

      Research on drug use includes:
      • Whitehead et al. (1992)
      • Anshel (1998)
      • Newman and Newman (1991)
      • game theory research (for example, prisoner’s dilemma).

      Candidates may examine a smaller number of reasons in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge,
      or may examine a larger number of reasons to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches
      are equally acceptable.

15.   Discuss two models/theories of how to prevent burnout in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses about the prevention of burnout in sport.

      Candidates may refer to burnout and its causes, but the focus of the response must be on the
      prevention of burnout in sport. In addition, models/theories must be linked to behaviour in sport
      and not behaviour in general.

      Models/theories on the prevention of burnout include, but are not limited to:
      • Smith’s (1980) cognitive affective model
      • Meichenbaum’s (1985) stress inoculation theory (SIT)
      • Raedeke’s (2002) investment model of burnout (also known as entrapment theory)
      • Kjormo and Halvari’s (2002) study of role conflict and other factors on burnout.

      If a candidate discusses more than two models/theories, credit should be given only to the first two
      discussions.
      If a candidate discusses only one model/theory, the response should be awarded up to a maximum
      of [5 marks] for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [4 marks] for
      criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C, organization.
