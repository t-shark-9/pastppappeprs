Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in calculation,
   but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question parts,
   then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should put OFR on
   the script where you are rewarding this. To do this you will need to use the on-page comment
   annotation tool (   ).

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4 mark] questions that use A02 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should be given.

1.   (a)   Outline one reason why

           (i)    the price elasticity of demand figures are negative;                                 [2]

                  Level                                                                              Marks
                    0 The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.           0

                    1 There is a limited understanding.                                                1
                      As price increases, the quantity demanded decreases and vice versa

                    2 There is a clear understanding.                                                  2

                  As price increases, the quantity demanded decreases and vice versa; there is a
                  negative relationship between price and quantity demanded because if price
                  increases the willingness and ability to purchase the good decreases.

                  N.B. For [2 marks], the candidate should refer to the relationship between P
                  and Q and ONE of the following
                   State that there is an inverse / negative relationship, OR
                   Outline the reason for the negative relationship (ie Law of Demand) OR
                   Use refer to the formula to illustrate the relationship

                  Alternatively, fully reward an account that PED is the ratio of changes in price
                  and quantity demanded which move in opposite directions so one change will
                  be positive and the other one negative resulting in a negative figure.

           (ii)   the income elasticity of demand figures are positive.                                [2]

                  Level                                                                              Marks
                    0 The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.           0

                    1 There is a limited understanding.                                                1
                      As incomes rise, quantity demanded rises.

                    2 There is a clear understanding.                                                  2

                  As incomes rise, quantity demanded rises; as incomes rise households are more
                  willing and able to purchase goods; the goods in the table are normal goods.

Reference to either normal goods or “ability to purchase” is sufficient for the
2nd mark.

Alternatively, fully reward an account that YED is the ratio of changes in
income and quantity demanded which in this case move in the same direction
so if one change is positive then the other change is also positive resulting in a
positive figure.

(b)   Using the price elasticity of demand data in the table

      (i)    calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded for clothing and
             footwear if the price of clothing and footwear rises by 6 %;                        [2]

      (ii)   calculate the percentage change in the price of house furnishings that can
             lead to a 2 % fall in quantity demanded of house furnishings;                       [2]

      (iii) describe what might happen to the revenues of food and beverages firms
            as the price of food and beverages increases.                                        [2]

                   As the price of food and beverages increases the revenue of food and
                   beverages firms increases because demand is price inelastic.

              2    There is a clear understanding.                                               2
                   As the price of food and beverages increases the revenue of food and
                   beverages firms increases because demand is price inelastic so the
                   increase in price leads to a proportionately smaller decrease in quantity
                   demanded.

(c)   The cross price elasticity between housing and house furnishing was estimated
      to be equal to –0.4. Using this cross price elasticity data, explain the possible
      impact that an increase in house prices might have on the demand for house
      furnishing.                                                                             [4]

             As the price of houses increases the demand for house furnishings will
             decrease as they are complementary goods.

       2     The written response is accurate.                                               3–4
             As the price of houses increases the demand for house furnishings will
             decrease as they are complementary goods. As houses become more expensive,
             fewer will be bought and thus fewer house furnishings will be needed. As the
             price of houses increases the demand for house furnishing will decrease by a
             smaller percentage.



(d)   Using the income elasticity of demand data in the table

      (i)    calculate the percentage change in quantity demanded for housing if
             household incomes rise by 4 %;                                                   [2]

      (ii)   calculate the percentage change in household incomes that can lead to
             a 5 % rise in quantity demanded of recreation.                                   [2]

(e)   (i)    Calculate the amount the average Argentinean household currently spends
             on health care.                                                                    [1]

      (iii) As a result of the forecasted average Argentinean household income for
            2015, calculated in part (ii), explain what you would expect to happen to

                 Spending on health care will increase as income elasticity of demand is
                 positive.

               2 The written response is accurate.                                             3–4
                 Income elasticity of demand for health care is greater than 1 (it is 1.31)
                 which means the demand for health care rises faster than income as
                 income rises; as a result households will be spending a higher proportion
                 of their income on health care over time.

             Candidates who correctly calculate that the percentage of income spent on
             healthcare will increase from 9 % to 9.59 % (but do not provide any
             explanation) may be rewarded with a maximum of 2 marks.

          For stating if marginal product decreases then marginal costs increase and vice
          versa.

           For stating that if marginal product decreases then marginal costs increase and
           vice versa AND for explaining that as diminishing returns set in, then for a
           given increase in the variable input (labour) the resulting increase in output
           becomes smaller. As a result, the additional cost of one more unit of output (the
           marginal cost) will begin to increase.

           fully rewarded.

      1 There is a correct diagram or an accurate response.                            1–2
        For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing an increase in
        AD and an increase in real GDP or an explanation that as exports
        increase aggregate demand increases thus leading to an increase in real
        GDP (or, in real output).

      2 There is a correct diagram and an accurate response.                           3–4
        For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing an increase in
        AD and an increase in real GDP and an explanation that as exports
        increase aggregate demand increases thus leading to an increase in real
        GDP (or, in real output).

    For the vertical axis, the labelling could be price level, average price level,
    PL, APL, CPI or GPL. For the horizontal axis, the labelling could be real
    GDP, real output, real income or Y. A title is not necessary.

    Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams or who do not denote the change in
    real GDP on the horizontal axis can be awarded a maximum of [3 marks].

               1 There is a limited understanding.                                              1
                 For stating one valid possible reason

               2 There is a clear understanding.                                                2
                 For a brief account of one reason, such as, that low interest rates reduce
                 the cost of borrowing for firms inducing them to borrow more in order to
                 acquire more capital.

             N.B. A valid reason for high FDI is acceptable

      (ii)   Explain one supply-side benefit to the South Korean economy of a high
             rate of investment.                                                                [4]

               1 The written response is limited.                                              1–2
                 For an explanation that investment will increase the quantity and/ or
                 quality of factors of production thus shifting the LRAS (or, Keynesian
                 AS) to the right OR that a rightward shift in the LRAS curve implies an
                 increase in potential output thus enabling higher economic growth (OR
                 rising employment OR lower inflation).

               2 The written response is clear.                                                3–4
                 For an explanation that investment will increase the quantity and/ or
                 quality of factors of production thus shifting the LRAS (or, Keynesian
                 AS) to the right AND that a rightward shift in the LRAS curve implies an
                 increase in potential output thus enabling higher economic growth OR
                 rising employment OR lower inflation.

             N.B. A clear response which does not explicity refer to the LRAS curve may
             be fully rewarded.
