            The Nature, Models, and Sources of Political Power

            Ultimately, power in society comes from the people’s obedience. And those people – each of
            whom is individually a small source of power – can change their minds, and refuse to
            follow commands. Power in society is expressed largely through institutions and organizations.
            These institutions, holding up the structures of power, are called the ‘Pillars of Support’. If people
     5      within these pillars start to withdraw their support, then the government or other opponents will
            begin to collapse. These pillars could include the police, military, businesses, organized religion,
            the educational system and the media.

            Each individual government is based on very few crucial pillars. Identifying crucial pillars and
            developing a strategy that weakens those pillars may make the difference between success and
   10       failure for a non-violent struggle. Obedience of individuals and, more specifically, their willingness
            to follow orders, keeps each pillar functional, even where a government’s economic power is
            based mainly on a single industry or resource, such as oil. Even in these cases, the pyramid
            could not stand without thousands of individuals following orders. Therefore, individuals and
            the community as a whole have the power to withdraw their support, and not act in the way that
   15       the opponent wants them to.

            Non-violent tactics may be Syria’s only path to freedom

            An escalation of violence in Syria has revived the tactics of civil, peaceful resistance among many
            of Syria’s democracy activists. Non-violent means may be their ultimate force.
            One sign of such a shift came last month when a young woman named Rima Dali, wearing a
            blood-red dress, stood in a street outside Syria’s parliament and held up a banner:
     5      “Stop the killing, we want to build a homeland for all Syrians.” Her act of courage (and her arrest
            for a few days) has led to similar displays of protest for peace.
            One reason is that the killing by all sides has gotten worse. Suicide bombers killed dozens
            last week. More arms are flowing into Syria – from Russia, Lebanon, Iran, and elsewhere.
            Syrian President Assad uses attacks by rebels to strengthen his support from Syria’s many ethnic
    10      and religious minorities who are afraid the country might be controlled by the religious majority
            of the country, Sunni Muslims.
            What Assad seems to fear most are non-violent protesters. Their stand for a secular,
            democratic Syria could persuade the minorities, such as Kurds and Christians, to support them.
            As Louay Hussein, an intellectual leader of non-violent tactics and a founder of the group
    15      Building the Syrian State, said last year, “If we enter the cycle of violence we will not find a
            democratic solution but the division of the country.”
            In recent days, Assad’s forces have tried to arrest prominent peace activists. Such actions, however,
            only result in more foreign support for the international isolation of Assad and his top supporters.
            On Monday, for example, the European Union increased sanctions against the regime.
    20      Popular, peaceful protests have the best chance of winning the backing of Russia and China for
            further action by the United Nations Security Council. Such tactics also are the best path to ensure
            that a post-Assad Syria looks more like Tunisia in its calm state after the revolution than like Libya,
            where former rebels are creating chaos after NATO airstrikes forced the end of the Qaddafi* regime.
            Non-violent tactics rely on a principle of peace and an appeal to conscience that are often difficult
    25      to resist. In some cases, such as Syria today, they may be the only way to freedom.

            Because of the current situation, because of our absolute conviction that the Criminal Regime
            in Syria will not be stopped or removed without the use of force and coercion, and because of
            the rapid increase in the number of the defected soldiers as well as officers of the Syrian Regular
            Armed Forces, we formed the Free Syrian Army on the 27th of July 2011. The FSA is the
     5      cornerstone of the future Syrian Army that consists of all Syrians regardless of their belief, religion,
            sectarian or ethnic origin, and regardless of their different traditions and cultures. It is an Army
            for all, whose purpose and only reason of existence is to defend and protect Syria and the Syrians.
            It is also the only Military Force that assumes the responsibility of removing this Criminal Regime.
            We, the FSA, will spare no effort to strike this Criminal Regime along with its criminal militia
   10       (known as Shabieha) as hard as possible in order to protect the demonstrators and defend the cities
            and villages that are struck down by the Criminal Regime and its militia. We have made an oath to
            be the dutiful soldiers of this Great Revolution, and therefore we will do everything within our means
            to achieve our purpose.

* Conscientization: this happens when the less powerful party becomes aware of the “unbalance of power”
   and the “unpeaceful relations” between itself and a more powerful party.
