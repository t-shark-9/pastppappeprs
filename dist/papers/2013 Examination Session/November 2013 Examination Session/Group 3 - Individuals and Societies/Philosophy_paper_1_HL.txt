In your answers you are expected to:

     •   argue in an organized way using clear, precise language, which is appropriate to philosophy
     •   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of appropriate philosophical issues
     •   analyse, develop and critically evaluate relevant ideas and arguments
     •   present appropriate examples providing support for your overall argument
     •   identify and analyse counter-arguments
     •   provide relevant supporting material, illustrations and/or examples
     •   offer a clear and philosophically relevant personal response to the examination question.

                                                    SECTION A

Answer one question from this section. Each question in this section is worth [30 marks].

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.       Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

         Galen Strawson proposes a view of the self as non-persisting that shares much in common with the
         views of Buddhists, David Hume, and Derek Parfit. He develops his own view by placing it in relief
         against a particular backdrop, namely, how the self is ordinarily conceived. He summarizes this
         ordinary conception, which is grounded in phenomenology, in the eight claims that follow, namely,
         that the self is:
         (1) a thing, in some robust sense;
         (2) a mental thing, in some sense;
         (3) a single thing when considered synchronically (ie at a given time);
         (4) a single thing when considered diachronically (ie persisting from one time to another);
         (5) ontologically distinct from all other things;
         (6) a subject of experience, a conscious feeler and thinker;
         (7) an agent;
         (8) a thing that has a certain character or personality.

2.    Read the following passage and develop your response as indicated below.

      Herrnstein and Murray claimed that the normal distribution of IQ scores recorded by black people and
      white people in the US showed the average [mean] score for black people to be 15 points lower than
      the mean for white people. They contended that this difference is due to heredity, that is, to genetic
      factors.
      Stephen Jay Gould challenged Herrnstein and Murray’s account by attacking the four premises on
      which it rests: that intelligence is a single thing; that people can be ranked in a linear ordering according
      to intelligence; that intelligence is wholly genetically based; and that an individual’s intelligence
      cannot be changed. He contended that undermining any one of the four premises would undermine
      their position.
      Against the first premise Gould argued that it is more compelling to believe that intelligence is
      many-layered and multidimensional. Against the second premise, he argued that while IQ tests do
      produce rankings, it has not been demonstrated that IQ tests test intelligence (rather than, for example,
      school performance or social background) or that IQ tests are free of cultural biases. According to
      Gould, until these possibilities are ruled out, the suspicion must be that attempts to rank people by
      IQ are attempts to establish that some groups of people are naturally inferior to others. Against the
      third premise, Gould contended that there is a false equation of that which can be inherited with
      what cannot be changed. He pointed out, by way of example, that an inherited defect in vision
      can be corrected with prescription spectacles. Finally, against the fourth premise, Gould contended
      that the empirical evidence for intelligence being amenable to alteration via environmental factors
      (for example, via social and educational interventions) is far stronger than for the view that a person’s
      IQ is unchangeable.

11.   With reference to the forms and ideologies of government you have studied, evaluate which is
      conceptually the most justifiable.
