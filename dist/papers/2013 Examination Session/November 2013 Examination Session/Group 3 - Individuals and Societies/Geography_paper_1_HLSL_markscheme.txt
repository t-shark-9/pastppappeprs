                                  Core Theme – Patterns and Change

                                              SECTION A

1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Briefly describe the global pattern of the maternal mortality ratio shown on
           the map.                                                                                      [3]

           The map shows that highest maternal mortality ratios (MMR) are in sub-Saharan
           Africa and South Asia [1 mark]; the MMR is low in Europe, North America,
           Australasia and most of the rest of Asia [1 mark], variation in MMR within Latin
           America and the Caribbean [1 mark], identification of anomalies [1 mark].
           Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] if no quantification/use of data.

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why the maternal mortality ratio is so high in some
           countries.                                                                                  [2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each valid reason, and an additional [1 mark] for its
           development, exemplification or further explanation.

           Possible reasons include: lack of trained health personnel; lack of access to health
           care; higher fertility; age of mothers; birth spacing; conflict; remoteness; lower status
           of women; malnutrition; poverty.
           Allow other valid reasons.
           If not related to maternal mortality award up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (c)   Explain the recent trends in life expectancy at birth for a named country or
           region.                                                                                       [5]

           Answers will depend on the country/region chosen.
           Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] for describing the recent trends and up to
           [3 marks] for explaining why they occur.
           For example, increased life expectancy could be linked to improved nutrition,
           health care, sanitation.
           For example, reduced life expectancy could be linked to HIV, AIDS, lifestyle issues,
           diet.
           If no named country/region or outdated examples are used, marks will be limited to a
           maximum of [3 marks]. If no reference to trends or change award up to a maximum
           of [2 marks].
           If more than one country/region is used, credit the best one only.
                                                   –4–               N13/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   Define the term remittances.                                                                     [2]

           Transfers of money/goods [1 mark] by foreign/migrant workers to their home
           countries [1 mark].

     (b)   Referring to the graph, describe the trend in remittance flows since 1989.                       [3]

           Increasing steadily from 1989 (US$ 50 billion) to a peak (US$ 325 billion) in 2007
           [1 mark]; from 2007 onwards sharp decline to below US$ 300 billion [1 mark].
           Accurate quantification (+/- 10 billion) and use of dates essential for final [1 mark].

     (c)   Suggest three reasons why international financial aid is not always effective.               [2+2+2]

           Award [1+1 mark] for each valid reason, provided that it is developed by means of
           explanation and/or exemplification.

           Possibilities include: insufficient aid (few donors achieving UN target of 0.7 % of
           GDP); wrong type of aid; some aid results in debt; aid targets specific groups within
           a population who are not always the poorest; unreliable source of funding (can be
           tied/withdrawn); there are other more reliable sources of income; can be subject
           to corruption; conditionality; spatial isolation; not spent in the correct manner; targets
           short term problems.
           Allow other valid reasons.

3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Identify Category X on the diagram.                                                           [1]

           Agriculture/farming [1 mark].

     (b)   Define the term physical water scarcity.                                                      [2]

           Physical water scarcity occurs when the use of water resources [1 mark] approaches
           or exceeds sustainable levels [1 mark] (that is, it relates water availability to demand,
           meaning that arid areas are not necessarily water-scarce areas if demand is small).
           For a partial definition, eg water demand exceeds supply, award [1mark] only.

     (c)   Explain two physical factors that affect the availability of safe drinking water
           for a community.                                                                            [2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each factor and a further [1 mark] for explaining why it relates
           to a safe water supply.

           Physical factors that affect access to safe water include climate (amount, type and
           timing of precipitation eg drought; climate change), geology (groundwater and
           aquifers), relief (surface water depressions, poor access probable if slopes are steep),
           drainage (rivers, lakes), isolation or distance from supply, natural hazard events such
           as earthquakes.
           Note that the factor must be physical. This may lead to contamination,
           eg earthquakes lead to contamination by sewage. Do not award human factors alone
           such as industrial or agricultural pollution.

     (d)   Analyse the role of water in the causes of soil degradation.                                  [4]

           At least two ideas associated with causes should be developed for the award of the
           full [4 marks]. A greater range of ideas (in less depth) may also be awarded
           full marks.

           Possibilities include: erosion by water, removing soil, may follow overgrazing and
           the removal of vegetation. Flash floods can strip surface soil within minutes, leaving
           barren rock. The upward movement of water through soil may result in salinization,
           rendering the soils infertile. The downward movement of water through soils may
           leach valuable minerals out of the soil, reducing its fertility.

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   Identify Country A.                                                                         [1]

           China [1 mark].

     (b)   Briefly describe what is meant by the OPEC cartel.                                          [2]

           Award [1 mark] for a comment that recognizes what OPEC is – eg the Organization
           of Petroleum Exporting Countries or names of the members (Algeria, Angola,
           Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
           Emirates and Venezuela). Award [1 mark] for the operation as a cartel – formed to
           fix prices and/or production quotas.

     (c)   Explain two geopolitical impacts of the rise in global oil consumption since 1990.        [2+2]

           There are many possibilities.
           Award [1 mark] for each basic explanation of a valid impact and a further [1 mark]
           for its development.

           The increase in global consumption has led to geopolitical pressures in some parts of
           the world as oil-hungry countries seek additional supplies of oil to meet their
           anticipated future demand. It has increased tensions in parts of the Middle East since
           that area has the world’s largest oil reserves to which oil-importing countries such as
           the US want to preserve their access. Equally, it has led to growing international
           tension over likely sources of oil, such as those in the Arctic, Sudan and South China
           Sea, that are currently not exploited. On the other hand, the rise in consumption has
           led to higher prices for oil, leading to more investment in non-oil sources of energy.
           Reference may be made to conflicts that have their origin in the securing of access to
           oil supplies. Comments may refer to variations in the rate of increase with NICs
           having a faster increase in demand which causes tensions. Some impacts may arise
           through the transport of oil and pollution incidents that are a consequence –
           be careful to credit only where they lead to geopolitical impacts.

(d)   Suggest two reasons why sources of renewable energy have become more
      important in many countries in recent years.                                    [2+2]

      Award [1 mark] for each valid reason, and an additional [1 mark] for its
      development, exemplification or further explanation.

      Possible reasons could include:
       adoption of a green agenda
       energy security
       the desire to increase sustainability
       the declining availability and/or rising costs of fossil fuels
       the need to avoid global warming
       meeting pledges, for example, Kyoto-Copenhagen
       an increased investment in renewable energy technologies
       technological breakthroughs that have reduced the costs of renewable energy
        infrastructure
       alternative to nuclear since Fukushima.

5.   Examine the negative environmental impacts of economic development on water and
     biodiversity.                                                                                  [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question, and each should be marked on
     its merits.

     Negative impacts arise from development as the use of resources (and ecological footprint)
     increases. Both water quantity and quality may be adversely affected by development, and
     biodiversity is often reduced as forests are felled and land cleared for settlement or
     agriculture. Responses may consider how climate change, as a product of global
     development, may have a wide range of impacts on water and biodiversity.

     It is possible that some responses may explore the idea that as countries become more
     developed they enact environmental controls and adopt strategies to reduce the stress on
     water and biodiversity.

     Responses that fail to look at both biodiversity and water (does not have to be in equal
     depth) are unlikely to go beyond band D. To access bands E and F responses should either
     provide a range of case studies that show understanding or take an evaluative approach that
     recognizes that economic development is a complex concept.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.


6.   “Greater gender equality is the most effective way to reduce poverty and stimulate
     development.” Discuss this statement.                                                          [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question and each should be marked on
     its merits.

     Many responses are likely to focus on the Millennium Development Goals and positive
     aspects of greater gender equality on societies and economies. These include the role of
     women in influencing trends in demography (via age of marriage, number of children),
     employment (via presence in the workforce), education, health care and politics,
     among others.

     It is expected that the discussion will also include some mention of other factors affecting
     development, such as the resources available, total size of population and economic and
     political framework. The strongest responses may challenge the question, either by
     concluding that they disagree with it, or exploring the meaning of “development”.

     Responses that do not offer some form of discussion/evaluation are unlikely to go beyond
     band D. Discussion could involve either looking at multiple ways in which gender
     equality meets these goals, or looking at other ways of combating poverty, for example,
     trade, aid. Some responses may choose to disagree with the statement and this is equally
     acceptable if they can provide a relevant evidenced argument.

     Stronger responses that include some discussion of other factors or discuss the meaning of
     poverty or development in more depth are likely to access bands E and F.

7.   “A falling fertility rate is always beneficial to a country.” Discuss this statement.          [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question, and each should be marked on
     its merits.

     Fertility rates should be defined, this can be stated or implied.

     Benefits could be: reduced costs for schooling, adults can begin to save; less environmental
     pressure; possible reduction of resource consumption; traditional roles of women changing,
     increased number of women in the workforce; potential for greater gender empowerment.

     Problems could be: aging population; smaller workforce; increased tax burden;
     reduced market; closure of schools/clinics; need for migrants to boost employment.

     Responses should make use of examples.

     Responses that focus on describing population policies in some nations and not the
     consequences of falling fertility rates in that country will be self-limiting as this is not
     the question. Responses that consider only one side of the argument are unlikely to
     progress beyond band D. Responses that look at both benefits and problems of a falling
     fertility rate in a more balanced manner are likely to access bands E and F.
