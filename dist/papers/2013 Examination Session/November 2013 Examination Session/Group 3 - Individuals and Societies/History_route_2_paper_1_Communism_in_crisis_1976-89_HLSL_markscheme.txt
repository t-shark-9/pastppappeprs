1.   (a)   What does Source A suggest about the political position in
           Czechoslovakia prior to the Velvet Revolution of 1989?                         [3 marks]

           •   The people lived under an authoritarian regime.
           •   The number of people willing to become politically active was increasing.
           •   Care had to be taken to ensure that risk did not outweigh possible benefits.
           •   If a protest ended in failure it sometimes strengthened the existing dictatorship.
           •   A constitution was drawn up by lawyers that would meet the requirements of a
               democracy.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source E?                                      [2 marks]

           • There is a peaceful demonstration in the streets.
           • Source E shows the intimidating presence of the police at the demonstration.
           • The number of candles suggests that many people demonstrated.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about events
     leading to the collapse of Communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989.                    [6 marks]

     For “compare”
     • Both sources suggest the role of the international media and Radio Free Europe were
       important.
     • Both sources emphasise the role of mass demonstration/mass protests in events.
     • Both sources suggest that the non-violent nature of the protests was a contributory factor.
     • Both sources refer to the influence of the Church and/or religion.

     For “contrast”
     • Source C deals mainly with positive external factors, eg election of a Polish Pope,
       Reagan’s strategy, etc, whereas Source D focuses on the negative effects produced by the
       state use of violence.
     • While Source D focuses on Czechoslovakia, Source C places the Velvet Revolution in an
       international context.
     • Source C emphasizes the importance of Gorbachev whereas Source D focuses on the role
       of people in Czechoslovakia.

     Do not demand all of the above. If only one source is discussed award a maximum of
     [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent
     linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
     Award up to [5 marks] if two sources are linked/integrated in either a running comparison
     or contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source B and Source C for historians studying the collapse of
     Communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989.                                                   [6 marks]

     Source B
     Origin:        This is the New Year’s address by Vaclav Havel, one of the main leaders of the
                    Velvet Revolution and the first president of the Czech Republic.

     Purpose:       Havel is keen to show the world that Czechoslovakia has emerged from the
                    oppressive Communist regime. He is also possibly anticipating that with this
                    may come nationalistic demands from Slovakia, and he may be seeking to
                    avoid this by bolstering inclusivity. He is also seeking to rally support behind
                    the revolution.

     Value:         Havel’s central role in the overthrow of the Communist regime in
                    Czechoslovakia means that he can provide valuable insight into the events
                    of 1989. Havel understood what had motivated some people in the
                    demonstrations and what they had hoped to gain which informs his speech; it
                    also captures the mood directly after 1989.

     Limitations:   Havel, as the key progenitor of the collapse of Communism in Czechoslovakia,
                    may be too emotionally involved to offer a detached insight into the events of
                    1989. This is a public address. He is setting out to inspire his people. His
                    aims may have changed after the fall of communism.

     Source C
     Origin:        This is written by an academic from the Department of Political Science of
                    Bucharest University in 2008.

     Purpose:       To explain the collapse of Communism in East-Central Europe in 1989.

     Value:         This is an academic paper written by a university faculty member and should
                    be based on thorough research. Twenty years had elapsed since 1989 and
                    therefore there has been time for hindsight. The provenance of this source,
                    from a state that – like Czechoslovakia – was formerly part of Communist
                    Europe, may give the author particular insight into the collapse of
                    Communism. .

     Limitations:   Since the purpose of this document is to explain the collapse of Communism in
                    Europe its focus will be wider than just Czechoslovakia, which may restrict its
                    value in relation to a study of the collapse of Communism in Czechoslovakia in
                    1989. Furthermore the author, who works at a university in Romania, may not
                    have firsthand experience of the Czechoslovakian revolution and this may
                    compound the possibility that his work provides a generalised, pan-regional
                    view of the collapse of Communism in East-Central Europe.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally, there will be a balance between the two sources, and each
     one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one source is assessed,
     mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and
     purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, explain the extent to which
     those involved in the build-up to the Velvet Revolution would regard the
     revolution as successful.                                                            [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A:    This shows that more people were willing to become politically active. It
                  shows that the people aimed to remove the Communist regime and that some
                  had prepared a new constitution to be applied after its fall. It shows that they
                  wanted an end to unjust trials. It also suggests that it had not been possible to
                  anticipate the nature of political pressure following the collapse.

     Source B:     This shows that Havel (the leader of Civic Forum) has now become president
                   and this was due to the will of the people. It outlines his aims of having free
                   elections and political change through peaceful means which had been what the
                   people wanted. It also addresses the need to realise the aim of improving living
                   standards and/or welfare for all. It also provides the stated aim of ensuring that
                   Czechs and Slovaks continue to work together to ensure that Slovaks do not
                   feel side-lined. This concern suggests impending trouble between the Czech
                   and Slovak sections of the country.

     Source C:     This shows that one of the aims, ie ousting the Communists, has been achieved
                   as the Communist regime has collapsed. Source C also shows that the aim of
                   achieving this through peaceful mass protest had been achieved. The desire for
                   a better standard of living is also noted. External forces, for example Ronald
                   Reagan, who had worked to bring down Communism in Europe, saw the
                   revolution as successful.

     Source D:     This relates to the aim of bringing about change by peaceful means – with
                   peaceful mass public demonstrations and no retaliation from the public despite
                   police violence. It also suggests there may have been a religious element for
                   some demonstrators.

     Source E:     This relates to the aim of bringing about change by peaceful means – with
                   peaceful public demonstrations, despite the intimidating police presence.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge might include: an explanation of the aims of the demonstrators for example,
     more specific detail on economic conditions and the desire for a better standard of living; to
     address the points outlined in Charter 77, and attain the freedoms of the Helsinki Accords
     1975 and the UN Declaration on Human Rights; the specific demands of Civic Forum; the
     removal of Article 4 from the constitution (which guaranteed the leading role of the
     Communist Party in government), and the release of political prisoners, which was an aim
     also promoted by the Committee for the Defence of the Unjustly Prosecuted [VONS]. The
     revolution did succeed in removing Article 4 of the constitution and Havel became the new
     President. Free elections were held and the economy was privatised. Political prisoners were
     released and the hated secret police was abolished. But, the aims stated by Havel in his New
     Year’s address of 1990 were not all the original aims of Charter 77. The subsequent break up
     of Czechoslovakia was not intended by many who had brought down the communists
     including Havel who was particularly disappointed with this situation. Own knowledge could
     also reflect on the original impetus in both parts of the country (Bratislava and Prague).

Gorbachev would not regard the collapse of communism as a success. Allow for a greater
focus on aims.

Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
[8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
references to the sources used.
