Answer two questions from this section.

1.    (a)   Define the following terms:

            (i)    economies of scale (line 16)                                                 [2 marks]

            (ii)   empowerment (line 35).                                                       [2 marks]

      (b)   With reference to RDB, distinguish between internal growth and external growth.     [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of each new RDB factory being
            “jointly managed by one experienced RDB senior manager from Europe and one
            local manager familiar with the language and culture” (lines 100–101).              [7 marks]


2.    (a)   By the 1970s, Japanese companies had moved to just-in-time production
            (line 26).   Outline one advantage and one disadvantage of just-in-time
            production.                                                                         [4 marks]

      (b)   Using data from the additional information on page 3, calculate RDB’s:

            (i)    gross profit margin in 1970 and 1975.                                        [2 marks]

            (ii)   acid test (quick) ratio in 1970 and 1975.                                    [2 marks]

      (c)   Interpret the results from your calculations in part (b).                           [7 marks]


3.    (a)   Describe one consequence of the likely relocation of the factories (lines 96–99):

            (i)    for one internal stakeholder of RDB.                                         [2 marks]

            (ii)   for one external stakeholder of RDB.                                         [2 marks]

      (b)   Using information in lines 19–21, construct a position map of the ball bearing
            industry in the 1930s and place RDB and its two main competitors on it.             [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for RDB of becoming a public limited
            company (line 123).                                                                 [7 marks]

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

4.    (a)   Outline why ball bearings are particularly important in the secondary sector of
            the economy.                                                                        [2 marks]
