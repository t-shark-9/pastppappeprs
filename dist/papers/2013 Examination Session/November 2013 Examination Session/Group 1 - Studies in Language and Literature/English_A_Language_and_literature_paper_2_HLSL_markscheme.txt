 Context should be understood in the widest possible sense. It may include the social and/or
 historical setting of the work; it may include the context of a situation within the work and will
 certainly include contexts of production and reception of a work.

 In addition to the notes below, responses should be structured with a logical sequence and
 development. Clear, varied and accurate language should be used, as well as appropriate
 register, style and terminology.


1.   An adequate to good answer will identify specific presentations of time in the texts studied
     and indicate to what effect the writers have used these instances of time.

     A good to excellent answer may offer more detailed presentations of time in the works and
     show a careful consideration of how time is used as a contextual element.


2.   An adequate to good answer will offer examples of “working together” and/or “standing
     on your own two feet” in the texts studied and will indicate how these ways of behaving
     reflect the cultural contexts conveyed in the works.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more sophisticated discussion of “working
     together” or “standing on your own two feet” and discuss how these ways of behaving
     relate to the cultural contexts.


3.   An adequate to good answer will show understanding of the terms “art” and “craft” as
     prompted by the question, exemplify the presence of each in the texts studied and offer
     some discussion of how they are combined successfully.

     A good to excellent answer may look more closely at the terms “art” and “craft” and offer
     a more nuanced and detailed examination of the presence of the two elements in the texts,
     showing a clear understanding of the nature of literature.


4.   An adequate to good answer will identify elements in the texts studied that lend themselves
     to various receptions by different audiences or readers.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more sophisticated awareness of the elements in
     the works that influence its reception and give a more detailed and nuanced analysis as to
     how the reception of a work is influenced by cultural context.

5.   An adequate to good answer will identify examples of “the getting of money” in the texts
     studied and offer some analysis of how it is represented and why that element is significant
     in the works.

     A good to excellent answer may examine more closely the significance of “the getting of
     money” in the texts studied, offering a detailed analysis and thorough understanding of
     how and why this element is presented and how contextual elements add to this
     understanding.


6.   An adequate to good answer will define, with specific examples, what is understood as
     “the new” and “the old”. The response will also offer some analysis of how these two
     elements create tension and what the significance of that tension is.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more nuanced understanding of “new” and “old,”
     and show a clear understanding of the tension created between the two and how that
     tension is relevant to the reader’s engagement with the text.
