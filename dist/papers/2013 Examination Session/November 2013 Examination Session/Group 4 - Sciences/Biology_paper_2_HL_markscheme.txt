Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Extended response questions - quality of construction

     w Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
        awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

     w Two aspects are considered:
         expression of relevant ideas with clarity
         structure of the answers.

     w [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
        Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

     (c)   type I shows same/similar pattern of rate in both age groups;
           rates of type II were (much) greater among those aged 10–19 years than <10
           years;                                                                                      [2]

     (d)   (i)    Europeans/E have lowest rate of type II / only Europeans/E (10+) have a
                  higher rate for type I (than type II);
                  API/NA 10+ rate higher for type II (than type I);
                  LA/A rates for both similar at 10+;
                  NA(10+) has the lowest cases of type I but highest number of type II / NA
                     under 10 have lowest rates for both types;                                    [2 max]

           (ii)   different genetic factors (affect fat metabolism);
                  (rise) due to increase in fat/carbohydrate intake/junk food/low in fibre;
                  “western” diet (in US) very different from traditional diets;                    [1 max]

     (e)   negative/inverse relationship/negative correlation / as one variable increases the
           other decreases / as plasma fatty acid increases, enzyme activity decreases / vice

     (g)   yes, effect is reversible as activity returns to (approximately) original level (when
           lipids/fatty acids decrease);
           when lipid/fatty acids washed out enzyme is more active/activity increases;
           difference between starting and final levels of enzyme activity is insignificant
           because of error bars;
           three hours/experimental time may be insufficient to reverse the effect;                [2 max]

     (h)   increased insulin concentration causes more glucose absorption (up to 103 µU ml–1);
           glucose absorption in muscle bathed in lipid always less than control;

           Referring to second graph:
           more/higher glucose uptake with higher insulin levels in muscles without lipids
           (compared to muscles bathed in lipids);
           lipids reduce glucose absorption (even at raised insulin concentrations);
           isolated muscle used in experiments so results may differ in whole organisms;           [2 max]

     (c)   more than one gene contribute to/control same characteristic;
           as number of genes increase so does possible number of phenotypes;
           leads to continuous variation;

8.   (a)   Award [3 max] for condensation reactions

           Condensation reactions:
           condensation is two molecules joining (by a covalent bond) with the loss of a
           water molecule;
           example of condensation reaction;
           eg
                                 +                    →                                       +Η2Ο

           formation of peptide bond between amino acids;
           (covalent) bond between carboxyl end of one amino acid molecule and amino end
           of other;
           many amino acids joined by condensation to form polypeptide;

           Hydrolysis reactions:
           hydrolysis is the addition of water to break a large molecule into smaller ones;
           polypeptide broken down into amino acids/dipeptides by hydrolysis;                   [4 max]
           Award any of the above points for a clearly drawn correctly annotated diagram.

           NAD/NADH + H is formed (when entering mitochondrion);                
           2-C molecule/acetyl group reacts with (reduced) coenzyme A to form acetyl CoA;
           acetyl CoA enters Krebs cycle;
           2 CO2 molecules removed (as waste);
           energy/electron rich NADH + H+/FADH2 formed;
           for each turn of cycle/each pyruvate, 3 NADH + H+ and 1 FADH2
           formed;
           1 ATP formed per pyruvate each turn (by substrate-level phosphorylation);
           reduced NAD/NADH + H+ and FADH2 enter electron transport chain/ETC;
           oxidative phosphorylation uses energy released by ETC to synthesise ATP;

           creates H+ gradient across the membrane;
           ATP synthesized by flow of H+ back across membrane through ATP synthase;
           ATP synthesized by chemiosmosis;
           ETC reduces oxygen/oxygen is final hydrogen (and electron) acceptor forming
           water;                                                                              [8 max]

      mutation in gene coding for (one of) polypeptide chain in hemoglobin/HbA;
      GAG (on sense strand of DNA) mutated to GTG;
      when transcribed, RNA sequence/codon becomes GUG rather than GAG;
      during translation, have one amino acid substituted for another;
      causes glutamic acid/glutamate to be replaced by valine;
      change alters folding of Hb protein/makes RBCs sickle-shaped (in low oxygen);
      sickle shaped cells block capillaries/cause tissue damage and pain;                 [6 max]
      Award any of the above points for a clearly drawn correctly annotated diagram.
