Figure 3     Fact File on Lake Naivasha and its ecology

 •   Situated within the tropical grassland biome.
 •   Naivasha is the only freshwater lake in the Rift Valley in Kenya. The others are alkaline or saline.
 •   Naivasha is a relatively small and shallow lake (average 6m deep).
 •   The surface area of the lake varies from 102 km2 to 150 km2 due to irregular rainfall.
 •   The main water sources are the Malewa and Gilgil rivers, rain from storms over the nearby Abedare
     mountain range, and groundwater flow.
 •   Water leaves the lake by evaporation, transpiration from aquatic vegetation and as underground flow.
 •   The lake and its shoreline provide diverse habitats for mammals, including hippo and colobus
     monkeys, birds (for example: African fish eagle) and fish (for example: tilapia, black bass).
 •   The lake supports a high but uneven biodiversity – rich in birds and plants but no native fish.
 •   Papyrus is found at the edges of the lake. Papyrus swamps have the potential to sequester large
     amounts of the carbon (1.6 kg cm–2 y–1) provided water levels remain high.

Figure 5    Economic Activity supported by Lake Naivasha

 • The lake supports flower growing, geothermal power generation, tourism, fishing and dairy farming.
 • The flower industry is dependent on irrigation from the lake.  Flowers represent 75 % of Kenya’s
   horticultural exports and their production employs over 250 000 people.  Flower farms are typically
   very large (over 60 hectares) and involve inputs of fertilisers and pesticides.
 • Much of the remaining land is farmed on a subsistence basis as shambas (smallholdings).
 • Approximately 9 % of Kenya’s electricity is supplied by the Ol Karia geothermal plant.  There is
   scope to expand the production of geothermal power considerably.

Figure 7    Threats to Lake Naivasha

The rising population has led to an increasing demand for land, firewood, charcoal, and timber, leading to
deforestation and increased soil erosion.  Lake Naivasha’s biodiversity is critically threatened by habitat
destruction, pollution (from pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers and sewage), nutrient enrichment, introduction
of alien species (for example: exotic crayfish), invasion of the water hyacinth, siltation due to over grazing,
shore line vegetation destruction (for example: harvesting of papyrus) and excessive water abstraction
(removal). Most of the water abstractions are not measured. Only a small section of Naivasha town is
covered by sewerage systems. The sewage treatment works broke down ten years ago.

Figure 8    The Ramsar Convention and Lake Naivasha Riparian Association

The Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation
of wetlands and their resources. At the centre of Ramsar is the “wise use” concept. The wise use of
wetlands is defined as “the maintenance of their ecological character, achieved through the implementation
of ecosystem approaches, within the context of sustainable development”.

The Lake Naivasha Riparian Association (LNRA) was founded in 1929 by the landowners surrounding the
lake. Today the LNRA is actively involved in coordinating a plan to control the forces that threaten the
lake’s quality and beauty and to promote the sustainable development of the lake.  There are nearly 140
members including: tour operators, the Kenya Power Company, flower growers, local farmers and the local
council.

Recent measures taken by LNRA
• Putting in drip irrigation technology
• Installing some water meters
• Controlling pesticide use
• Introduction of codes of conduct for the flower farms, geothermal plant and tourism industries
• Restoration of sewage treatment plant.

Figure 9 (a)      Pollution study method used to test water quality at Naivasha

At each sample site, water pH, temperature, and transparency were measured from the side of the boat
two metres from the edge of any water hyacinths.

Transparency was measured by lowering a Secchi disk into the water and measuring the depth in cm at
which the white part is no longer visible. This gives a measure of turbidity.

                                                                                                           Secchi disk




500 cm3 water samples were also taken for laboratory analysis to test for algae concentration.

Relative abundance of floating water hyacinths was measured at each site using 1 × 1 m quadrat frames
placed on the vegetation surface from the side of the boat.
