Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 20 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 40 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of the conflict for the designer
           between moral and social responsibilities in relation to green design issues and
           wealth creation [3 max].
           designers are often under pressure to produce products as cheaply as possible in
           order to maximize profit for the manufacturer;
           but the designer has to resolve this with providing value-for-money to the
           consumer and minimizing the impact of products on the environment;
           the challenge for designers is to produce environmentally friendly products
           without seriously compromising quality or profit;                                        [3]

                 with energetic activities;
                 the backpack needs to weigh as little as possible in order to not interfere
                 with the movement/enjoyment of the activity;

                  it needs to be lightweight;
                  materials/frame must be low density;                                              [2 max]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for stating one advantage to the user of parts of the backpack

             reduces manufacturing costs;

             environmental impact;
             producing different sizes means that some sizes of backpacks are likely to
             remain unsold as it is difficult to judge the market;
             this would mean wastage of natural resources;                                    [9]

           (iii) Award [1] for identifying how constructive discontent was the primary
                 generator of the idea for the Umbrolly and [1] for a brief description
                 [2 max].
                 Ejogo was discontent with finding himself unprepared for walking in the
                 rain;
                 and he decided to use his experience to come up with a new idea to solve the
                 problem;                                                                           [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for identifying one reason why innovators such as Ejogo may
                  have difficulty in obtaining financial support.
                  the innovation of products may be considered high risk / potential investors
                  may be unsure whether the product will be successful/may prefer to wait
                  until there is clear evidence of market;                                          [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of Ejogo as an example of
                  an inventor/entrepreneur [3 max].
                  the invention is the idea/concept rather than the product;
                  as the product is a combination of existing designs, for example, a brolly
                  and a vending machine;
                  Ejogo is not a creative designer but a businessman who saw a new
                  opportunity and formed a company;                                                 [3]
                                            – 11 –             N13/4/DESTE/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   (i)    Award [1] for outlining the impact of research and development costs on the
             final cost of the Umbrolly and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
             minimal impact;
             the invention does not rely on expensive research and development as it
             does not employ new technology;                                                [2]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each distinct point in a discussion of three cost implications
             which will need to be taken into account when establishing a network of
             Umbrolly machines [3 max] for each consideration.
             maintenance;
             the machines need to be regularly maintained to ensure they are operating
             effectively;
             but the level of maintenance will vary depending on the level of
             use/potential abuse;

             labour;
             the machine will need refilling;
             costs will vary depending on location of the machines/how often they need
             refilling/transport costs;

             supply of machines;
             as a relatively new innovation the company will want to expand the network
             of machines;
             the costs will vary depending on the pace of innovation/level of investment;

             location;
             the company will need to identify suitable locations for the machines which
             have a high level of footfall/used by many people;
             and payment/rental to the owners of the premises will also have to be taken
             into account;                                                                  [9]
