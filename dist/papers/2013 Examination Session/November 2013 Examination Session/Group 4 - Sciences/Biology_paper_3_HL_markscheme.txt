Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 x 20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

            is a risk factor for CHD;
            Lactobacillus/supplements increase bile salts in feces which implies some
            cholesterol may be eliminated;


            Evidence against hypothesis:
            not known if cholesterol ends up in blood instead thus increasing risk for CHD;
            no data about benefit for normal diet/actual decrease of incidence of CHD;
            data/results based on rat experiments / may not apply to humans;
            WTTE of taking into account difference in bile salt level between L. fermentum
            and L. plantarum;                                                                       [3 max]

      (b)   facilitated diffusion;
            substance moves from high to low concentration/ down concentration gradient;
            protein channels needed;
            does not require ATP/energy / passive;
            valid example; (eg amino acids / glucose / fructose / water soluble vitamins)       [3 max]
            or
            active transport;
            substance moves from low to high concentration / against concentration gradient;
            membrane pumps needed / Na/K pump, Ca++;
            ATP/energy required;
            valid example; (eg amino acids / glucose / mineral irons / iron)
            or
            endocytosis/pinocytosis;
            droplets of intestinal fluid surrounded by membrane;
            forms vesicle;
            vesicles are released inside villus cell;
            valid example; (eg fat soluble vitamins)
            Accept appropriate diagram.

            enzymes immobilized in plasma membrane of epithelial cells / on surface of
            villi/microvilli;
            remain functional for longer time than free floating enzymes / OWTTE;
            product in right place for absorption / absorbed immediately;
            valid example of enzyme; (eg maltase, lactase, sucrase);                            [2 max]



15.   control of ADH secretion by negative feedback;
      ADH controls water reabsorption in kidney;
      osmoreceptors in hypothalamus monitor water content (in blood);
      ADH produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus;
      transported (down axons of these cells) to the posterior pituitary;
      low water content/high solute concentration in blood ((usually) causes action potential
      to be sent to posterior pituitary);
      posterior pituitary releases ADH which travels to collecting ducts of kidney;
      more water reabsorbed (by collecting ducts) making water content (of blood)
      higher/solute concentration lower;
      less ADH released;                                                                        [6 max]
