Answer either question 1 or question 2.
Answer question 3.

Question 1 refers to the work Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 “Classical” by S Prokofiev.
Question 2 refers to the work The Yellow River Piano Concerto by X Xian.
Question 3 refers to both works.

Justify your statements with arguments making clear reference to the piece/extract.

involved in the works by Prokofiev and by Xian.


Either

1.    Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 “Classical” by S Prokofiev
      Melody writing in the classical period (1750–1820) has been described as concise,
      balanced, organized, elegant and perfectly shaped.  Which of these characteristics would
      apply to Prokofiev’s melodies in his “Classical” symphony, and which would not?  Make
      clear reference to the score in your answer.                                             [20 marks]

Or

2.    The Yellow River Piano Concerto by X Xian
      Many musicologists maintain that The Yellow River Piano Concerto is a fusion of
      traditional Chinese music and western art music.   With clear reference to the score,
      discuss at least three examples that support this point of view.                      [20 marks]




3.    Symphony No. 1 in D Major, Op. 25 “Classical” by S Prokofiev and The Yellow River
      Piano Concerto by X Xian

      works, emphasizing the presence of any significant musical links.  Make clear reference
      to both scores in your answer.                                                          [20 marks]
