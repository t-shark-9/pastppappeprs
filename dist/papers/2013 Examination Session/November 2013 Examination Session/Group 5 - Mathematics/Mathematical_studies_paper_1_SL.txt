Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be
given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Write your answers in the answer
boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      Zachary borrows $80 000 at a nominal annual interest rate of 5 %, to be repaid over a
      20 year term.

      (a)   Using the table, calculate the total interest that Zachary pays.                           [3]

      Finley borrows a sum of money at a nominal annual interest rate of 7 % over a
      10 year term. His monthly repayment must not be more than $500.

      (b)   Using the table, calculate the maximum amount that Finley can borrow. Give your
            answer correct to the nearest $100.                                                        [3]
