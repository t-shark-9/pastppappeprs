These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking the paper,
keep in mind that subject specific knowledge, as well as candidates’ personal opinions, are not
being assessed.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At SL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words. Failure to write the minimum
number of words will result in a 1-mark penalty under criterion A. There is no penalty for
exceeding 400 words: the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have few language gaps, and slips or flaws rarely affect meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.
