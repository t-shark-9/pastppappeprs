These marking notes give additional information for marking paper 2. When marking both
sections, keep in mind that neither subject specific knowledge nor candidates’ personal opinions, as
such, should be assessed, although Criterion B marks may be influenced by how successfully
knowledge or opinions are handled in the message.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
(5 for criterion C) of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to
which they fail to meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.

Word count

At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in Section A and 150 words in
Section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a 1-mark penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in Section A or 250 words in Section B:
the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Criterion A – Language

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.


 Language
 Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
 affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
 fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
 forgetfulness.
 SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
 forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”
 FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are
 formed correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions
 (eg past simple versus present perfect)
 GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
 but do not appear.

                                           SECTION A

1.   Cultural diversity

     Many languages are spoken by a small number of people, and some are in danger of
     dying out. Write an article to be published in your school magazine on why and how
     minority languages should be maintained.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will make the writer’s viewpoint clear
      will cover both aspects: why and how; if the script fails to cover one of the requirements, it
       may achieve the 5–6 band if the ideas that are developed are reasonably “coherent” with
       supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may give specific examples of minority languages in danger; this should be rewarded
      may encourage readers to preserve minority languages; this should be rewarded.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will have a title and the name of the author
      will have an appropriate introduction and conclusion
      will use a lively magazine style.


2.   Customs and traditions

     On one of your recent travels, you were asked to take part in a traditional dance.
     Post an entry on your personal blog describing your experience and what you thought
     about it.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will include both reflection and narration; if the script fails to cover one of the
       requirements, it may achieve the 5–6 band if the ideas that are developed are reasonably
       “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
      will have blog features such as first person reflection and narration, direct approach, sense
       of the reader, and spontaneity.

     N.B. Some limited use of textese (eg 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
     permissible.

3.   Health

     A recent article in a national newspaper highlighted the fact that more and more young
     people are having health problems because they spend many hours on the computer.
     Write a letter to the editor of the newspaper in which you express your opinion about
     this issue.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will refer to the original article
      will make the writer’s viewpoint clear
      will have examples
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may personalize the issue; this should be rewarded.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
      will include the formal aspects of a letter (date, greeting, closing salutation, etc).


4.   Leisure

     Money plays an important role in sport today. You have been asked to give a speech to
     your classmates on the negative aspects of this situation. Write the text of your speech.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will mainly concern itself with the negative aspects
      will give examples
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively
      may have flashes of humour.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
      will include speech rhetoric, for example rhetorical questions, repetition
      will maintain contact with the audience throughout (opening, use of “we” and “you”,
       closing).
                                                –6–           N13/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Science and technology

     You have visited an information technology fair and you were impressed by the recent
     advances in this field. Write an email to a friend in which you describe what you saw
     and encourage him/her to attend the fair.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Message
      will set the email in a personal context
      will express enthusiasm
      will both describe the fair and encourage the friend to attend; if the script fails to cover one
       of the requirements, it may achieve the 5–6 band if the ideas that are developed are
       reasonably “coherent” with supporting details that are “mostly appropriate”
      will give examples
      will use paragraphing and cohesive devices which structure the development of ideas
       effectively.

     Criterion C – Format
      will adopt an informal register
      may adopt the email format (“To” and “Subject”).

     N.B. Some limited use of textese (eg 4 for four/for and u for you) and/or emoticons is
     permissible.

                                         SECTION B

6.   Personal response

     It is often thought that in order to succeed today, all young people must work in the city
     rather than in the country.

     A good answer:

     Criterion B – Argument
      will address the issue of young people deciding where to work; scripts which do not
       address this issue should be marked down under “relevance”
      will make the candidate’s viewpoint clear: the candidate may write a balanced argument or
       a polemic, an analytic approach etc
      will provide clear, coherent and detailed reasons for the candidate’s viewpoint/s
      may take unexpected, creative approaches, provided that there is a link to the key point in
       the stimulus
      may personalize the issue by providing examples drawn from the candidate’s own
       experience; this should be rewarded.
