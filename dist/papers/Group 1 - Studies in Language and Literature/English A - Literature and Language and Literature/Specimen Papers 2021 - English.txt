1.

                                                         Act one

          3 p.m. Saturday.

          The open plan living room of a modern executive-style house. Archways leading off to the
          kitchen and back doors. Another to the front door and bedrooms etc. Primarily furnished with
          English Swedish style furniture. A lot of wrought iron for gates in lieu of doors and as used for
      5   room dividers. Also artistic frosted glass. Doubtful pictures. Possibly a bar. It all cost a great deal
          of money. Parquet floor with rugs.

          At the start, EVELYN, a heavily made-up, reasonably trendily dressed, expressionless girl, is
          sitting by a pram which she is rocking absently with one hand whilst gazing blankly out of the
          window. Near her, on the table, underneath suitable coverings, tea is laid out in the form of
     10   sandwiches and cakes. Only the teapot and hot water jug are missing. EVELYN chews and
          sings to herself.

          After a moment, DIANA enters. She is older, mid to later thirties. She always gives the
          impression of being slightly fraught. She smiles occasionally, but it’s painful. Her sharp darting
          eyes don’t miss much after years of suspicions both genuine and unfounded.

     15   diana: Have you got him to sleep?
          evelyn: Yes.
          diana [looking into the pram]: Aaah! They look so lovely like that. Like little cherubims.
          evelyn [unenthusiastic]: Mmm.
          diana: Just like little cherubims. [Anxious.] Should he be covered up as much as that, dear?
     20   evelyn: Yes.
          diana: Won’t he get too hot?
          evelyn: He likes it hot.
          diana: Oh. I was just worried he wasn’t getting enough air.
          evelyn: He’s all right. He doesn’t need much air.
     25   diana: Oh well… [She looks about her.] Well, I think we’re all ready for them. John’s on his way,
               you say?
          evelyn: Yes.
          diana: How is he these days? I haven’t seen John for ages.
          evelyn: He’s all right.
     30   diana: I haven’t seen either of you.
          evelyn: We’re all right.
          diana: Not for ages. Well, I’m glad you could come this afternoon. Colin will really appreciate
               that, I’m sure. Seeing us all.
                      [Pause.]
     35        Paul should be home again soon. I think he’s playing his squash again.
          evelyn: Oh.
          diana: Him and his squash. It used to be tennis – now he’s squash mad. Squash, squash,
               squash. Can’t see what he sees in it. All afternoon hitting a ball against a wall. It’s so
               noisy. Bang, bang, bang. He’s not even out of doors. No fresh air at all. It can’t be good for
     40        him. Does John play squash?
          evelyn: No.
          diana: Oh.

         evelyn: He doesn’t play anything.
         diana: Oh, well. He probably doesn’t need it. Exercise. Some men don’t. My father never took a
45            stroke of exercise. Till he died. He seemed fit enough. He managed to do what he wanted
              to do. Mind you, he never did very much. He just used to sit and shout at we girls. Most of
              the time. He got calmer though when he got older. After my mother left him. [Looking into
              the pram.] Did you knit that little jacket for him?
         evelyn: No.

                                                                  Alan Ayckbourn, Absent Friends (1975)

Write a guided analysis of the following text.

2.

In the following extract from a travelogue, the author has travelled out of the city of Cairo and into the
desert.



                     It was a canyon of great promise. The cliffs were three hundred or more feet high and rose
              in a concave curve to an abrupt crumbly steepness at the top. They looked impossible to climb.
              I was cowed by the canyon’s vastness, content at first to leap from boulder to boulder along its
              rocky bottom. There were plants but no trees, gravel slides, rounded hillocks of shale and side
     5        wadis* winding into rocky clefts in the canyon walls. The air was brilliantly clear. Bright blue
              sky in front and, when I turned to look back, the city squatting under a foggy haze. You could
              actually see the start of the smog, worryingly near the place where my kids’ school was, but as I
              walked up the canyon I turned my back on it.
                     In the ultra-clear air of the desert you can see as far as you want to. Small details are
     10       visible far away. A falcon floating in the distance above the canyon top was like an inkstroke, a
              precise piece of calligraphy.
                     There were two ruined blockhouses in the wadi, remnants of its time as a military
              training area. These became my landmarks. I would reach them quickly and decide where to
              explore. On the ground I found fossils but no stone tools. I followed a path up a rocky defile
     15       and rediscovered the pleasure of hauling myself up short boulder-faces. Each sub-wadi was a
              series of steps that water had once poured down. They looked unclimbable but up close there
              was almost always a way. Under the cliffs were animal tracks and burrows but for days I saw no
              animals, only birds including the black and white wheatear, the zerzur, after which Zerzura had
              been named. At the top of the side wadi I was on the plain, flat and gravelly. In the far distance
     20       were new tower blocks being built. Ahead it was clear to the horizon and behind, in the hollow of
              the Nile valley, lay Cairo under its pall of greyness.
                     I had been keen on rock-climbing when I was younger, but it had been years since I
              had done any. I was surprised to find I’d become trepidatious about heights, nervous about
              scrambling up shale cliffs. Slowly, I regained the old skills needed, not pausing too long on a
     25       hand- or foothold, not thinking too much, just moving upwards. Instead of seeing unclimbable
              vertiginous cliffs I began to see routes, ways up and out of the canyon. I deliberately sighted
              up a possible route and found my way quite easily to the very top edge. The drop made me
              keep clear of the edge, gave my knees a slight wobble. Looking across the canyon, which was
              maybe a half-kilometre wide, the plains on the other side stretched away to hills marked only
     30       by a distant radio tower. Coming down the same way I saw my first desert fox, not a big-eared
              fennec, but a red fox. I sat still and watched it as it watched me. The time spent watching in the
              cool, clear high-up air was like an inner breath of some neglected part of me, which neutralized
              the heavy sense of self, made me transparent again.

 adopté un autre angle technique ou formel doivent être récompensées de manière appropriée,
 conformément aux critères d’évaluation.

  the difference in amount of dialogue attributed to both characters and the crisp or
   monosyllabic statements of Evelyn in contrast to Diana’s longer speeches
  the specific choices of diction, and how they indicate a potentially complex relationship
   between the characters
  two characters’ portrayal of their partners
  the humour in the passage and the techniques used to create it – eg use of props, stage
   business
  the tension in the passage and the various means by which it is created
  the effectiveness of the text as an introduction to a play.

                                                             almost everywhere—including Europe
                                                             and the U.S. Slaves are forced to work,
                                                             without pay, under the threat of violence.

          Slavery Is Everywhere
          There are tens of millions of people trapped in various forms of slavery throughout the world
          today. Researchers estimate that 40 million are enslaved worldwide, generating $150 billion
          each year in illicit profits for traffickers.
      5   yy Labor Slavery. About 50 percent toil in forced labor slavery in industries where manual labor
             is needed—such as farming, ranching, logging, mining, fishing, and brick making—and in
             service industries working as dish washers, janitors, gardeners, and maids.
          yy Sex Slavery. About 12.5 percent are trapped in forced prostitution sex slavery.
          yy Forced Marriage Slavery. About 37.5 percent are trapped in forced marriages.
     10   yy Child Slavery. About 25 percent of today’s slaves are children.

          Slavery today is a hidden crime, making it harder for the public to see and for those in slavery to
          call out for help.

          Slavery statistics come from the U.N. International Labor Organization, Walk Free and the
          International Organization for Migration. See our Trafficking and Slavery Fact Sheet for details.

     15   The Rise of Modern Slavery
          Slavery has existed for thousands of years, but economic and social forces have enabled its
          alarming resurgence in the past few decades by increasing people’s vulnerability.
          yy Population: A population explosion has tripled the number of people in the world, mostly in
             developing countries. In many places, the population has grown faster than the economy,
     20      leaving many people economically vulnerable. A fire, flood, drought, or medical emergency
             places them in the hands of ruthless moneylenders who enslave them.
                                                     –3–               SPEC/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

            yy Migration: Millions are on the move from impoverished rural areas to cities, and from poorer
               countries to wealthier ones, in search of work. Traffickers
               are able to trick them by posing as legitimate labor
   25          recruiters. Migrants are especially vulnerable—they are
               often very far from home, don’t speak the local language,
               have no funds to return home, and have no friends or
               family to rely on.
            yy Corruption: Global government corruption often allows
   30          slavery to go unpunished. Many law enforcement officials
               aren’t even aware that bonded labor, where someone
               is enslaved to work off a loan, is illegal. In many places,
               those in slavery have no police protection from predatory   Free the Slaves books and videos
               traffickers.                                                are great tools to learn about
   35       yy Discrimination: Social inequality creates widespread        slavery's global resurgence and
                                                                           prompt discussions at book clubs
               economic and social vulnerability based on factors such     and campus or church events.
               as gender, race, tribe, or caste.

            Modern Slaves Are Cheap and Disposable
            New slavery has two chief characteristics—it’s cheap and it’s disposable. Slaves today are
   40       cheaper than ever. In 1850, an average slave in the American South cost the equivalent of
            $40,000 in today’s money. Today a slave costs about $90 on average worldwide. (Source:
            Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy. See all Free the Slaves* books.)
            Modern slaves are not considered investments worth maintaining. In the 19th century it was
            difficult to capture slaves and transport them to the United States. But today, when someone in
   45       slavery gets sick or injured, they are simply dumped or killed.

            You are Connected to Slavery, and You Can Cure It
            Slavery flows into our homes, offices, and schools through many of the products we buy. Many
            food products and raw materials are tainted by slavery—such as tomatoes, tuna, shrimp, cotton,
            diamonds, iron, sugar, and gold.
   50       There was a time when slavery was legal, and people considered it morally acceptable and
            economically essential. The battle to build a global consensus that slavery is unjust and
            unneeded has been won. Now we need to finish the job by freeing those still trapped in
            bondage.
            See our Take Action section for ideas to mobilize your family, friends, classmates, co-workers,
   55       and faith community.

            Modern Slaves Are Cheap and Disposable
            New slavery has two chief characteristics—it’s cheap and it’s disposable. Slaves today are
   40       cheaper than ever. In 1850, an average slave in the American South cost the equivalent of
            $40,000 in today’s money. Today a slave costs about $90 on average worldwide. (Source:
            Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy. See all Free the Slaves* books.)
            Modern slaves are not considered investments worth maintaining. In the 19th century it was
            difficult to capture slaves and transport them to the United States. But today, when someone in
   45       slavery gets sick or injured, they are simply dumped or killed.

            You are Connected to Slavery, and You Can Cure It
            Slavery flows into our homes, offices, and schools through many of the products we buy. Many
            food products and raw materials are tainted by slavery—such as tomatoes, tuna, shrimp, cotton,
            diamonds, iron, sugar, and gold.
   50       There was a time when slavery was legal, and people considered it morally acceptable and
            economically essential. The battle to build a global consensus that slavery is unjust and
            unneeded has been won. Now we need to finish the job by freeing those still trapped in
            bondage.

1.   How do two of the works you have studied portray the struggle to be understood?


2.   Some literary texts, although set in a particular place or time, convey ideas that are universal.
     In what ways is this true in two of the works you have studied?


3.   Discuss how two works you have studied present concepts of good and bad, not as absolute
     notions, but as a matter of individual perception.


4.   Referring to two works you have studied, discuss how the author has created a convincing “world”.
