Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Mathilde delivers books to five libraries, A, B, C, D and E. She starts her deliveries at
     library D and travels to each of the other libraries once, before returning to library D.
     Mathilde wishes to keep her travelling distance to a minimum.

     The weighted graph H , representing the distances, measured in kilometres, between the
     five libraries, has the following table.


                                           A      B      C     D      E

                                     B     18     –     15     22    17

                                     C     19     15     –     20    17

     (a)   Draw the weighted graph H .                                                                [2]

     (b)   Starting at library D use the nearest-neighbour algorithm, to find an upper bound for
           Mathilde’s minimum travelling distance. Indicate clearly the order in which the edges
           are selected.                                                                              [5]

     (c)   By first removing library C, use the deleted vertex algorithm, to find a lower bound for
           Mathilde’s minimum travelling distance.                                                    [4]

     Consider the recurrence relation

                                un = 5un-1 -6un-2 , u0 = 0 and u1 = 1 .

     (a)   Find an expression for un in terms of n .                                                  [6]

     (b)   For every prime number p > 3 , show that p | up-1 .                                        [4]

     (a)   (i)    Draw the complete bipartite graph κ3,3 .

		         (ii)   Prove that κ3,3 is not planar.                                                        [5]

     (b)   A connected graph G has v vertices. Prove, using Euler’s relation, that a spanning
           tree for G has v - 1 edges.                                                                  [2]

     Consider κn , a complete graph with n vertices, n ≥ 2 . Let T be a fixed spanning tree of κn .

     (c)   If an edge E is chosen at random from the edges of κn , show that the probability that
                                        2
           E belongs to T is equal to     .                                                             [4]

     Consider the system of linear congruences

                                              x ≡ 2(mod 5)
                                              x ≡ 5(mod 8)

     (a)   With reference to the integers 5, 8 and 3, state why the Chinese remainder theorem
           guarantees a unique solution modulo 120 to this system of linear congruences.                [2]

     (b)   Hence or otherwise, find the general solution to the above system of linear
           congruences.                                                                                 [7]
