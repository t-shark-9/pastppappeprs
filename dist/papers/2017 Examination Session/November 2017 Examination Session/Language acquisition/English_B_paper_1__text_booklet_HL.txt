                          Create your new noise:
                     use radio adverts to target teens
         We are New Noise Audio, a UK-based music production house
         who specialise in producing high quality, bespoke music for
         radio, television and online campaigns worldwide.

         As the autumn sets in, one thing is on the minds of young teens
 5       – GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. Many higher education institutions
         are trying to capture the minds of those teenagers and young
         adults who aren’t quite sure about which path to take in terms of
         studying and careers, so they are approaching us to help them
         with their advertising campaigns.

10       Does radio advertising still work?

         Due to a reported decrease in the percentage of radio listening ﬁgures for 16–24 year
         olds, many businesses nowadays are of the opinion that it’s not worth advertising to
         teenagers. However, these reports also show that radio advertising targeting teenagers
         does work. It is still a proven method of attracting new business, and we’ve found that
15       advertising higher education places is a good way of reaching potential attendees.

         Consider the numbers:

         UK Government statistics show that young adults between the ages of 16–24 are still
         listening to at least 1 hour of radio on average every day, demonstrating that there is
         still a market to reach. The UK Government ﬁgures also show that 16–24 year olds are
20       using computers in their spare time for around 3 and a half hours a day. At the same
         time, the popularity of streaming AM/FM radio stations online among this group is also
         increasing in the UK.

         This phenomenon seems to be international: US-based research centre Edison showed
         that 13–17 year olds in the United States are dedicating around 53 minutes of listening
25       time per day to AM/FM radio stations.

         Yes, there are reports of its decline, but an hour of listening time is still there for
         the taking. In the UK, that is equivalent to approximately 4 to 5 radio advert breaks.

         Our approach at New Noise Audio

         When it comes to creating a higher education radio commercial, we always advise
30       appealing to the parent as well as the teenager, as it’s usually the parent who has the
         last say on where the teenager attends college or university.

         In the UK, in the run up to the beginning of the academic year, thousands of students
         will be searching for places at higher education institutions. Short radio advertisement
         campaigns concentrated around this time will bring brand awareness to students who
35       need it now and in the future.

            People judge you on two criteria says Harvard
                           psychologist
         People size you up in seconds, but what exactly are they
         evaluating?

         In her new book, Presence, Harvard Business School professor
         Amy Cuddy explores how to feel more confident. She says                 Removed for copyright
 5       people quickly answer two questions when they first meet you:                reasons
         • Can I trust this person?
         • Can I respect this person?

         Psychologists refer to these dimensions as warmth and
         competence respectively, and ideally you want to be perceived as having both.

10       Interestingly, Cuddy says that most people, especially in a professional context, believe that
         competence is the more important factor. After all, they want to prove that they are smart and
         talented enough to handle your business.

         But in fact warmth, or trustworthiness, is the most important factor in how people evaluate
         you. “From an evolutionary perspective,” Cuddy says, “it is more crucial to our survival to know
15       whether a person deserves our trust.”

         While respect is highly valued, Cuddy says it is evaluated only after trust is established.
         And focusing too much on displaying it can backfire.

         It makes sense when you consider that in cavemen days it was more important to figure out if
         your fellow man was going to kill you and steal all your possessions than if he was competent
20       enough to build a good fire.

         Cuddy says that MBA* interns seeking full-time employment within a company are often
         so concerned about coming across as smart and competent that, as a result, they tend
         to skip social events, not ask their colleagues for help, and consequently they then seem
         unapproachable.

25       These potential employees are in for a rude awakening when they don’t get “the big one”
         because nobody got to know and trust them as people.

         “[ – X – ]  someone you’re trying to influence doesn’t trust you,  [ – 50 – ]  you’re not going to get
         very far.  [ – 51 – ], you might even elicit suspicion  [ – 52 – ]  you come across as manipulative,”
         Cuddy says.

30       “A warm, trustworthy person who is also strong can elicit admiration.  [ – 53 – ]  only after you
         have established trust does your strength become a gift rather than a threat.”
