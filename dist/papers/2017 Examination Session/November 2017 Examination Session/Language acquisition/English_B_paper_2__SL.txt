Complete one of the following tasks. Write 250 to 400 words.

1.   Cultural diversity

     Your English teacher has set the following question as your next essay assignment: “In our modern
     world, are national borders still relevant?” Write the essay.


2.   Customs and traditions

     You are currently living in an English-speaking country and your local newspaper has published an
     article in support of a custom or tradition of the country that you do not agree with. Write a letter to
     the editor, explaining why you do not agree, and what alternative custom or tradition could take its
     place.


3.   Health

     A local newspaper report alerted the people of your town that there has been an outbreak of
     an infectious disease. You are worried about this news. Write a leaflet for your fellow students
     drawing attention to the dangerous effects of this disease and suggesting how they can protect
     both themselves and others from it.


4.   Leisure

     You are very enthusiastic about your hobby and have been invited to give a talk about it to other
     students at your school. In your talk, describe how this hobby has contributed to your personal
     development and why you would encourage others to also take up this hobby. Write the text of
     your talk.


5.   Science and technology

     Your science teacher has challenged your class to live without watching television or using mobile
     devices and computers for a week. Now that the week is completed, write a report for your
     teacher, describing the ways in which this challenge affected your daily life, and what you have
     learned from this experience.
