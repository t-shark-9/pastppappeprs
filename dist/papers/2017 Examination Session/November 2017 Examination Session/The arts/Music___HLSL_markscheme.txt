General comment to examiners
Please note that the markscheme is provided as guidance for marking. There are many potential and
valid ways in which to approach the questions and examiners need, therefore, to use their judgment
when attributing marks to a candidate’s answers.

Each question is worth [20 marks].

                                              Section A
This criterion concerns the candidate’s ability to:
• question 1 or question 2 – analyse and examine essential musical elements (including form and
  structure) within one of the two prescribed works
• question 3 (HL only) – compare and contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing the presence of
   any significant musical links.

Marks      Level descriptor
  0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
          The answers, which generally do not address the question, show a minimal level of
          musical understanding. There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly
          located, or none at all. There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.
          The answers, which generally do not address the question, […]
          There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response consists mostly
          of generalizations or poorly substantiated assertions.
          […] show a minimal level of musical understanding.
          The response relays irrelevant knowledge, or inaccurately applies remembered content.
  1–4     There is limited use of musical evidence, though this is poorly located, or none at all.
          Musical evidence is never or rarely used. When evidence is given, it is inaccurate, superficial
          and imprecise with regards to bar/measure number(s), rehearsal number(s) and/or
          instrument(s).
          There is limited use of musical terminology or none at all.
          The responses communicate without the use of musical terminology, or where musical
          terminology is applied, it is generally not relevant and/or inaccurate. However, a rudimentary
          understanding of terminology in relation to the material/topic in question may surface on
          occasion.

       The answers, which may not always address the question, show some level of musical
       understanding. There is some use of musical evidence, though this is not located
       precisely enough. There is some use of musical terminology.
       The answers, which may not always address the question, […]
       The response indicates an understanding of the question, but only partially addresses it.
       The response is narrative and/or descriptive in nature.
       The answers show some level of musical understanding.
       The response contains some prior knowledge, but demonstrates merely recall of
5–8    information, rather than application of prior knowledge and engagement with the question
       through reasoned discussion and evaluation.
       There is some use of musical evidence, though this is not located precisely enough.
       Musical evidence is presented on occasion, but used without explanation or not relevant to
       the question under discussion. Where musical evidence is given, it is imprecise with
       regards to bar/measure number(s), rehearsal number(s) and/or instrument(s).
       There is some use of musical terminology.
       Musical terminology is applied and on occasion is relevant and appropriate with regards to
       the material under discussion, while there is also some inaccurate use of terminology
       and/or vague statements.
       The answers, which generally address the question, show an adequate level of musical
       understanding. There is use of musical evidence, though this is not always precisely located.
       There is partially effective use of musical terminology.
       The answers, which generally address the question, […]
       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question. The response
       contains some critical discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc. However, answers
       lack clarity and development.
       […] show an adequate level of musical understanding.
       The response appropriately applies and sometimes explains prior knowledge in relation to
9–12   the question and the material under discussion.
       There is use of musical evidence, though this is not always precisely located.
       Throughout the answer musical evidence is used, which is sometimes, but not consistently,
       accurate, relevant and explained in relation to the question. Evidence is sometimes, but not
       consistently, located by using bar/measure number(s), rehearsal number(s) and/or
       instrument(s).
       There is partially effective use of musical terminology.
       The use of musical terminology is mostly relevant and accurate, but does not consistently
       support the discussion, analysis, evaluation, examination, etc. Critical terminology is
       appropriately used, although some may be ignored or unaccounted for.

Note: The following indicative content is for guidance only, and by no means meant to suggest that
candidates should be marked according to the extent that their answer resembles these suggestions.
It is quite possible for candidates to come up with good responses other than these, which should be
credited accordingly.

Examiners may find the following resources helpful:

Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach
Various editions of the score are available online for free download, eg at:

http://imslp.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Concerto_No.2_in_F_major,_BWV_1047_(Bach,_Johann_Sebastian)


Dances of Galánta by Zoltán Kodály

The score of the work is still in copyright and no free download versions as such are available, but a
digital copy of the score used by André Kastelanitz when conducting the New Philharmonic is available
(for viewing, not printing) at:

http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/artifact/db9cbad7-6e9c-4dc1-bc81-08439b597b11

Note: Examiners should be aware that there is an error in the bar/measure numbering of Dances of
Galánta. The indication for bar/measure 95 has actually been placed in bar 96, and all numbers
following this are one lower than they should be. Some candidates will have been alerted to this by their
teachers, but others will not, and will simply use the bar/measure numbers given in good faith. We have
therefore decided to accept both possibilities, and examiners will need to remember that the bar
numbers provided by some candidates may be one more than those given in the score. As these differ
only by one bar/measure, however, it should be easy to distinguish such “adjustments” of the numbering
from actual errors in location.

1.   Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach
     Analyse how Bach uses the principles of concerto grosso in the first movement of Brandenburg
     Concerto No 2 in F major.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     The two most obvious concerto grosso principles to consider are (i) textural/timbral: the contrast
     between the soloist/concertino group and the ripieno; and (ii) structural: aspects of Vivaldi-like
     ritornello form. The opening section of the movement up to bar 30 provides perhaps the clearest
     illustration of both, with (i) relatively clear alternations between tutti passages (shown in bold
     below) and various combinations of solo forces, and (ii) clear thematic distinctions between
     ritornelli (R1, R2 etc) of various lengths and episodes (E1, E2 etc.), as shown in the table below:

      Bar/             Formal        Key       Instrumentation              Remarks
      measure          type

      9                E1            F         Vln solo, continuo

                                               continuo

      21               E4            C         Tr/ob soli,                  Based on E1
                                               continuo
      23               R5            C         Soloists + ripieno           Based on R1 (b. 3 onwards)
      29               E5            F         All 4 soloists, continuo     Based on E1

     The end of the movement from b. 103 onwards also brings back a clear statement of the opening
     ritornello in the original key, albeit interrupted by an interpolation of material from the middle of the
     movement (first heard in b. 50). Between these outer sections, however, things get rather more
     complicated. There is one other clear passage of “episode” material played by the concertino
     group (bb. 60–67), but for the rest the distinction between solo and ripieno becomes blurred – with
     all instruments participating continuously in the musical discourse – and the thematic motifs are
     almost exclusively derived from the ritornello material, with little further reference to the “episode”
     sections. As Martin Boyd puts it: “The participation of the ripieno instruments is so thorough-going
     that it becomes no longer possible to attempt an analysis in terms of ritornello-episode or tutti-
     solo.”

Most candidates are likely to be able to identify some of more obvious concerto grosso features
described above, and those aware of the historical context may note specific aspects of Bach’s use
of them – eg, the way the differing lengths of the ritornello theme echo Vivaldi’s general practice,
while the more heterogenous solo group departs from it. Stronger candidates, however, will be
aware of the ways in which the work also departs structurally and thematically from concerto
grosso practice, and illustrate their answer with relevant passages from the main body of the
movement.

It should however be pointed out that, despite the obstacles the work places in the way of a
straightforward ritornello-form analysis, this has nevertheless been attempted, and obviously some
candidates may draw on such a pre-existent analysis in their answer. For reference purposes,
therefore, one such analysis of the remainder of the movement – based on Siegbert Rampe’s – is
appended below. Although it should be stressed here that (to quote the standard Section B rubric):
There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this extract. Here is one of them:

     For reference purposes, the opening ritornello theme (bars 1–8) is shown below:

2.   Dances of Galánta by Zoltán Kodály
     Discuss how the theme introduced from bar/measure 50 (andante maestoso) of The Dances of
     Galánta is treated in the rest of the work. Your discussion may include (but is not limited to) such
     musical features as rhythm, melody, harmony, texture and orchestration.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     There is a wealth of material to choose from here, and there are various ways in which candidates
     might structure their discussion of it. As a means of introducing their answer candidates may
     choose to describe the transition into the theme of the Andante maestoso at bar/measure 50 by
     referring to the conclusion of the embellished clarinet cadenza in bar/measure 49 with a simple
     statement of an E minor scale.

     The theme introduced at bar/measure 50 is the principal thematic material of a five-part rondo
     (bars/measures 50–235), and is also brought back by Kodály near the end of the second section of
     the work (566–572).

Example 1 – Zoltán Kodály, Dances of Galánta, bars/measures 50–65:




The following, which gives examples of the way the thematic material (or theme) introduced at
bar/measure 50 (Andante maestoso) of The Dances of Galánta is treated in the rest of the work,
is intended simply as a convenient reference guide, and is in no way intended to suggest a model
answer, or provide a full-scale analysis. However, the question does at least require a response to
the treatment of thematic material, which invites thinking about how Kodály has treated the
thematic material introduced at bar/measure 50 in the rest of the work.

Theme (bb. 50–65)

Part I (bb. 50–57)
E minor (ending on dominant), solo clarinet + strings and horns
• The theme of a five-part rondo is introduced by the first clarinet in bar/measure 50 accompanied
  by the rest of the orchestra in E minor. This theme appears several times throughout the work
  and is separated by episodes inspired by Hungarian folk music. The theme is split into two
  8–bar sections/phrases. In the first statement of the theme the accompaniment is thinly scored
  so that it does not obscure the melody. Yet, it is more insistent than a simple, homophonic
  progression.
• From bars/measures 50–55 the violin and the viola set up an off-beat accompaniment
  characteristic of the verbunkos style with the cello and double bass providing the downbeat at
  the beginning of each bar/measure together with a pedal note on E in the third and fourth horns.
  The strings play a chord of E minor for 3 bars/measures and then progress towards the
  dominant, B in b. 57.
• At bar/measure 56 the violin and viola further accentuate the verbunkos style through the use of
  a rising syncopated rhythm, emphasising the major tonality but the final chord of bar/measure
  58 beat 4 acts like a dominant chord propelling the melody into D major. This is enhanced by a
  brooding crescendo leading to an abrupt accent on the fourth beat of bar/measure 57.
                                            – 11 –              N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Part 2 (bb. 58–65)
D majorA minor (ending on dominant), solo clarinet + strings and horns
• The second half of the melody, bars/measures 58–65, makes further use of Scotch snaps and
  in bars/measures 58–61 the violin, viola, cello and double bass reinstate their earlier
  accompaniment figure but it is two bars shorter; the pedal in the horns is replaced by a fleeting
  countermelody by the first bassoon (bars/measures 60–63 doubled by the cello at bar/measure
  62–63) and the cellos and double bass move by leaps of fourths and fifths rather than by step,
  suggesting the use of a circle of fifths. The chords played in the string parts are less
  conventional, with the use of suspension in bar 58 in the violin; in bar 59 the chord above the
  bass note is a major augmented 5th chord and in bar/measure 61 it is an F major 7th.
• At bars/measures 62 the violin and viola introduce a simple 2-bar/measure accented, off-beat
  rhythmic accompaniment on beats 2 and 4, before revisiting the syncopated idea used at
  bars/measures 56–57 to support the conclusion of the introductory statement of the theme by
  the clarinet at bars/measures 65 beat 3.

First restatement: bb. 66–93

Part 1 (bb. 66–73)
A minor, melody in upper strings and woodwind, accompaniment in lower strings, horns, clarinets
• The principal theme is then played again with a lead-in by first flute, second clarinet, first and
  second violin and viola.
• Texture is different in bars/measures 66–73 to the original statement of the theme in
  bar/measure 50. The flute, second clarinet, first and second violin and viola have the melody.
• The rhythm of the horn chords in bars/measures 66–69 uses a syncopated figure giving a sense
  of drive before going into an off-beat rhythm in bar/measure 70 reminiscent of the in
  bar/measure 63.
• In bars/measure 66–69 the oboes introduce a grace note embellished chord before taking up
  the melody in bar/measure 70 as the second clarinet drops out and joins the first clarinet on a
  pedal chord.

Part 2 (varied), bb. 74–81
G major[dominant preparation for C], melody in violin I, clarinet 1, cello, accompaniment in
remaining strings, horns, woodwind
• First four bars of melody are essentially transposition (up a fourth) of bb. 58–61 (with the Scotch
  snap in the last bar evened out), but then two new ideas are introduced – a twice-repeated
  figure revolving round E-flat (b. 78), and an expressive figure in even quavers/eighth notes
  (b. 79) – before the phrase ends with the repeated notes of 72–73 transposed down a major
  second.
• Melody is transferred to violin I, clarinet I, cello; rest of strings, woodwinds (minus flutes) and
  horns provide chordal accompaniment
• Begins on D major (as dominant of G) and ends with dominant preparation for C major.

Part 2 (varied), bb. 82–93
C majorG (as dominant of C minor), melody in lower strings and woodwind, accompaniment in
higher strings, woodwind, bass
• In bars/measures 82 to the end of the section at bar/measure 93, Kodály creates a different
   texture, in which the bass and second bassoon play bass notes alternating with off-beats from
   the flutes and, at the same time, the violins play chords in a Scotch snap rhythm, while the
   clarinet, first bassoon, viola and cello play an expanded version of the second part of the
   principal theme.
• Theme in bars 82–84 is subjected to only minor changes (b. 83), but b. 85 then reintroduces the
   material of b. 53 (transposed), while in b. 86 a variant of b. 64 is followed by a descending
   scalar figure in the next bar and, in b. 88, by an extended passage based on b. 86 revolving
   round G and D. Chords of A-flat major, F minor and G major above this give a strong sense of
   a dominant preparation in a harmonic minor/“Gypsy” mode.

Second restatement – Bar/Measure 151–172

Part 1 (bb. 151–158)
A minor, melody in octaves in higher strings and woodwind, accompaniment in lower wind and
strings, horns and timpani
• The second restatement of the principal theme of the Andante maestoso returns to the key of A
    minor.
• Unlike the original statement the full orchestra play here, accompanied by the horns using the
    syncopated rhythmic figure used in bars/measures 66–69, although now extended to six
    bars/measures long. The harmony presented by the horns contrasts with the strong down beat
    of the cello and bass accompaniment and the timpani rolls.
• The melody appears in unison played by the upper strings and wind instruments minus
    bassoon.
• The texture is quite simple with only three different elements.
• There is a slight variation in the melody with the addition of two sixteenth notes in the rhythm
    rather than the Scotch snap in the original statement and the grace note at the end of
    bar/measure 155.

Part 2 (varied) bb. 159–172
G majorwhole tone/augmented sixth chord on B-flat
• The second part of the theme is initially different in that Kodály changes the rhythm of the
  original statement from a series of eighth notes to a dotted quarter note/crotchet followed by a
  triplet. The syncopated pattern in the horns is now replaced by pulsing eighth notes.
• From b. 163 the theme begins to depart from the original version more radically. Kodály
  reintroduces the material of b. 78, repeats it a third higher, and follows this with a rhythmically
  more active variant of b. 79, which then settles down to a version of the repeated-note figure
  from bb. 80–81.
• The material of bb. 163–164 is then repeated (transposed) by violin II and cello, again landing
  on a figure centred on D over a whole-tone harmony in bb. 169–172.
                                            – 13 –              N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Third restatement – Bars/Measures 229–235

Full orchestra, modal melodic line (similar to F melodic minor + C-sharp)
• The third restatement of the theme is only seven bars/measures long
• The melody appears rhythmically altered from the original statement in the upper strings, cello,
   first flute, first and second oboe and first and second clarinet, accompanied by an off-beat
   rhythmic pattern in the horns and trumpets over rolled timpani on pedal B-flat.
• The theme is also altered modally to fit in with the underlying B-flat dominant harmony. The
   texture is further simplified in bar/measure 232, where the accompaniment drops out, before the
   melody passes to the lower instruments in b. 233. In the final two bars of this section the
   clarinets, first bassoon, viola and cello play a more extended version of the material from b. 79
   in unison, slowly working their way down to a pause on D.

Final restatement – Bars/measures 566–572

G# minor, flute/oboe/clarinet solos + tremolo strings
• The principal theme re-enters as a real contrast to the accelerando in the second section of the
  work. The furiously accelerated mood of the piece is abruptly halted as the principal theme
  returns.
• The melody rings out above the shimmering accompaniment in the strings and begins with a G#
  minor triad.
• Melody is presented by the flute, then passed to the oboe in bar/measure 569 before the
  clarinet takes over at bar/measure 571, taking the theme towards another scalar cadenza.
• Melody essentially follows the same basic overall contour as when originally stated in b. 50
  (initial notes of phrases gradually fall by thirds), though it is rhythmically changed, becoming
  especially more active towards the end as the cadenza approaches.
• It has been suggested that this section functions as linking material between the coda and the
  principal thematic material which has been absent for much of the second half of the piece.

Note: although it is not an essential requirement for study of the piece, some candidates may be
aware of the nineteenth-century piano versions of Hungarian dance/folk melodies which Kodály
used as a basis, and might argue that the “treatment” of the theme includes the changes made to
his source material. In fact the question is quite explicitly asking about the treatment of the theme
in the rest of the work, and examiners will have to use their own judgement as to how successfully
any such candidate has argued for the inclusion of this material. In case such responses should
arise, the original version of the melody has been given for reference purposes below.

3.   Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach and Dances of Galánta
     by Zoltán Kodály
     Compare and contrast the melodic characteristics of the prescribed works, emphasizing any
     significant musical links.

     (HL only)

     The answers should refer to the prescribed works.

     Answers should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding, and should
     be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     The comparing and contrasting of significant musical links must focus on melodic characteristics.

     Candidates have a multitude of possible examples and comparisons to choose from here, and it is
     impossible to predict all the likely forms their responses might take. The examples that follow are
     therefore designed simply to give examiners some sense of the types of melodic features
     candidates might fruitfully explore, and are certainly not intended to provide a kind of ‘checklist’
     against which their performance should be measured.

     Obviously the melodic character of the two works is a reflection not only of their historical period
     but also of their purpose and intended audience. Kodály’s work is a 20th century score for concert
     hall performance before a large public, based around a sequence of dance melodies deriving from
     Hungarian folk sources, and its main emphasis is on showcasing these melodies rather than
     offering elaborate, sustained musical discourse. Bach’s 18th–century concerto is a more intimate
     and “learned” work for aristocratic and (in part) informed listeners, in which melodies are
     consciously constructed from motifs and subjected to intensive development throughout.
     Nevertheless, the melodic characters of the two pieces reveal a surprising number of similarities as
     well as differences in various aspects:
                                            – 15 –              N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Melodic construction
• With some exceptions (eg, b. 1ff), Kodály’s folk-derived melodies are generally closed forms in
  themselves, lasting for several bars and built up from a number of balancing phrases (eg, 50ff,
  16 bars, 8 x 2). Bach also occasionally presents themes of this kind, eg, the opening ritornello
  of I (8 bars, 2 x 4).
• However, these kinds of extended, closed melodic forms are rarer in Bach’s case. The melody
  of the second movement, for example, is mostly a continuous flow of 2-bar units repeated in
  different instruments, often imitatively, with occasional cadence points.
• Phrase lengths melodies in both works are generally regular (mostly multiples of 2), but
  Kodály’s work contains some irregular examples, eg, the two phrases of the melody at 96ff (7 +
  5½ bars).
• Repetition is found in the melodic material of both composers, whether of short motifs (eg,
  Bach I, 36–37 and the rather similar “turning” figure at Kodály 377ff) or of longer sections (eg,
  Bach I, bars 1–2, or Kodály 96–102 and 103–108, where the second phrase is essentially a
  repetition of the first).
• However, repetition of longer melodic phrases is more common in Kodály’s work than in Bach’s.
  Contrastingly, although internal repetition of motifs is found in Kodály’s melodies (eg, the triplet
  turning figure in b. 50), independent development of motifs outside their melodic context (as at
  b. 19ff) is rather rarer and less consistently rigorous than in Bach’s case.
• Both composers use transposed repetitions (sequences) in their melodic construction, eg,
  Bach I, b. 32ff and Kodály, b. 50ff (bb. 50–51 essentially repeated third lower in 52–53, and third
  lower still in 54–55).

Melodic contour
• Conjunct melodic movement is prevalent throughout both works, and countless examples could
  be given. The use of scalar/scalic material is particularly common (eg, Bach I, b. 4; Kodály b.
  246).
• However, the intervallic content of Kodály’s scalar passages may differ from Bach’s through use
  of modal material rather than the traditional major and minor scales – eg, the so-called “gypsy
  scale” (or harmonic minor) with its characteristic augmented second (b. 64). Kodály also uses
  scales for rhetorical embellishment – eg, the sweeping upbeat gesture at 65 – in a “Romantic”
  manner that is not found in Bach.
• More generally, the melodic contour in both works may also be influenced by the scalar types
  and attitude to tonality proper to their style and period. Eg, the movement to the dominant at
  the end of the trumpet theme at bb. 1–7 of Bach’s 3rd movement is conventional for a fugue
  subject. Conversely, the fall to A in the 5th bar of Kodály’s opening theme rather suggests a
  Dorian mode on A, pointing to the work’s folk origins.
• Larger, disjunct intervals are found in both works, and in both cases they are usually
  consonant – eg, Bach I b. 7, Kodály bb. 223–225 (perfect fifth). Usually such intervals also form
  part of the underlying harmony, and in some cases the melody is essentially an arpeggiation of
  this harmony – eg, Bach I, 50–56 (ripieno violins); Kodály 34–36 (solo clarinet). The triadic
  figures at Bach III, 34ff (solo violin) bear comparison with those at 142ff of Kodály and might
  indeed be cited as a “significant musical link”.
• More dissonant disjunct intervals occur in both works, eg, the sevenths in the recorder at
  b. 77ff of Bach I, and in the clarinet melody at b. 346 of Kodály. However the oscillating
  sevenths in the Bach example are derived from the harmony and always resolved, whereas no
  such resolution is found in the Kodály. Elsewhere in the latter (b. 169, violins) unresolved
  dissonant intervals such as diminished fifths arise in the melody through arpeggiation of a
  whole-tone harmony that would not have been available to Bach.
                                            – 16 –              N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Stylistic features
• Various kinds of ornamentation are found in both works: trills, including cadential trills (Bach II,
   64–65; Kodály 322); turns or turning figures (Kodály, 131, 349); acciacaturas (Kodály 377).
   A full comparison is nevertheless not really feasible, as in Baroque times Bach’s work would
   have been additionally embellished in performance with unscripted ornamentations; moreover,
   candidates’ editions of the score may differ in this respect.
• However, Kodály sometimes uses ornaments in isolation as a kind of standalone colouristic
   effect rather than as melodic embellishments (eg, the trills at 307, or the turns in the oboe at
   129). This device is not really used by Bach, though a similar effect to Kodály’s trills is briefly
   achieved by the trumpet’s inverted pedal at I, 31.
• Melody may be influenced by instrumental possibilities in both works. The limitations of the
   Baroque trumpet provide an obvious example in the Bach (triadic arpeggiations in the lower
   register, I, 1–2), while the fast semiquaver scalar runs at 443 onwards in the Kodály are an
   obvious emulation of gypsy violin style, and his two major clarinet cadenzas (33–49; 573–8)
   fully exploit the wide range and agility of the modern instrument.
• The type of melodic line found, eg, in the solo violin at b. 12ff of Bach I, based on an implied
   2–part texture and hovering between melody and arpeggio figuration, is not found in Kodály’s
   work.
• The type of procedure used in b. 242 of Kodály, where the basic melodic line is enriched by
   interpolated notes (“divisions”), is not found in Bach’s work.
• Some of the melodic character of Kodály’s material displays other folk-like characteristics
   (besides those mentioned above) which are not encountered in Bach’s statelier and more
   “aristocratic” style. For example, it is hard to imagine Bach using the simple repeated-note
   figures of 56–77 etc. to end phrases, or including anything akin to the melody at 443ff, with its
   “cheeky” octave leaps and acciacaturas.

It is sometimes difficult to discuss melody without mentioning other musical elements, and for
example elements of duration, harmony, texture and instrumentation all figure in places in the
above examples. Having said this, however, candidates’ discussions should still be firmly centred
around melody, and other extraneous features should only be mentioned in passing where
necessary, rather than the other way around.

     • Use of pizzicato and arco also creates timbral contrasts on individual notes rather than phrases
     • Wide dissonant intervals are frequent (eg, dim. 8ves, maj. 7ths)
     • Non-harmonic (except for harmonic intervals, eg, in the piano) but there is no harmonic basis to
       the style
     • The texture is characterised by frequent use of rests or silence as an element in its own right.

     Musical structure
     The structure can best be described in terms of the inter-relationships arising from the use of the
     series or tone row. However, the classical design in the background is evident as shown below.
     Students are not expected to undertake a thorough analysis of the use of the tone row although it
     is reasonable to expect at least some references to it and its use. (These notes are written with
     that in mind and for the benefit of the examiners, and try to reflect what might be reasonably
     expected in student responses). Identification of forms of the row may not be reasonably
     expected, although credit should be given where reference is made to them, even as a general
     observation.

     Although the movement follows the ternary design of classical sonata form, it is not actually in
     sonata form since tonality – the core of the form – is distinctly avoided.

     Importantly, the texture is canonic and development is contrapuntal rather than tonally related.

     Introduction: Bars 1–5 (00:00–00:11)
     The introduction breaks the tone-row down into 3-note segments (e.g. sax, bb. 1-2), and the
     section consists of a fragmented texture in which the instruments play short motifs answering one
     another and interlocking. Each motif is answered in its inversion as can be seen in the exchange
     between the tenor saxophone and violin in bars 1–2. The material for the movement is introduced.
     There are many rests and frequent changes of dynamic, for example from fp to sudden pp on the
     second note of tenor saxophone in bar 4. There is also frequent change of timbre by means of the
     individual entries of the instruments but also in terms of their tessitura and, for instance, use of
     arco and pizzicato in close proximity. Instrumental colour and the use of timbre are important
     features. The frequent changes of timbre are complemented by the changes of time signature.
     None the less, a regular 16th-note/semiquaver pulse is established, affected at times by ritardandi
     and a tempo markings that signal important phrase ends or beginnings.
                                            – 22 –              N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


There is also no sense of tonal centre. There is a ritardando at bar 6 which also affects a sense
of any established pulse.

Exposition: Bars 6–15/00:12–00:32 [repeated 00:33–00:53] (P and I forms of the row)
The saxophone enters a tempo with the inversion of its opening bar but the previous D-flat is
notated enharmonically as C-sharp. The saxophone has the most continuous melodic line as if it
were a form of cantus firmus (bars 6–15). Although there are no truly established tonal
relationships, there is an abundance of pitch relationship such as the tritonal relationship
between the starting C-sharp and closing G-natural in this passage.

Chords are created as in the piano (bars 12, 14 and 15), but they do not function tonally. Each
combination forms a discord such as a diminished octave or major seventh but they are played p.
The texture is like a fractured counterpoint which arises out of a core three-note motif. The form is
more like a continuous piece of Baroque counterpoint than a classical sonata. Overall, the section
is written as a mirror canon (canon by inversion) which reflects the overall principle of symmetry
also present in the work as a whole.

Development: Bars 16–27/00:54–01:24
The use of compound intervals is evident from the beginning violin leap from the high B-flat down
to its open string G pizz. The retrograde and retrograde inversion are introduced alongside the
prime form of the row. I+P can be seen in bar 16, for example; I in the saxophone part at bar 19; R
+ RI in the piano at bar 21 and in the saxophone and clarinet at bar 24. The dynamics range from
p to ff and introduce another level of extreme contrast. From bar 20, the instruments play together
in closer metrical proximity than before as though to form a musical climax which is marked with
the ff in bar 23. Webern uses dynamics partly to emphasise significant events in the structure.
Without tonality, Webern uses texture, tone colour, interval expansions/displacement from simple
to compound, close combination of parts in stretto and contrasting dynamics and rhythm. Silence
is also a significant element.

Recapitulation: Bars 28–39/01:25–02:46 (including repeat from bar 37)
Here the texture is thinner once again. As to be expected, material from the exposition and
introduction is revisited. This can be shown by comparing bar 1 with bar 28, in which the initial
interval (minor 3rd) is inverted (major 6th). The P and I forms of the row are returned to, but I
appears also in bar 39 (in the second-time bar).

Coda: Bars 40–41/02:47–02:53 (at pausa)
The coda is marked by tempo change and pauses, as though to put the brakes on a very slow
train. It is marked calando to suggest fading away (morendo), a “weakening” of pulse and a
slowing down. The final three bars include tempo changes within a short period moving from a
tempo, rit., a tempo. The final pitch is enharmonically the same as the D-flat of the beginning,
suggesting symmetry once again.

NB: The published scores may vary in how the bars are numbered.
The score used for these notes shows bars 36 and 37 as 36a and 37a and the following bars after
the repeat sign as 36b and 37b through to bar 41.

The timings are not as important for the question, which includes the score.

Musical context
• Quartet for tenor saxophone, clarinet, violin and piano.
• Chamber music, early 20th century.
• Written 1930 in the period leading to WW 2 and at a turbulent time in Vienna
• Anton von Webern (1883–1945).
• Webern was a member of the Second Viennese School of composers and pupil (disciple) of
  Arnold Schoenberg, the third pupil being Alban Berg.
• Webern’s use of atonal serialism created music of brevity and detailed expressiveness. His
  adoption of certain contrapuntal forms and practices arose from his study of medieval music
  (Flemish) and the Ars Nova.
• Webern’s style as represented here can be called “pointillist” after painters such as Seurat.
  Linked to that style is the use of Klangfarbenmelodie, in which individual notes of a melodic line
  are individually coloured instrumentally rather than entire phrases, as is more traditional.
• Webern’s music represents a response to Schoenberg’s ideas about the need for music to
  move away from tonality, which was seen as a spent force since the weakening of tonality as in
  some works by Wagner and other late Romantics such as Richard Strauss.

     String Quartet No 7 in F Major (“Rassoumovsky”), Op 59, No 1, Movement I by Ludwig van
     Beethoven
     (Identified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements
     • Broadly diatonic but with significant chromatic diversions harmonically and melodically
     • High tessitura in first violin but narrower for other instruments
     • F major but begins with some ambiguity with the prominence of C in the bass and avoidance of
       a clear cadence to F until some time afterwards
     • Dynamic contrast used effectively
     • Texture varies from full quartet to pairs only
     • Some decorative articulation and embellishments
     • Principal theme presented in cello as well as upper voice first violin

     Musical structure
     The extract is the exposition of the movement, which is in sonata form.

     00:00–00:29 F major – common time (4/4) – lively tempo (Allegro). No introduction. Four four-
                 bar phrases move roughly sequentially, with a slow crescendo, by step to the tonic
                 (perfect) cadence (00:26). The principal melody moves mainly by step and is
                 heard first in the ‘cello. The accompaniment is a regular quaver pattern with slow
                 harmonic rhythm which leads to the V7 – I cadence establishing the key. The first
                 violin imitates the cello’s second phrase, while the cello joins with the homophonic
                 accompaniment. The dialogue between cello and violin could be termed
                 antiphonal.

     00:29–00:47 A bridge or transition of linking passage featuring diminished harmony disturbs
                 the previously certain tonic before returning to it. The writing here is chordal
                 homophony, contrasting with the melody dominated homophony of the
                 beginning; the rhythm also features longer notes as well as short staccato pairs,
                 particularly the descending figure. Chromatic intervals are also evident before the
                 passage reaches the dominant again, soft (p) and sustained for a full bar.

     00:47–01:16 The ‘cello and viola sustain a tonic triad pedal-point while the two violins are
                 paired mostly in thirds or sixths, playing a new theme but one which is also derived
                 from the scale idea in the initial theme. (Some candidates might identify this as the
                 “second subject”, though it’s in the wrong key – however, as few of them will have
                 perfect pitch, and as Beethoven may well have intended the ambiguity, they should
                 be given some credit for this, especially as it evidences some awareness of sonata
                 form.) The theme is echoed by the ‘cello and viola with no pedal. At circa 01:00,
                 the cello and viola resume the ascending scale run from the first theme. The scale
                 is answered by an overlapping related idea including the very high entry by the first
                 violin which collapses in a flurry of triplets, circa 01:07. The scale idea continues as
                 the ‘cello imitates the high violin triplets at circa 01:13, ending with a cadence to G
                 (supertonic II sharp 3rd/V of V).

     01:17–01:36 This section has the character of a development, anticipating later events. The
                 ideas already heard are utilised, including the triplets and the scale theme; the
                 rising scale idea can also be heard rhythmically augmented in the viola and ‘cello
                                              – 25 –               N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


            circa 01:34. Harmonically, the section features dissonances arising from the
            diminished 7ths and fragmentation arising from the separation of the triplet figure.
01:36–02:46 The (actual) second subject, in the dominant (C major), appears at 01:36 and is
            decorated with trills; the harmonic movement is broadened by way of both harmonic
            and melodic dissonance. Around 01:58 it leads to a passage mainly in triplets that
            may remind candidates of the material heard at 01:17. A particularly striking
            passage occurs at 02:16 with widely distant chords (A major, G7, A major, D minor,
            B dim. 7th) alternating with contrasted dynamics, before returning to the first subject
            theme in the dominant (C) at 02:27, which is then further developed. A long double
            pedal on an open 5th is established between viola and ‘cello from circa 02:31,
            followed by a modulation back to the tonic (F).

02:46–02:53 Beginning of development section; the principal theme (subject) can be heard
            briefly before the fade-out.

What is particularly notable in the extract is the foreshadowing of development before the “official
development”, but this shows Beethoven following a sonata principle rather than what is generally
termed “sonata form”.

Another small point to note is the pairing of ‘cello and viola and the two violins or in different
combinations.

     Tiger Rag by LaRocca, Edwards, Ragas, Sbarbaro & Shields
     (Unidentified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements
     • Jazz improvisation
     • Solo “breaks” eg, on clarinet and trumpet
     • Major key
     • Key changes (eg, A-flat, F)
     • Improvisation
     • Syncopation
     • Use of solo “breaks” as a jazz technique
     • Dynamic level is fairly constant but changes with texture
     • Instrumentation: drum kit – string bass/double bass – trumpet – clarinet – trombone – piano –
       banjo (heard in chorus) – tuba/ sousaphone (at 00:58)

     Musical structure
     00:00–00:02 Introduction: B-flat/common time – lively tempo – snare drum introduction
                                  ending with a light cymbal crash. Drum kit then underpins the
                  performance with off-beat pattern.

     00:02–00:15 A: First section by band led by trumpet and trombone with counter-melody on
                 clarinet – trombone has distinctive downward slides/glissandos – 8 bars: 2-bar
                 phrase repeated with different ending, whole 4 bars then repeated again – string
                 bass follows a continuous quaver pattern based around tonic/dominant – trumpet
                 plays lead in…

     00:15–00:22 B: Modulation to dominant (F major) – string bass solo pizzicato with punctuating
                 chords from band – bass uses upper register within its runs over four bars – the solo
                 ends with a lead-in from trombone…

     00:22–00:29 A: Repeat of A (once only, 4 bars)

     00:29–00:58 C: Modulation to E-flat major (subdominant) – 4x 4-bar phases, with third phrase
                 approximate repeat of second – new section but reflecting the solo exchanges in the
                 band from section B – clarinet figures – virtuosic – syncopation evident in the chord
                 exchanges – also some double-tonguing on trumpet – solo riff on trumpet where no
                 others play – cymbal crash – solo clarinet riff – ends with glissando down piano
                 keyboard –

     00:58–01:27 D: Main chorus tune on A-flat (“Hold that tiger…”) with its distinctive syncopated
                 rhythm:




                   16 bars (4x 4-bar phrases) with short trombone slides on the first beat of each bar –
                   trumpet repeats the first four-bar phrase one scale degree lower, featuring a minor
                   3rd rather than the initial major 3rd – the trombone plays a solo link with fast and
                   difficult articulation between the second and third phrases – bass follows a “walking
                   bass” pattern.

01:27–01:55 D1: – 16 bars, solo violin improvisation in quasi-“Stephane Grappelli” style over
            chord progression (“changes”) of chorus (D) – solo piano link after 8 bars –

01:55–[fade] D2: beginning of another improvisation over chorus chords, initially featuring solo
             clarinet – answered with trombone in “call in response” fashion or ‘trading fours’ –
             [fade out somewhere around 02:11].

Musical terminology
• Allegro or other suitable term for the tempo (crotchet/quarter note = ca. 138 bpm)
• Syncopation
• Improvisation

• Composers Harry De Costa; Eddie Edwards; Nick LaRocca; Henry Ragas; Tony Sbarbaro;
  Larry Shields
• The names under “composers” are actually members of The Original Dixieland Jazz Band
  whose recording in 1917 made the tune famous and who merely copyrighted but probably did
  not write it
• The performance here is one recorded in the studio in the twentieth century

     Tere Sur Aur Mere Geet (traditional)
     (Unidentified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements
     • Female vocalist, violin, mridangam (South Indian/Carnatic percussion)
     • Both vocalist and violinist perform with a great deal of embellishment and rhythmic freedom
       throughout, with the use of slides (glissandi) a particularly conspicuous feature
     • In raga Biha, according to CD liner notes. Various (often conflicting) theoretical explanations of
       this are given, and candidates with knowledge of the culture may explore this in some detail.
       Candidates who lack such specialised knowledge, however, will probably hear the scale as
       roughly equivalent to diatonic [E-flat] major, though with various distinctive melodic traits such
       as use of A-natural when ascending to B-flat, and A-flat when descending to G. Such
       descriptions are also quite acceptable.
     • According to liner notes, in 10-beat rhythmic cycle matha tala, consisting of laghu (4 beats),
       drutam (2 beats) and laghu (4 beats). However, basic song is clearly in triple metre, and
       relationship to underlying tala rather unclear. Those unfamiliar with the genre are mostly likely
       to hear piece in “3/4”, with regular 2- or 4-“bar” phrases, and should not be penalised for so
       describing it.
     • Vocal melody has compass of just over one octave (D–E-flat)
     • Medium tempo: one beat of tala / “crotchet” of “3/4” = ca. 132.

     Musical structure
     Original song consists of 3 main verses (labelled I, II, III below) of 4, 7 and 7 lines respectively –
     though in this performance these are expanded in places by the addition/interpolation of short
     instrumental or vocal improvisations. Verse III is more or less a repeat of Verse II, giving an overall
     A B B1 form, but because the last 3 lines of verses II and III repeat the material of Verse I, some
     candidates may hear the structure as A B A1 B1 A2 and should also be given some credit for this.
     There are also many internal repetitions of phrases (see below) which may give rise to yet further
     interpretations, and some latitude may therefore be necessary when assessing candidates’
     structural analyses of the piece.

     Introduction
     00:00       Violin plays arpeggio open fifth on Sa (E-flat)/Pha (B-flat) in double stopping,
                 supported by single stroke of mridangam.

     Verse I
     00:02       “Tere sur aur mere git ”: Vocalist enters with first line of song: 2 phrases (A+B), each
                 of 2 “bars” of “3/4”. Starts unaccompanied (monophonic); in second phrase, violin
                 joins melody with slight discrepancies (heterophonic); mridangam enters under last
                 note with pattern leading into to first beat of tala.

     00:08       “Tere sur aur mere git ”: Vocalist repeats first line of song to same melody: A
                 accompanied only by mridangam; in B, violin joins in, doubling vocal melody. (Note:
                 some candidates might describe texture here as “homophonic” since it consists of
                 “melody and accompaniment”. This is inaccurate and should not be credited.)

     00:14       “Dono mil kar banegi prit ”: Third line of song. First half is new phrase C, rising to
                 high Sa (E-flat); second half is similar to B, with violin providing heterophonic echoes
                 and downward glissando into next phrase.
                                          – 29 –              N17/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


00:19      “Tere sur aur mere git ”: Final line of song, same basic melody as lines 1 and 2
           (A+B).

00:25      Instrumental improvisation: Violin solo with mridangam accompaniment. Violin
           sustains long G (Ga) for 2 “bars”, then launches into improvisation based on phrases
           C, B, A, B of song. Whole section 11 “bars” long: vocalist can be heard breathing (or
           making false entry?) one bar before end.

Verse II
00:40      “Dhadakan me tu hai samaya hua”: New, more rhythmically active 2-bar vocal phrase
           (D) alternating between notes Mi – Pa (A-natural – B-flat), accompanied by livelier
           mridangam patterns. Followed by variant of phrase B in which percussion almost
           drops out completely.

00:45      Vocal improvisation: Interpolated 2-bar melismatic vocalise on final “ah” sound,
           beginning with ascending Sa – Ga – Pa (E-flat – G – B-flat) pattern using wide vibrato.
           Skipping Ri (F) and Mi/Ma (A/A-flat)) is apparently characteristic of this raga in its
           ascending form.

00:48      “Khayalo me tu hi chhaya hua”: New 2-bar phrases E (based around repeated Da/C)
           and F (florid figure rising to top Sa/E-flat), accompanied heterophonically by violin.

00:54      Instrumental improvisation: Phrase F then echoed by violin in 2-bar solo, with
           vocalist re-entering towards end in preparaion for next phrase.

00:57      “Dhadakan me tu hai samaya hua”: Varied reprise of phrases D + B; begins with
           vocalist and violin (some brief double stopping) only, with mridangam entering towards
           end.

01:02      “Khayalo me tu hi chhaya hua”: Phrases E + F repated with slight variants.

01:18      “Mai teri jogan tu mera mit” First two phrases of song as at beginning (A+B); violin

02:00       “Mujhase agar dur jaoge tum”: Phrases E + F

02:05       “Meri muhabbat me tassir hai”: Phrase D + B2 in voice, though – interestingly – violin
            begins with a repeat of phrase F, creating a brief moment of polyphony.

02:11       Vocal improvisation: Another 2-bar vocalise similar to 00:46, but this time
            accompanied by violin throughout.

02:14       “Meri muhabbat me tassir hai ”: Phrases D + B2, kicked off with double stop in violin.

02:39       Vocalist sustains final note (G/Ga) which then slides down to sa [E-flat] and fades out;
            violin echoes gesture and sustains E-flat while mridangam ends piece with short
            ritardando and final stroke.

Musical terminology
• mridangam, raga, tala, etc. (or acceptable equivalents if terms not known to candidate)
• monophony, heterophony, polyphony (but not homophony)
• melisma(tic)
• glissando, embellishment, vibrato
• double stop(ping)
• ritardando

Musical context
• South Indian (Carnatic) music
• Song originally from the soundtrack to the film “Goonj Uthi Shehnai” released in 1959
• However, in this version it is treated in traditional Carnatic style, without Western harmony, but
  instead with violin providing heterophonic accompaniment and improvisations, and mridangam
  playing tala patterns. The piece is not, however, simply a traditional, improvised raga
  performance.
• Some candidates may have in-depth knowledge of Carnatic music and go into much more detail
  than this markscheme. This should be credited, but candidates without specialist knowledge
  should still be given some credit if they identify close relatives within the same broad culture
  (eg, “tabla” for mridangam) or provide Western equivalents while acknowledging that these are
  only approximations (eg, “major”, “3/4”).
