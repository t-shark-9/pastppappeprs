Questions 36 – 40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

In 2015, Oakley Europe, along with www.designboom.com, launched a European-wide competition
where entrants were challenged to create an innovative design that would enhance elite sports
performance.

The winning design by Nacho Fernandez Bellette and Luis Enrique Muñoz Vargas was the Konk. This
product brings together in a single object the functionality of a dozen pieces of outdoor equipment.

Figure 12 below shows the Konk in a number of applications.

Figure 13 shows where the Konk attaches to backpacks for easy carrying when not in use.
