39.   Monochromatic electromagnetic radiation is incident on a metal surface.  The kinetic energy of the
      electrons released from the metal

      A.   is constant because the photons have a constant energy.

      B.   is constant because the metal has a constant work function.

      C.   varies because the electrons are not equally bound to the metal lattice.

      D.   varies because the work function of the metal is different for different electrons.


40.   A photon interacts with a nearby nucleus to produce an electron.  What is the name of
      this process?

      A.   Pair annihilation

      B.   Pair production

      C.   Electron diffraction

      D.   Quantum tunnelling
