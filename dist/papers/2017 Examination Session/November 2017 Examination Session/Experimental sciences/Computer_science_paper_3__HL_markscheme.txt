1.   (a)   Bioinformatics is the analysis of biological data by computers;
           For example: DNA / patient statistics / results from blood samples etc.                 [2]

           Note: Accept any example related to medical research.

     (b)   Award [1] for a feature of fuzzy logic and [1] for outlining its relevance to medical
           diagnosis, up to [2 max].
           Fuzzy logic can put a measure on uncertainty (give an approximate/probabilistic
           value);
           Can express relationships in a probabilistic manner;
           Patterns can be found which are not easy to classify with traditional logic;
           Work with multi-variable connections;
           Can help to give probability of certain diagnoses;                                      [2]

           Note: One symptom may be important only if there are some related ones;
           vagueness and uncertainty of measurements eg borderline blood results etc;


2.   (a)   Award [1] for each comparison up to [4 max]. Note that the italicised
           descriptions below are from then case study and will not gain credit unless they
           are expanded on.

     (b)   Award [1] for each issue and [1] for each associated outline, for two issues up to
           [4 max].

           Hardware incompatibility;
           Different machines making measurements with dedicated processors;

           Software incompatibility;
           eg different OS where not all function with the electronic records software;

           Different format of records;
           Not all centres taking the same measurements;

           Different format of results;
           For example temperature “> 40” or temperature “= 40.5”;
           Analogue values may be rounded differently;

           Note: Accept other reasonable issues which could occur.                              [4]


3.   Award [2] for a clear description of augmented reality, [2] for a clear explanation of
     how an image could be sent to the expert surgeon, and [2] for the role in the operation
     (up to [6 max]).

     AR:
     Augmented reality projects digital/additional information;
     onto a real-time situation/onto the real world;

     Augmented reality allows an actual situation to be complemented in such a way;
     that essential information is added to a video image;

     An expert surgeon in another place sees the operation as if they were there/as a video
     being filmed;

     Tags attached to the affected area to be operated can be overlaid on the image;
     Can overlay information on the view they have;

     Transmission;
     Annotated video data is continually streamed between the two;
     Using a camera at the operation end;
     In real-time over a (very) secure and fast network;
     Viewed by expert surgeon on a screen;

     Example of use;
     The expert can show on the image what actions should be made (and where);
     Allow example;
     Using the information being sent back on a headset tablet/smart phone/transparent
     screen;                                                                                    [6]

4.   Discussion should focus on:

     “health carers at the health centre for visits made by appointment”
     People will need a physical presence at the centre for reassurance which means carers
     need to be employed and in place – enough to cope with the estimated need
     especially as visits to the hospital are difficult.

     “expert doctors from other locations, who are available 24 hours a day via a VPN
     connection”
     Essential for crises which occur outside of the hours the centre is open.
     Will need a secure and reliable connection with access from mobile device, and access
     to any data and phone calls coming into the centre.

     “a comprehensive care system for chronically sick patients at home”
     Continual measurements can be sent to the health centre; this could be done with
     wearables. Someone with a heart problem could have the heart rate continually
     measured on a bracelet with an imbedded RFID to communicate wirelessly via NFC to
     a receiving device which sends the data automatically to the health centre.
     The centre would need to have software to interpret the data (or this could be done at
     the patient side – therefore less to send) and any fluctuations identified.
     Danger signals would mean the doctor needs to know. Health carer would check on
     minor changes as well as regular check-ups – need for health carers depends on
     proportion of chronically sick and elderly.
     Effect on population – good system to stay at home may be met with some aversion to
     remote monitoring.

     “some provision for emergency operations in the health centre”
     Could be dealt with by telesurgery when essential but will need appropriate
     cameras/connections and software, as well as a doctor who is confident to be involved.

     “diagnostic equipment to identify cases where a person needs to be treated at the large
     hospital”
     An ultrasound scanner should probably be purchased. For example, regular scans are
     needed for pregnant women. However, these need expert technical operators and
     interpreters. One suggestion would be for the scans to take place via telemedicine and
     the results sent electronically to be analysed at the hospital.

     An internet site for communication and advice would have the advantages of
     knowledge so that a decision whether or not to make an appointment can be made.
     Accounts would need to be set up and security ensured via firewalls, encryption etc as
     personal medical information is sensitive. It would be helpful to give information as to
     when an appointment should be made and simple remedies for simple problems.
     Some people may be suspicious of using this medium for medical uses and be
     concerned about privacy.
