1.   Which function is accomplished by structures X and Y in the Paramecium?

     C.        movement               food storage

     D.        respiration            DNA replication



2.   What evidence from the image of Paramecium indicates whether the organism is a prokaryote or
     a eukaryote?

     A.    Compartments in the cell indicate that it is a eukaryote.

     B.    No nucleus indicates that the cell is a prokaryote.

     C.    Lack of a cell wall indicates that the cell is a eukaryote.

     D.    It is a unicellular organism, so it must be a prokaryote.


3.   The salt concentration inside an animal cell is 1.8 %. The salt concentration in the surrounding
     medium becomes 5 %. What will be the likely response?

     A.    The cell will gain water from the medium.

     B.    The cell will lose salt to the medium.

     C.    The cell will remain unchanged.

     D.    The cell will shrink from loss of water.
