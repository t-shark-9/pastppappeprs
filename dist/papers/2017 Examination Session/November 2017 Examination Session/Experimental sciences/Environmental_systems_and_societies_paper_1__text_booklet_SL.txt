 Native to North America.
 Introduced in Iceland to stop soil erosion in 1885.
 Invasive – spread quickly and outcompetes native ﬂora.
 Ministry of Environment recommended eradication of the lupin in highlands (above 400 m), national
  parks and conservation areas.
 Removal methods include: grazing, use of herbicides, pulling up by hand, mowing.
 Public participation encouraged to help with removal of the lupin.

 Estimated worldwide population of twelve million.
 60 % of the world’s puffins live in Iceland.
 Puffins lay their eggs in burrows on cliﬀs in June–July, one egg per year.
 Adult puffins bring small fish to their young.
 Classified as “vulnerable” on International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.
 Current population in decline.
 Threats to puffins include overfishing, native predators such as foxes and gulls, introduced predators
  such as cats, hunting and egg collection by humans, oil spills, extreme weather and disturbance from
  tourists.
 Puffins can be hunted legally in Iceland in April by a technique called “sky fishing”, which involves
  catching low-ﬂying birds with a big net. Their meat and eggs are commonly featured on hotel menus.
 Puffin populations aﬀected by extreme weather events, and changes in availability of food.
