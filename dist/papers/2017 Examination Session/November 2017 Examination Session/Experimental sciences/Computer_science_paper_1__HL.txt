                                               Section A

Answer all questions.

1.   Identify two essential features of a computer language.                                  [2]


2.   In the context of a networked world, state the role of

     (a)   a client.                                                                          [1]

     (b)   a server.                                                                          [1]

                                                  Section B

Answer all questions.

10.    An application package used in an office includes a word processor.

       (a)    Describe how a spellchecker checks whether a word in a text file is correctly spelt
              or not.                                                                                 [2]

       The office manager decides to buy and install new software and hardware.

       (b)    Outline one problem that may arise from the installation of new hardware and software
              in the office.                                                                          [2]

       The changeover to the new system can be achieved by either direct changeover or
       phased conversion.

       (c)    Compare direct changeover and phased conversion.                                        [4]

       The new software allows basic text summaries and analysis to help check text files,
       including functions such as calculating word frequency.

       (d)    Identify one way of testing this software.                                              [1]

       One of the methods in this software is findFirst(CH, CHARARRAY) which accepts a
       character, CH, and a one-dimensional array of characters, CHARARRAY, and returns the
       position of the first occurrence of character CH in CHARARRAY. It returns −1 if CH does not
       appear in the array CHARARRAY.

       For example, consider the character array MESSAGE, which is of length 19.

 [0]    [1]   [2]   [3]   [4]   [5]   [6]   [7]   [8]   [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]
  A      U     R     O     R     A           M     U     S   I    S         A    M    I    C    A    .

       For this array:
       yy The character at position 8 in the sentence is “U” and hence MESSAGE[8] = "U".
       yy The character at position 18 in the sentence is “.” and hence MESSAGE[18] = ".".
       yy The method findFirst('A', MESSAGE) returns 0.
       yy The method findFirst('S', MESSAGE) returns 9.
       yy The method findFirst('Z', MESSAGE) returns −1.

       (e)    Construct an efficient algorithm for the method findFirst(). You should use the
              function len(), which returns the number of characters in an array (for example,
              len(MESSAGE) returns 19).                                                               [6]

11.   A wireless local area network (WLAN) is used to extend access to a school’s wired
      local area network.

      (a)   Identify one hardware component of the WLAN, other than computers.                        [1]

      The advantages of this WLAN are user-mobility and economical access points.

      (b)   Outline two disadvantages of this WLAN.                                                   [4]

      (c)   Identify three ways in which the network administrator can reduce the risk of
            unauthorized access to confidential data.                                                 [3]

      The concept of packet data transmission is used within this network.
      Figure 1 shows the simplified structure of a data packet.

       yy …


      (d)   Define the term protocol.                                                                 [1]

      (e)   With reference to Figure 1, explain how data is transferred by packet switching.          [6]




                                                                                                Turn over

12.   A biotechnology company owns a resource centre which collects and classifies organisms
      for use in research.

      Only authorized employees are allowed access to some laboratories in the resource centre.

      These laboratories are protected by locked doors. Each door is controlled by a separate
      microprocessor. A digital camera is used to scan the iris of an employee who wishes to
      enter the lab. If the employee is authorized the doors are unlocked.

      (a)   Identify two benefits of using a digital camera as an input device in this control system.   [2]

      (b)   Outline the use of a microprocessor in this control system.                                  [2]

      (c)   Outline the function of an output transducer.                                                [2]

      The company is planning to use a centralized computer system to secure the resource
      centre’s building.

      (d)   Compare a centrally controlled system with the system described above.                       [4]

      The operating system has an important role in this system.

      (e)   Identify two functions of the operating system.                                              [2]

      Polling and interrupt are two operating system management techniques.

      (f)   Suggest with reasons which of these two techniques is the most appropriate for this
            centrally controlled system.                                                                 [3]

13.   (a)   Describe the features of a dynamic data structure.                                       [2]

      Consider the following doubly linked list which holds the names of flowers in
      alphabetical order.

            FIRST      NULL   Aster            Camellia             Lavender NULL      LAST



      (b)   Explain how “Primrose” could be inserted into this doubly linked list. You should draw
            a labelled diagram in your answer.                                                       [6]

      Consider the two stacks: FLOWERS and FRUITS.

                     FLOWERS                              FRUITS
                                    Aster                             Apple
                                    Broom                            Cherry
                                  Camellia                           Orange
                                  Day Lily                             Pear
                                  Lavender
                                  Primrose
                                   Yarrow


      (c)   Show the output produced by the following algorithm.                                     [4]

   loop while (NOT FRUITS.isEmpty()) AND (NOT FLOWERS.isEmpty())
     X = FRUITS.pop()
     Y = FLOWERS.pop()
     if X < Y then
					output X
				else
       output Y
				end if
			end loop

      A third stack, FLOFRU, is needed. It should contain all the data from FLOWERS and FRUITS
      and will store it as shown below

                                      FLOFRU

                                                     Apple

      (d)   Describe how the FLOFRU stack could be created.                                          [3]

                                                                                              Turn over

14.   Consider the following two-dimensional array, MAT, with dimensions 6 × 6.

                                    [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
                              [0]    7   0   0   0   0   0
                              [1]    0   0   0   0   0   0
                              [2]    0   0 −3    0   9   0
                              [3]    0   0   0   0   0   0
                              [4]    0   0 −1    0   0   0
                              [5]    0 −6    0   0 −5    1


      The value −1 is stored in MAT at position [4][2]. The position [4][2] means row 4
      and column 2.

      (a)   State the total number of elements stored in MAT.                                     [1]

      (b)   State the number of non-zero elements in MAT.                                         [1]

      A two-dimensional array in which most of the elements are zero is called a sparse matrix.
      A sparse matrix can be compressed by storing only non-zero elements using three
      one‑dimensional arrays.

      The first array, VALUES, stores all non-zero elements taken from the sparse matrix in
      row‑major order (left-to-right then top-to-bottom order).

      The length of the array VALUES is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the sparse
      matrix. For the sparse matrix above, MAT, the array VALUES is:

                                 [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
                                  7   −3  9   −1 −6 −5    1

      The second array is ROWC. ROWC[i] stores the number of non-zero elements, from row 0 to
      row i of the sparse matrix, inclusive.

      The length of ROWC is equal to the number of rows in the sparse matrix. For MAT the array
      ROWC is:

                                    [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
                                     1   1   3   3   4   7

      For example, ROWC[2] stores 3 because in MAT there are three non-zero elements from
      row 0 to row 2, inclusive.

      The third array, COL, stores the column index for each non-zero element in the sparse
      matrix. COL[i] stores the sparse matrix column index for the non-zero element stored in
      VALUES[i]. For MAT the array COL is:

                                 [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
                                  0   2   4   2   1   4   5

(Question 14 continued)

     (c)    Construct an algorithm that compresses a 6 × 6 two-dimensional array, such as MAT,
            into the three one-dimensional arrays described on page 8. You may assume that the
            6 × 6 array is inputted and all three one-dimensional arrays are initialized.           [6]

     Consider the following three arrays. They hold the compressed contents of a 7 × 7 sparse
     matrix, BIGMAT.

     VALUES
                   [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
                    15 20 37 43 57 60 70 89 90 92


     ROWC
                   [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6]
                    1   3   4   5   5   7   10


     COL
                   [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]
                    0   1   2   1   3   0   1   0   5   6


     (d)    For a given column, C, in BIGMAT, outline how it could be determined that this column
            contains no non-zero elements.                                                          [2]

     (e)    State how many rows in BIGMAT contain only zeros.                                       [1]

     (f)    (i)     State the index in VALUES of the first non-zero element in row 5 of BIGMAT.     [1]

		          (ii)    For a given row, R, in BIGMAT, determine the range of indexes in VALUES where
                    non-zero elements in row R of BIGMAT are placed. You may assume that there
                    is at least one non-zero element in row R.                                      [3]
