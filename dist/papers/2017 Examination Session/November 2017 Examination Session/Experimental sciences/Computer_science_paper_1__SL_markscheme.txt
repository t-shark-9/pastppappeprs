     Search/look up, or comparable wording, are synonyms of the given Retrieve;
     Insert/put, or comparable wording, are synonyms of the given Add;
     Lists of repeated arithmetic operations that fall under examples of calculations (subtract,
     divide, multiply, square) are all examples of calculations, and hence processing.             [2]

           available by a server /
           The role of a client is to access a service made available by a server by sending
           a request for service;

           Note: the term client is to be understood only from the computing perspective, ie
           this is not a human.                                                                    [1]

                output K
                K = K + 1
           end loop

           Example answer (including J variable)
           K = 1
           J = 1
           loop while K = J AND K <= N
                output K

8.   (a)   Primary memory / RAM                                                                  [1]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           Note: there must be explicit reference to both address and data bus

           Example 1
           Buses are used as physical connections to carry information to the CPU;
           The data bus transports data from/to CPU, whereas the address bus the memory
           address where the data is supposed to go/be.

           Example 2
           Data bus is a physical connection to transport data from-to CPU to be
           processed;
           Address bus is a physical connection to transport an address of memory storage where data
           (transported in the data bus) should be read/written;

           Note: Award [1] mark, for responses that show some understanding of use of
           buses in CPU, for address location and data transport without using specialist
           terminology                                                                           [2]

            the dictionary, spellchecker will recognize that it is incorrectly spelt;                          [2]

      (b)   Award [1 max].
            If power goes off, only the text typed after last (automatic) save is lost;

            Note: Accept any reasonable examples, but there should be more than one.
            The focus of the question is on data loss, and not in relation to
            security/hacking.                                                                            [2]

      (f)   Award [1] for stating a problem and [1] for an elaboration, up to [2 max].
            Users/employees might be afraid of these changes (for various reasons);
            And not willing to help in this change;

            Data migration problems;
            For example, different file formats so conversion must be performed;

            Employee efficiency may drop;
            As they learn to use the new system;

            Issue of compatibility with legacy software/hardware;
            So features of new software/hardware may not work correctly;                                       [2]
                                                   –8–                 N17/4/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (g)   Award [1] for outlining what is meant by direct changeover, [1] for outlining what
            is meant by phased conversion, and then [1] for an advantage or disadvantage
            of each, up to [2].

            Example answer:
            Direct changeover, the old software and hardware is completely replaced, in one
            move, by the new software and hardware;
            Phased conversion involves selecting one section in the office for the direct
            changeover and other sections will be switched when the first section selected is
            running satisfactorily. Eventually the whole office has been changed;
            A phased conversion is less risky than a direct changeover as any problems that
            might arise will be isolated in only one section in the office;
            Direct changeover means everyone in the organization has same
            software/hardware and so there are no compatibility issues;                             [4]


12.   (a)   Award up to [1 max].
            Wireless router/modem;
            Access points;
            Switch;
            Wireless repeater/extender/booster;                                                     [1]

      (b)   Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage and [1] for an expansion, for two
            disadvantages up to [4 max].

            Data transfer will decrease (compared with a wired LAN);
            Because the number of computers using the network increases;
            (and because) WLAN has lower bandwidth than a wired LAN;

            Less data security;
            As devices from outside the school can access the network/intercept
            transmissions;

            More easily open to misuse;
            As teacher/administrator cannot directly monitor a specific student/teacher/
            machine;

            Intermittent connectivity due to physical barriers (walls);
            Results in low transfer/speed and may hinder operations.

            Note: Accept any reasonable points, provided they are appropriately
            elaborated.                                                                             [4]

      (c)   Award up to [3 max].
            Give each user appropriate login details/passwords;
            Different access rights for students, teachers, school administrators (file-level and
            share-level security);
            All passwords and files should be encrypted;
            Use the latest WiFi protocol/WPA2;
            Require MAC address authentication;
            Password protect the documents;

            Note: the focus of the question is on confidential data (firewalls not accepted)        [3]
                                             –9–                  N17/4/COMSC/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Set of rules for data transmission;                                                    [1]

(e)   Award up to [6] as follows:

      Award up to [3 max] for a general description of how data is transferred by
      packet switching. ([1 max] if this general description is very simplistic and refers
      to just the Header/Data/Trailer already shown in the question paper).

      Award up to [3 max] for added detail that references the contents of the given
      data packet in the answer.

      Example of general description

      Data is organized in specially formatted units (data packets) which are routed
      from source to destination using network switches and routers;

      Network switches and routers determine how best to transfer the packet between
      a number of intermediate devices (routers and switches) on the path to its
      destination (rather than flowing directly over a single wire on the path to its
      destination);

      Data packets are reassembled at the destination;

      Example of referencing content

      Addresses have to be in a standard format so that each switch/routing station
      recognizes the address;
      Address of sender identifies the sending computer, so that any packets not
      received can be re-requested;
      Address of receiver identifies intended recipient so it can be forwarded on
      correctly;
      The protocol used must be identified so that the correct rules are followed;
      Size of packet / size of fields in packet – All packets/fields must have the same
      size so that the data can be reassembled;
      Sequence number so that packets can be reassembled in correct order;
      Transmission codes to show whether the data packet is transmitted or
      re-transmitted;
      Control bits, to maintain the integrity of the data by ensuring that the data
      received is the same as the data sent;
      Error checking code – when an error is detected, an algorithm either corrects
      the error or requests that the packet is resent;                                       [6]

            Note: The symbol " appearing in cells above means that the value in that cell is
            the same as the one in the cell just above it; unfilled cells means that no value
            must be present.

            Remark: Accept drawings of tables where the values of the column CL are
            shifted downwards of one cell only, therefore showing the first value 2 when
            K = 10. Do not propagate by FT to the other columns, they are independent from
            the way CL has been filled.)                                                        [4]
