    research into the premature babies that are going to use this product                 points in how three of the stages of
    so gathering anthropometric data such as their length, reach, weight, etc /            user-centred design have been
    gathering information about the levels of oxygen / temperature / airflow required by   considered in the development of the
    premature babies                                                                      NeoNurture.

    research into local resources in developing countries, such as used spare car
    parts / which car parts can be used 
    and local skills, such as the expertise of local car mechanics / medical
    professionals 
    to enable the manufacturing of a functional / reliable / safe incubator 

    Concept / Concept Examining:
    a UCD team comes up with preliminary solutions to address users’ needs 
    then involves potential end users / experts in the evaluation of concepts using
    concept models / paper prototypes 
    to gather in-depth insight of users’ perspective / requirements early in the
    process 

a UCD team develops usage scenarios / use cases 
to deepen their understanding of users’ behaviours / requirements 
and reflect real user experiences in the design 
[3max]


Design:
a UCD team develops the design based on continuous user evaluation/
involvement / feedback 
using an iterative process 
until the NeoNurture is optimised for its end-users 

a UCD team carries extensive usability testing of mock-ups/ prototypes of the
NeoNurture 
the result of each test feeds into and refines the next 
which means that every aspect of the NeoNurture is examined / revised in detail
from its users’ point of view 
[3max]


Implementation:
prior to its launch, end-users / experts need to be involved in the testing of a (high
fidelity /final) prototype of the NeoNurture 
this will enable the NeoNurture to be as “bug-free” as possible 
and ensures it provides the best possible end-user experience/ meets all identified
requirements / is accessible 

end users / local mechanics need to assess a (high fidelity /final) prototype of the
NeoNurture in terms of maintenance repair 
and the availability of replacement parts 
to make sure it has a long product life 

Launch:
the launch of the NeoNurture needs to be managed so end-users are able to
make a smooth transition from existing products (if necessary) 
however, the launch does not mean the end of the UCD process 
as gathering additional feedback from a range of sources (usability testing, focus
groups, competitor comparisons, expert appraisals, etc) is necessary to inform any
future development of the product 
