34.   Cobalt chloride paper is blue when dry but turns pink with water. Blue cobalt chloride paper was
      fastened to the upper and lower surfaces of a plant leaf. After 20 minutes, many small pink dots
      were observed on the paper on the lower surface, and a few pink dots were seen on the
      upper surface. What conclusions can be drawn?

		         I.     There are more stomata on the lower surface than on the upper surface.
		         II.    Stomata on the upper surface are blocked by the waxy cuticle.
		         III.   More transpiration occurs through the lower surface than through the upper surface.

36.   In a plant, dark leaves are dominant to pale leaves and yellow seeds are dominant to white seeds.

      A heterozygous dark-leaved plant with yellow seeds was crossed with a pale-leaved plant with
      white seeds.  A large number of offspring were produced.  They were either dark-leaved with
      yellow seeds or pale-leaved with white seeds in equal number.

      What is the most likely cause of this pattern?

      A.   Crossing over has occurred.

      B.   The two genes are linked.

      C.   The traits are polygenic.

      D.   The genes are codominant.
