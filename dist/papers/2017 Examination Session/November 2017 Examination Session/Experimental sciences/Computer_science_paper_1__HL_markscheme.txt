7.   (a)   Primary memory / RAM                                                                  [1]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           Note: there must be explicit reference to both address and data bus.

           Example 1
           Buses are used as physical connections to carry information to the CPU;
           The data bus transports data from/to CPU, whereas the address bus the memory
           address where the data is supposed to go/be;

           Example 2
           Data bus is a physical connection to transport data from-to CPU to be processed;
           Address bus is a physical connection to transport an address of memory storage
           where data (transported in the data bus) should be read/written;

           Note: Award [1], for responses that show some understanding of use of buses in
           CPU, for address location and data transport without using specialist
           terminology.                                                                          [2]

                                                  Section B
10.   (a)   Each word in the text file is compared with words in a dictionary (held in
            memory/online);
            If the word is found in the dictionary it is correctly spelt / if the word is not found in
            the dictionary, spellchecker will recognize that it is incorrectly spelt;                    [2]

      (b)   Award [1] for stating a problem and [1] for an elaboration, up to [2 max].
            Users/employees might be afraid of these changes (for various reasons);
            And not willing to help in this change;

            Data migration problems;
            For example, different file formats so conversion must be performed;

            Employee efficiency may drop;
            As they learn to use the new system;

            Issue of compatibility with legacy software/hardware;
            So features of new software/hardware may not work correctly;                                 [2]

      (c)   Award [1] for outlining what is meant by direct changeover, [1] for outlining what
            is meant by phased conversion, and then [1] for an advantage or disadvantage
            of each, up to [4 max].

            Example answer
            In direct changeover, the old software and hardware is completely replaced, in
            one move, by the new software and hardware;
            Phased conversion involves selecting one section in the office for the direct
            changeover and other sections will be switched when the first section selected is
            running satisfactorily. Eventually the whole office has been changed;
            A phased conversion is less risky than a direct changeover as any problems that
            might arise will be isolated in only one section in the office;
            Direct changeover means everyone in the organization has same
            software/hardware and so there are no compatibility issues;                                  [4]

      (d)   Award [1 max].
            Debugging (Accept: white-box testing – ie structural testing/flow testing;

            Note: Attempts of solutions that use an incremental for-loop, starting from the first
            index of the array, necessarily require the presence of a temporary variable to
            store the index!;
            If none is present, then it is likely to be an incorrect attempt to the question

      (b)   Award [1] for identifying a disadvantage and [1] for an expansion, for two
            disadvantages up to [4 max].

            Data transfer will decrease (compared with a wired LAN);
            Because the number of computers using the network increases;
            (and because) WLAN has lower bandwidth than a wired LAN;

            Less data security;
            As devices from outside the school can access the network/intercept
            transmissions;

            More easily open to misuse;
            As teacher/administrator cannot directly monitor a specific student/teacher/
            machine;

            Intermittent connectivity due to physical barriers (walls);
            Results in low transfer/speed and may hinder operations.

            Note: Accept any reasonable points, provided they are appropriately
            elaborated.                                                                             [4]

      All passwords and files /disk should be encrypted;
      Use the latest WiFi protocol/WPA2;
      Require MAC address authentication;
      Password protect the documents;

      Note: the focus of the question is on protection of confidential data
      (Firewalls not accepted)                                                                [3]

(d)   Set of rules for data transmission;                                                     [1]

(e)   Award up to [6] as follows:

      Award up to [3 max] for a general description of how data is transferred by
      packet switching. ([1 max] if this general description is very simplistic and refers
      to just the Header/Data/Trailer already shown in the question paper).

      Award up to [3 max] for added detail that references the contents of the given
      data packet in the answer.

      Example of general description
      Data is organized in specially formatted units (data packets) which are routed
      from source to destination using network switches and routers;

      Network switches and routers determine how best to transfer the packet between
      a number of intermediate devices (routers and switches) on the path to its
      destination (rather than flowing directly over a single wire on the path to its
      destination);

      Data packets are reassembled at the destination;

      Example of referencing content
      Addresses have to be in a standard format so that each switch/routing station
      recognizes the address;
      Address of sender identifies the sending computer, so that any packets not
      received can be re-requested;
      Address of receiver identifies intended recipient so it can be forwarded on
      correctly;
      The protocol used must be identified so that the correct rules are followed;
      Size of packet / size of fields in packet – All packets/fields must have the same
      size so that the data can be reassembled;
      Sequence number so that packets can be reassembled in correct order;
      Transmission codes to show whether the data packet is transmitted or
      re-transmitted;
      Control bits, to maintain the integrity of the data by ensuring that the data
      received is the same as the data sent;
      Error checking code – when an error is detected, an algorithm either corrects
      the error or requests that the packet is resent;                                        [6]

            No need for AD conversion;
            Generally very high quality pictures (useful to prevent malpractice);
            Generally quick;

            Example answer 1
            No need for conversion because image is in digital format;
            Thousands/millions of photos of eyes could be taken before needing replacement;

            Example answer 2
            It is directly connected to a microprocessor for image comparison;
            It could be fitted (purchased), with a macro lens so that a close up scan of the
            Iris is possible;                                                                      [2]

      (b)   Award up to [2 max].

            Processor compares the inputted image/pattern with the images stored in memory;

            If a match is found, it sends a signal to unlock doors /
            (if match is not found, it sends error message/the doors remain locked);               [2]

      (c)   Output transducer is a device (an actuator) which converts;
            an electrical signal into physical quantity (a physical action);

            Output transducer is a device which converts energy from one physical form to
            another;
            eg electrical energy (signal) into electro-mechanical or kinetic energy / to produce
            action (lock/unlock door);

            Note: Award one mark only for an answer that just says that the output
            transducer can be used to lock/unlock doors.                                           [2]

      (d)   Award [1] for the meaning of centrally controlled system;
            [1] for the meaning of a distributed system, and;
            [up to 2 max] for an expansion/comparison addressing both kind of systems
            [up to 4 max];

            Example answer
            A centrally controlled system involves a central computer which controls all
            labs/doors;
            A distributed system can have only a dedicated microprocessor with memory to
            control one of the labs/doors;

            A centrally controlled system is more versatile;
            Could be used in solving other business tasks (accept specific examples);
            Can unlock all doors easily during an emergency;
            Access rights can be updated easily;
            Data is stored centrally and therefore easier to update;
            A failure in a central system would affect all doors;

      A distributed system can be programmed with ad hoc OS depending on the
      technologies used;
      It may be practical choice when dealing with legacy systems/ specific devices/
      old infrastructure/while updating the facilities;
      It contributes a higher sense of partition of the physical space (territory) to groups
      / individuals;
      Data are stored locally, so there is local consistency (and smaller size mean
      easier to manage);
      Changes to data may be done locally, and if some data are common in two or
      more different
      systems, global inconsistencies across different systems may be
      introduced;                                                                              [4]

(f)   Award [1] for choosing “interrupt”, [1] for explaining “interrupts” and [1] for
      justifying the choice in this context, up to [3 max].

      Example answer:
      Interrupt;
      A signal sent from an input device to a computer causes the processor, and the
      main program that operates the computer (the operating system), to stop and
      figure out what to do next;
      Interrupt is better in this situation because it does not waste central computer’s
      time (other tasks could be performed);
      (example of emergency – it must give quick response);

      Note: Award [1 max] for an answer of “polling”, but only if reasonably justified.

      Polling – the continuous checking of all input devices by processor to see what
      state they are in/to see whether they are still connected/want to communicate;
      So a faulty device that is polled will not reply;                                        [3]

            Each node contains data and also a link to other nodes;
            Links between nodes are implemented by pointers (a pointer references a
            location in memory or holds a memory address);
            List size is not fixed / predetermined;                                                [2]

      (b)   Award up to [6 max] as follows. (There are 7 marking points)

            [1] instantiation of values and pointers in new node;
            [1] state where the search starts from;

            [1] update pointers in new node;
            [1] update pointers from the node at the insertion point, to the new node;
            [1] update external pointers;
            Remark: Some answers may just use illustrations alone, or very minimal explanations: see
            note below;

            Create a new node (with pointer NEWNODE) with data field Primrose and two
            pointer fields (next and previous), to be inserted;

            Perform a linear search, either from the beginning or end of the list (using
            pointers FIRST and LAST, on the alphabetically order list;

            The location/position of insertion, is found by comparing nodes (Primrose to be
            inserted after Lavender, LOCATION points to Lavender) (Accept any description
            to that effect);

            (At the end of this phase, the situation looks as in Figure 1)

            Figure 1




            Then, continue by setting the “next” field/pointer in the newly created node to
            NULL;

            Set the “previous” pointer in the newly created node to the current LAST / to point
            to Lavender/ to point to the node detected by LOCATION;

            Change/Set/Update the Lavender’s “next” pointer to point to the new node / to
            link with the NEWNODE pointer (delete NULL in the field and link to the existing
            NEWNODE pointer);

            Update the LAST pointer to point to the newly created node;

            Eventually the final doubly linked list looks like this (Figure 2);

      [1] The order of nodes Aster/Camellia/Lavender/Primrose is eventually correct;
      [1] The two unidirectional links between Lavender and Primrose are (eventually)
      correctly displayed, from-to the appropriate fields;
