Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the
             main points are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned
             conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are
             generally well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition
             or lack of clarity in places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
             and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are
             appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
             evaluation of different perspectives.

Section 1       Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   Discuss the role of warfare in maintaining and expanding the political organization of one
     pre-Columbian society.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the role of warfare in maintaining and
     expanding the political organization of one society in pre-Columbian America during, although not
     necessarily spanning, the period from c750 to 1500. Both beneficial and detrimental effects are
     relevant. Candidates will refer to maintenance and expansion in their responses; however, the
     treatment of each does not need to be equal. Candidates may argue that some societies were
     organized into independent city-states that fought against each other to maintain and extend their
     territory. They may also claim that success in war led to territorial expansion, increased the
     resources and contributed to the maintenance of the dominant society. Some societies, such as
     the Aztecs, exacted tributes and forced unequal trade relations upon the conquered territories. It
     may be suggested that wars weakened the political organization of a society and contributed to
     their defeat by the Spanish.


2.   Compare and contrast the social structures of two indigenous societies.

     Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the social structures of two
     indigenous societies within the given period, referring to both societies throughout. Areas for
     discussion may include the wielding of power over a society, or how power was handed down from
     generation to generation. The existence of slavery, the role, status and rights of women, as well as
     customs, such as those relating to marriage, children and the elderly may also provide fruitful
     avenues of exploration. Some indigenous societies had a very complex social structure of class
     and status with many different layers while others had a very simple structure. As such, the
     societies chosen will influence the extent of comparison and contrast. The types of societies
     chosen, be they communal, individual, permanent, nomadic, urban or rural may also have an
     influence on the levels of comparison and contrast.

Section 2       European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   “The exploration and conquest of the Americas had a negative economic impact on the indigenous
     populations.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of factors in order to
     assess the economic impact of the exploration and conquest of the indigenous people and
     determine whether this impact was positive or negative. Answers to this question will most likely
     focus on Spanish exploration and conquest, but accept any exploration and conquest from within
     the period. In nearly all cases in Latin America, conquest meant indigenous people lost their lands
     to the conquerors, and saw their cities, markets and fields destroyed. Natural resources of gold
     and silver were taken and sent back to Europe. In most cases, indigenous people were forced to
     mine these resources. Enslavement of the indigenous population was attempted, but generally
     failed. Later, this was replaced with the repartimiento, which tied indigenous people to specific
     land to work without economic compensation. While there may have been some benefits from the
     Columbian exchange, such as new crops and animals, these were mostly for the benefit of the
     conquerors, not the indigenous people.


4.   Evaluate the impact of the Law of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws of the Indies (1542) on the
     indigenous populations of Spanish America.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the strengths and limitations of the Law of Burgos (1512) and
     the New Laws of the Indies (1542) on the indigenous populations under Spanish rule.
     In evaluating the effects, they must offer detailed and specific knowledge of both the laws and their
     impact on the indigenous populations of Spanish Americas. The Law of Burgos was the first
     codified legislation on the treatment of the indigenous populations. It instituted the encomienda to
     replace repartimiento or mita, and legislated the duties of the encomenderos towards the
     indigenous populations. Though it regulated the working and living conditions of the indigenous
     populations, exploitation persisted. The New Laws of the Indies aimed to protect the indigenous
     populations by addressing the ineffective application of the Law of Burgos, banning the creation of
     new encomiendas, providing for the dissolution of existing encomiendas and establishing
     additional safeguards for indigenous peoples. These too were mostly ignored.
                                                 –7–                N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3       Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   “Colonial governments successfully overcame the economic challenges that they experienced.”
     Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the extent to which colonial
     governments were successful in overcoming economic challenges. Candidates may choose to
     address each of the challenges individually and gauge the extent to which each was overcome, or
     they may choose to focus on the challenges that were overcome and those that were not in
     discrete groups. They may choose to discuss different colonial governments separately or discuss
     them collectively. Candidates may discuss mercantilism and the control of trade. They may
     discuss that the “salutary neglect” of the British colonies allowed their colonial governments to
     address the economic challenges, while Spanish and French decisions were made by the crown.
     Taxation, smuggling, piracy, sanctioned trade monopolies, lack of economic diversification, and a
     shortage of labour were common economic challenges throughout the Americas and some or all of
     these may be mentioned.


6.   Evaluate the reasons for resistance to governmental authority in the New World.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for resistance to governmental authority in the
     New World. British North America is a possible choice. The existence of local self-government
     from the early days of the colonies and the British practice of salutary neglect made colonists
     resentful of attempts at increased control by Great Britain. Other areas are also acceptable, but
     resistance in New France and New Spain was less common, although Haiti could be used.
     Candidates are not required to include all areas of the New World. They may consider political,
     economic, religious, geographic location or ideological reasons. Both long-term and short-term
     causes may be considered. The reasons varied from region to region and, whatever reasons are
     evaluated, the candidates will provide specific detail.
                                                –8–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4       Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   “The influence of the Catholic Church on the indigenous populations of the Americas was
     beneficial.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. They may choose to address
     the beneficial and detrimental effects in discrete groups, or they may choose to focus on individual
     arguments. Candidates are expected to offer opinions and conclusions that are supported by
     appropriate evidence. The Catholic Church became a driving force in the Spanish conquest when
     the Pope awarded the Catholic monarchs the exclusive right of evangelization of the indigenous
     populations in 1493. This legitimized the conquest as a war against paganism. In French North
     America, the Church interacted with the indigenous peoples and attempted to evangelize them with
     mixed results. Candidates may argue that the religious beliefs of the indigenous populations were
     neither understood nor respected. The Catholic Church banned native religious ceremonies,
     destroyed their idols and forced entire groups to convert, sometimes by persuasion, sometimes by
     force. Some indigenous populations were moved into missions where religious orders taught them
     to read and write as well as different farming techniques. Some candidates may argue that the
     Catholic Church contributed to the protection of the indigenous populations, citing Bartolome de
     Las Casas.


8.   Evaluate the impact of the religious orders in New France.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the various religious orders that operated in
     New France up to 1800. The impact could be social, economic or political. They should show a
     clear knowledge of the various orders and an understanding of the impact these orders had.
     Candidates might evaluate the impact of religious orders in general, but some orders are likely to
     be specifically identified. The Recollects were one of the earliest orders, arriving in 1622 and
     immediately reaching out to the Huron. By 1630, the Huron saw the Recollects as evil. Jesuits
     became the dominant order in New France. By the 1640s, thousands of Huron and Algonquin
     were converted to Christianity by the Jesuits. Candidates could identify the general purposes of
     the religious orders as conversion and control of the indigenous peoples. Whether either of these
     purposes was accomplished is debatable.

Section 5         Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Evaluate the role of colonial powers in the establishment and expansion of slavery.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the role of colonial powers both in instituting and extending
      slavery in the region within the given period. In doing so, they must address both parts of the
      question, although some imbalance in the treatment of each may be allowed. They may address
      the establishment and the expansion of slavery in discrete groups or they may offer individual
      arguments for them. No approach is specified; however, candidates are expected to offer opinions
      and conclusions that are supported by appropriate evidence. Candidates may evaluate the role of
      colonial powers in establishing slavery of the indigenous populations, which, in most cases, failed.
      Slavery was also established to prevent local indigenous populations from fleeing and to serve the
      economic interests of colonial powers. Candidates may argue that the expansion of slavery from
      Africa was because of the decimation of the indigenous populations. Alternatively, they could
      discuss the introduction of slavery in British North America, which was a response to a shortage of
      labour as well as to British control of the slave trade.


10.   Evaluate the methods and effectiveness of slave resistance in British North America up to 1800.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the strengths and limitations of the methods of slave
      resistance in British North America. They may discuss slave resistance from earliest colonial times
      up to 1800. Candidates must demonstrate a clear understanding of various types of slave
      resistance and make an appraisal of the effectiveness of that resistance. The most common forms
      were working slowly, breaking or losing tools, feigning illness, self-injury, infanticide, running away
      and slave rebellions. Effectiveness of slave resistance is open to interpretation. Some of the
      minor forms of resistance may have led to more accommodating treatment from the owner to end
      the resistance, but it may have led to harsher treatment to crush the will of the slaves. Candidates
      might suggest that slave resistance led to the growth of the abolitionist movement in the North.
      While both parts of the question will be addressed, accept some imbalance in their treatment.

Section 6         Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   Compare and contrast the methods used to gain independence in two Latin American countries.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between two independence
      processes within the given period referring to both processes throughout. No approach is
      specified. They may choose to address the comparisons and contrasts in discrete groups, or they
      may choose to focus on individual arguments. Candidates may compare and contrast some of the
      early political decisions of the independence process, resulting from events in Europe. They could
      compare and contrast the contributions of different social groups, of specific leaders’ initiatives and
      methods, and the different methods by which the independent processes were financed.
      Candidates might also focus on the similarities and differences of the military campaigns and the
      significance of the armed confrontations with Spain. While candidates may refer to some of the
      events leading up to the independence processes, the focus of the question should be on the
      processes of independence.

      Note: Cuban independence is not a valid example.


12.   “Gaining independence improved the economy.” With reference to either the US or one Latin
      American country, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. The response may take any
      position with respect to the question. Factors which may be employed to determine the level of
      improvement may involve trade and investment, increases in territory, acquisition of resources and
      population, elimination of mercantilist restrictions on producers and merchants and the elimination
      of taxes from the mother country. On the other hand, it may be argued that independence led to
      the loss of access to the wealthier colonial power and other colonies in its empire, which may have
      made trade difficult for the independent country. It might also have brought additional costs such
      as defence and protection that had formerly been assumed by the colonial power, as well as led to
      conflicts with neighbouring states as the newly independent state was no longer protected by the
      colonial power.

Section 7         Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   Compare and contrast the Articles of Confederation and the US Constitution of 1787.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences of the specific characteristics of
      the Articles and the Constitution referring to both throughout. They may, for example, choose to
      address the comparisons and contrasts in discrete groups, or they may choose to focus on
      individual arguments. For comparisons, candidates might explain that both documents established
      a government for the United States. Both created a Congress, a method for passing legislation,
      for making amendments, for regulating foreign affairs, declaring war, establishing a post office and
      administering Indian relations. Both divided power between the states and the national
      government. For differences, the Articles had only a unicameral legislative branch of government,
      while the Constitution had three branches: a bicameral legislature, a judicial and an executive.
      The federal government was stronger, could pass taxes, regulate interstate commerce and raise
      an army. Candidates might also discuss the relative ineffectiveness of the Articles when compared
      to the Constitution.


14.   “The War of 1812 was caused by US expansionism and not by disputes over maritime rights.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement by determining whether US
      expansionism or disputes over maritime rights were most responsible for causing the War of 1812.
      Candidates may agree, partially agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions and
      conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound
      argument. Candidates may argue that the desire to seize additional land was the most important
      reason as it would help satisfy the prevailing hunger for land and expansion in the United States
      and eliminate the British presence in Canada. The issue of maritime rights was an important issue
      not only in itself but as a matter of American honour and its recognition as a sovereign state.
      British interference with US trade with Europe was a serious matter, as was British use of force to
      recover its seamen from American ships (even though many of them were naturalized US citizens).

Section 8        United States Civil War: Causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   To what extent did the crises of the 1850s contribute to the outbreak of the Civil War?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the crises of the 1850s
      contributed to the start of the Civil War. Candidates may discuss the events in chronological order
      or in order of suggested importance. While candidates might discuss some issues and events
      prior to 1850 or post 1859 as other contributors to the Civil War, the focus must be on evaluating
      the importance of the events of the 1850s. The Compromise of 1850, with its five different acts,
      might be seen as the beginning of the increased tensions between North and South. Other events
      could be the publication of Uncle’s Tom Cabin, the Kansas-Nebraska Act and Bleeding Kansas,
      the Dred Scott case and the Lincoln-Douglas debates. John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry may
      also be perceived as a crisis due to Southern reaction to it. The South’s reaction to the growth of
      abolitionism in the North may also be referred to.


16.   To what extent did Reconstruction improve the lives of African Americans in the southern US?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Reconstruction improved
      the lives of African Americans in the southern US. Candidates could focus on the social, economic
      and political conditions faced by African Americans after the Civil War and determine whether
      Reconstruction improved these conditions. Most candidates are likely to indicate that
      Reconstruction did not improve the lives of African Americans, but some could argue that there
      were some improvements. Candidates are likely to discuss the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th
      Amendments, The Freedmen’s Bureau and the Military Reconstruction Act. By 1870, almost all
      the early successes were reversed. African Americans were denied the right to vote and black
      codes were established and enforced by the Ku Klux Klan. Many former slaves became
      sharecroppers, which was not much better than slavery. When Reconstruction ended in 1877,
      African-Americans were no longer slaves, but they were second-class citizens.

Section 9         The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Discuss the reasons for changes in the role of women in two countries in the Americas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of arguments and
      factors to explain the reasons for changes in the role of women within this period. These reasons
      may cover a wide range of possibilities, such as economic, religious, social, scientific, philosophical
      and political factors among others. Industrialization after 1865 was an important factor, as well as
      social and political movements. Responses will provide a range of reasons and not merely focus
      all their attention on one reason such as women’s roles in the First World War. Candidates who
      wish to undertake this question should choose a country where there is adequate material to
      provide a range of reasons. If a candidate chooses to select a country in which there was little
      change in the status of women, they must provide a comprehensive analysis of the reasons for the
      lack of change.


18.   Evaluate the level of success achieved by either Theodore Roosevelt or Wilfrid Laurier or one
      Latin American leader during this period.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the degree of success achieved by one of the stated leaders
      or a Latin American leader during the period by making an appraisal of the strengths and
      limitations of their actions. The question requires that the chosen leader’s policies both domestic
      and foreign be considered, but not necessarily equally. These policies may relate to economics,
      legal issues, social and cultural initiatives, or constitutional matters among others. Foreign policy
      may relate to, for example, trade, alliances, conflicts, and national prestige. Success may be
      judged by the impact that the policies achieved, the degree to which they fulfilled the aims of the
      leader and/or the support that they achieved from the populace.

Section 10        Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   “The expansionist foreign policies of the US were driven by economics rather than ideology.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that expansionist foreign
      policies of the US were driven by economics rather than ideology. This question deals with the
      reasons for the expansion of the United States beyond its own borders and its acquisition of an
      overseas empire. After 1880, US business was concerned about the need for markets and
      sources of raw materials. Their expansion into Hawaii and the acquisition of territory in the
      Caribbean after the Spanish-American war was supported by US business interests. The work of
      Admiral Mahan in supporting a larger navy, overseas bases and the Panama Canal had a firm
      economic as well as strategic purpose. There were ideological reasons as well, as many in the US
      saw imperialism as their chance to spread US values, help civilize other states, and establish the
      US as a world power. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
      opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   “Wilson’s failure to gain US ratification of the Treaty of Versailles was due to his unwillingness to
      compromise”. To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Wilson’s unwillingness to
      compromise led to the US Senate’s rejection of the Treaty of Versailles. Candidates should
      demonstrate a clear understanding of the reasons why the US Senate failed to ratify the Treaty of
      Versailles. They may refer to Wilson’s refusal to compromise on any points of the Treaty of
      Versailles when it was presented to the US Senate. Republican Senator Lodge, chairman of the
      Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Reservationists had several objections to the treaty
      and Wilson’s refusal to compromise ensured their opposition. This left Democrats with no room to
      negotiate with the Republican majority. Candidates may distinguish between political and
      ideological reasons, although it is not required. They may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement, but their opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported with
      appropriate evidence.

Section 11       The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Discuss the nature and significance of Mexico’s 1917 Constitution.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the nature and significance of the 1917
      Mexican Constitution. The 1917 Constitution was a response to the desire to modernize the state
      and achieve compromise between the different factions of the Mexican Revolution. Candidates
      may indicate that the Constitution was influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution and the
      Enlightenment and that it established popular sovereignty, freedom of thought and of association.
      They may also refer specifically to Articles 3, 27, 123 and 130 of the Constitution. Each of these
      attempted to resolve a major issue in Mexico. Article 3 dealt with secular education and Article 27
      with land reform and foreign land ownership. Article 123 provided some of the most advanced
      labour laws of the time and Article 130 dealt with the Catholic Church. Each of these had a major
      impact on Mexico’s future.


22.   “By 1940, Lázaro Cárdenas had achieved all of his aims.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the suggestion that Cárdenas had
      achieved all his aims by 1940. They may choose to address each of his aims individually and
      gauge the extent to which each was achieved, or they may choose to focus on the aims that were
      realised and those that were not in discrete groups. While no approach is specified, candidates
      are expected to offer opinions or conclusions that are supported by appropriate evidence.
      Cárdenas aimed at modernizing and industrializing Mexico. He also attempted to implement
      various parts of the 1917 Constitution such as land redistribution, increased workers’ rights and
      improved secular education. Cárdenas tried to integrate the indigenous populations by designing
      specific education and health programmes. Whether he was successful at these is debatable.

Section 12        The Great Depression and the Americas (mid-1920s–1939)

23.   “The Great Depression was a significant challenge to democracy.” Discuss with reference to
      one Latin American country between 1929 and 1939.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range of factors indicating
      whether the Great Depression was a significant challenge to democracy in one Latin American
      country. They should demonstrate a clear understanding of the actions taken to end the Great
      Depression and evaluate whether those actions adversely affected democracy. Conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence. Candidates may argue that
      the Great Depression contributed to economic instability and rising levels of unemployment that in
      turn led to social unrest. In many countries in the region this unrest led to political repression,
      which included the banning of trade unions and the persecution of some political parties of the left.
      Candidates may argue that the Great Depression contributed to greater social inequality thus
      threatening the egalitarian concepts of democracy. The Great Depression led many people to look
      for solutions to their social and economic grievances to political parties of the far left and far right,
      as well as the military. All sides posed challenges to democracy.


24.   Evaluate the impact of the Great Depression on women in one country in the Americas.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the Great Depression on women in any one
      country in the region. Candidates may, for example, choose to address the beneficial and
      detrimental effects in discrete groups, or they may choose to focus on individual arguments in their
      assessment. Candidates may argue that more women, both single and married, entered the
      workforce to help their home economies. However, wages were low and employment
      opportunities were often temporary or seasonal. Some candidates may argue that the working
      opportunities during the Great Depression did not offer women significant prospects for
      advancement but nonetheless, it became a starting point for a more active participation in the
      labour market and empowered them to make further social and political demands. Candidates
      may assess the impact of the Great Depression on different racial groups of women within the
      selected country. In some cases, men abandoned their families due to their unemployment,
      leaving women as head of the household.

Section 13       The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   Evaluate the reasons for US use of atomic weapons against Japan.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the decision of the US to deploy atomic
      weaponry against Japan. The reasons may cover a range of issues, be they political, military,
      strategic, emotional or scientific. Candidates might include the Japanese refusal to surrender and
      the American fear that an invasion of Japan would be very costly (financially and in the number of
      lives lost). They may also refer to the cost of building the bomb, the desire for revenge for Pearl
      Harbor, and the desire to show American power to the Soviets. The response should not discuss
      the results of the bombing on the war or subsequent events, nor should it describe the immediate
      effects of the bomb.


26.   “During the Second World War, the economies of countries in the Americas were transformed.”
      With reference to two countries, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the Second World War
      brought notable change to the economy in two countries. Any two countries from the region may
      be discussed. The concept of change involves both short-and long-term changes. These changes
      may be either positive or negative in nature and may comprise a wide range of issues depending
      on the countries chosen. Issues covered may include industrialization, financial structures,
      government involvement, changes in the labour force, trade and balance of payments, the
      development of new products, technologies and/or movement of population. The changes that
      resulted are largely based on the extraordinary increase in demand for all types of products both
      raw and manufactured that the war created. Many suppliers of goods were no longer able to do so
      and the needs of the combatants had to be met from other regions.

Section 14        Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   Compare and contrast the responses of Latin American populist leaders in two countries to the
      challenges they faced.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the responses of two Latin
      American populist leaders to the challenges they faced within the given period referring to both
      leaders throughout. Candidates may, for example, choose to address the comparisons and
      contrasts in discrete groups, or they may choose to focus on individual arguments. Candidates
      may address the responses of two leaders to the economic problems in their countries by
      comparing and contrasting protectionist policies, nationalization of resources and foreign
      companies, land redistribution, the extent to which infrastructure was developed and
      industrialization policies. Candidates may refer to social challenges such as illiteracy, malnutrition
      and social inequality in order to compare and contrast responses including educational reforms
      and improvements in healthcare. Policies addressing the role of women and minorities,
      urbanization and housing may also be addressed. Other areas for comparison could be labour
      legislation and trade union policies, relations with the Church, and foreign policy.


28.   “The rise of guerrilla movements in Latin America can mainly be attributed to economic factors.”
      With reference to one Latin American country, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that economic factors were the
      main factor in the rise of guerrilla movements in one country during the given period. The focus
      should be on the role of economic factors; however, candidates should also discuss the
      contributions of other factors, such as political issues or the role of external forces, and may then
      conclude these played a more significant part in the rise of guerrilla movements. Candidates may
      argue that economic conditions such as unemployment, poverty and inflation contributed to the rise
      of guerrilla movements. They may refer to US influence and intervention, domestic political
      corruption and repression, and Marxist influence as other factors. Candidates may agree, partly
      agree or disagree with the statement, but their opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported with appropriate evidence.

Section 15       Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   To what extent was Johnson’s Great Society successfully implemented?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Johnson successfully
      implemented his Great Society domestic policies. This programme launched the war on poverty in
      the US and attempted to improve the quality of life. He passed important legislation in healthcare,
      education, housing, civil rights and in relation to the environment. His programmes encountered
      obstacles from interest groups who felt that they threatened their influence or who feared the
      expansion of government power. The success of the programmes was limited by the Vietnam
      War, which drained large amounts of money from the programmes, created inflation, which
      weakened the economy and distracted Johnson from maintaining the programmes. Overall
      however, he made fundamental changes in American domestic policy particularly in civil rights,
      healthcare, education and employment. Success may be judged by the degree to which his
      proposed polices were implemented or carried out.


30.   Evaluate the impact on Canadian society of the governments of Pearson and Trudeau.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact that each leader had on Canadian society,
      weighing up the strengths and limitations of their administrations. Lester Pearson was prime
      minister from 1963–1968. Candidates may refer to his rebuilding of the Liberal Party, his
      leadership in a coalition government, and his social policies, such as healthcare and a pension
      plan. He also restructured the Canadian military, acted more strongly on the issue of Quebec
      separatism, approved the new Maple Leaf flag for Canada and kept Canada out of Vietnam.
      Pierre Trudeau was Prime Minister from 1968–1979 and 1980–1984. Candidates may refer to his
      handling of the FLQ Crisis and his use of the War Measures Act to resolve it. He gained passage
      of the Official Languages Act and led movements for constitutional reform, which brought the
      patriation of the constitution in 1982 as well as a Charter of Rights.

Section 16       The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Discuss the reasons for the changing nature of US involvement in Vietnam from 1954 to 1975.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the changing nature of
      US involvement in Vietnam during the given period. Opinions or conclusions should be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence. The changing nature could be interpreted as the
      amount of involvement as well as the type of involvement. The fear of communism and the
      containment policy were responsible for limited financial and military support for South Vietnam
      from 1954 through to 1960. Kennedy (1961–1963) greatly increased the number of military
      advisors and implemented the strategic hamlet programme. Using the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution,
      Johnson (1963–1968) changed American involvement to combat troops. This Americanization of
      the war significantly increased the number of US troops. The anti-war movement, the Tet
      Offensive and the presidential campaign of 1968 led Nixon (1969–1974) to adopt the policy of
      Vietnamization, decreasing US involvement. Candidates may also discuss the changing nature of
      strategy from heavy reliance on land forces to increased use of air power because of the anti-war
      movement and desire to limit US casualties.


32.   Discuss the reasons for, and the impact of, the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the US and Panama to
      negotiate the treaty and then discuss the impact of the treaty for both countries. Candidates must
      address both parts of the question, but accept some imbalance in the treatment of each. Opinions
      or conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence. Reasons for
      the treaty could include anti-US riots in Panama, increasing tensions between the two countries
      and President Carter’s desire to improve relations with Panama, specifically, and Latin America in
      general. Panamanian reasons include wanting to end US domination, a desire to control the
      important canal and to benefit economically. The treaty ended the Panama Canal Zone in 1977
      and gave the canal to Panama in 1999. The US retained the right to defend the canal.
      Other effects were increased nationalism in Panama, better US-Panama relations as well as better
      US-Latin American relations in general. In the US, the treaty caused some political discord and a
      dislike of Carter for “giving away” the canal.

Section 17        Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   To what extent did indigenous peoples in the Americas achieve their civil rights in the period
      after 1945?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that indigenous peoples in the
      Americas achieved their civil rights in the period after 1945. In this context, civil rights may have a
      broad interpretation to include differences in the societies chosen for discussion. Civil rights may
      include economic and political rights, legal rights, property and land titles, access to education and
      social services, and support for the maintenance of culture and language. Racial and ethnic
      discrimination has also been an issue for indigenous peoples. This discrimination has led to
      limited access to jobs, social programmes, housing and education, all of which have severely
      affected the civil rights of indigenous peoples. Candidates must examine the ways in which
      governments or other groups have worked to limit, overcome or eliminate examples of this
      discrimination that has affected the well-being of indigenous peoples. Candidates will state a
      position about the relative level of success of the indigenous peoples in the countries chosen and
      provide relevant supporting content.


34.   Discuss the importance of US Supreme Court rulings in advancing the civil rights movement up
      to 1980.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of Supreme Court rulings that affected the
      Civil Rights Movement up to 1980. They should demonstrate a clear understanding of the impact
      of Supreme Court rulings. Candidates could argue some rulings advanced the movement, while
      others hindered it. Candidates could discuss rulings affecting other minority groups beyond
      African-Americans. Conclusions should be clearly presented and supported by appropriate
      evidence. Most candidates will conclude that the Supreme Court rulings were paramount in
      advancing the civil rights movement, but accept alternative arguments that are well supported.
      Candidates may refer to Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), even though it is pre-1945, which legalized
      discrimination, as an impetus for the civil rights movement. Other cases that candidates may
      discuss include Brown v. Topeka I (1954) and II (1955), Browder v. Gayle (1956), The Heart of
      Atlanta Motel v. United States (1964) Swann v. Mecklenburg (1971) and California v. Bakke
      (1978).

Section 18       The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Compare and contrast the factors that contributed to the democratization of two Latin American
      countries between 1980 and 2005.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the factors leading to the
      transition to democracy of two countries in the given period referring to both countries throughout.
      Candidates may, for example, choose to address the comparisons and contrasts in discrete
      groups, or they may choose to focus on individual arguments. In doing so, they may refer to both
      internal and external contributing factors. Candidates may refer to economic factors such as
      foreign debt, recession, unemployment and inflation. They might discuss the loss of legitimacy of
      authoritarian leaders due to economic failures, violation of human rights or foreign policy failures,
      which contributed to demands for democratization. Candidates might also refer to the influence of
      the Catholic Church, the ending of the Cold War and the role of trade unions and businesses. The
      factors that contributed to democratization and their relative importance will vary depending on the
      countries chosen.


36.   Discuss the significance of the challenges faced by two Latin American countries following their
      transition to democracy.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the challenges faced by two Latin
      American countries following their transition to democracy. They should demonstrate a clear
      understanding of the many and diverse challenges faced by new democratic countries during the
      given period. The countries chosen must have previously been non-democratic. Depending on
      the countries chosen, economic challenges may include poverty, economic dependence, inflation
      and hyperinflation and rising foreign debt. Candidates may argue that the democratic governments
      faced the problems of social inequity, such as illiteracy, uneven distribution of land and housing.
      These issues were long standing in the history of many Latin American countries and it became a
      challenge to address them when combined with other economic problems. Other challenges that
      might be discussed are creation/restoration of a constitution, the restoration of personal freedoms
      and holding free elections. Multiple parties often resulted in a divided legislature, weakening
      governments’ ability to act. Possible examples are Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay but other
      relevant cases are acceptable.
