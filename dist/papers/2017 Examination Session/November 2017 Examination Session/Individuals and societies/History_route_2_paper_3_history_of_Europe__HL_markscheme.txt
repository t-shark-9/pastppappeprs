Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is possible
to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all
implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or
success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme.
Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.
If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

            and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
          • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and there is a clear
            understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used to
            support the analysis/evaluation.
          • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of different
            perspectives.
          • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and the response
            argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9     • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are
            only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.

Section 1       Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

   1. With reference to England, to what extent were Henry II’s reforms to local government more
      significant than his reforms to central government?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      reforms to local government during the reign of Henry II were more significant than those to
      central government. Candidates may discuss local and central government separately, or they
      may offer a comparison of the impact of various reforms on central and local government.
      Responses may focus on the law and administration, and on the role of the justiciar. There may
      also be consideration of the standardization of common law and customary law and the impact of
      the activities of royal justices in bringing order to the localities. Central government reform
      focused on royal finances to restore royal authority and to ensure this was maintained during
      Henry’s absences.



   2. Discuss the causes and consequences of the wars between Philip II (Philip Augustus) and
      King John.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes and
      consequences of the wars between Philip II and John. Candidates may consider the long- and
      short-term causes, or they may focus more on short-term reasons why John and Philip were at
      war. Causes could include the issue of the succession to the English throne and Philip’s
      intervention in this dispute, the difficult relationship between vassal and overlord and constant
      border tension between the Angevin Empire and France. For consequences, the focus may be
      for both Philip and John personally, the results for France and England or a combination of both.
      John lost prestige at home and was unable to withstand the demands of his barons (Magna
      Carta). For Philip, victory increased both his personal authority as king and France became a
      significant and prosperous power after the acquisition of Normandy. Candidates need not offer
      equal coverage of causes and consequences, but both aspects must be a feature of the
      response.

Section 2       Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

   3. “Christian doctrine and teaching were the most important reasons for hostility to Muslims in
      medieval Europe.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Christian doctrine and teaching were the most important reasons for hostility to Muslims in
      medieval Europe. Candidates may agree, partially agree or disagree with the statement, but they
      must discuss this key issue. In fomenting hostility to Muslims, Christian teaching held that
      Muhammad was a false prophet and a heathen. Christian teaching also argued for the need to
      defend the Christian churches in the East and restore the Holy Sepulchre. However, there may
      also be some consideration of other factors, such as the Crusades stimulating hostility, as well as
      stories of Muslim atrocities told by key churchmen such as Bernard of Clairvaux to generate
      support for the Crusades. Some may argue that hostility was caused by the self-interest of
      monarchs (such as Alfonso X), who utilized the spirit of the Reconquista to increase their
      authority and end the coexistence of the two faiths.



   4. Evaluate the reasons why Jews were often blamed for the Black Death.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons why the Jews were
      blamed for the Black Death. These reasons could include the fact that the Jewish populations
      suffered fewer deaths, largely because they were isolated in ghettos, the spreading of rumours
      that they had poisoned water supplies (rumours that were linked to the notion of an international
      Jewish conspiracy). Some candidates may argue that individual self-interest led many to blame
      the Jews, for example, those who sought to avoid payment of debts to Jewish money-lenders. It
      may also be argued that the authorities, to alleviate antagonism towards their inability to resolve
      the crisis, encouraged the belief that Jews had caused the Black Death. The confessions of
      some Jews lent credence to the rumours of responsibility. Answers must focus specifically on
      why Jews were blamed for the Black Death and not why there was a general anti-Semitic
      attitude, although that may be considered a significant contributory factor.
                                                  –6–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3        Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

   5. “Edward II’s removal from the throne in 1327 was the result of his failures as a military leader.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the assertion
      that Edward II’s deposition was because of his unsuccessful military leadership. When
      considering this issue, which was a key role of medieval kings, candidates may refer to
      Bannockburn and the humiliating treaty with Scotland, or the military failure in Gascony. Other
      factors that might be discussed include his relationship with favourites such as Gaveston and the
      Despensers; their domination of patronage aroused the hostility of key magnates and of
      parliament. Edward’s weak and unreliable character may also be considered. Queen
      Isabella’s—and her favourite, Mortimer’s—actions, and their control of the young Edward, who
      was perceived to be a suitable successor, may also have been crucial to the deposition.



   6. Evaluate the reasons why ducal Burgundy became a major power in the late 14th and early
      15th centuries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of the various
      reasons why Burgundy emerged as a major power. Reasons may be political and dynastic, and
      may include the expansion of territory in the Low Countries. The acquisition of titles, such as the
      Duke of Brabant or Counts of Hainault and Luxemburg, increased the power of the dynasty.
      Various marriages also benefitted the dynasty. The endowment of Burgundy by Philip in 1363
      began the process of political independence from France. Burgundy’s actions in the Hundred
      Years War also increased its importance in relation to a weakened France. Economically
      Burgundy was prosperous with key cloth towns such as Bruges and Ghent, as well as developed
      financial structures such as credit facilities and banking houses. Burgundy was an international
      trading centre that benefitted from tolls on trade and made it enormously wealthy.
                                                  –7–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4        The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

   7. “The wealth of Italian cities was the most significant factor in the development of the
      Renaissance.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance
      of wealth in the development of the Renaissance. Candidates may focus on the comparative
      importance of a range of Italian cities such as Florence and Milan and assess the significance of
      their wealth against a range of other factors, for example, the Church, the role of individuals
      and/or the classical heritage. Wealth allowed for investment in the arts and encouraged
      originality. Rivalry between the cities also encouraged support for the arts, as rulers
      commissioned works of art to enhance pride in their cities. There may be some discussion of the
      role of the Church in commissioning artists. Proximity to the remains of classical antiquity may
      be considered vital as many ideas were taken from the classical past. The importance of
      individual artists might be discussed, as it was their innovations that stimulated development.



   8. Evaluate the impact of the Renaissance on one European country excluding Italy, Burgundy and
      Germany.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the Renaissance on
      one European country that existed between 1400 and 1600, except Burgundy or those areas now
      incorporated into Italy and Germany. There may be consideration of the direct impact on the
      arts, the impact on political developments and ideas (such as the creation of a Renaissance
      monarchy), or there may be a focus on social and economic developments. When considering
      the impact of the Renaissance on ideas, the spread of humanism may be considered. In some
      countries, the Renaissance contributed to the growth of secular education whereas in others, in
      Spain for example, the Renaissance had a limited impact.
                                                   –8–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 5       The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

   9. Compare and contrast Spanish and Portuguese motives for exploration up to 1550.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of similarities and differences between
      Spanish and Portuguese motives for exploration overseas, referring to both countries throughout
      the response. There are several motives that may be considered, for example, religious motives,
      economic motives, the desire to increase political power and/or the desire of individuals for fame.
      Religious motives were common to both countries but the level of its significance varied. Both
      were motivated by the search for wealth, as both lacked resources such as gold and silver. Both
      countries, wanted to increase the status of their nations, particularly Portugal because of its size
      and lack of power. A key difference might be the role of individuals: in Portugal, Henry the
      Navigator sought fame and encouraged exploration whereas in Spain it was the monarchy that
      motivated exploration. There does not have to be a balance in the number of similarities and
      differences.



   10. Evaluate the economic impact on Europe of the voyages of exploration.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic impact the voyages of
      exploration had on Europe. Candidates may focus on the voyages of one or more countries and
      they may suggest that the impact was largely positive, largely negative or somewhere between.
      Areas to consider may include the impact of new sources of bullion, the influx of which contributed
      to inflation in many parts of Europe throughout the first half of the 16th century and had a substantial
      impact on the living standards of many social groups. There may also be consideration of changing
      trade patterns within the continent due to the arrival of new raw materials. Some candidates may
      argue that there was a rise in entrepreneurial activity, as traders sought to capitalize from access
      to goods that were not subject to the tariffs of the overland routes from Asia and through the Middle
      East.
                                                   –9–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 6        The Reformation (1517–1572)

   11. Evaluate the reasons for criticism of the Catholic Church at the start of the 16th century.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for criticism of the
      Church. It must be noted that the question is about the start of the 16th century and not the start
      of the Reformation and as such, issues including the condition of the papacy, the character of
      popes, for example Alexander VI, and the poor physical condition of Rome as the centre of the
      western Christian faith may be considered. There was much criticism that bishops were often
      either poorly educated or too involved in politics and secular affairs. The quality of the clergy
      especially parish clergy, the spiritual condition of the Church, the perceived problems of
      absenteeism, nepotism, simony and anticlericalism, and the criticism from humanist writers may
      be included in candidates’ responses. Candidates may choose to deal with each factor
      separately or group them into categories.



   12. Evaluate the reasons for the spread of Protestant ideas in England or Scotland or France or
       the Netherlands.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of a range of reasons why Protestant
      ideas spread in one of the above-mentioned countries. Candidates may deal with the reasons
      discretely or they may order them into groups, for example, religious reasons, political reasons,
      social reasons or even, perhaps, reasons linked to the geography of the country being evaluated.
      Political factors could include the influence of nationalism and dislike of the powers of the papacy.
      Economic factors could include the economic condition of the chosen exemplar or the role of
      itinerant merchants in spreading Protestant ideas. For example, the declining position of some
      groups in the Netherlands encouraged them to take up Protestantism. Social factors could
      include the emphasis on individual faith that was appealing to the more literate or the view that
      Protestant thought encouraged social change or even revolution.

Section 7       Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

   13. Discuss the view that the Scientific Revolution overturned accepted belief systems.

       The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact on
       accepted beliefs of the Scientific Revolution. Candidates may choose to support or challenge
       the presented view, or they may find the middle ground and suggest that the Scientific
       Revolution had some, albeit limited, effects on accepted belief systems. Candidates may argue
       that the overturning of accepted belief systems happened only very slowly and depended on
       what part of society was being discussed. Examples of enduring superstition remained with the
       last example of a woman being executed for witchcraft in Europe taking place in Switzerland in
       1782. Some may argue that the Church remained strong and it was not until the 18th century
       that these ideas became widespread during the Enlightenment. There may be some discussion
       of the work of key figures such as Newton, Harvey, Galileo and how it affected belief systems.



   14. “Absolutist monarchs had few limits on the exercise of their power.” With reference to two
       absolutist monarchs, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of statement that
      absolutist monarchs had few limits on the exercise of his and/or her power. Candidates must
      focus on any two absolutist monarchs, from a single country at different times or from two
      different countries at the same or at different times. Candidates may take a comparative
      approach or discuss each monarch separately. Limits could be the problems of effectively
      controlling a large territory due to poor transport and communications. The need to raise taxes
      often led to compromise by absolutist monarchs. In support of the assertion, there may be
      reference to the Divine Right of Kings, the power that control of patronage gave, or the role of
      standing armies. There may be some discussion of the fact that absolutist monarchs provided
      stability and the extent of their power was regarded as acceptable for this reason.

Section 8       The French Revolution and Napoleon (1774–1815)

   15. Discuss the social and economic impact of the Revolution in France.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social and
      economic impact of the Revolution. They could choose to consider the short-term impact or the
      impact over the whole period between 1789 and 1799. Socially, impact may include those
      factors that affected the Church or the social structure (the overthrow of the Ancien Régime and
      the increasing power of the bourgeoisie and the emergence of a property-owning peasantry).
      Another social impact was the greater political prominence of women, especially in the early
      stages. Some historians argue that ultimately the revolution led to a conservative social
      settlement with the middle classes and peasants now having a stake in a stable society.
      Economically, the impact could be discerned via crises such as hyperinflation caused by the
      assignat system, or perhaps the cost of revolutionary wars. It may also be argued that the
      revolution and wider political uncertainty undermined economic stability.



   16. Evaluate the reasons for Napoleon’s military defeat.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the different factors that contributed
      to Napoleon’s defeat during the period up to 1815. Defeat could include the retreat from Russia
      in 1812, the military and diplomatic events that led to his abdication in April 1814 and defeat at
      Waterloo in June 1815. Factors could include the scale of the Allied opposition, the extensive
      nature of his campaigns (he chose to undertake the Russian campaign while the conflict in Spain
      continued) and the oppressive nature of his rule, which led to rebellions in conquered territories.
      Some candidates may focus on key strategic and military decisions that led to defeat in Russia,
      at Leipzig and, finally, at Waterloo. They may also consider non-military factors that contributed
      to military defeat, including his refusal to sign a peace in 1813, and a decline in domestic support
      following the invasion of France from Germany and Spain in 1813–1814.

Section 9       France (1815–1914)

   17. Compare and contrast the policies of Louis XVIII and Charles X.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of similarities and differences in the
      policies of the restored Bourbon kings, referring to the policies of both monarchs throughout and
      covering the period between 1814 and 1830. Candidates may focus on constitutional or religious
      policies, the treatment of political opponents and foreign relations. Comparisons may include the
      fact that both accepted the need for an element of democracy and neither attempted a return to
      the Ancien Régime. Both, however, believed in the Divine Right of Kings and both gave some
      latitude to groups who wanted revenge for events during the Revolution. For contrast, Louis
      XVIII was more conciliatory and worked harder not to antagonize French opinion, while Charles X
      was willing to restrict press freedom and, to some extent, democracy. Charles X was more
      influenced by the Church than Louis XVIII, who had a more successful foreign policy, through
      which France was (by 1823) once again accepted as a major power.



   18. Evaluate the reasons why the Second Republic was overthrown.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the various reasons for the overthrow
      of the Second Republic and weigh up their significance. Louis Napoleon’s coup d’état of
      December 1851 effectively marked the end of the Second Republic. Reasons could include the
      lack of support nationally, the alienation of key supporters (June Days, 1848) and divisions on the
      Left, which undermined support for the Republic. The actions and ambitions of Louis Napoleon
      were key to the overthrow. Louis was underestimated by many politicians and played off one
      faction against the other. Further, he excelled at fostering a positive image, presenting himself as
      defender of the Revolution while at the same time using the appeal of his name to offer a return
      to the glory days of empire. He was thus able to gain support from left and right and to also offer
      strong government.

Section 10      Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

   19. “The problems of urban poverty drove social reform in Victorian Britain.” To what extent do you
       agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      social reforms in Victorian Britain were driven mainly by urban poverty. Candidates may identify
      examples of social reform in Victorian Britain as a starting point and consider the extent to which
      urban poverty stimulated these reforms. These may include acts to regulate working hours in
      factories/shops (Factory Acts of 1833 and 1847), to increase the quality of urban housing and
      end homelessness (Artisans’ Dwellings Act,1875) or to improve infrastructure and public health
      (Local Government Act, 1861). Other factors that stimulated social reform may include religious
      conscience, for example Shaftesbury’s Coal Mines Act (1842). Improved conditions in the
      industrialized towns of the North were often driven by civic pride.



   20. “The emergence of the Labour Party had a limited impact on British politics before 1914.” To
       what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that up to
      1914 the British Labour Party had little impact on British politics. Candidates may examine
      factors separately and gauge the significance of each, or they may choose to look at several
      factors that support the statement collectively before examining the opposite arguments. In
      support of the statement it could be argued that the Labour Party had limited influence on the
      Liberal government and insufficient support to be considered a viable alternative government with
      the two traditional parties continuing to dominate politics. Counter arguments could include the
      growing support for the Labour Party in the country with increasing number of local groups being
      formed, and its links with the Trades Union Congress (TUC)—especially during the “Great
      Unrest”. It could also be argued that the Liberal government only survived between 1910 and
      1914 because of Labour support in Parliament.

Section 11       Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

   21. Evaluate the causes and consequences of the 1848 to 1849 Revolutions in Italy.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the causes and the consequences of
      the 1848 to 1849 Revolutions in Italy. Causes may include specific local grievances, for example
      Milanese hostility to Austrian restrictions and Sicilian grievances about Bourbon misrule. There
      was also a widespread general resentment against Austrian rule and influence, leading to
      support for nationalist movements such as “Young Italy”. Some candidates may argue that
      economic grievances were a factor. Consequences may be said to include the failure of all the
      revolutions following the collapse of the Roman Republic, the restoration of Austrian power and
      the restoration of the Bourbons. In the longer term the consequences of 1848 and 1849 were
      increased support for the notion of Italian unification and a realization that there was a need for
      the support of a friendly foreign power to counteract Austrian power.



   22. “The Wars of Unification were the most significant factor in the establishment of the
       German Empire.” Discuss with reference to the period up to 1871.

      Candidates are required to offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of the Wars
      of Unification in the establishment of the German Empire by 1871. The wars, including the
      Danish War of 1864, the Austro–Prussian War of 1866 and the Franco–Prussian War of 1870 to
      1871, can be discussed collectively or separately. Other factors include, economic factors and
      Bismarck’s leadership. Prussia was the leading economic power in Germany and the Zollverein
      linked many states to Prussia, as such, they were more willing to accept the Empire. Bismarck’s
      political skills enabled him to manipulate events, presenting Prussia as a supporter of German
      nationalism in Denmark, neutralizing Austria and using the international situation in 1869 and
      1870 to provoke France into war and to gain the support of the South German states. These
      events took place against a background of growing German nationalism, providing the climate
      within which the establishment of the German Empire could take place.

Section 12      Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–
                1924)

   23. “The reforms of Alexander II were mainly aimed at preserving Russian autocracy.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of what Alexander
      II hoped to achieve by implementing reforms. Candidates may argue that the reforms were
      aimed at modernizing Russia and that Alexander II was a genuine liberal much influenced by
      Western ideas. Others may argue that the aim was to modernize Russia to strengthen
      autocracy. Indeed, their limited nature suggest that Alexander’s main aim was the preservation
      of autocracy. When discussing each reform, candidates may consider how it might strengthen
      autocracy. For example, the Emancipation Edict was aimed at both modernization of agriculture
      and a reduction of peasant unrest (Reform from Above). The establishment of the Zemstva and
      Duma could be suggested as a move toward liberal democracy or that, because they were
      dominated by the nobility, they were a means to extend central authority to the regions. Both
      educational and legal reforms could be considered as attempts at westernization and
      modernization but both had limits.



   24. Discuss the view that the Provisional Government collapsed because of the power of the Soviets.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that
      led to the collapse of the Provisional Government in October/November 1917. Some may argue
      that the Provisional Government was weakened initially because of Dual Power, but that its
      overthrow was the result of a coup carried out by the Bolsheviks. Other factors that may have
      undermined the Provisional Government were its lack of legitimacy (it was self-appointed).
      Additionally, its failure to implement popular policies, such as dealing with the land question and
      the decision to continue with the war, was in contrast to Bolshevik policies of Peace, Land and
      Bread. There may be consideration of the extent of popular support for the Provisional
      Government by October 1917; it was only able to survive the Kornilov affair with the help of the
      Red Guards, whereas the Bolsheviks had majorities on the Petrograd and Moscow Soviets.

Section 13       Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

   25. “The Congress of Berlin (1878) was the greatest achievement of European diplomacy between
       1871 and 1914.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      1878 Congress of Berlin was the highpoint of European diplomacy. Some may focus on the
      Congress itself, others may compare the Congress against other events or factors that had a
      positive impact on European diplomacy. It could be argued that the Congress achieved the
      resolution of tensions over the Eastern Question avoiding conflict particularly between Russia
      and Austria-Hungary and avoided war in the Balkans for several decades. Alternatively, it could
      be argued that it stored up tensions for the future by allowing Austria control over Bosnia and
      Herzegovina. The hostility of Russia contributed to the establishment of the alliance system and
      ultimately the First World War. Some may argue that there were other greater diplomatic
      achievements such as the resolution of the two Moroccan crises.



   26. “The failure to manage the international crisis of July 1914 led to the outbreak of the
       First World War.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      outbreak of the First World War was the result of the failure to manage the July Crisis of 1914.
      The key crisis must be discussed; however, the extent of this discussion may vary based on each
      candidate’s interpretation of events. Some may focus almost entirely on the events of the July
      Crisis whereas others may seek to place it in the wider context and offer a comprehensive
      assessment of other factors, for example militarism, colonial rivalry or the alliance system. Some
      may argue that failure to manage the crisis brought the alliance system into play, escalating a
      crisis in the Balkans into a European and later world war. Some may also point out that previous
      crises such as Morocco or Bosnia had been successfully managed and war avoided.

Section 14      European states in the inter-war years (1918–1939)

   27. To what extent do you agree that Hitler was able to consolidate his power, by August 1934,
       because he had the support of the German people?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      German people, by and large, supported Hitler. Responses may examine levels of support,
      referring to electoral support and the results of plebiscites. Other factors that may be considered
      significant could include, legal methods used to consolidate power such as the Enabling Bill or
      the policy of Gleichschaltung, the use of force against Communists, SPD deputies and the SA on
      the Night of the Long Knives or gaining the support of elites including the Reichswehr. Some
      may argue that Hitler’s consolidation of power was possible because of a combination of all these
      factors with each being more significant at different stages. Some may place events in context
      arguing that consolidation was because of fear of revolution or the desire for strong government
      combined with Hitler’s personal popularity.



   28. Evaluate the successes and failures of Primo de Rivera’s government from 1923 to 1930.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the successes and failures of Primo
      de Rivera’s government in the given period. They may elect to examine these two issues
      separately, or they may choose to draw links between specific factors. In doing this, they are
      likely to identify the problems confronting Spain and Primo de Rivera’s attempt to resolve them.
      Problems included weak and corrupt governments, the threat posed by regional separatism,
      especially in Catalonia, a weak economy and undeveloped infrastructure, high unemployment,
      extreme social divisions and colonial weakness. Some candidates may wish to set a context by
      discussing how Primo de Rivera came to power in a pronunciamiento with the tacit support of
      Alfonso XIII and how, despite his attempts to establish a power base (the Unión Patriótica), he
      still relied on the army, Church and nobility. Ultimately, he had no real basis for stable
      government, limiting his attempts at reform.

Section 15      Versailles to Berlin: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

   29. “Italian foreign policy was inconsistent in the period between 1922 and 1940.” To what extent do
       you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement. They
      are required to cover the whole period of Mussolini’s regime. Candidates may argue that
      Mussolini had consistent goals and used consistent methods to achieve them. Alternatively, they
      may argue that he had clear goals—restoring Italian prestige, revising the post-war settlement
      and expanding Italian influence and territory in the Mediterranean—but was inconsistent in terms
      of the methods used. Some may choose to examine Mussolini’s policies chronologically, arguing
      that in the 1920s and early 1930s he was, overall, pursuing consistent policies diplomatically
      (Locarno), but with some exceptions (Corfu). From the mid-1930s his policies became more
      aggressive (Abyssinia and Spain, signing the Rome Berlin-Axis), but that again there were
      inconsistencies (helping to preserve peace at Munich or attempting to reach an Anglo-Italian
      agreement in 1939). He joined the war in 1940 to expand into the Balkans.



   30. Evaluate the reasons for the defeat of the Axis powers in Europe in the Second World War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of a number of
      reasons why, by 1945, the Axis powers had been defeated. Candidates may wish to adopt a
      chronological approach that deals with key issues as they occurred—particularly key military
      battles (Stalingrad, El Alamein, the battle of the Atlantic or D-Day). They may take a thematic
      approach, or they may deal with Italy and Germany separately. Factors may include the issue of
      effective military leadership (both Hitler and Mussolini interfered with key military decisions) and
      their relative strength (Italy was weak economically and militarily and Germany was obliged to
      support her, thus overstretching her own resources). Neither could sustain a long war whereas
      the Allies had the economic resources of the US and the numerical resources of the US and the
      Soviet Union. The Allies were also able to rely more on the willingness of the civilian population
      to make sacrifices for the war effort.

Section 16       The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

   31. “Stalin’s Five Year Plans and the policy of collectivization failed to improve the Soviet economy
       by 1941.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the assertion
      that the Soviet economy was not improved by either the Five-Year Plans or by Collectivization.
      Candidates may choose to define the aims of both policies and then assess the success and
      failures of each in relation to the economic growth of the Soviet Union, they may elect to address
      the two policies separately or they may provide an integrated assessment of both. Some may
      argue that despite the many criticisms and weaknesses of the Five-Year Plans they were an
      overall success, giving the Soviet Union the industrial capacity to withstand invasion and to
      become a superpower. Collectivization was arguably a political success (dekulakization and the
      extension of party control in the regions) but an economic disaster, as agriculture did not recover
      until the 1950s.



   32. “Khrushchev’s foreign policy caused confusion and uncertainty.” To what extent do you agree
       with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Khrushchev’s foreign policy caused anxiety internationally because it was inconsistent.
      Candidates may agree, partially agree or disagree with the statement. At times Khrushchev
      appeared to be seeking to improve Cold War relations (peaceful co-existence, co-operation over
      Vietnam in Geneva and over Suez, or even agreeing to the Test Ban Treaty and the
      establishment of a “hotline”), but at other times he seemed to be increasing tensions (establishing
      the Warsaw Pact, events in Hungary in 1956, and the Berlin crisis in 1958), indicating a much
      harder line. The building of the Berlin Wall and the Cuban crisis caused anxiety in the West
      regarding Soviet expansion, yet Khrushchev also visited Camp David. Some may argue that he
      was consistent in trying to maintain the position of the Soviet Union as a superpower.

Section 17       Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

   33. Evaluate the reasons for the emergence of the Cold War by 1949.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance or otherwise of the
      various factors that led to the Cold War in Europe by 1949. Candidates may detail these factors
      separately and consider the significance of each, they may group factors (for example, long-,
      mid- and short-term causes) or they may separate them into East and West factors. Long-term
      causes may include intervention in the Russian Civil War and the isolation and suspicion of the
      Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s (for example the Riga Axioms, and Soviet exclusion from
      the League of Nations until 1934). Medium term causes may include wartime tensions and
      suspicions (delay over opening the Second Front or the future of Poland). In the short term, it
      was arguably the policies and actions of both superpowers and their leaders that led to the
      collapse of wartime co-operation.



   34. “Kohl’s support for the rapid reunification of Germany was motivated by political opportunism.”
       To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      rapid reunification of Germany was motivated by political opportunism and they may question the
      “Reunification Chancellor” Helmut Kohl’s reasons for overseeing the rapid reunification of
      Germany. To argue against the premise, Kohl stated that he hoped for reunification but did not
      expect it in “his lifetime” and that he was also concerned that reunification would be destabilizing,
      particularly with immigration from the east. In support of the statement, Kohl had been losing
      support in West Germany and feared his coalition would be defeated in the elections. As the
      Wall came down in 1989 the popular mood was clearly for reunification (“We are one people”)
      and his response to that mood restored his political fortunes. Candidates may argue that he was
      always committed to reunification but that the events of 1989 and 1990 meant that he had to
      manage a much more rapid process than he had anticipated.

Section 18      Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

   35. Evaluate the impact of COMECON and the Warsaw Pact on states dominated by the Soviet
       Union.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of both COMECON and
      the Warsaw Pact on Eastern Bloc states. Candidates may elect to evaluate the impact of
      COMECON and the Warsaw Pact separately, alternatively, they may examine the combined
      impact of COMECON and the Warsaw Pact on individual states. There may be an assessment
      of the levels of control from Moscow and to what extent this control had an impact on the policies
      of governments. The impact of COMECON may be examined in terms of the structure of the
      economies in member states and the extent to which they were linked to the Soviet economy or
      could trade with the West. The impact of the Warsaw Pact may be discussed in terms of how it
      was used to maintain the ’buffer zone’ (Hungary, Czechoslovakia) and support the Brezhnev
      Doctrine. The presence of Soviet troops for “military planning” ensured Soviet domination of
      governments.



   36. Evaluate the developments in one central or eastern European country, excluding Russia,
       following the collapse of Soviet control.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the post-Soviet developments in their
      chosen central or eastern European example country. Relevant examples could include former
      satellite states as well as former Soviet republics that gained independence after 1991. Areas to
      consider may include internal political developments, the economy and social change. Political
      changes could include constitutional changes, the extent to which politics was stable and the
      ways in which democracy was established. In terms of economics, there may be a focus based
      on economic activity (for example if the country became monetarist or if its standards of living
      changed), the extent of stability/instability, or even economic differentials in society. Social
      developments may include freedom of religion, a more westernized society or the re-emergence
      of national traditions. There may also be discussion of negative social effects, for example
      reduced welfare and educational provision.
