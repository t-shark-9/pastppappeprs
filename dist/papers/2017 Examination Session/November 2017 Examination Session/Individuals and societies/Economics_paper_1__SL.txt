Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain why governments provide subsidies for some goods and services.               [10]

     (b)   Discuss the consequences of providing a subsidy for goods such as agricultural
           products.                                                                            [15]


2.   (a)   Explain how an increase in the price of air travel might affect the demand for its
           complements and its substitutes.                                                     [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that the use of regulation is the most effective way to reduce
           negative externalities.                                                              [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain why structural unemployment may occur in an economy.                                [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that the best way to reduce unemployment is through education and
           training.                                                                                   [15]


4.   (a)   With reference to the income, output and expenditure approaches, explain how the real
           gross national product (GNP)/gross national income (GNI) per capita of a country can
           be measured.                                                                                [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that a rise in the GNP/GNI per capita will always lead to a rise in living
           standards in a country.                                                                     [15]
