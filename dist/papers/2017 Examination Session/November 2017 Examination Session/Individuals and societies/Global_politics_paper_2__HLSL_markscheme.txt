The paper is marked using the generic markbands on the following page, and the paper specific
markscheme that follows. The markscheme for this paper is the same for HL and SL.

Important points to note
● The content listed in the markscheme indicates possible areas candidates might cover in their
  answers. Candidates may take a different approach, which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
  Examiners should not expect all of the information listed and should allow other valid points.
● Students are expected to draw on political concepts that are relevant to the arguments they put
  forward. These will usually be, but are not always, taken from the concepts listed in the global politics
  guide – if they are valid and relevant to the answer, they can be rewarded.
● The paper expects conceptual understanding but extensive knowledge of political theory is not
  required unless the question specifies it.
● Explicit stand-alone definitions are not required: understanding of terms may sometimes be conveyed
  as effectively through the way they are woven into the response.
● Please do keep in mind the IB command term associated with each question and recognize what
  candidates are required to do in response.
● The candidates are heavily time-constrained so numerous examples are not expected.

Power, sovereignty and international relations

1.   Examine the claim that state sovereignty is challenged by non-governmental organizations
     (NGOs) and non-state actors such as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).

     Responses are likely to include an explanation of the concept of sovereignty – implying that the
     state or government has supreme authority. Candidates may discuss how the state is the sole
     author of laws within its territory (internal sovereignty). External sovereignty refers to the capacity
     of each state to act independently and autonomously on the world stage. Candidates may then
     briefly dwell upon their understanding of NGOs (organizations with membership, support and
     activities across borders) and non-state actors (Amnesty International) with some examples of how
     these have an impact on state sovereignty.

     Arguments that state sovereignty is challenged by NGOs and non-state actors may include:
     • NGOs such as Amnesty International have emerged as powerful players and influencers of
        policy with their legitimacy and expertise. These NGOs have an important role to play and
        scrutinise states which fall short of delivering on their responsibilities. For instance, in 2013
        efforts from Amnesty International saw some progress with regards to the detention facility at
        Guantanamo Bay when President Obama appointed staff to lead the effort to close the
        detention facility, Congress rolled back some restrictions on transferring detainees to other
        countries, and 11 detainees were transferred
     • NGOs work together to influence state sovereignty and policy making. For example,
        multinational corporation Johnson Controls joined other firms to work for energy efficiency in
        2012. The Clinton Climate Initiative and Rocky Mountain Institute also collaborated on the
        project. The groups estimated the project will cut energy costs by 38%, saving US$4.4m
        annually and reducing carbon emissions by 105,000 metric tons over 15 years
     • NGOs have a significant role to play in shaping public opinion, reviewing compliance and policy
        changes which in turn has an impact on the direction of decisions taken by sovereign states
     • non-state actors such as international and regional organizations challenge the Westphalian
        notion of sovereignty. States cede a certain amount of sovereignty to IGOs such as the UN and
        choose to follow certain norms and rules laid out by these global governance institutions
     • non-state actors challenge state sovereignty. Terrorist groups directly attack infrastructure and
        people whose welfare is a responsibility of the state.

     Arguments that state sovereignty is not challenged by NGOs and non-state actors may include:
     • the capacity of NGOs to interfere in a state’s internal affairs or functioning is very limited due to
        their limited powers, lack of military resources and at times lack of proper funding
     • NGOs need state support to make an impact and contribution
     • Non-state actors such as terrorist groups do not necessarily have the same kind of resources as
        a state
     • the sovereign state remains the primary unit in global politics. Non-state actors such as terrorist
        groups do not have the kind of power, legitimacy and resources states possess.

     Responses should contain references to specific examples. They could cite cases of states which
     have had to make changes to their policies due to pressure from non-state actors and non-
     governmental organizations. Candidates could then conclude by responding on how far they think
     the sovereignty of states is eroded by these NGOs and non-state actors. Candidates are expected
     to discuss the impact of both NGOs and non-state actors on state sovereignty and those who can
     do both should be awarded marks accordingly. Responses should include the candidate’s
     evaluation of the validity of the claim put forward in the question.

2.   Evaluate the function and impact of one of the following in dealing with global challenges:
     • Political parties
     • Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs)
     • Multinational corporations (MNCs)
     • Informal forums.

     Responses should demonstrate a clear understanding of what candidates define and identify as
     global challenges – climate change, non-state actors such as crime and terrorist groups, poverty,
     sustainable development, gender disparities, hunger and diseases, food and water security. In a
     globalized world these challenges cannot be tackled by states in isolation. Candidates could then
     move on to choose any one of the four options – political parties (Democratic and Republican in
     US, Communist Party of China, Peoples’ Action Party in Singapore among others), IGOs (such as
     WTO, IMF, EU and ASEAN among others), MNCs (Unilever, Ikea, Tata, Nike among others) or
     informal forums (G20, G7, G8, WEF among others) and delve further into what their understanding
     of each of them involves and includes:

     Political parties:
     • Political parties are important actors in a democratic society. Citizens have options on policies,
       which in turn can become legislation which could be directly or indirectly linked to steps in
       dealing with global challenges. For example, candidates could cite cases of political parties
       such as the Democratic Party of the US which has clearly outlined certain issues of global
       concern such as managing terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons and climate leadership
     • Political parties provide democratic societies with leaders who will pursue interests and
       collaborate with other leaders at international fora to manage global challenges
     • Political parties help to address global challenges such as lack of gender empowerment and
       participation in decision making by involving more women in their organization
     • Political parties can make use of their access to and contacts with international organizations,
       NGOs and groups abroad/across borders and use this linkage to address global challenges
     • Parties in power can implement social, political and economic reforms which directly and
       indirectly help manage global challenges.

     Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs):
     • IGOs such as the EU and ASEAN can become powerful platforms to formulate, coordinate and
        implement policies to address global challenges such as migration and poverty. Candidates
        could give examples of IGOs such as ASEAN and the EU policies to combat terrorism and
        organized crime through sharing best practices, intelligence, cutting off funding etc
     • Member states of these groups can help and assist each other using their own expertise to face
        cross border challenges such as the role of ASEAN in dealing with the outbreak of SARS in
        2003.

     Multinational corporations (MNCs):
     • MNCs can contribute towards tackling several global challenges through corporate social
       responsibility schemes
     • MNCs employing local population in relatively poorer areas can help provide employment to
       people and help to alleviate poverty
     • MNCs have economic resources, technology, an international presence, and the ability to use
       markets to try to solve global challenges
     • Some candidates could argue that MNCs primarily aim at making profits and do not try to deal
       with global challenges.

Informal forums:
• Informal forums such as G20 have taken steps to manage global challenges by strengthening
   financial systems, promoting economic growth and employment, enhancing food security and
   promoting green growth
• Groups such as the G8 countries encompassing powerful states can implement policies and
   agendas in formal world institutions to manage global problems. For example, the World
   Economic Forum meeting of business leaders at Davos in 2014 had many global challenges
   such as overcoming famine and economic inequality on its agenda
• Some candidates could argue that many of these informal forums are not able to contribute
   much to solving global issues considering that they do not have a staff, headquarters or rules
   and powers.

Responses should contain references to specific examples. Any other valid and relevant examples
should be evaluated positively.

Human rights

3.   To what extent has the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) provided the basis
     for contemporary political movements for social change?

     Responses should include examples of contemporary political movements and how they can be
     related to the UDHR. Components of the UDHR should be used to illustrate the examples in
     answering the question.

     Arguments that the UDHR has provided the basis for contemporary political movements for social
     change may include:
     • the leaders of contemporary social movements have referred to the UDHR in their justifications
        for action
     • the UDHR has served as a basis for the recruiting of grass roots membership into movements
        for social change
     • the development of the UDHR was commissioned by the UN as the basis for motivating change
        across a range of issues
     • contemporary treaties and covenants are based on goals and objectives set by the UDHR (i.e.,
        The Beijing Declaration, the Kyoto Agreement, etc)
     • the UDHR has provided the basis for humanitarian intervention approved by the UN.

     Arguments that the UDHR has not provided the basis for contemporary political movements for
     social change may include:
     • some might argue that contemporary social movements have developed independently of the
        UDHR, and that most grass-root members of contemporary social movements have never
        heard of the UDHR
     • the UDHR is dated and does not fully relate to the demands of contemporary movements,
        (ie climate change)
     • the problem of cultural relativism is still an issue in many non-western countries whose social
        movements may not recognize or agree with the UDHR
     • many contemporary social movements (eg Arab Spring, Occupy) have emerged as
        spontaneous mass movements for social change that have not referred to the UDHR in their
        development.

     Responses should contain references to specific examples. Candidates could choose one
     argument or another, and these choices should be rewarded if they are clearly argued. But both
     can be justified by referring to various movements for social change around the globe.

     Responses should include the candidate’s evaluative conclusion on the extent to which the UDHR
     has provided the basis for contemporary political movements for social change.

4.   “Universal rights should take precedence over cultural relativism in the formation of human
     rights treaties and covenants.” Discuss this view.

     Reponses should define cultural relativism, universal rights and human rights treaties and
     covenants. Examples of treaties and covenants should be provided in the answer, along with the
     reasons for why the assertion provided by the question does or does not hold.

     Arguments that support the view that universal rights should take precedence over cultural
     relativism in the formation of human rights treaties and covenants may include:
     • recent treaties and covenants have urged the acceptance of, for example, women’s rights,
        pollution standards, recognition of climate change and a condemnation of genital mutilation
        despite arguments for the recognition of cultural relativism
     • cultural relativism is no longer recognized as a mechanism that can guarantee freedom from
        harm to life and limb. This is recognized in treaties and covenants (eg the Beijing Declaration
        for the Rights of Women)
     • globalization has made universal rights the standard approach for meetings of human rights
        activists and UN Organizations (such as UNESCO, the United Nations Entity for Gender
        Equality and the Empowerment of Women, and the UN Convention on the Elimination of All
        Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which specifically targets genital mutilation) and major
        agreements such as the Beijing Declaration and the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse gas
        emission reductions
     • cultural relativism has often been used an excuse for the discrimination against women and
        ethnic groups.

     Arguments that oppose the view that universal rights should take precedence over cultural
     relativism in the formation of human rights treaties and covenants may include:
     • many countries and groups still argue that the UNDR is a western document that discriminates
        against the culture and practices of Asian and African societies, citing the need to recognize
        cultural relativism
     • the treaties and conventions that argue for universal rights are not enforceable and are
        therefore not followed or agreed to by many parts of the world, who insist on their own cultural
        knowledge and practices
     • in many Middle Eastern countries women want and demand circumcision to be eligible for
        employment opportunities and marriage
     • human rights treaties and covenants are often not signed by the major industrialized countries
        and members of the UN Security Council, including the United States, Russia, India, China and
        Israel, citing the need to recognize differences in human rights standards among nations.

     Globalization has created greater diversity as local cultures incorporate beliefs from the outside,
     creating more needs for the recognition of cultural diversity and relativism. Responses should
     contain references to specific examples. Responses should include the candidate’s evaluation of
     the validity of the view put forward in the question.

Development

5.   “Definitions of development that stress meeting basic needs should be replaced with
     definitions that focus on well-being.” Discuss this statement.

     Responses should demonstrate some understanding of the two approaches. Candidates should
     define the basic needs approach which is linked to the measurement of absolute poverty in
     developing countries, or the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term physical well-
     being and the amount of income needed to satisfy these needs. The approach originated at the
     International Labor Organisation’s World Employment Conference in 1976, and candidates should
     be aware that basic needs include food, water, shelter and clothing and more recently sanitation,
     education and healthcare. Candidates should be able to mention indicators of basic needs such
     as the Human Development Index (HDI), and to note that it is consumption-orientated. The
     shortcomings of this approach lie in the use of averages and aggregates which say little about
     individual experiences.

     Candidates should also define the more recent well-being approach, which owes much to Amartya
     Sen who emphasizes the need to listen to what people themselves are saying they need, even
     though it might not yet be possible to realize it. Candidates should be able to mention well-being
     indicators such as The Happy Planet Index, or the OECD well-being indices. Examples of projects
     aiming to understand poverty from the perspective of the poor themselves should be rewarded.

     Arguments that support the view that basic needs definitions should be replaced with well-being
     definitions may include:
     • basic needs indicators make use of averages, medians and aggregates which say little about
        individual experiences
     • well-being indicators are based on listening to what people say rather than measurement of
        needs determined by academic and international organizations
     • understanding poverty from the perspective of the poor is surely better as a means of identifying
        future pathways to development than measuring levels of consumption.


     Arguments against the view that basic needs definitions should be replaced with well-being
     definitions may include:
     • well-being indicators are subjective, based on what people say rather than empirically observed
        data
     • composite indicators such as HDI are quite sophisticated and allow for comparisons between
        countries and over time
     • basic needs such as food, shelter, fresh water and clothing are surely universal needs whereas
        wellbeing is a state of mind
     • basic needs indicators reflect what has been achieved whereas wellbeing indicators reflect
        aspirations which may not be achieved.

     The command term “Discuss” is defined as “Offer a considered and balanced review that includes
     a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.” It allows candidates to draw a number of different
     conclusions, all of which can be valid if argued convincingly and with examples. The two
     approaches may be seen as complementary, or, alternatively, the candidate may agree or
     disagree with the quotation in varying degrees. A chronological argumentation can be taken and
     candidates may argue that one approach has grown out of the other. They may also argue that
     the basic needs approach is a precondition for the well-being approach.

6.   Discuss the view that harmful environmental factors represent the greatest threat to
     successful development.

     Responses may begin with a definition of successful development which points towards enhanced
     living standards and well-being as a corollary of economic growth, perhaps including measures of
     health, education, and longevity. Harmful environmental factors may be approached in different
     ways including for example population, natural resources, presence or lack of stability or conflict,
     and, perhaps most likely, sustainability and climate change.

     Arguments that support the view that harmful environmental factors represent the greatest threat to
     successful development may include:
     • climate change as a result of harmful environmental activities may prove the ultimate barrier to
        development. A current example is the disappearance of island communities due to rising sea
        levels eg Maldives/Tuvalu and threat to low lying cities and river deltas eg Nigeria
     • climatic hazards such as hurricanes and drought render some countries fragile, eg drought led
        to famine in the Horn of Africa in 2011–12 leading to a refugee crisis and the diversion of
        resources away from development
     • large scale, energy intensive industrialisation leads to environmental degradation which
        threatens further development eg parts of India
     • sustainability can be compromised if poor countries exploit non-renewable resources at a rate
        which does not allow them to refresh, eg forests, fish.

     Arguments against the view that harmful environmental factors represent the greatest threat to
     successful development may include:
     • rapid population growth may prove a greater threat to successful development than harmful
        environmental factors through uncontrolled migration, and vicious circles of poverty
     • a range of economic factors can be considered as prerequisites for successful development,
        eg factors of production such as natural resources and capital, and without them development is
        impossible, meaning that harmful environmental factors are of lesser significance
     • a range of non-economic factors can also be considered as essential to successful
        development, such as property rights, absence of corruption and an educated workforce
     • wars, conflict and political instability may prove a greater threat to successful development that
        harmful environmental factors, such as in Syria and Iraq.

     The command term “Discuss” is defined as “Offer a considered and balanced review that includes
     a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate evidence.” Candidates can support the view and/or oppose it, in
     which case an alternative threat or threats to successful development should be identified. In
     either case, arguments should be supported with examples.

Peace and conflict

7.   Examine the claim that contrasting material interests are the main cause of conflicts.

     Responses should include clear descriptions of the causes of conflict in the examples used.

     Important to notice here is the absence of the term ‘violent’, which means the question concerns
     virtually every conflict, between individuals, between groups or between states. It also concerns
     conflicts that have not yet become violent, but where relations are clearly problematic as between
     China and several East-Asian states with regards to the South China Sea. The way in which the
     relationships between the USA and the rest of the world develop could become central to this
     question. Answers can draw on any example of conflict, if it is used to effectively answer the
     question.

     Arguments that support the claim may include:
     • conflicts around identity or territory are often ultimately concerned with contrasting material
        interests
     • conflicts usually do not start unless there is material interest involved
     • examples of international conflicts could be: China in the East-China Sea, USA involvement in
        Iraq, which arguably is still about oil. An example of an interstate conflict is Boko-Haram in
        Nigeria where it has been said that its success is for a large part due to the deplorable
        economic circumstances in Northern Nigeria
     • government’s material interests come into conflict with the interests of non-state actors, such as
        the demonstrations against the oil pipeline in Dakota (2017), USA, and the rejection of a
        liquefied gas plant at the mouth of the Skeena river by a group of First Nation People in Canada
        (2016)
     • environmental well-being could be a material interest, as in both cases above, the rivers
        involved are likely to be polluted which will create material difficulties for the inhabitants of the
        region. Continuing conflicts in the Nigerian delta between international oil companies and local
        inhabitants are another example.

     Arguments against the claim may include:
     • there are always multiple causes to a conflict
     • other factors, such as values, ideology, identity or security can play a more significant role
     • many inter-state conflicts are started because of grievances, not greed, against the state
     • some candidates may explain the question with reference to the PIN model (Position, Interests,
        Needs), which claims it is necessary to understand all of the interests behind actors’ positions
        before a conflict can be solved. This will often show that material interests do not always come
        first, but rather the aforementioned values, security, identity or ideology
     • examples of (inter)national conflicts could be: Russia–Ukraine, India–Pakistan, Israel–Palestine,
        Turkey and the Kurds (identity/security more than material interests)
     • many of the examples could be turned both ways, and this should be rewarded as long as the
        arguments are well substantiated.

     Responses should contain references to specific examples and should include the candidate’s
     conclusion on whether or not contrasting material interests are the main cause of conflicts.

8.   Discuss the view that non-violent protest is the only way to achieve lasting change in
     conflicts between the state and non-state actors.

     Responses should include a definition or examples of non-violent methods, to highlight the
     differences between non-violent and violent conflicts.

     Candidates are given the opportunity to explore their understanding of the use of non-violent
     methods when people engage in conflicts.

     Arguments in favour of the view may include:
     • the state has easy access to military resources and will therefore almost always be stronger.
        (Gandhi in British India, Egypt)
     • responding to non-violence with violence often strengthens the cause of the non-state actors,
        because the state is viewed as over-reacting (Martin Luther King in the USA; Egypt and the
        Arab Spring)
     • non-violent action allows a focus on the issue itself rather than on the violence occurring
     • it may be easier for people to get involved in non-violent protest such as a peaceful
        demonstration than in violent action such as the use of explosives (Examples from the Arab
        Spring can be used, but also Gandhi)
     • violent methods used to protest may alienate the population from the protestors unlike non-
        violent methods used.

     Arguments against the view may include:
     • if non-violent methods used to protest are too weak, it can easily be crushed by the state
        (Turkey, later protests in Egypt)
     • sometimes, violence sends a much stronger message to the state that the issue is serious (self-
        immolation in Tunisia which started off the Arab Spring)
     • states may ignore non-violent methods used to protest, but are more likely to have to respond to
        violence
     • violence may bring the population to side with the non-state actors, out of fear
     • violence may make the world aware of the conflict (Rohingya in Myanmar)
     • movements may begin as non-violent but often end up being violent (Syria).

     Responses are likely to refer to classic historical examples concerning Gandhi/British India, Martin
     Luther King Jr/USA, Mandela/South Africa, but contemporary examples should be rewarded.
     Candidates can refer to examples of a more local nature where non-violent protest may or may not
     have been effective in producing lasting change.
     Responses should include the candidate’s conclusion to what extent they support the view that
     non-violent protest is the only way to achieve lasting change in conflicts between the state and
     non-state actors. It is possible and highly likely that candidates will only agree to some extent.
