               Answers may include:
               • definition of subsidies
               • diagram(s) to show the application of subsidies to a market and reasons to
                 apply a subsidy such as merit goods
               • explanation of why governments apply subsidies and a consideration of
                 how subsidies influence the market and society in terms of welfare, such as
                 making goods more affordable for low income households
               • examples of the application of subsidies.

(b)   Evaluate the view that the use of regulation is the most effective way to reduce
      negative externalities.                                                            [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of regulation and negative externalities
      • diagram(s) to show the impact of regulation on negative externalities
      • explanation of how regulation reduces negative externalities. An example of
        this might be a regulation on producers to produce a good in way that
        reduces pollution. example(s) of regulations used to reduce negative
        externalities
      • synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the benefits of using regulation to deal with negative
      externalities such as direct effect on externalities and relative ease of
      application. It may also include the problems of using regulations such as:
      managing the regulation, increasing the price of the good produced and the
      negative impact on employment in the regulated industry. It may also
      consider alternatives to regulation such as taxes.

           • diagram to show the decline in employment caused by structural factors

             replacing labour in a market, lead to unemployment because workers do
             not have the skills or geographical mobility to get a new job quickly

(b)   Discuss the view that the best way to reduce unemployment is through

      Answers may include:
      • definition of unemployment
      • diagram to show how education and training reduces unemployment such
        as an increase in the supply of available labour increasing employment and
        LRAS shifting to the right explanation that education and training increases
        the skill level of unemployed workers and increases their opportunities for
        employment
      • examples of where education and training has reduced unemployment
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of how education and training might be
      appropriate for structural unemployment, but might not be as effective with
      demand-deficient and frictional unemployment. There could be consideration of
      the cost and effectiveness of government run education and training. There
      could also be consideration that alternative policies are more effective than
      education and training in reducing certain types of unemployment.

(b)   Discuss the view that a rise in the GNP/GNI per capita will always lead to a
      rise in living standards in a country.                                              [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of living standards
      • diagram(s) of AD/AS, PPC
      • explanation that a rise in GNP/GNI per capita leads to rising real incomes,
        better public services and rising employment which leads to rising
        living standards
      • examples of where rising GNP/GNI per capita leads to rising living standards
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of how rising GNP/GNI per capita
      might lead to situations that have a negative impact on living standards such
      as negative externalities and widening income inequality. It is also difficult to
      assess rising living standards because it is affected by non-monetary factors.
      It may also be argued that a rise in GNP/GNI per capita can be accompanied
      by inflation, reducing the potential rise in living standards.
