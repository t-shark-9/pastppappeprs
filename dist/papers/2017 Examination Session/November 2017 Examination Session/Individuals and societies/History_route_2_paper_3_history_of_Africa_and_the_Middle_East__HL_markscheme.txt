Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1         The ʽAbbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   Evaluate the view that the ʽAbbasid Revolution was mainly a religious revolution.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the view that the ʽAbbasid Revolution was
     mainly a religious revolution, weighing up the strengths and limitations of this assessment. Candidates
     may agree, partially agree, or disagree with the view. They may elect to evaluate the significance of
     religion in the context of other aspects of the ʽAbbasid Revolution, for example the relocation of the
     capital from Damascus to Baghdad, which empowered Iranians and lessened the power of Syrian
     Arabs. Nevertheless, the focus of the response will be on religion and its significance (or lack thereof).
     In this context, candidates may comment on factors such as discontent amongst Sunni and Shia in
     the Umayyad dynasty in the mid-700s, the role of key figures, such as Abu al-ʽAbbas al-Saffah and/or
     Abu Muslim Khurasani. They may also reference the importance of Silk Road garrisons in the
     ʽAbbasid Revolution.



2.   To what extent did the ʽAbbasid dynasty draw upon the Sassanian heritage in the organization of its
     empire?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that the ʽAbbasid
     dynasty drew upon the Sassanian heritage in the organization of its empire. Candidates may focus
     the political and fiscal structure of the empire, the use of the satrapies, the ʽAbbasid court system, and
     the notion of the Caliph as Shahanshah, and argue that these features were legacies of the Sassanian
     system. The military structure of the ʽAbbasids, so crucial to the establishment and expansion of their
     empire, was also based on a Sassanian template. Candidates may consider other explanations of
     the genesis of the ʽAbbasid system, including the argument that the main inspiration for ʽAbbasid
     organization came from the Ummayads and not the Sassanids.
                                                    –6–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 2         The Fatimids (909–1171)

3. Discuss the impact of the foundation of Cairo (969) on political and social developments in the
   Fatimid Empire.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range
     of opinions relating to the impact of the foundation of Cairo on political and social developments in
     the Fatimid Empire. Candidates may choose to discuss political and social developments
     separately or alternatively stress the interconnectedness of the two. They may note that the political
     focus of the empire shifted eastwards with the foundation of Cairo and discuss ways in the
     cosmopolitanism of the city led to racial and religious tolerance and the inclusion of different groups
     in the administration of the empire. Art and culture flourished and a university was established at
     the Jamadi al-Awwad mosque. Candidates may stress Cairo’s location as a factor that promoted
     intellectual enrichment, as academics from the ʽAbbasid and Byzantine empires were attracted to
     the city.



4.   Evaluate the impact on the Fatimid Empire of either al-Hakim (996–1021) or
     al-Mustansir (1036–1094).

     The question requires that candidates appraise the impact on the Fatimid Empire of one of al-Hakim
     or al-Mustansir. Such appraisal could include, but need not be limited to, effectiveness of their
     policies, their relations with other rulers and/or religious groups or how effectively they responded to
     challenges to the empire. Candidates may suggest that al-Hakim had a positive impact in that he
     expanded the empire and was closely involved with the development of Cairo as the capital. They
     may also critique al-Hakim’s impact, noting that he became known for his intolerance particularly
     towards Christians and has been perceived as being an arbitrary ruler with many decrees against
     religious groups. For al-Mustansir, while his 60-year reign was the longest of the Fatimid dynasty, it
     has associations with a period of prolonged decline. Although the empire was prosperous during
     the first decades of al-Mustansir’s reign, a prolonged famine between 1065 and 1071, a
     consequence of agricultural neglect, was a watershed. From this point, Egypt endured several
     internal crises that were largely caused by maladministration and led to a state of almost total
     collapse in the government of the empire. Under this pressure, al-Mustansir summoned Badr
     al-Jamali, the governor of Acre, to Egypt to provide support. Henceforth, al-Jamali ruled the
     caliphate in all but name until 1094.
                                                  –7–                 N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3         The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   “The First Crusade (1096–1099) was motivated by religious rather than secular concerns.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range
     of opinions relating to the religious and secular motivations for the First Crusade. Evidence for
     religious concerns may include the Gregorian reform movement, which sought to assert the primacy
     of the pope over secular rulers, the occupation of the Holy Land by Seljuk Turks, Byzantine fears of
     Muslim expansion into their empire, and Church doctrine, which held that crusaders would receive
     absolution for their sins. For secular concerns, candidates may include Pope Urban’s speech at the
     Council of Clermont—where he did not mention the capture of Jerusalem as an objective—and the
     right of primogeniture, which may have led the younger sons of noblemen to join the crusade.
     Candidates may recognize that there is often some overlap between religious and secular concerns.



6.   Compare and contrast the tactics used by both sides during the Third Crusade (1189–1192).

     The question requires that candidates give an account of similarities and differences in the tactics
     used by the two sides during the Third Crusade, referring to both sides throughout. They may note
     the similar strategies employed by the leaders of the two sides, for example, both Salah al-Din
     (Saladin) and Richard I preferred to avoid pitched battles unless they felt assured of victory. Both
     leaders stressed unity and organization and placed strong emphasis on motivating their forces.
     Candidates must also focus on contrasts. They may note that the Crusaders used heavy horses,
     broadswords and plate armour, and relied on cavalry charges. On the other hand, the Arabs had light
     horses, scimitars and chain mail, and depended on speed and battlefield mobility. Additionally, the
     Crusaders favoured siege tactics. There may be some imbalance between similarities and differences
     but both elements must be present in candidates’ responses.
                                                   –8–                   N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 4         The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Evaluate the impact on the Ottoman Empire of contest [competition] with the Safavids.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of competition between the
     Ottomans and Safavids on the Ottoman Empire. They may note the impact of military conflict,
     including Ottoman victory in the Battle of Chaldiran, through which the Ottomans secured their eastern
     frontier and brought thousands of captured Persians to Istanbul. Many of these prisoners were skilled
     craftsmen and intellectuals, and contributed to the cultural enrichment of the empire. The protracted
     series of wars fought between 1532 and 1555 were costlier and more damaging, even though the
     outcome was some territorial gains and the consolidation of Sunni power in Anatolia. Candidates may
     also note the significance of economic competition, which became more pronounced with the decline
     of trade along the Silk Road and growing rivalry in the carpet industry.



8.   To what extent did the fall of Constantinople (1453) transform the Ottoman state?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the fall of
     Constantinople transformed the Ottoman state. They may argue that the fall of Constantinople was
     of major significance to the Ottomans, as the strategic importance of the city instantly transformed the
     Ottoman state into a major regional power. From their new capital, they could control the Black Sea
     and the Eastern Mediterranean, Anatolia and the Balkans. The development of Istanbul as a port and
     commercial city led to greater interaction with the wider Mediterranean region. This interaction
     included trade with the Italian city states, the result of which was the burgeoning prosperity of the
     empire. Alternatively, candidates may argue that the transformation of the state itself was more
     limited, with the Ottomans failing to adopt any administrative practices from the Byzantines, preferring
     to derive their cultural influences from the Seljuk Turks.
                                                   –9–                   N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 5         Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.   Evaluate the influence of Catholicism in the Kingdom of the Kongo.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the influences of Catholicism on the
     Kingdom of the Kongo. They may note the impact of Catholicism on traditional African culture, for
     example, practices such as polygamy were shunned by the converted. Christian converts spoke
     Portuguese and adopted Portuguese names and clothing, and candidates may stress the growing
     tension and rivalry between converts and other Kongolese. They may also focus on the impact of
     Catholicism on traditional belief systems. These were not necessarily eliminated, but often
     syncretised with Catholicism. They may look at the spread of literacy with the establishment of
     Christian schools and the translation of the Bible into the vernacular. Missionaries were also
     responsible for the establishment of at least one hospital in Sao Salvador.



10. Discuss the causes of the rise and decline of the Mali Empire.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of the
     rise of the Mali Empire and the causes of its decline. While they need not provide equal focus on rise
     and decline, the two factors must be addressed in candidates’ responses. Candidates may note that
     Mali’s rise was tied to the decline of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata Keita’s defeat of regional rivals
     allowed him to step into this power vacuum and consolidate control of the lucrative trade in gold and
     salt. The empire then expanded to the Atlantic coast and became the dominant regional power.
     Candidates may also refer to military factors including success in warfare. For decline, candidates
     may address the weak leadership of Maghan Musa, whose mismanagement of revenues led to
     economic failure. These problems were compounded by succession disputes and the division of the
     empire into three, followed by the surrender of territory and loss of control of the trans-Saharan trade
     routes, and, finally, the disintegration of the empire.

Section 6         Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11. “The social effects of the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate were more significant than the political
    effects.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    the social effects of the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate were more significant than the political effects.
    Candidates may recognize that social and political effects were often closely related. For instance,
    the caliphate first emerged following the jihad of Usman Dan Fodio. Similarly, religious fervour and
    the emergence of a theocracy consolidated the power of the caliph. Another effect was the
    introduction of Sharia law. Candidates may address economic factors, but only in the context of social
    or political effects. Trade in kola nuts and gold led to the emergence of a wealthy merchant class,
    while revenues from trans-Saharan trade helped strengthen the caliphate.



12. “The role of religion in the rise of the Mahdist state in Sudan has been greatly exaggerated.”
    Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
    the role of religion in the rise of the Mahdist state. They may choose to focus on the argument that
    the role of religion has not been exaggerated and note that many Sudanese Muslims were inspired
    by the piety of the Mahdi and the purity of his vision. He promised to revitalize Islam, introduced
    Sharia law and launched a jihad against infidel occupation. Candidates may also stress the role of
    other factors, including initial British disinterest in the Sudan as well popular resentment towards
    Egyptian and, later, British rule. The merchant class in Khartoum suffered due to foreign control of
    trade and the banning of slavery. Military conscription was also deeply unpopular. Candidates may
    conclude by reflecting on the extent to which religion was key to the rise of the Mahdist state.

Section 7        The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13. “Rivalries and warfare between African states were the main causes of the expansion of the Atlantic
    slave trade.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade was mainly caused by rivalries and warfare between
    African states. They may consider the argument that rivalry and warfare debilitated African societies
    and left them vulnerable the incursions of slavers. It also encouraged some states to take part in
    expeditions at the expense of rivals. Candidates may point out that this was not the only reason why
    African states became involved, as many derived commercial benefit from selling slaves to
    Europeans or exchanging them for manufactured goods and firearms. They may also argue that
    many of the causes can be found outside of Africa—most notably in the increased demand for slave
    labour in the sugar and cotton plantations of the Americas.



14. Evaluate the significance of colonial expansion to the decline of the East African slave trade.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of colonial expansion as
    a factor in the decline of the East African slave trade. They may consider the role of European
    missionaries and humanitarians who campaigned against the trade and highlighted its iniquities
    and/or suggest that public opinion contributed to British diplomatic pressure, which was a factor in
    the closing of the Zanzibar market in 1873. Conversion to Christianity also helped stigmatize the
    institution of slavery among Africans. Candidates may note the significance of factors other than
    colonial expansion—such as the decline in demand for plantation slaves in the Americas with the
    introduction of machinery, the expansion of legitimate trade and the role of anti-slave trade
    treaties—to provide context and/or a reference point for their evaluation; however, the bulk of their
    response must be focused on colonial expansion.

Section 8         European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15. Evaluate the impact of British actions in Egypt and South Africa on the partition of Africa.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact on the partition of Africa of
    British actions in Egypt and South Africa. They may note that one obvious effect was the eventual
    colonization of those countries. In addition, British actions in Egypt led to the breakdown of the
    “gentleman’s agreement” with France in West Africa, while concerns over foreign control of the
    headwaters of the Nile led to colonial expansion in East Africa. In South Africa, candidates may
    note Britain’s rivalry with the Boer Republics and its expansion into the interior, which led to
    competition with Germany and Portugal. To provide context and/or a reference point for their
    evaluation, candidates may consider the impact of other factors in the partition, but the focus of the
    response remain on Egypt and South Africa.



16. Evaluate the factors that facilitated German annexation in Africa.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
    limitations of the various factors that facilitated German annexation in Africa. They may, for
    example, consider the importance of the Berlin West Africa Conference, during which the assembled
    countries facilitated German actions by rubber stamping the country’s acquisition of new colonial
    possessions. Candidates may also focus on the role of economic factors, with Africa increasingly
    viewed as a source of raw materials and market for finished products, particularly following
    Leopold’s actions in the Congo. Candidates may also consider the role of surprise—few had
    expected Germany to suddenly become a player in the colonial game. While candidates may also
    look at general factors that facilitated colonial expansion, the focus must be on German annexation.

Section 9        Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17. Evaluate the factors that influenced African decisions to resist European imperialism.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the factors that influenced African
    decisions to resist European imperialism, weighing up the significance, or not, of those factors.
    Candidates may note that the desire to maintain independence was a primary factor in any decision
    to resist, they may also suggest that access to modern firearms may have given impetus to their
    grievances. Candidates may suggest that large, powerful, politically unified states were in a
    stronger position to offer resistance than small and divided states. They may also argue that African
    states often chose to resist because all other options, including negotiation, had been exhausted, or
    because the colonizing power was determined to end their independence come what may, thus
    ensuring that collaboration was out of the question.



18. “The conquest and destruction of the Zulu kingdom was mainly a consequence of Cetshwayo’s poor
    judgment.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    Cetshwayo’s poor judgment was the main reason for the conquest and destruction of the Zulu
    kingdom. Candidates may agree, partially agree, or disagree with the statement. In support of the
    statement, candidates may refer to Cetshwayo’s apparent inability to avoid war with the British in
    1879, his decision not to attack a retreating army following victory at Isandlwana, and his failure to
    avert open field battle against superior arms at Ulundi. To counter this, they may argue that Britain
    was steadfastly determined to end the independence of a powerful African neighbour, and this
    meant that, in the long run, the Zulu would succumb regardless of Cetshwayo’s actions. Candidates
    may also argue that Cetshwayo was initially successful in his resistance to the British, especially
    with his victory at Isandlwana, and that much of his diplomacy with the British was characterized by
    moderation and astuteness.

Section 10       Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19. Evaluate the main features of British rule in Tanganyika.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the main features of British rule in
    Tanganyika, weighing up the significance, or otherwise, of those factors. Candidates may offer a
    chronological approach that identifies the evolution of British rule in Tanganyika, from it being a
    British mandate, through its existence as a UN trust territory under British control, to the last years of
    British influence prior to independence. In this vein, candidates may suggest that British rule was
    shaped by specific governors, prevailing attitudes and/or international events such as the Second
    World War. Alternatively, a thematic approach may be adopted, through which candidates may
    evaluate the use of, for example, indirect rule and the efficacy of efforts (where they existed) to
    engage Africans in rule at a local, regional and eventually national level.



20. Evaluate the economic development of the Gold Coast up to 1957.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic development of the Gold
    Coast up to 1957. They may focus on the development of private commerce, particularly in the gold
    mining sector with the emergence of major companies such as the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation.
    These companies became major employers in the region. Candidates may refer to the importance
    of the export market, with diamonds, pepper, ivory, grain and cocoa all prominent. Agriculture was
    diversified and peasant cultivators were encouraged to grow cash crops. A harbour was
    constructed at Takoradi, and there was development of rail and other transport infrastructures. In
    addition, urbanization led to the growth of an African middle class. Some candidates may argue that
    the colonial economy was developed under British rule to the extent where early independence
    became achievable due to the relatively advanced state of the Gold Coast economy.

21. Compare and contrast the role of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the
    Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in the achievement of independence in Kenya and
    Tanganyika respectively.

    The question requires that candidates give an account of similarities and differences between the
    roles of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the Tanganyika African National Union
    (TANU) in the achievement of Kenyan and Tanganyikan independence, referring to both throughout.
    For comparison, candidates may refer to the dominant roles played by Kenyatta and Nyerere in their
    respective movements. Both were truly national movements that were supported by most Africans,
    and both were prepared to negotiate and sometimes work together with the British. Further, both
    were regarded by the British as being relatively moderate. For contrasts, candidates may note
    TANU’s broad-based support in contrast to Kenyan nationalism, which was more fractured. They
    may also note TANU’s smooth path to independence, a factor related to Tanganyika’s UN Trustee
    status. In contrast, Kenya was a crown colony—moreover, it was one with a sizeable white settler
    population. There may be some imbalance between comparisons and contrasts in the candidates’
    responses.



22. “Nationalist movements were the main factor in the achievement of independence in
    French West Africa.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review that includes a range
    of opinions relating to the role of nationalist movements in the achievement of independence in
    French West Africa. Candidates may mention the significance of trade unionism, communism and
    student groups in the early growth of nationalism. They may stress the role of nationalist leaders
    such as Leopold Senghor—a proponent of a federal post-independence structure that would
    maintain the territorial integrity of French West Africa and retain strong links to Paris—who was
    instrumental in persuading the French to accelerate the decolonization process. Candidates may
    also mention Sékou Touré, who persuaded Guineans to vote against the proposed French
    Community and thus precipitated the breakup of French West Africa. Candidates may also discuss
    other factors in the achievement of independence, including the willingness of the French to
    encourage nationalist movements by offering self-rule and eventually full independence.

Section 12       The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23. Evaluate the challenges to Ottoman power during the first half of the 19th century.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the various challenges facing Ottoman
    power in the first half of the 19th century by weighing up the significance or otherwise of each.
    These challenges may include economic problems such as those related to the decline of Ottoman
    trade due to European powers gaining commercial monopolies in India and China. Candidates may
    note the conservatism of the Ottomans, who were reluctant to introduce western-style reforms or
    innovations because they believed Islamic civilization to be superior. They may also focus on the
    growth of nationalism within the empire and the revolts in Serbia, Greece and Egypt. Candidates
    may acknowledge the Tanzimat (Ottoman reforms), but argue that the implementation of reforms
    was resisted by conservatives. They may also argue that the Tanzimat offered too little and came
    too late to save the empire from its long-term decline.



24. “The decline of Ottoman power was the main reason for the Ottoman Empire's entry in to the First
    World War.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    the decline of Ottoman power was the main reason for the empire’s entry into the First World War.
    Candidates may agree, partially agree or disagree with the statement. They may refer to the
    constriction of Ottoman territory in the decades preceding the war, and the hope that military victory
    would allow the empire to recover lost lands. They may suggest that the war may have been
    perceived as an opportunity for the empire to redeem its pride, especially after the humiliation of the
    First Balkan War. Candidates may note that Ottoman weakness was also a factor in her decision to
    ally with Germany, which was viewed as the strongest European power. The Ottomans hoped that
    German assistance would help strengthen its army. Candidates may mention factors other than
    Ottoman decline, such as the important strategic location of the empire which increased the
    likelihood that it would be drawn into any conflict, however they must deal with the main issue in the
    question.

Section 13       War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25. “Allied diplomacy in the Middle East was motivated by self-interest.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    allied diplomacy in the Middle East was motivated by self-interest. Candidates may produce
    evidence in support of the statement, including the Constantinople Agreement of 1915, which
    designated the various parts of the Ottoman Empire to the allied powers and/or the Sykes-Picot
    Agreement, by which Britain and France envisioned the post-war allied partitioning and
    administration of Ottoman Arab lands. Candidates may also mention allied wartime duplicity (the
    promises made in the Hussein-McMahon Agreement and the Balfour Declaration were
    contradictory) and the conflict between Wilsonian principles of self-determination and the mandate
    system. They may also consider arguments against the statement, including the views that allied
    diplomacy during the war was focused primarily on military victory, and that mandates were ruled by
    allied powers with a view to preparing them for self-government.



26. Evaluate the success of Ataturk’s rule in the Turkish Republic up to 1938.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the success of Ataturk’s rule in the Turkish
    Republic by weighing up the strengths and limitations of his policies. They may argue that he was
    successful in achieving the aims of his policies of secularization and westernization. These included
    abolishing of the sultanate, the caliphate and Sharia law, introducing the Latin alphabet, westernizing
    dress, abolishing the veil and improving the status of women. He also succeeded in separating
    religion and state and introducing a modern civil legal code and a national, western-style, system of
    education. Candidates may mention economic growth during Ataturk’s rule and Ataturk’s success in
    steering a neutral course in diplomacy. Candidates may also address failures, such as his growing
    authoritarianism and persecution of minority groups, for instance.

Section 14       Africa, international organizations and the international community (20th century)

27. “The failure of the League of Nations to deal with Italian aggression had more significant
    consequences for Abyssinia [Ethiopia] than it did for the League.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    the League of Nations’ failure to deal with Italian aggression had a greater impact on Ethiopia
    (Abyssinia) than it had on the League of Nations itself. When discussing the impact on Ethiopia,
    candidates may address the half a million Ethiopian fatalities, many of whom were killed by aerial
    bombardment and gas attacks. Ethiopia lost its independence and was assimilated—along with
    Eritrea and Italian Somaliland—into the new colony of Italian East Africa. It suffered five years of
    military occupation and the segregationist policies implemented by Italy. As well as consequences
    for Ethiopia, candidates must also address consequences for the League of Nations. They may
    examine the ineffectiveness of its response, a factor that undermined its authority and encouraged
    aggression elsewhere.



28. Evaluate the reasons why the United Nations (UN) failed in Rwanda.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the various reasons why the UN failed
    in Rwanda. They may focus on the small size of the UN mission (UNAMIR), which had an initial
    force of just 1 400 peacekeepers. Candidates may also stress UNAMIR’s limited mandate, which
    did not permit armed intervention, and commander Romeo Dallaire’s failure to receive clarification
    from the UN of the mission’s rules of engagement. The UN also failed to respond to intelligence
    passed on to Dallaire to the effect that genocide was imminent. Candidates may look at Belgium’s
    decision to withdraw its full contingent following the murder of 10 of its peacekeepers, as well as
    France’s close relations with the Hutu-led government. The UN also feared a repeat of the failure of
    its mission in Somalia.

Section 15       Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29. “The British won the South African War (1899–1902) but the Boers won the post-war peace.”
    Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    while the British won the South African War, it was the Boers who would ultimately win the post-war
    peace. Candidates may support the first part of the statement by arguing that the Boers
    surrendered and lost their independence because of the agreements concluded in the Treaty of
    Vereeniging (1902). However, they may counter this and suggest that the difficulties experienced by
    the British during and after the war ensured that it was only the hollowest of victories; the war had
    been costly and protracted for the British, and Britain’s reputation was tarnished by its use of
    scorched earth tactics and concentration camps. When discussing the success (or otherwise) of the
    Boers during the post-war peace, candidates may address the failure of Milner’s Anglicization
    policies, the granting of self-government to the former Boer Republics, and the creation of the Union
    of South Africa, which was led by Boer politicians. Alternatively, they may argue that post-war
    reconciliation and white political and economic domination meant that both sides were “winners”.



30. Evaluate the reasons why the African National Congress (ANC) adopted armed struggle.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons why the African National
    Congress (ANC) adopted armed struggle. Candidates may refer to evidence such as the apartheid
    laws passed since 1948 and argue that armed struggle was the ANC’s ultimate response to a racist
    system. They may note the peaceful campaigns and demonstrations organized by the ANC and
    argue that these had failed to persuade an intransigent government to negotiate. Candidates may
    stress the importance of the Sharpeville Massacre and argue that the government’s response to
    this—the banning of the ANC—dramatically narrowed the scope for more peaceful protest. They
    may also mention the influence of the South African Communist Party and rivalry with the Pan
    Africanist Congress, a movement that had already created its own armed wing.

Section 16       Social and cultural developments in Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries

31. “African Independent Churches emerged because colonial rule was unpopular.” To what extent do
    you agree with this statement?

    The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that African
    Independent Churches emerged because colonial rule was unpopular. They may agree, partially
    agree or disagree with the statement. When arguing in support of the statement, candidates may
    focus on the way in which independent churches were used as a vehicle for popular opposition to
    the colonial state and its policies. Independent churches stood in contrast to the mission churches,
    which were associated with colonialism. Candidates may also look at how the colonial authorities
    tried to eradicate traditional practices such as polygamy and argue that independent churches were
    seen to be a refuge for African culture. Candidates may also look at the influence of Black American
    evangelism, the theology of which was strongly anti-colonial, on the independent churches. In
    disagreement with the statement, candidates may argue that the emergence of independent
    churches was due more to dissatisfaction with existing churches than to disaffection with colonial
    rule.



32. Evaluate the impact of developments in education in two African countries.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of developments in
    education in two African countries, weighing up the significance, or otherwise, of those
    developments to each country. Candidates may choose to focus on the neglect of academic
    education under colonialism, particularly in white settler colonies where Africans were prepared for a
    life of servitude. In other colonies, it was the Christian mission and/or Islamic schools that provided
    education. Further, while the academic standards of these institutions were often high, most
    Africans received little or no education. Candidates may also focus on how newly-independent
    governments faced substantial challenges in providing universal primary and secondary education.
    They may consider the success of some countries in meeting these challenges, especially in term of
    opening opportunities in education to females. Candidates may, if they desire, adopt a comparative
    approach; however, this is not a requirement.

Section 17        Post-war developments in the Middle East (1945–2000)

33. “The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 was the result of tensions and instability in Palestine
    following the Second World War.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    the creation of Israel was the result of tensions and instability in Palestine following the Second
    World War. Candidates may agree, partially agree or disagree with the statement. In their
    arguments, they may focus on tension between Jews and Arabs after the war and the declaration of
    open war on the British by Jewish underground groups. Candidates may note how this instability led
    the British to hand the decision of the future of the territory over to the United Nations. The UN ruled
    that it should be partitioned, a decision rejected by the Palestinians. When the British officially
    terminated its mandate, David Ben-Gurion declared an independent Israeli state. While the focus of
    candidates’ responses must be on post-war factors, to contextualize their arguments, candidates
    may refer to pre-1945 evidence. This may include the creation of the World Zionist Congress, the
    Balfour Declaration, the Peel Commission and the mass murder of European Jews during the Third
    Reich.



34. “The outbreak of civil war in Lebanon in 1975 was mainly caused by outside interference.” Discuss.

    The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that
    the civil war in Lebanon was mainly caused by outside interference. Candidates may stress the
    primacy of outside interference as a cause by considering the creation of a League of Nations
    mandate that included Christians, Druze and Shia and Sunni Muslims within its borders. Sectarian
    resentments were stoked by the French, who favoured the Christian population. The volatile mix of
    populations was added to by large numbers of Palestinian refugees who flooded into the country
    following the creation of Israel and the expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from
    Jordan. Candidates may also mention the Israeli Special Forces raid in 1973 that went some way to
    destabilizing the country. Candidates may also stress the importance of domestic politics, including
    the weakness of the army and the creation of militias.

Section 18       Post-independence politics in Africa to 2005

35. Evaluate the responses of two African countries to the post-independence challenges of disease
    and poverty.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of two African countries’ responses to the
    post-independence challenges of disease and poverty, weighing up the strengths and limitations of
    each of those countries’ responses. Candidates may adopt a comparative approach, although this
    is not a requirement. They may choose from a range of case studies in their responses but many of
    themes addressed will be similar. For instance, candidates may refer to heavy investment of some
    countries in schools, hospitals and clinics, and in specialist training in health and education. Many
    countries used UN agencies and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide specialist
    infrastructure, especially in remote areas and those hit by drought and famine. Several of these also
    sought to achieve food security to reduce diseases caused by malnutrition. Candidates may
    address factors that inhibited effective responses, such as conflict, corruption, and high levels of
    military spending and government debt.



36. With reference to two African countries, evaluate the success of African states in the return to multi-
    party democracy in the 1980s and 1990s.

    The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the success of two African states in the
    return to multi-party democracy in the 1980s and 1990s. They may choose from a range of case
    studies in their responses. Examples that may be chosen include (but are not limited to) the
    following countries: Nigeria, where periods of democracy were punctuated by military coups;
    Uganda, where initial optimism regarding the restoration of democracy by Museveni was replaced
    by concerns over human rights abuses; Zambia, where similar optimism surrounded the election of
    Chiluba; and Ghana, where a transition to democracy under Rawlings proved to be enduring and
    was accompanied by impressive economic growth. Candidates may adopt a comparative approach,
    or an approach where the success or otherwise of the two countries is addressed separately.
