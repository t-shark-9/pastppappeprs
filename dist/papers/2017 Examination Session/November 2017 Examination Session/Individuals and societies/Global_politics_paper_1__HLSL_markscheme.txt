Unit 2      Human rights

Bulleted lists in this markscheme indicate likely points that candidates may include in their
answer: they are not exhaustive, and examiners should credit other valid points not listed.

                         Practice of, and claims on, human rights

1.    With specific reference to Source A, identify how expectations of women might
      impact on their human rights.                                                                 [3]

      Answers may include:
      • Source A depicts the unpaid labour of childcare and associates women with this
        role. The comment and the picture of the man resting reinforces the fact that this
        work is not viewed as difficult and is naturally a female activity
      • Source A shows that the woman is in a rural setting and appears to be taking
        responsibility for the home and /or children ie looking after farm animals and
        gathering supplies. The comment reinforces the fact that this (house) work is not
        viewed as difficult and is not classed as equivalent to work. Stereotypes about
        domestic and paid labour are in evidence here
      • Source A draws attention to the driver and their views and illustrates that they have
        a demeaning and limited view of a woman’s contribution to work
      • Source A is using the idea of gendered roles to show unequal treatment of women.
        It is arguably a simplification of society and may imply that all men are better off than
        women and that men do not have roles as stay at home fathers, for example
      • Source A is a cartoon and is using humour to shed light on unequal treatment of
        women. This suggests that such views about gendered roles are commonly held in
        society and not yet addressed.

      Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].
                                                –4–                 N17/3/GLPOL/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2   Using Source B and one example you have studied, explain the impact of gender
    inequality.                                                                                [4]

    Answers may include, but are not limited to:
    • Source B shows how different groups of women experience different challenges to
      equality (ie compounded by ethnic or socio-economic background)
    • Source B shows how traditional views about gender roles (including unpaid
      domestic work) have created economic inequality and a pay gap. By extension
      women’s social and economic opportunities are lessened
    • Source B shows that women have had unequal access to education and training.
      By extension women’s social and economic opportunities (including through literacy)
      are lessened and their participation in democratic processes is likely to be less than
      that of men
    • Source B shows reports by large international organisations. They express alarm
      which suggests that the challenge is very significant and that their intervention is
      required to motivate people and governments to change.

    Other relevant points not listed can also be rewarded. Candidates are not expected to
    make four separate points in order to achieve full marks. For each valid point a
    maximum of [2] may be awarded, up to a total of [4]. For responses that do not make
    reference to both the source and to one example, award a maximum of [3].

3.   Compare the obstacles to women’s equality as described in Source C and
     Source D.                                                                                  [8]

     Potential points of comparison:
     Women hindered by lack of power (physical abuse and lack of schooling)
     • Source C suggests that women experience more gender violence that men. They
       are also not subject to equal protection from violence
     • Source D also makes reference to the obstacle of domestic violence and the need to
       tackle this form of inequality in order to progress
     • Source D shows how women are undermined by limited access to education.

     Late response to women’s equality by institutions
     • Source C shows that Brazil has created important laws for women (in 2013).
       Previously, women were likely to have had little protection and lacked institutional /
       legislative support
     • Source C also suggests that action is needed because state institutions such as the
       police and churches have perpetuated inequality for a long time
     • Source D illustrates that rural women have not had equal rights to financial
       assistance until recently. This will provide a future challenge as younger
       generations only now begin to realise their potential.

     The need for action by women
     • Source C suggests that action is needed because state institutions such as the
       police and churches may be failing in their duty to protect women, especially from
       violence. This shows the complexity of the situation and emphasises the precarious
       status of many women
     • Source C shows that progress on domestic and sexual violence has been slow
       because it is not talked about in public. This is a societal or community wide
       challenge to be met politically and publicly
     • Source D discusses women’s organised and collective action for equality in Brazil.
       The call for protest suggests a need for urgent change but also a longstanding or
       entrenched problem
     • Source D also makes reference to the need for women to have an equal voice.
       Women are not able to secure rights as they are not being heard.

     Links between personal and public life
     • Source C suggests that the gender / cultural issue of machismo might allow men to
        behave in more violent ways and often with impunity
     • Source C also shows how violence often takes place in the home and remains a
        private issue
     • Source D shows that women’s inequality begins in the home with unequal treatment
        and recognition over issues such as housework. By extension women’s social and
        economic opportunities are lessened.

     Do not expect all of the points above, and allow other valid points. Award [2] per
     effective point of contrast up to a maximum of [8].

     If the view of only one source is discussed award a maximum of [4]. For a response
     which focuses significantly on one source with only minimal reference to the other
     source, award a maximum of [5]. For responses that discuss the sources separately,
     rather than in a running contrast, award a maximum [6].

4.   “Women’s rights are the same as human rights.” Discuss this claim, using all
     the sources and your own knowledge.                                                        [10]

     Question 4 is assessed according to the markbands that follow, in conjunction with
     these marking notes.

     Source material may include, but is not limited to:
     Source A
     • The source is a cartoon used in a gender equality campaign. It illustrates an
       overburdened woman and also draws attention to a corresponding lack of
       recognition of her work. This justifies the quotation’s cry for specific attention
     • The source shows how women’s lives are integrated into society through their
       responsibilities. The argument can be made that without women’s rights, other
       human rights – for example those of many dependents cannot be secured.

     Source B
     • The source raises the issue of a natural or societal, sexual division of labour. Their
       status arguably means that they require attention and support to experience
       equality. The quotation also hints that there may be two tiers of rights and that
       women need to be taken more seriously as holders of human rights and that human
       rights need to be understood as related to gender
     • Source B shows that women’s rights are also connected to age and ethnicity (also
       known as intersectionality in law). The case could be made that other groups also
       need to be focused on (within human rights) and the status of women is complex.
       This also raises the issue of expanding claims for rights for other groups under the
       umbrella term of human rights
     • Source B clearly shows that equality for women has not been attained in many
       areas and this justifies the quotation’s cry for specific recognition and attention on
       women’s rights. In this sense, women’s difference is key to attaining appropriate
       rights and human rights campaigns which do not refer to women may not secure
       enough support.

     Source C
     • Source C illustrates violence and discrimination towards women. The argument can
       be made that women are often violently attacked by men, and not afforded the same
       protection as men within society. This inequality justifies campaigns in their name
       and the specificity of pursuing “women’s rights” until progress is made. Their status
       arguably means that they require urgent and separate attention
     • Source C makes reference to slow and difficult progress in this area suggesting that
       women’s rights appear to be less important than men’s rights and even religious
       organisations may have to further advance women’s rights. The quotation suggests
       that it is hypocritical to pursue human rights without attention to the situation of
       women. Human rights need to be understood as related to gender.

     Source D
     • Source D also illustrates that violence is an ongoing issue towards women despite
       significant advances in legislation. Women’s rights have had a limited impact on
       their lives and women are urged to protest and take action as well
     • Source D notes that equality for women is a global challenge which helps make the
       case for advancing their cause.

Own knowledge could include, but is not limited to:
• Using their knowledge and all sources candidates may refer more broadly to the
  politics of gender including observations about power relations between men and
  women. A counter argument may be made that lobbying for women’s rights has not
  yet helped many women and possibly reinforced marginalisation of their status
• Using their own knowledge, candidates may argue that rights are a subjective idea
  and that human rights have failed many groups, not just women
• Using their own knowledge answers may draw attention to a range of identities such
  as children or indigenous people in order to make points about interests and
  activism. For example, candidates may make a comparison with children’s rights in
  that children are humans too but their roles and capabilities or status in society may
  mean that they need separate protection or greater attention rather than being
  subsumed under human rights
• Conversely the quotation might also be suggesting that we do not need to refer to
  women’s rights, only human rights and that the terms are interchangeable.

Do not expect all of the above, and reward other relevant points and/or examples
not listed.

If only source material or only own knowledge is used, the response can only be
awarded a maximum of [6].

To achieve the maximum [10], expect argument, synthesis of all four sources and own
knowledge.

Students should synthesize and evaluate evidence from the sources and from their
study of the prescribed content and key concepts of the course.

Markbands for question 4

The aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the student,
using the best-fit model. The mark awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of
achievement against the descriptor. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor
to be met for that mark to be awarded.

  Marks      Level descriptor
    0         • The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
   1–2        • There is a very limited understanding of the demands of the question.
              • There is little relevant knowledge.
              • The response is mostly descriptive and may contain unsupported
                generalizations.
   3–4        • There is limited understanding of the demands of the question, or the
                question is only partially addressed.
              • Some knowledge is demonstrated, but this is not always relevant or
                accurate, and may not be used appropriately or effectively.
              • Counterclaims, or different views on the question, are not identified.
   5–6        • The response shows an understanding of the demands of the question.
              • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant, and there is some limited
                synthesis of own knowledge and source material.
              • Counterclaims, or different views on the question, are implicitly identified but
                are not explored.
   7–8        • The response is focused and shows a good understanding of the demands
                of the question.
              • Relevant and accurate knowledge is demonstrated, there is a synthesis of
                own knowledge and source material, and appropriate examples are used.
              • Counterclaims, or different views on the question, are explored.
   9–10       • The response is clearly focused and shows a high degree of understanding
                of the demands of the question.
              • Relevant and accurate knowledge is demonstrated, there is effective
                synthesis of own knowledge and source material, with appropriate
                examples integrated.
