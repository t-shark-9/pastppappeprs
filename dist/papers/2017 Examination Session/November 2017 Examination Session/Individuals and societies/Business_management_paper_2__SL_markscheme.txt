                                           Section A
1.   (a)   Describe one reason why brand loyalty would be important to PP.                          [2]

           Brand loyalty would be important to PP given that they operate in a local market
           with a number of competitors and that the prices they charge are higher. Given
           this fact, it would be critical for PP to have brand loyalty or their sales could fall
           (although not on the stimulus, sharp-eyed candidates may spot that PP’s pies are
           price inelastic given the additional information for 2018).

           Accept any other relevant description.

           Award [1] mark for conveying some understanding that PP has considerable competition or
           that it charges higher prices than most of its competitors. If a candidate conveys an
           understanding of both of those ideas, award [2] marks.

           A candidate can achieve one or two marks by making other accurate assertions about brand
           loyalty, provided they are relevant and logically reasonable (for example, brand loyalty
           assures some continuity of revenue or stable revenue). Award up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Construct a profit and loss account for PP for the year ending 30 April 2017
           based on the figures in Table 1 (show all your working).                                 [4]

Candidates do not have to list all types of expenses (electricity, rent, promotion)
under expenses, as the IBO format does not specify different items. Therefore,
working of electricity and rent per year are not expected.
Supporting working is expected with the calculation of total revenue/costs
/interest/tax are given.

Please note:

If the candidate was penalised for inappropriate structure or headings/format in
part (b) and repeats the same in part (c) provided that the working is correct and
shown, do not double penalise and award full marks.

Generally, do not double penalise any wrong headings/ omission presented in
part (b) and repeated in part (c). Question (c) is more about the manipulation/
calculation of the old figures.

However, be aware that sometimes a candidate makes a mistake in question (b)
(for example, in calculating income tax) and also miscalculates income tax in
question (c) but makes a different kind of error (in one instance multiplies 25 % by
net profit before tax but makes a mathematical error and then, in the other
instance, multiples 25 % by net profit before interest), then each should be
counted as an error.

       [1] for both appropriately labelled axes – y-axis must include both costs and
        revenue. The x-axis can be any suggestion of quantity, including output
       [1] for accurately drawn and labelled total cost line.
       [1] for accurately drawn and labelled total revenue line.
       [1] for indication of break-even point. OFR applies from part (b)(i).

      Award a maximum of [2] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight edge, or
      is not to scale. If a candidate “free hands” their break-even chart, the
      maximum they can receive is [2]. For two marks, the break-even chart
      should be largely correct – axes correctly labelled. Total revenue and Total
      cost lines identified and largely correct. For example, Total revenue line
      should start at (0,0) and total cost line should start where the Fixed cost
      line intersects the y axis.

      If a candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0].

3.   (a)   Define the term diseconomy of scale.                                                   [2]

           Diseconomy of scale refers to an increase in average unit cost as a business
           increases in size.

           Accept any other relevant definition.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           of the idea that a business can develop inefficiencies as it grows in size.

           Award [2] for a full, clear description that conveys knowledge and understanding
           similar to the answer above. To receive [2], candidates must express the idea of
           an increase in per unit cost as a business increases in size. In some instances, a
           candidate does not have literally to say “per unit”. For example, if a candidate
           says “average cost” and the response is otherwise sufficiently strong so that a
           reader can know from context that the candidate intends per unit or average unit
           cost, award [2].

     (b)   Using the table, construct a product position map/perception map for all four
           companies.                                                                             [4]




           Award [1] for the overall layout of the map with both axes correctly labelled
           (price: high or low; quality: high or low).

           N.B. It does not matter which one is horizontal / vertical.

           The correct positioning is as shown above. Adjust appropriately if a candidate
           makes price the horizontal axis and quality the vertical axis.

           Award [2] for a correctly labelled position map with two of the companies properly
           placed.

           Award [3] for a correctly labelled position map with three of the companies
           properly placed.
                                              – 13 –               N17/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Award [4] for a correctly labelled position map with all four companies properly
      placed.

      If a candidate correct produces a position map, correctly labels the axes, places
      DE correctly on the x axis (if the position map is oriented as above), and has
      companies A, B, and C correctly placed in terms of price but slightly off-center in
      terms of quality, award [3] provided that A, B, and C are vertically aligned (or
      horizontally aligned if the map is oriented the other way).

      In this case, the candidate has made one conceptual error – where to place
      medium quality – and repeated it two more times. Do not double and triple
      penalize. In effect, the candidate has drawn a correct position map and placed
      three companies correctly, assuming a “conceptual OFR”.

(c)   (i)    Draw and label a product life cycle curve.                                        [2]




             Award [1] if the candidate demonstrates some understanding of the product
             life cycle curve. Award an additional [1] if the candidate has correctly
             drawn the product life cycle curve, labelled both axes correctly, and
             identified at least four of the following stages: development, induction,
             growth, maturity, and decline (candidates do not have to use precisely
             those terms but they should be terms of roughly equal meaning). Award a
             maximum of [2].

             N.B. If a candidate has at least four stages correctly drawn and identified
             and labeled correctly the x axis but labels the y axis “market share”,
             award [2].

      (ii)   Explain how DE’s innovation is an extension strategy.                             [2]

             DE’s sales appears to have been at a maturity. Then, after the hackers,
             sales began to decline industry-wide. By developing an innovation that
             prevented the hackers from affecting the security of their product, DE was
             able to extend the life of its product. Sales not only returned to prior levels
             but actually began to increase.

             Award [1] if candidates convey some understanding of an extension
             strategy. Award [2] for a clear explanation.

             If a candidate merely draws and labels an extension curve on their product
             life cycle, award [1] for 3 (c) (ii).
                                             – 14 –               N17/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   With reference to DE, discuss the merits of small organizations compared to
      large organizations.                                                                    [10]

      In general, advantages of large businesses include:
       an enhanced ability to survive
       economies of scale
       higher status
       market leader status
       increased market share.

      In general, advantages of being small include:
        greater focus
        greater cachet
        greater motivation
        competitive advantage
        less competition.

      In the case of DE, the above advantages would in general apply. However, the
      circumstances can be further nuanced based upon the stimulus. Traditionally,
      the company was small and had a focus on quality, arguably its unique selling
      point. As the company grew, many insiders worried that DE would lose its focus
      on quality. Now, if it is to have cachet, it will have to rebrand itself and base its
      USP more on the security that its product offers.

      Although the company probably also experienced a number of economies of
      scale, it was also experiencing some diseconomies, which invariably reflect that
      some inefficiencies from growth have crept into the business. With growth, DE
      has probably expanded its workforce. An increase in employees could change
      the character of the organization. Communication would be more difficult, both in
      the literal sense (having to communicate to a larger number of people) and in the
      figurative sense (new employees do not know the “unwritten” rules and norms of
      an organization, so greater care has to be taken in all communications).

      An increase in size brings both advantages and disadvantages. In general, the
      larger the organization, the more it can benefit financially from size – more
      product lines and products and, with a diversity of revenue streams, an enhanced
      ability to survive. However, in DE’s case, it still has only one product. If the
      company grows and it increases its fixed costs, it takes some risks. If one of its
      competitors develops an ability to provide comparable security to the product of
      DE, DE’s sales could fall – but it may now be committed to higher fixed costs.

      Candidates are expected to provide conclusions and judgment.

      Accept any other relevant answer.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further

(c)   With reference to GT, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of
      debt factoring.                                                                       [4]

      Advantages of debt factoring. The business (GT):
       does not have to carry the invoice (receivable) for the duration (or longer) of
        the credit terms but rather receives cash immediately upon sale to the factor.
        Thus, factoring reduces the working capital requirements.
       does not have to provide any collateral. Unlike when taking out a revolving or
        seasonal line of credit, the business does not have to provide a lender with
        collateral. As a result, the business may use any assets it has available for
        collateral for other borrowing requirements.
       does not have the credit risk of the debtor, as the factor assumes the credit
        risk (though, over time, if GT routinely sold uncollectable invoices, the factor
        would adjust its discount rate to account for credit losses or not purchase
        invoices from certain customers). Without the credit risk, the business does
        not have to have a collections employee/department and will not have credit
        losses.

      The disadvantages of factoring include:
       The high cost. While the discount rate may vary, the discount rate used by
        debt factors almost always equates to a higher rate of interest than a loan.
        Thus, the cost of debt factoring is high.
       Loss of control. Collection of the invoice is in the hands of the factor, who may
        or may not use collection methods consistent with the approach of the
        business selling the invoices. Customer relations could suffer if the factor
        uses harsh collection methods or a negative tone in collection.
       Damage to reputation. In general, some stigma is attached to reliance on debt
        factors, as it alerts customers that the business (GT) lacks working capital or
        the ability to borrow. A poor reputation weakens a firm’s ability to negotiate
        and may mean loss of customers (businesses want suppliers who are
        reliable).

      Accept other relevant advantages and disadvantages.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and / or application.

(d)   Examine Elaine’s proposals to cut back on “GT’s commitment to its employees
      and CSR practices”.                                                                      [10]

      The main thrust of this question is for candidates to consider the difficult financial
      situation that GT has gotten itself into and how the company may try to resolve
      the issue. The CFO’s idea to cut back on GT’s commitments to employees and
      to CSR rests on the notion that commitments to employees and CSR are costly
      and that saving those expenses could help pay for the commitment and generate
      profits to support much needed working capital. However, the stimulus makes
      clear that commitments to employees and CSR are core values of the company
      and possibly the very basis for the success of the company. To eliminate them or
      weaken them may cause other (costly) issues for the business.

      Candidates should distinguish between commitments to employees and
      commitments to CSR. Cutting commitments to employees would erode trust and
      loyalty, bringing long-term damage to the company, whereas cutting CSR for a
      short period of time is more justifiable and explainable. Candidates may want to
      propose other solutions – selling assets, other sources of finance, etc.

      Balance in the context of this question means nuanced advantages and
      disadvantages of cutting back on GT’s commitments to employees and to CSR.
      If candidates do not treat commitment to employees and commitment to CSR
      separately, award a maximum of [7].

      Candidates are expected to provide conclusions and judgment.

      Accept any other relevant answer.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5 with further

      analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the

5.   (a)   Define the term ethical objective.                                                     [2]

           Ethical objectives are the goals of a business based on a set of values or moral
           beliefs. They should cover all the actions of an organization and guide its
           decision-making process and strategies. Ethical objectives at GC: using
           environmentally friendly products to reduce pollution; paying fair wages.

           Accept any other relevant definition.

           N.B. no application required. Do not credit examples alone. The candidate must
           provide a definition.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           (Ethical objectives are the goals of a business based on a set of values or moral
           beliefs).

           Award [2] for a full definition that conveys knowledge and understanding similar to
           the answer above, especially the idea that ethical objectives are more expansive
           than doing some ethically upstanding act (giving to a charity, paying for employees’
           attendance at night school, etc.)

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for GC of recruiting gardeners
           externally.                                                                            [4]

           Advantages could include:
            GC will have access to a larger pool of applicants for the job. They will
             increase their chances of recruiting trained professional gardeners to offer a
             wider range of quality services.
            New employees will have the necessary professional qualifications when
             hired.
            Recruiting externally could bring younger workers to the company that could
             help to motivate current employees and provide a fresher outlook at GC.

           Disadvantages of recruiting gardeners externally:
            Recruiting gardeners externally can damage morale and motivation at GC.
              Cleaners may feel it lessens their chances of becoming gardeners.
              Productivity in the cleaning services may fall. Conflict with the union may
              arise and erode the working environment at GC.
            External recruitment could take more time, especially if in the labour market it
              is difficult to find professional gardeners.
            Externally recruited gardeners could take more time to adjust and adapt to the
              organization.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for identifying or describing the advantage / disadvantage of recruiting
           gardeners externally and a further [1] for a development with respect to GC.
           Award a maximum of [2].

           [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either
           explanation and / or application.

      For example:
       For an identification or a description of an advantage / disadvantage with or
        without application [1].
       For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage with no application [1].
       For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for GC of using off-the-job training
      for the cleaners who would like to become gardeners.                                      [4]

      Advantages include:
       An external provider is likely to have more expertise and knowhow in
        gardening than GC.
       It could help motivate cleaners who may see training to become a gardener as
        a form of promotion due to the higher wage paid.

      Disadvantages include:
        Assuming that the training will take place during work time, there will be some
         disruption to productivity in addition to the cost incurred for the training itself.
       It is difficult for GC to monitor what the trainees have learnt. Will there be an
         examination at the end of the course?

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for identifying or describing the advantage / disadvantage of off-the-job
      training and a further [1] for a development with respect to GC. Award a
      maximum of [2].

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage / disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and / or application.

      For example:
       For an identification or a description of an advantage / disadvantage with or
        without application [1].
       For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage with no application [1].
       For explanation of an advantage / disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   With reference to two motivation theories, examine the motivation of cleaners
      at GC.                                                                                [10]

      GC wants to recruit professional gardeners and pay them higher wages. This
      decision is causing resentment among current cleaners at GC.

      Candidates may refer to the following motivation theories: the works of Taylor,
      Maslow, Herzberg, Adams, Pink.

      Candidates are expected to use two theories in order to examine the motivation
      of cleaners. Candidates are tested on their ability to apply theories with constant
      use of, and reference to, the information from the stimulus.

       Herzberg’s motivation factors, for example, can be widened so as to include
        job satisfaction through being treated fairly, especially as the cleaners
        perceive the gardeners to be at the same skill level as themselves.
       Candidates could use Adams’ theory in relation to the rewards from GC not
        meeting the efforts that cleaners are putting in. Though HR are considering
        offering employee share ownership scheme, which, if introduced, may cause
        resentment among shareholders as their wealth is shared.
       Maslow’s higher level of needs can be reached due to empowerment and
        trust. Although cleaners are often low skilled they are trusted to work in
        various environments.
       Taylor says that people are motivated by economic factors. The cleaners may
        feel demotivated from being paid less than gardeners.

      Candidates should demonstrate an understanding that paying gardeners a higher
      wage is causing insecurity and a feeling of injustice among cleaners. It is likely
      that they are scared of the change. Some of them have worked for GC for over
      two decades. Consequently, the cleaners are becoming demotivated and may
      reduce their efforts. Some employees might not be interested in training to
      become gardeners but want to be treated fairly.

      Accept any relevant theory that is applied to the information given in the
      stimulus material.

      Theorists and theories should be applied not just mentioned. If a candidate does
      not apply the theories, maximum award [2].

      Accept any other relevant examination.

      A conclusion with judgment is expected.

      A balanced response is one that covers two motivation theories.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further
      guidance below.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

      Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
      analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
      stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

                                          Section C
Marks should be allocated using the assessment criteria on pages 6 to 7 with further guidance below.

N.B. examiners should include a breakdown of each mark awarded per criterion and a brief note
explaining the mark awarded at the end of each candidate’s response.


The main aim of paper 2 (SL or HL) section C is to assess candidates’ understanding of the six major
concepts (change, culture, ethics, globalization, innovation, strategy) within a business
context. Candidates are to demonstrate their understanding through an organization of their choice.
The expectation of the use of an organization is to allow assessment of the depth of candidates’
understanding through their ability to apply the concepts and their knowledge.
Assessment of candidates’ knowledge of the organization itself is not an aim of the assessment. If a
candidate makes minor factual errors and these minor errors have no genuine bearing on whether the
candidate understands the concepts, examiners should not penalize. For example, a minor error of
historical fact (the year when a company was founded, for example, or the year in which a change was
implemented) that has no genuine bearing on candidates’ understanding of the concepts does not
warrant penalty.


Individual question marking notes

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
      operations management strategy.                                                                      [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which
      globalization can influence organizational culture.                                                  [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which ethics and
      change can influence human resource management.                                                      [20]

It is expected that the candidate explains the chosen theoretical direction / content of their response.




                                          Section C
Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria

For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by the
candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be
met for that mark to be awarded.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable by a
  candidate.
 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily reach high
  levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.
                                                   – 25 –               N17/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


If only one concept is addressed:
Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept may be
more significant than the other.

In section C, the question rubric explicitly states that “organizations featured in sections A and B and in
the paper 1 case study may not be used as a basis” to candidate’s answers to questions 6, 7
and 8. When this happens please award marks as follows:
 Criterion A: award a maximum of [1]. The business management content cannot be relevant if the
   organization is fictitious.
 Criterion B: 0 marks – there is no connection to a “real-world organization”.
 Criterion C: award a maximum of [1]. The arguments cannot be relevant if the organization is
   fictitious.
 Criterion D: mark as normal.
 Criterion E: award up to a maximum of [1]. The individual and/or group perspective(s) cannot be
   relevant if the organization is fictitious.

Criterion B
 For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
 Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept – therefore
   accept 2 + 2 arguments for a balanced response.
 Justification is through logic or data.
 For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are all one-
   sided then this would be unjustified.
 For [3] there is some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
 Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
 The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
 A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occur. It is usually located between the
   introduction and the conclusion.
 Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way.
   For example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
 One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager. However
   this could not be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
 For [4], a balanced response: need to look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s). The
   chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with specific explanation.
 Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
 Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.
