Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Voice biometrics technology in banking

     Telephone passwords and security questions could soon become obsolete as financial institutions
     such as CBR Bank implement technology that can authenticate a customer’s identity based on the
     characteristics of their voice. CBR Bank is now introducing voiceprint biometrics technology that
     can identify customers when they telephone the bank.

     As part of the registration process, the customer has to say the phrase, “my voice is my password”
     three times. This provides a “voiceprint” that will be used to verify the customer’s identity in future
     telephone calls to the bank.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two forms of biometric identification other than voice.                        [2]

		         (ii)   Identify the steps used by the voiceprint biometric technology to authenticate a
                  customer calling CBR Bank.                                                              [4]

     (b)   CBR Bank holds a large amount of information on its customers. Some customers are
           concerned about the security, privacy and anonymity of their data.

           For each of the concerns above, explain one policy that CBR Bank could use to
           address the concerns of its customers.                                                         [6]

     (c)   The chief executive officer (CEO) of CBR Bank, Alice McEwan, said in a recent
           interview, “CBR Bank will be replacing all passwords, PINs and personal verification
           questions for our online banking and mobile banking with voice biometric recognition.”

           Discuss whether the changes proposed by Alice are beneficial for both CBR Bank’s
           customers and CBR Bank’s IT support.                                                           [8]

2.   Goal-line technology in soccer (football)

     In 2010, at the soccer World Cup tournament in South Africa, England were denied a goal in a
     match against Germany, even though the ball had clearly crossed the goal-line. This led football
     officials to introduce goal-line technology in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The referees wore
     watches that vibrated and displayed the word “GOAL” every time the ball crossed the goal-line.

     Goal-line technology includes 14 cameras that track the ball around the pitch and uses a network
     of high-speed video cameras to track the ball in flight. The cameras create high resolution images.

     The software calculates the ball’s location in each frame by identifying the pixels that correspond
     to the ball. The software can track the ball and predict its flight path, even if the view of several
     cameras is blocked. An encrypted message is sent to the referee’s watch in less than one second
     to let the referee know whether the ball has crossed the goal-line.

     All of the information collected by the goal-line technology is stored in a database.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Define the term resolution.                                                           [2]

		         (ii)    Using the following assumptions:
                   1 pixel is made of 24 bits
                   1 kilobyte (KB) = 1000 bytes
                   1 megabyte (MB) = 1000 KB

                   Calculate in megabytes (MB) the storage requirements for an image size of
                   2000 pixels by 4000 pixels.                                                           [2]

		         (iii)   The system records the ball’s flight path into a database.

                   Identify two fields that would be found in the goal-line technology database.         [2]

     (b)   The goal-line technology is capable of collecting vast quantities of data. To make this
           manageable three policies are needed: for the collection, storage and sharing of data.

           Explain how each of these three policies could be implemented so that the quantity of
           data is manageable.                                                                           [6]

     (c)   Many sports have introduced technology to assist officials with their decision-making at
           critical moments. These include whether to award a goal in soccer (football), whether a
           shot in tennis is in, or whether a sprinter has made a false start.

           To what extent do the advantages of introducing technology in sport outweigh the
           disadvantages?                                                                                [8]

3.   Social media and political tension

     National governments sometimes block websites at a time of political tension. One example was
     in 2011, when a government prevented its citizens access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
     Images on these websites were considered inappropriate, with the potential to cause hatred,
     violence and political unrest in that country. The national government gave direct orders to the
     internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to these sites for four hours. The aim was to give
     enough time for site officials to remove the offending images from their websites.

     Despite these attempts by the government, some citizens were still able to access these images
     using proxy servers.

     Many people, such as academics, believe that this approach is not appropriate and governments
     should focus on the education of their citizens so that they are able to make informed decisions
     about how to react to potentially offensive information on websites and social media.

                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2017]



     (a)   (i)   In addition to providing access to the Internet, identify two functions of an internet
                 service provider (ISP).                                                                  [2]

		(ii)           Identify two characteristics of a proxy server.                                          [2]

		(iii)          Identify two ways that the government could have determined the identity of the
                 persons responsible for posting the offending images on the social media.                [2]

     (b)   Many schools block access to social networking websites such as Twitter, Facebook
           and YouTube. However, other schools are investigating two different options:

           • monitoring the network to view what websites the students are viewing, or
           • giving different ages of students different levels of access to social media sites.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   Many citizens have raised concerns about the surveillance of their web browsing
           history or censorship of selected websites by their national government.

           To what extent is it appropriate for national governments to use surveillance and
           censorship to control citizens’ access to websites?                                            [8]

4.   Sports watches used in physical education (PE) lessons

     Sports watches are now used with high school students (aged 11–18) in their physical education
     lessons at Collège Earlet in Quebec. Students will wear the device around their wrist during sports
     and fitness activities. In some lessons, teachers can use their tablet to see the students’ vital
     signs* provided by the sports watches and even project the information for all students to see (see
     Figure 2).

     Before the lesson, teachers set heart rate targets, measured in beats per minute (bpm), for each
     student.

     During the lesson, students should aim to stay within their recommended heart rate limits.
     After the lesson, the software will email the students a summary of their heart rate data as well as
     a number of other vital signs recorded by the sports watch, with a copy sent to their teachers and
     parents.

(Question 4 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Apart from heart rate, identify two possible vital signs that could be recorded by
                   the sports watch.                                                                    [2]

		         (ii)    At the start of each lesson the student is asked to set their maximum heart rate
                   on the watch to 220 bpm − their age; so in the case of a 15-year-old it would be
                   220 bpm − 15 = 205 bpm.

                   Identify the steps used by the software in the sports watch to encourage students
                   not to exceed their maximum heart rate.                                              [4]

     (b)   (i)     Explain one advantage for the student of using these monitoring devices.             [2]

		(ii)             Explain one advantage for the teacher if their students are using these
                   monitoring devices.                                                                  [2]

		         (iii)   Explain why the reliability of the sports watches may be a concern for the
                   teachers.                                                                            [2]

     (c)   The principal at Collège Earlet has been discussing arrangements for sharing data
           from the students’ watches with a third party, Fitness World.

           Discuss whether the principal at Collège Earlet should agree to share data that has
           been collected by the students’ watches with Fitness World.                                  [8]
