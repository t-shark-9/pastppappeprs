                                               Section A
Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one study related to localization of function in the brain.                             [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one study
     related to localization of function in the brain.

     Candidates should clearly identify the specific part of the brain and its function, and use a
     relevant study to demonstrate localization of function.

     Responses should describe the aim, procedure, findings and/or conclusions of the study.

     Examples of localization include, but are not limited to:
     • localization of speech production/understanding
     • the role of the hippocampus and memory
     • the role of the amygdala in aggression
     • the role of the prefrontal lobe in decision-making.

     If Sperry and Gazzaniga’s study of split-brain patients is described, it is important that the
     focus of the response is on localization of function.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should be given only to the first
     description.

     If a candidate addresses localization of function without making reference to a relevant
     study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [3].

     If a candidate describes a study that is not relevant to localization of function, [0] should
     be awarded.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Explain how one principle that defines the cognitive level of analysis may be
     demonstrated in one example of research (theory or study).                                         [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands on the next page when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of how one
     principle that defines the cognitive level of analysis is clearly demonstrated in one relevant
     theory or study.

     Acceptable principles include, but are not limited to:
     • cognitive processes can be scientifically investigated
     • cognitive processes are important mediators between stimuli and responses
     • mental representations guide behaviour
     • cognitive processing can be compared to computer function

     After outlining the principle and giving a brief summary of one study or theory, candidates
     should make an explicit link between the research and the principle. If a relevant principle
     and research are identified but are not explicitly linked, then apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [6].

     If a candidate explains a principle without making reference to research, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [4].

     If a candidate only describes a study or theory relevant to the cognitive level of analysis
     without addressing a principle at the cognitive level of analysis, apply the markbands up to
     a maximum of [3].

     If a candidate explains more than one principle and/or uses more than one example of
     research, credit should be given only to the first explanation of the first principle and to the
     first example demonstrating that principle.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   Describe one ethical consideration related to one study at the sociocultural level of
     analysis.                                                                                        [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one ethical
     consideration related to one study at the sociocultural level of analysis.

     The ethical consideration may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative (what
     guidelines were not followed).

     Ethical considerations which may be addressed include, but are not limited to:
     • deception
     • protection from physical or mental harm
     • briefing and debriefing
     • right to withdraw from a study
     • informed consent
     • anonymity/confidentiality.

     Responses should make a clear link between the study at the sociocultural level of analysis
     and the ethical consideration. If there is no explicit link between the study and the ethical
     consideration, award up to a maximum of [6].

     If a candidate describes one ethical consideration without making reference to one research
     study from the sociocultural level of analysis, the response should be awarded up to a
     maximum of [4].

     If a candidate describes a study from the sociocultural level of analysis but one ethical
     consideration is not addressed, up to a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

     If a candidate describes more than one ethical consideration or addresses more than one
     study, credit should be given only to the first ethical consideration or the first study.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Knowledge and comprehension

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of marginal
    1–3      relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used in the
             response.
             The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
    4–6
             question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in the response.
             The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding relevant
    7–9      to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in support of
             the response.

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer goes beyond description but evidence of critical thinking is not linked to
    1–3
             the requirements of the question.
             The answer offers appropriate but limited evidence of critical thinking or offers
    4–6      evidence of critical thinking that is only implicitly linked to the requirements of the
             question.
             The answer integrates relevant and explicit evidence of critical thinking in response
    7–9
             to the question.


C — Organization

  Marks      Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             The answer is organized or focused on the question. However, this is not sustained
    1–2
             throughout the response.
    3–4      The answer is well organized, well developed and focused on the question.

                                               Section B
4.   Examine one interaction between cognition and physiology in terms of behaviour.                   [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “examine” requires candidates to consider an argument or concept in
     a way that uncovers the assumptions and interrelationships between cognition and
     physiology in terms of behaviour.

     In examining the interaction, examples may be either uni-directional (that is, one factor
     influences the other factor) or bi-directional (that is, looking at the true interdependence of
     both factors), but candidates are not required to make the distinction. The focus of the
     response, however, must be on the interaction between the cognitive and physiological
     factors.

     Uni-directional interactions include, but are not limited to:
     • the role of acetylcholine or beta-amyloid proteins in Alzheimer’s disease (eg Lorenzo
       et al. 2000)
     • the effect of meditation on physiological processes (for example, Davidson, 2004;
       Luders et al. 2009)
     • the role of the hippocampus in memory (for example, Maguire et al. 2000; Milner,
       1957).

     Bi-directional interactions include, but are not limited to:
     • models of emotions (for example, LeDoux’s The Emotional Brain model, Schachter &
        Singer’s two-factor theory)
     • Ramachandran & Hirstein (1998) on perception and pain in phantom limb syndrome
     • stress and immune function (for example, Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 1984)
     • cognitive appraisal and biological reactions (for example, Lazarus and Folkman, 1975;
        Speisman, 1964).

     The examination of the interaction may include, but is not limited to:

     •   methodological considerations
     •   the relevance of animal studies
     •   the issue of reductionism
     •   the role of information processing in behaviour
     •   supporting and/or contradicting evidence

     If a candidate examines more than one interaction between cognition and physiology in
     terms of behaviour, credit should be given only to the first interaction.

5.   Evaluate schema theory.                                                                    [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
     the strengths and limitations of schema theory. Although a discussion of both strengths
     and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Bartlett’s (1932) seminal study “War of the Ghosts”
     • Loftus and Palmer (1974) on schema processing as a consequence of leading
     questions
     • Anderson and Pichert’s (1978) study on the effect of schema processing on memory
       encoding and retrieval
     • Wynn and Logie’s (1998) study using real-life experiences in schema processing
     • Brewer and Treyen’s (1981) “office schema” study
     • Piaget’s studies on the reorganization of schema during child development
     • studies on gender schemas (for example, Martin et al., 1995; Bee, 1999).

     Evaluation of the theory may include, but is not limited to:
     • the degree of empirical support
     • methodological considerations of research used to support the theory
     • application to real life (for example, eye witness testimony, stereotypes)
     • predictive value (for example, in research studies on stereotyping)
     • if the theory has relevance for understanding cognition and/or behaviour (for example,
       gender or cultural roles)
     • Cohen’s (1993) criticism of schema theory regarding the vagueness of the concept.

     If a candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a maximum
     of [2] for criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded for criterion A,
     knowledge and comprehension.

6.   Discuss one or more examples of psychological research (theories or studies) on
     conformity to group norms.                                                                    [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of one or
     more examples of psychological research (theories or studies) on conformity.

     Theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • informational/normative social influence theory
     • social comparison theory
     • bystander effect
     • groupthink

     Studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Asch (1951, 1952, 1956) testing conformity under non-ambiguous conditions
     • Sherif (1935) testing conformity with autokinetic effect illusion
     • Crutchfield (1955) on the influence of intellectual competence and personality
     • Moscovici et al. (1969, 1976, 1985) on minority influence
     • Berry (1967) on the role of cultural dimensions
     • Kagitcibasi (1984) on cultural norms and conformity
     • Bond and Smith (1996) on changes over time and cross-cultural differences.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological, cultural, ethical and gender considerations
     • contrary explanations and/or findings
     • application of the theory and/or empirical findings.

     If research addressing obedience, rather than conformity, is discussed, no marks should
     be awarded for this discussion.

     Responses that focus on one example of research must include other theories and/or
     studies in the discussion in order to be awarded marks in the top markband for criterion A.
