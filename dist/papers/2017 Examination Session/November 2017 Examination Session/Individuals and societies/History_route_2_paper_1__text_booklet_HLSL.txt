Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

A fragile economy in a demanding environment and a Chinese dynasty’s denial of trade for vital
products are a few of the general conditions that gave rise to the Mongol eruption [expansion] from their
homeland, but the specific motivations for the Mongol assault on the rest of the world are in doubt. Their
military superiority is often used as an explanation for their emergence. The toughness of steppe life,
according to some scholars, compelled the Mongols to be aggressive, and their aggressiveness spilled
over [developed] into attacks on neighbouring states. Other scholars assert that the Mongols’ hunger
for booty [riches] inevitably caused them to raid and assault the settled civilizations. Their military
advantages and circumstances certainly enabled them to succeed spectacularly in the 13th century, but
they do not explain the motives for the Mongol migrations into other lands. They tell us how the Mongols
conquered much of Asia, but not why.

The cohesiveness of the Mongol military stood in sharp contrast with the disunity of their enemies,
which Genghis Khan and his successors took care to exploit. The political fragmentation of early
13th-century Rus’ under the prolific Riurikid dynasty is well known. But division also characterized the
two most formidable powers confronting the Mongols. Jurchen rule was deeply resented by the Khitan
still living in the borderlands of China, large numbers of whom joined the Mongols or coordinated their
own operations against the Chin [Jin] with those of Mongol commanders. Subsequently, even native
Chinese and Jurchen officers and troops defected to the invaders. In western Asia, the Khwarazm
shah’s bitter quarrel with the ‘Abbasid Caliph impaired [weakened] his capacity to pose as a champion of
orthodoxy and the Jihad, while the unreliability of significant elements in his recently gained dominions
undermined his preparations for resistance. By contrast, the religious tolerance that characterized
Genghis Khan’s empire also served the Mongols well, so that the Gur-khan’s Muslim subjects in
eastern Turkestan, who had been persecuted by Kuchlug, welcomed them as liberators.

                           (2004).

[Mongol] tactics seemed to be, at least in part, a combination of older fighting techniques and hunting
strategies; yet the consistent inability of the perplexed [confused] enemy to respond effectively to this
form of warfare indicated that Temujin [Genghis Khan] had introduced enough innovation to make these
strategies uniquely his own. Temujin had produced a new type of steppe army based on a greater
variety of tactics and, most important, close cooperation among the men and complete obedience to their
commanders. They were no longer an attacking horde of individuals; they were now a united formation.
Temujin used a set of manoeuvres that each man had to know and to which each responded precisely
and without hesitation. The Mongols had a saying: “If he sends me into fire or water I go. I go for him.”
The saying reflected not just an ideal, but the reality of the new Mongol warfare, and it made short order
of [rapidly defeated] the Naiman.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8.
The sources and questions relate to Case study 1: The final stages of Muslim rule in Spain — Impact:
Forced conversions and expulsions; Marranos, Mudéjars.

Source E                 Atalia Omer and Jason Springs, professors of religion and peace studies, writing
                         in the academic book Religious Nationalism: A Reference Handbook (2013).

In 1469, Isabella of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon were married [in order] to unite the two crowns of
the Spanish Empire. This act was intended to resist the regionalism of Hispania [Spain] by centralizing
power and consolidating a shared identity. Though the monarchs did not actively seek to construct a
nation, they recognized the need to harness [encourage] a certain degree of popular allegiance based
on a common Catholic faith. The Spanish Inquisition consolidated a Spanish–Catholic identity by
purging Jewish and Moorish elements in an effort to promote support for a nation that would be only
for Spanish Catholics. Hence, as Anthony Marx has suggested, “Jews or converts were described as
separate, alien, or as enemies, implying that everyone else shared a blood relationship … habit or faith”.
The Inquisition sanctioned [approved] and institutionalized pre-existing anti-Semitism by intentionally
excluding Jews. The language of “purity of blood” was integral [central] to the Inquisition; consequently,
it provides a clear example of the important interconnections between religion, nationality, and ethnicity.

                         writing in the academic book Spain, 1469–1714: A Society of Conflict (2005).

The expulsion of the Jews from Spain was carried out for religious motives that had long been in the
making; the forcible conversion of the Mudéjars was by contrast an abrupt move. It is very likely that
the Catholic monarchs expected a further programme of evangelization [preaching] to produce a nation
truly united in religion. This, however, did not happen. Instead, the abandonment of a pluralist [diverse]
society led to the creation within Christian Spain of two great disadvantaged minorities, conversos and
Moriscos, which suffered all the disabilities of prejudice but enjoyed few of the benefits of conversion.
From the early 15th century various official bodies began to discriminate against the New Christians,
setting in motion the social pressure for “purity of blood”. The university college of San Bartolomé
in Salamanca was the first to introduce, in 1482, rules forbidding any but those “of pure blood” from
becoming members. The principal impulse [trigger] to the spread of this practice was the founding of
the Inquisition, which made Spaniards familiar with the image of conversos as a danger to religious
integrity and national security … The Inquisition adopted as its rule (1484) that descendants of those it
condemned were not entitled to hold any public office, thereby giving support to the notion that guilt for
heresy remained in the blood generation after generation.

                        issued in April 1492.

We have learned from the inquisitors as well as others of the great harm that comes to Christians who
interact with the Jews, these Jews who employ many and all manners to subvert the holy Catholic faith
and who keep Christian followers from embracing their beliefs.

It is thus clear, taken from the confessions of these Jews, that their corrupt ways have resulted in great
harm and injury to the holy Catholic faith.

After much deliberation it has been decided in council, having reunited the eminent men, knights and
other persons of sense and knowledge of our supreme realm, that all Jews and Jewesses must leave
our kingdom, never to be allowed to return.

It is also hereby ordered in this edict that before the end of July of this year comes, Jews and Jewesses
of all ages residing within our domains and territories must depart from such taking with them their sons
and daughters, their servants and their close and distant relatives of every age. It is they who must not
dare to return to our lands, nor cross our borders, and if any among these Jews were not to accept this
edict and were found to be living within our domains or if these Jews were to return to our lands, they
should be condemned to death and their wealth seized.

We hereby command that, under penalty of forfeiting all of their lands and fortresses as well as their
hereditary privileges and wealth, no person of our kingdom, no matter their position or noble status, may
hide, keep or defend any Jew or Jewess after the month of July has passed nor in the following months
whether publicly or secretly, in their homes or throughout our domains.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12.
The sources and questions relate to Case study 1: Japanese expansion in East Asia (1931–1941) —
Causes of expansion: The impact of Japanese nationalism and militarism on foreign policy.

Source I                 An extract from a Japanese government statement, “The Fundamental Principles
                         of National Policy” (August 1936).

(1) Japan must strive to eradicate [eliminate] the aggressive policies of the great powers …

(3) … in order to promote Manchukuo’s healthy development and to stabilize Japan-Manchukuo national
defense, the threat from the north, the Soviet Union, must be eliminated; in order to promote our
economic development, we must prepare against Great Britain and the United States and bring about
close collaboration between Japan, Manchukuo, and China. In the execution of this policy, Japan must
pay due attention to friendly relations with other powers.

(4) Japan plans to promote her racial and economic development in the South Seas, especially in the
outlying South Seas area. She plans to extend her strength by moderate and peaceful means without
arousing other powers. In this way, concurrently with the firm establishment of Manchukuo, Japan must
expect full development and strengthening of her national power.

                         book Japanese Imperialism, 1894–1945 (1987).

Central to the basic propositions was the intention that Japan … must establish cordial [friendly] relations
with the peoples of the area founded on the principles of co-existence and co-prosperity. It would
also undertake economic expansion on its own account by creating a strong coalition between Japan,
Manchukuo and China and by extending its interests in South-East Asia in gradual and peaceful ways.
There were some conditions. The army must be given forces in Korea and Kwantung [Guandong]
sufficient to deal with any attack from Soviet Russia. The navy must have a fleet capable of maintaining
ascendancy in the west Pacific against that of the United States.

Sino-Japanese [Chinese-Japanese] cooperation, designed to detach Nanking [Nanjing] from its
communist affiliations [links], though highly desirable must not be allowed to stand in the way of treating
north China as a “special region” to be brought into close relationship with Japan and Manchukuo.
It was, for example, to provide strategic materials, in order to strengthen their defences against the
Soviet Union. As to the south, a gradual and peaceful approach was intended to avert fears in countries
of the area concerning Japanese aims …

From the point of view of the ministers in Tokyo, none of this was meant to bring about territorial
expansion. They still thought in terms of informal empire, that is, of securing an increase in Japan’s
privileges through pressure exerted on Asian governments, including that of China.

                        book War and Nationalism in China: 1925–1945 (2003).

By 1933, Japan’s military strategy aimed at defending itself against the Soviet Union, China and the
British and American navies. Massive investment programmes in the heavy, chemical, and machinery
industries followed to give Japan the industrial base to sustain itself in time of war, and also of course to
deal with the problems of the Depression. In 1936, Japan stepped up its military expenditures when a
new cabinet accepted the build-up of national strength as Japan’s highest priority …

Japan therefore developed a strategic doctrine aimed at defending Japan by aggressive offensive
operations of limited duration, to be concluded before its major enemies could concentrate their forces
in East Asia. To defeat China before such a war was part of this strategy. Worried about war with the
Soviet Union and the Western powers, the “removal of China”, as the aggressive General Tojo stated in
a telegram from Manchuria to Tokyo in early 1937, would eliminate “an important menace from our rear”
and release forces for service on more critical fronts. If the military build-up and the political influence of
the army in Japanese politics were causes for worry in China, so were the expansionist tendencies of the
Kwantung [Guandong] Army in Manchuria.

(1954–1965) — The role and significance of key actors/groups – Key actors: Malcolm X;
Lyndon B Johnson.

Note: In the following sources the word “Negro” is used to reflect the place and time of these original,
English language sources. Today, in many countries, the word is no longer in common usage.


Source M                Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a former US Navy officer and a sociologist who was
                        Assistant Secretary of Labor for President Lyndon B Johnson, writing in the report
                        The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (March 1965).

                                        Delinquency and Crime
The combined impact of poverty, failure, and isolation among Negro youth has had the predictable
outcome in a disastrous delinquency and crime rate … It is probable that at present, a majority of
the crimes against the person are committed by Negroes. There is, of course, no absolute evidence;
inference can only be made from arrest and prison population statistics … In Chicago in 1963,
three-quarters of the persons arrested for such crimes were Negro; in Detroit, the proportions were the
same. In 1960, 37% of all persons in Federal and State prisons were Negro. In that year, 56% of the
homicide and 57% of the assault offenders committed to State institutions were Negro …

                                            The Armed Forces
The ultimate mark of inadequate preparation for life is the failure rate on the Armed Forces mental test …
A grown young man who cannot pass this test is in trouble. 56% of Negroes fail it. This is a rate almost
four times that of the whites … Service in the United States Armed Forces is the only experience open
to the Negro American in which he is truly treated as an equal … In food, dress, housing, pay, work—the
Negro in the Armed Forces is equal and is treated that way.


Source N                James Patterson, a professor of history, describes some features and events of
                        the civil rights movement in the US academic journal History Now (2006).

[In the 1960s] many young black people became impatient with the slow progress of legal cases …
they believed that direct action protest, especially if it provoked violence by white extremists, was the
most productive means of civil rights activity … By May 1961, the first interracial freedom rides from
Washington DC, to New Orleans were underway, designed to force southern officials to honor a recent
Supreme Court decision that had called for the ending of racial segregation in interstate bus terminals.
Violence quickly followed, as one bus was firebombed in Alabama and its riders were injured … These
bloody confrontations attracted considerable public attention. They also revealed that the Kennedy
administration, concerned mainly with Cold War issues, was reluctant to jeopardize [threaten] its political
strength among whites in the South and southerners in the Congress. Kennedy was slow to recognize
the moral passion of civil rights demonstrators or to employ force in order to stem the implacable
[uncompromising] resistance and rage of many southern white people, police, and politicians.

[Tutsis returning from exile] would take any salaried job, and this meant pushing the Hutu out of the
towns—and out of the jobs. This contributed to further social tensions in the country. To make things
worse, over 150,000 houses had been destroyed and even without any illegal occupations there would
not have been enough houses to go around. There were also nearly 300,000 children without parents
… living lives of incredible fear and loneliness, at times miles away from the nearest adult. Most
of the police were dead or had fled abroad with the former government, as had most of the judges,
schoolteachers, doctors, and nurses … even the churches, which were full of dead bodies, were closed.

Source S                Sadako Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, outlines her
                        findings in a speech to the United Nations Security Council in New York
                        (28 June 1996).

New comprehensive initiatives are urgently needed to break the deadlock in the repatriation of 1.7 million
Rwandan refugees. Extremist elements among the refugees in Zaire are responsible for increasing
armed incursions into Rwanda and have reportedly also been involved in the massacres in the Masisi
region, thus creating regional tension. A climate of intimidation in the camps and fear of arrest or
retribution [revenge] in Rwanda remain the two major obstacles to large scale repatriation.

Achieving lasting repatriation and contributing to reconciliation remains our objective… Let me say a few
words about the relocation of camps. We believe that it would improve regional and refugee security …
When combined with the separation of the former army and leadership, relocation would also help break
their control of the refugees. It might then enable and induce many … refugees to repatriate …
Separation would make it easier to exclude from international protection those guilty of genocide, in
accordance with the OAU [Organisation of African Unity] Refugee Convention. This has thus far been
practically impossible.

Let me add that I am worried about the assertion by some that the forced return through various means
of Rwandan refugees from Zaire is the only “solution”. There are still human rights concerns in Rwanda.
I am also convinced that in that case large numbers of refugees would spread out and destabilize other
regions of Zaire, as happened in Masisi. On the other hand, a sudden mass return to Rwanda could
have serious humanitarian and security implications.
