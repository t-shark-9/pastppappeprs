                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Describe two advantages to MSS of being a charity (line 14).                         [4]

           Advantages to MSS include:
            land being donated – unlikely if not a charity
            grants – usually only available for charities
            books being donated
            the management being able to focus on their mission rather than profits, which
             may make the mission and vision more attractive to potential students/parents
            possible tax advantages

           Accept any other reasonable description.

           Award [1] for each advantage, up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the advantage into context, up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Explain how the school could overcome high labour turnover.                          [6]

           Key aspects leading to high labour turnover are:
            poor accommodation
            having to teach only in English
            no career development
            no professional development
            standard pay scales.

           Solutions likely to come from these including higher wages, more levels of
           hierarchy, access to new technology, staff involvement.

           Explanation/analysis will come from discussing these and any other relevant
           issue. Candidates do not need to discuss these in relation to motivation theories,
           such as Maslow, Herzberg, Taylor, Adams or Pink but these could be rewarded.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for only analysing one
           method/idea.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the analysis of two or more methods/ideas is mainly
           descriptive but in context.

           Only award [6] if the answer takes into account constraints on methods/ideas eg
           limited finance, being a charity etc.
                                                   –6–                 N17/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe two features of the school’s marketing mix (line 54).                          [4]

           Context: The marketing mix can apply to: the IT centre, the product of an
           education for girls, boarding, a better school environment than most schools, and
           a humanitarian award.

           Features include:
            promotion by means of effective communication with customers
            a coordinated marketing mix
            branding based on the humanitarian award and the mission of the school
            the school and its location, which is the product and is differentiated from
             similar organizations
            Product: school environment, ethos, extra curricula activities, boarding school,
             other aspects of service.

           Remember: Place is about distribution, not location and is unlikely to apply
           to MSS.

           Accept any other reasonable description. (eg at HL can accept the 7Ps)

           For each feature: Award [1] for identifying the feature and [1] for relevant
           application to MSS.

     (b)   Explain, with reference to MSS, the purpose of the mission and vision statements
           (line 37).                                                                              [6]

           A mission statement is a statement of the purpose of an organization, in this
           instance providing an education for girls. It should refer to the key market
           (parents of girls), the contribution it makes to that market and what makes the
           service unique, so that the client chooses the school. The school’s ethics may
           play a part in this.

           A vision statement is a statement of an organization’s overall objectives designed
           to aid decision making. In this instance it will refer to future plans for growth and
           facilities.

           Mission statements and vision statements fulfill different purposes. A mission
           statement describes an organization’s purpose and answers the questions “What
           business are we in?” and “What is our business for?”. A vision statement
           provides strategic direction and describes what the owner or founder wants the
           company to achieve in the future.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum of [4] if either only one of mission statement or vision
           statement are addressed in context.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the analysis is mainly descriptive but in context.

           If there is confusion between mission statement and vision statement but there is
           some understanding shown of the concepts award a maximum of [4] if in context
           and [2] if no context. If the statements are not explained but purposes developed
           also award max [4].

3.   (a)   Describe one capital expenditure and one revenue expenditure for MSS
           (lines 1617)                                                                         [4]

           Capital expenditure could include: buildings, computers, books, equipment.
           Revenue expenditure could include: wages, materials, electricity, marketing, etc.

           Pens, paper and other consumables are revenue expenditure even if bought
           in bulk.

           Accept any other reasonable expenditures.

           For each capital expenditure: Award [1] for identifying the expenditure and [1] for
           relevant application to MSS.

           For each revenue expenditure: Award [1] for identifying the expenditure and [1]
           for relevant application to MSS.

     (b)   Explain a suitable promotional mix that MSS might use to attract new students.        [6]

           Relevant context:
            MSS is a charity so has a limited promotion budget
            the school is in a remote area, which has an impact on the choice
            ethical considerations
            USP considerations
            suitable methods
            is the promotion for the local area or in the cities? The outcome might be
             different for each.

           Above the line methods:
            advertising, but where?

           Below the line:
            sales promotion. How? Two for the price of one might apply to siblings.
            public relations. For a small school? Where?
            exhibitions, etc. But the school is remote.
            word of mouth. Probably the most likely in a remote location.
            can also include social media in below the line.

           Remember: This question is about a “mix” of promotional activities and therefore
           needs more than one promotional activity.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation.

           Analysis should come from explaining how the methods can achieve
           the objective.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum of [4] if the explanation is limited to only one promotional
           activity in context.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is purely descriptive but in context.

           A judgement/recommendation is not needed for [6].
                                                  –8–                N17/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                        Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term economies of scale (line 36).                                             [2]

           The reduction in average costs that result from an increase in the scale of
           production.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [2] for a complete definition.

           Award [1] for some understanding of economies of scale, eg no reference to
           average costs.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Jacob of using convenience
           sampling.                                                                                 [4]

           Context:
            Jacob is a busy man
            The school has limited resources
            The school is in a remote location

           Advantages: Cheap method, and he’s concerned with cash flow, easy – can he
           spare teachers’ time spent on this?

           Disadvantages: Biased, might ask wrong people, difficult to focus, sample may
           not represent people in Dodoma.

           Award [1] for an advantage and award a second mark if the advantage is put into
           context.

           Award [1] for a disadvantage and award a second mark if the disadvantage is put
           into context.

     (c)   (i)   Calculate the value of X and the value of Y in Table 1.                             [2]

                 X = 21 + 5 – 5 – 4 = 17
                   = 17 – 11 = 6

                 Y = 11 – 5 – 3 – 5 = –2

                 Award [1] for each correct answer.

                 Accept 6000 and –2000

                 Accept the presence or absence of unit

                 Note: negative results may also be presented in brackets, so accept (2) and (2000) in
                 the sense –2 and –2000
                                             –9–                  N17/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      (ii)   With reference to Table 1, explain one way in which MSS could improve
             cash flow.                                                                              [2]

             Two possibilities:
              Get incomes earlier – possible with fees but not with the sale of crops,
               which is seasonal.
              Delay expenditures – get credit from some suppliers

             Do not credit “seek more donations” or “more promotion/marketing”.

             Award [1] for a method to improve cash flow and [1] for applying this method
             to MSS.

(d)   Discuss the difference in leadership style between Jacob and Mrs K.                        [10]

      Jacob: Seems to delegate. Good at listening and learning, and gains loyalty from
      his staff. Fulfils role as a negotiator and is the main force for change. These fit in
      well with management roles with interpersonal, informational and decisional
      features. Shows traits of democratic and Theory Y.

      Mrs K: Seems to be autocratic, with a Theory X approach. Focuses on day-to-
      day decisions rather than strategy, so is more of a manager than a leader.
      Limited in terms of management roles.

      The question asks for a discussion of the difference between the two leadership styles.
      It is not enough to only describe, explain or evaluate Jacob’s leadership style then Mrs K’s
      leadership style one after the other.

      Accept reasonable alternative answers.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4.

      Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer or with no effective use
      of case material.


      Award a maximum of [6] if both people are considered but there is limited discussion of the
      differences between the two styles.


      For full marks both people should be considered, data used effectively, and a
      clear discussion drawn based on theories.
