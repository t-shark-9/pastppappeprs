Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

Compare and contrast the view(s) of philosophical activity presented in the text below, with your own
experience and understanding of what is involved in doing philosophy [25 marks].

            Philosophy critically examines anything and everything, including itself and its methods. It
     typically deals with questions not obviously addressed by other areas of enquiry, or those that
     remain after their activity seems complete. Paraphrasing A C Grayling: Philosophy, as the critical
     examination of beliefs, “pokes its nose in”, finding problems where it may not always be welcome.
 5   For de Beauvoir in The Second Sex, philosophy goes “straight to the essentials” and “right to the
     heart of truth.” Whilst this is the nature of philosophy, it is also its value, for, according to Socrates,
     the unexamined life is not worth living. Such critical examination helps to mitigate the risk of being
     deceived by untenable beliefs and spurious claims, uncritical acceptance of which claims can
     result in dire consequences.
10          As to how “we” do philosophy: In A Philosophy of Boredom, Svendsen reminds us to be
     wary of what Nietzsche referred to as the “hereditary fault all of philosophers” – a lack of the
     historical sense, facilitating an unwarranted assumption that existence in our own particular milieu
     gives privileged access to truth. With this in mind, we seek to identify and address philosophical
     problems whilst remaining aware of past and current responses, as well as alert to and explicating
15   flaws in extant arguments, their assertions and assumptions. We aim also to be aware of the
     findings of other pertinent disciplines and their bearing upon those of contemporary philosophical
     concerns, drawing upon them to help address both perennial matters and those peculiar to the
     present and so to our possible futures. In so doing, we try to frame our arguments rationally and
     cogently, such that they can be claimed to be “true” – all of which concepts are common
20   to philosophy.
            Philosophy involves the analysis of arguments and concepts, examining the validity and
     soundness of the arguments, and revealing the connections and distinctions between
     the concepts.
            This all seems a little dispassionate – a rarefied and refined pursuit to be indulged away from
25   the hurly-burly of daily life, like butterfly collecting. But what does every philosopher dream
     of delivering? A knock-down argument! Philosophy is full of belligerent language. Using the
     power of reason and the weight of evidence, a philosopher exposes unsupported assertions,
     prejudice, rhetoric, rash generalizations and wishful thinking, crushes the opposition with brilliant
     counter-examples, and ultimately triumphs with the truth. A successful philosophical argument
30   forces someone to a belief, whether she wants to believe it or not.
            Of course, I’m not talking about a shouting match. A philosophical argument uses only the
     finest ingredients: Well-judged premises, and assumptions containing only the choicest facts,
     locally sourced rather than flown in from another planet, all kneaded with the yeast of reason.
            People die from faulty reasoning as easily as from faulty wiring. In safeguarding the good
35   name of reason, philosophers offer a valuable service to our fallible minds. They clear the
     cognitive undergrowth, clogged by vague concepts, dodgy premises, logical fallacies,
     invalid arguments. They mentor the inner philosopher we each have within us. They remind
     us that a wise man proportions his beliefs to the evidence. This matters when peddlars of
     false medicines, cultish religions or faulty intelligence sincerely spin their tales. Perhaps most
40   importantly, mindful of our humanity, our common frailty, the best philosophers do philosophy with
     kindness as well as clarity.
                                                      –3–                     N17/3/PHILO/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX

            Philosophy is the universe, or at least the general survey of it. It’s the ocean in which
     physics, chemistry, psychology and all of the other disciplines float, the soil from which they grow.
     All of the sciences are built on it. Philosophy won’t directly provide the equation for the velocity of
45   a projectile, but it yielded the mathematics on which the equation is based. Not the vaccines, but
     the scientific method with which they were created – including Occam’s razor, so that the theories
     wouldn’t be too difficult to work with. But philosophy is not done yet, for once science gives us
     something, whether a new medicine or a new bomb, we’re then forced to decide if we should use
     it or not.
50          Thinking is the most obvious way of doing philosophy, but we can’t overlook the actual doing
     of philosophy: As Marx said, in probably his least controversial statement, “The philosophers have
     only interpreted the world in various ways. The point however, is to change it.”
            Realization, then actualization. I see a girl. She’s pretty (Bam!! Aesthetics). So pretty, that I
     wonder if she’s even real (Wham!! Metaphysics). Her boyfriend is standing next to her. I ponder
55   killing him (Pow!! Ethics). But, come to think of it, I’m not quite sure that they’re dating (Bam
     Wham Pow!! Epistemology). I conclude that since she’s attractive, and might be free, I should at
     least try to ask her out (Other Sound Effect!! Logic). Yet, all of this wonderful looking, questioning,
     scheming, thinking, and concluding is absolutely useless unless I actually walk over to her and
     start a conversation – or use the situation as an example of how we do philosophy.
60          Basically, philosophy is the general study of the intangible foundations of the universe, and
     we do it by studying this infrastructure and putting our conclusions into practice. In other words,
     by existing.
