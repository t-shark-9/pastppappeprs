                                                Section A

Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Voice biometrics technology in banking

     Telephone passwords and security questions could soon become obsolete as financial institutions
     such as CBR Bank implement technology that can authenticate a customer’s identity based on the
     characteristics of their voice. CBR Bank is now introducing voiceprint biometrics technology that
     can identify customers when they telephone the bank.

     As part of the registration process, the customer has to say the phrase, “my voice is my password”
     three times. This provides a “voiceprint” that will be used to verify the customer’s identity in future
     telephone calls to the bank.

                                          [Source: adapted from www.cbc.ca]



     (a)   (i)    Identify two forms of biometric identification other than voice.                        [2]

		         (ii)   Identify the steps used by the voiceprint biometric technology to authenticate a
                  customer calling CBR Bank.                                                              [4]

     (b)   CBR Bank holds a large amount of information on its customers. Some customers are
           concerned about the security, privacy and anonymity of their data.

           For each of the concerns above, explain one policy that CBR Bank could use to
           address the concerns of its customers.                                                         [6]

     (c)   The chief executive officer (CEO) of CBR Bank, Alice McEwan, said in a recent
           interview, “CBR Bank will be replacing all passwords, PINs and personal verification
           questions for our online banking and mobile banking with voice biometric recognition.”

           Discuss whether the changes proposed by Alice are beneficial for both CBR Bank’s
           customers and CBR Bank’s IT support.                                                           [8]

2.   Goal-line technology in soccer (football)

     In 2010, at the soccer World Cup tournament in South Africa, England were denied a goal in a
     match against Germany, even though the ball had clearly crossed the goal-line. This led football
     officials to introduce goal-line technology in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The referees wore
     watches that vibrated and displayed the word “GOAL” every time the ball crossed the goal-line.

     Goal-line technology includes 14 cameras that track the ball around the pitch and uses a network
     of high-speed video cameras to track the ball in flight. The cameras create high resolution images.

     The software calculates the ball’s location in each frame by identifying the pixels that correspond
     to the ball. The software can track the ball and predict its flight path, even if the view of several
     cameras is blocked. An encrypted message is sent to the referee’s watch in less than one second
     to let the referee know whether the ball has crossed the goal-line.

                                             [Source: www.goalcontrol.de]

     All of the information collected by the goal-line technology is stored in a database.

(Question 2 continued)

     (a)   (i)     Define the term resolution.                                                           [2]

		         (ii)    Using the following assumptions:
                   1 pixel is made of 24 bits
                   1 kilobyte (KB) = 1000 bytes
                   1 megabyte (MB) = 1000 KB

                   Calculate in megabytes (MB) the storage requirements for an image size of
                   2000 pixels by 4000 pixels.                                                           [2]

		         (iii)   The system records the ball’s flight path into a database.

                   Identify two fields that would be found in the goal-line technology database.         [2]

     (b)   The goal-line technology is capable of collecting vast quantities of data. To make this
           manageable three policies are needed: for the collection, storage and sharing of data.

           Explain how each of these three policies could be implemented so that the quantity of
           data is manageable.                                                                           [6]

     (c)   Many sports have introduced technology to assist officials with their decision-making at
           critical moments. These include whether to award a goal in soccer (football), whether a
           shot in tennis is in, or whether a sprinter has made a false start.

           To what extent do the advantages of introducing technology in sport outweigh the
           disadvantages?                                                                                [8]

3.   Social media and political tension

     National governments sometimes block websites at a time of political tension. One example was
     in 2011, when a government prevented its citizens access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
     Images on these websites were considered inappropriate, with the potential to cause hatred,
     violence and political unrest in that country. The national government gave direct orders to the
     internet service providers (ISPs) to block access to these sites for four hours. The aim was to give
     enough time for site officials to remove the offending images from their websites.

     Despite these attempts by the government, some citizens were still able to access these images
     using proxy servers.

     Many people, such as academics, believe that this approach is not appropriate and governments
     should focus on the education of their citizens so that they are able to make informed decisions
     about how to react to potentially offensive information on websites and social media.

                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2017]



     (a)   (i)   In addition to providing access to the Internet, identify two functions of an internet
                 service provider (ISP).                                                                  [2]

		(ii)           Identify two characteristics of a proxy server.                                          [2]

		(iii)          Identify two ways that the government could have determined the identity of the
                 persons responsible for posting the offending images on the social media.                [2]

     (b)   Many schools block access to social networking websites such as Twitter, Facebook
           and YouTube. However, other schools are investigating two different options:

           • monitoring the network to view what websites the students are viewing, or
           • giving different ages of students different levels of access to social media sites.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                     [6]

     (c)   Many citizens have raised concerns about the surveillance of their web browsing
           history or censorship of selected websites by their national government.

           To what extent is it appropriate for national governments to use surveillance and
           censorship to control citizens’ access to websites?                                            [8]

                                                Section B

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Expert systems in healthcare

     The administrators at Turkistuva Hospital in Finland are concerned about the effectiveness of the
     current medical expert system that is used to diagnose and treat patients, so they are considering
     introducing a new medical expert system. Currently, doctors are required to follow the advice
     of the current medical expert system unless they can present significant evidence for a different
     approach.

     Doctors have complained that the current medical expert system relies on evidence based on
     averages. For example, if a 45-year-old woman has a set of symptoms that matches the average
     45-year-old woman, a diagnosis and treatment are provided that would work for the average
     45-year-old woman. However, doctors argue that each patient is unique, and that their intuition,
     which is based on many years of clinical experience, and their personal relationship with the
     patient should be the most important factors in making the final decision about treatment.

     Patients believe that the evidence for their treatment should be explained better and be more
     personalized. They also believe that patients should be more involved in deciding what might be
     the best treatment for them.

     Kiko Tuikistov, the project manager, will ask a systems analyst to gather information from patients
     that will be used to help design the new medical expert system.

     He believes that the increased use of patient data will help to increase the ability of doctors using
     the new medical expert system to make the correct diagnosis and plan of treatment for a patient’s
     condition. This should increase the number of patients that doctors at Turkistuva Hospital can
     treat.

(Question 4 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two features of the user interface of the new medical expert system that
                  would make it easy to use.                                                            [2]

		         (ii)   In addition to gathering information from patients, identify two tasks that a
                  systems analyst would carry out.                                                      [2]

		(iii)           Identify two characteristics of an expert system.                                     [2]

     (b)   Kiko Tuikistov is considering using either questionnaires or interviews to gather
           information from patients that will be used to help design the new medical expert
           system.

           Analyse both questionnaires and interviews as methods of data collection to gather
           information from patients that will be used to help design the new medical expert            [6]
           system.

     (c)   For this new medical expert system to be effective Kiko Tuikistov must ensure it will
           enable the best quality care for each patient, as well as meeting the requirements of
           the administrators and doctors.

           To what extent is it possible to develop a new medical expert system that will achieve
           these goals for these three different stakeholders?                                          [8]

5.   Patrolling train stations with a Segway

     The Segway Patroller is a two-wheeled, battery-powered electric vehicle. On a Segway, when
     you lean forward the machine powers the wheels to go forward. When you lean back, the Segway
     slows down. Recently, Segway Patrollers have been used for security purposes at various public
     venues. Managers at Oliverstadt train station in Germany have decided to experiment with using
     them for security purposes. Security personnel standing on the Segway Patrollers are 20 cm (8
     inches) above the ground, so the officers can easily monitor activity in the station and can easily be
     seen by people in the station. The Segway Patroller can travel up to a speed of 20 kilometres
     per hour (about 12 miles per hour) and travel about 40 kilometres (25 miles) in distance before it
     needs to be recharged.

     Managers at Oliverstadt station have also asked Segway to develop a customized smart Segway
     Patroller with added features:
     • voice recognition
     • navigation system
     • bomb detection
     • proximity sensor
     • control display panel.

     The prototype of the smart Segway Patroller has been designed. It has also been alpha tested
     and is now ready for beta testing.



     (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 5 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two pieces of data that the customized Segway Patroller would
                  automatically collect.                                                              [2]

		         (ii)   Outline two reasons why it is necessary to test the added features of the
                  prototype.                                                                          [4]

     (b)   The prototype underwent both alpha and beta testing. Explain why both were
           necessary before releasing the customized Segway Patroller for sale.                       [6]

     (c)   Segway Patrollers have been very successful in other areas, including airports and city
           centres (downtown). If these Segway Patrollers are successful in Urumqi train station,
           the managers are considering whether to introduce a new version of the Segway that
           uses machine learning. This will allow employees to enter the GPS coordinates of the
           location within the train station they want to go to and the new Segway will navigate
           itself to that location.

           Over a period of time it is hoped that the new Segway will be able to navigate Urumqi
           train station with little or no human input, having “learned” the most efficient routes.

           Discuss whether the managers of Urumqi train station should upgrade the Segway to
           include machine learning capabilities.                                                     [8]

6.   Student counselling

     Muscat High School in Oman has grown quickly over the last three years. As a result, the school’s
     counsellor, Savannah Mendez, does not have enough time to interview every student before they
     choose their Diploma Programme (DP) subjects. To help Savannah, the principal is considering
     purchasing the Student Counselling System from EduSolve in the next three months. Students
     would fill out online questionnaires provided by the system to determine their interests, abilities
     and future goals. After the completion of the online questionnaire, the Student Counselling System
     would provide Savannah with recommendations for each student regarding the appropriateness
     of their proposed choice of subjects in the Diploma Programme. These recommendations should
     allow Savannah to spend less time with every student but also to be able to interview every
     student, something she cannot do now.

     The Student Counselling System is a proprietary management information system (MIS) that has
     been developed by EduSolve, a company which is located in the United States. The Student
     Counselling System is based on artificial intelligence and will use fuzzy logic rather than inference
     rules to provide more relevant information and recommendations for Savannah.

     The principal has involved the network manager, Debbie Hudson, in the feasibility study. One
     aim is to integrate the Student Counselling System with the school’s existing student information
     management system (SIMS).

     (a)   (i)    Identify two reasons why the network manager is involved in the feasibility study.     [2]

		         (ii)   Outline two reasons why the feasibility study should be carried out before any
                  decision is made to purchase the Student Counselling System.                           [4]

     (b)   Explain three reasons why fuzzy logic would be used in the development of the
           Student Counselling System, rather than relying solely on inference rules.                    [6]

     (c)   The Principal at Muscat High School has decided to use the Student Counselling
           System from EduSolve that uses fuzzy logic.

           To what extent should Savannah rely on the recommendations of the Student
           Counselling System, rather than relying on her own professional judgment and intuition,
           when advising students about what subjects to study in the DP?                                [8]

7.      Social robots

        When many people think of robots, they think of them in large-scale industrial settings, such as
        manufacturing automobiles (cars), but this is not always the case. Figure 3 shows an image of
        Jibo, the first social robot for the home. Jibo can be purchased for US$599.

        Jibo is connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is "the network of physical objects – or
        “things” – embedded with electronics, software, sensors and network connectivity, which enables
        these objects to collect and exchange data"1.

        Jibo is able to carry out simple tasks, such as reminding someone when they have an important
        meeting, or turning the heating or air conditioning on or off in a person’s house while they are
        away.

        (This question continues on the following page)
                                                   – 15 –                  N17/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

(Question 7 continued)

     (a)   (i)    Identify two sensors that Jibo could use.                                              [2]

		         (ii)   Identify the steps Jibo would take in order to turn the air conditioning on and off.   [4]

     (b)   It has been decided to provide only online access to documentation for Jibo. There will
           be no downloadable PDFs.

           Analyse this decision.                                                                        [6]

     (c)   Jibo’s website claims that “Jibo is friendly, helpful and intelligent. He can sense and
           respond, and learns as you engage with him”. Some of the customers who own Jibo
           are considering whether they could extend the range of tasks Jibo could perform, or
           whether they should allow Jibo to make decisions for them.

           To what extent should individuals rely on robots such as Jibo to act as decision-makers
           for them?                                                                                     [8]
