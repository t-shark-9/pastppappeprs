Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools
of thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic
illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   Examine the strengths and limitations of using a synchronic perspective in ethnography.


2.   Evaluate the contribution of either an idealist or a materialist perspective in terms of an
     understanding of social relations.


3.   Compare and contrast a particularistic and a universalistic perspective in relation to one of the
     following schools of thought:
      Marxism
      symbolic theory
      feminism.


4.   Contrast the work of two anthropologists in relation to one of the following perspectives:
      structure-centred
      diachronic
      agency-centred.


5.   Discuss why anthropologists might choose to use either a conflict-centred or a cohesion-centred
     perspective in their approach to ethnography.
