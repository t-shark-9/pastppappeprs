Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate
              and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their

           • The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical
              commentary, but this is not sustained.
  4–6      • The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While
              there may be an attempt to follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and
              coherence.
           • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.

Section 1        Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   “The Silk Road was more significant for interregional trade than it was for the transmission of
     ideas.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the argument that the Silk Road was more
     significant for interregional trade than for the transmission of ideas. While the focus of the
     response must be within the timeframe of this topic, it does not need to span it, nor do the factors
     affecting interregional trade and the transmission of ideas need to be contemporaneous.
     Candidates may elect to agree or disagree with the statement or they may find some middle
     ground, arguing that significance varied at different times. Some candidates may suggest that
     significance varied per the direction of travel. They may note, for example, that the Islamic Golden
     Age and the 12th century Western renaissance could both be regarded a consequence of ideas
     that were transmitted from the East. Some candidates may also suggest that the East gained little
     in return.


2.   Evaluate the significance of Tamerlane’s [Timur’s] rule to the effective functioning of the Silk Road.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the significance of Tamerlane (Timur or Timur-i Lang) to the
     effective functioning of the Silk Road. Some candidates may argue that, in the context of the
     period, he was very significant and that his facilitation of cultural developments in Samarkand
     enabled cultural changes to radiate along the Silk Road. Others may argue that the limited impact
     of his conquests on the growth of Ottoman power contributed to the long-term diminishing of the
     Silk Road as, ultimately, the Ottomans would close its western end. Additionally, or alternatively,
     candidates may suggest that the significance of Tamerlane’s rule was mixed, noting that his
     conquests were not permanent and the unity of his empire collapsed after his death. The ensuing
     civil war between his heirs had serious ramifications for the functioning of the trade routes.
                                                  –6–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2        Japan in the age of the samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Discuss the reasons for the declining power of the emperor during the period between 1180
     and 1333.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the declining power of
     the Emperor in Japan. Candidates may address a range of reasons for this shift in power including
     political, economic, cultural and geographic factors. Political reasons may include a discussion of
     the growing power of the samurai, the outcome of the Gempei War, the fact that military power lay
     almost exclusively in the hands of the military clans outside the capital of Kyoto and the succession
     crises in court. Economic reasons may include the growing economic strength of the clan leaders
     in the countryside while the court was experiencing a decline in income. There was also a shift in
     cultural focus as the gentlemen of the court were no longer held in such high esteem and were
     replaced in status by the samurai and their codes of honour.


4.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results of, the struggles between samurai clans during the period
     between 1180 and 1333.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and results of, the
     struggles between the samurai clans. When discussing the reasons for the struggles candidates
     may consider the rivalry between the clans and the struggles within the court to control the office of
     the Shogunate. Economic reasons may be considered, in particular, the issue of land. Land was
     the principal source of wealth and clans sought to control large areas of land to support their
     armies. The culture of the Samurai placed great emphasis on personal honour and this caused
     conflict as individuals or groups who felt that their honour had been compromised resorted to
     violence. The results of the struggles may include a discussion of the shift from a civilian to a
     military government, the emphasis on the samurai in culture and the emergence of the warrior
     class with its strict code of conduct that was imposed on the population.
                                                   –7–                 N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3        Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   Discuss the reasons for China “turning in” and adopting a policy of isolationism.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for China “turning in” and
     adopting a policy of isolationism. Candidates may approach the question by considering short and
     long term reasons or they may take a thematic approach by considering the social, political and
     economic reasons for China becoming isolationist. Social and political reasons discussed may
     include the nature of Confucianism in Chinese society, the xenophobic attitudes of the court and
     the impact of the Mongol invasions. Economic reasons may include a discussion of the fiscal crisis
     in the 15th Century, the nature and benefits of the Tributary System and the growth of piracy at this
     time. Candidates may also discuss whether external or internal reasons were of more significance
     to China “turning in”.


6.   Evaluate the impact of isolation on Japan during the 17th century.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of isolation on Japan by considering the positive
     and negatives effects of this policy. Candidates may approach the question by taking a thematic
     approach by discussing the social, political and economic effects of this policy or they may discuss
     the positive and then the negative impacts of “turning in”. Positive political effects discussed could
     include long periods of peace and political unity with few internal divisions. However, candidates
     may also argue that this led to a rigid society with almost no social mobility and that long periods of
     peace undermined the status of the samurai class. Candidates may also argue that although
     isolationism protected Japanese culture it also limited trade and prevented technological advances
     which made Japan more vulnerable in the long term to foreign powers.
                                                 –8–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4        The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   Discuss the social and economic achievements of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social and economic achievements
     of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar. Social achievements discussed may include the
     abolition of the Jizya and Pilgrims tax, equal treatment of minorities and the promotion of social
     justice and welfare. There were also many cultural developments in the arts and literature.
     Economic achievements discussed may include the stimulation of trade through low custom duties,
     new coinage and agricultural developments. Candidates may also argue that there were many
     limitations to Akbar’s achievements and to support this argument they may discuss the discontent
     felt amongst many Muslim subjects towards Akbar’s religious tolerance and the economic strain
     caused by high military costs.


8.   “The policies of Aurangzeb began the decline of the Mughal Empire.” Discuss with reference to
     the period up to 1712.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Aurangzeb’s policies
     contributed to the decline of the Empire. Candidates may refer to other factors and discuss the
     importance of Aurangzeb’s policies in the wider context of the decline of the Mughal Empire. While
     other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in
     the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement, but their
     opinions or conclusions will be supported by appropriate evidence. Aurangzeb’s policies
     discussed may include his policies of religious persecution against the Hindus and the Shias.
     Candidates may also discuss the prolonged war against the Marathas which ruined the finances of
     the state and the impact of the Deccan Policy. Other factors discussed may include the
     unmanageable size of the empire and the impact of the arrival of the British/French in India.
                                                  –9–                  N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 5         Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    To what extent did the introduction of the Ethical Policy (1901) transform the nature of Dutch
      colonization of the Dutch East Indies/Indonesia?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the introduction of the Ethical
      Policy transformed the nature of Dutch colonization of Indonesia. Some discussion of the nature of
      Dutch colonial rule before the Ethical Policy was introduced would be valid but must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to how the Ethical Policy aimed to
      transform living conditions and one way they aimed to achieve this was by making education
      available for the local population. Economic factors discussed may include developments in
      infrastructure, banking, agriculture and irrigation projects. Politically more autonomy was given to
      local officials. Candidates may argue that social, political and economic impact of the Ethical
      Policy impacted only a minority of the population and that for most Indonesians, life under Dutch
      rule stayed the same.


10.   Discuss the reasons for the emergence of nationalism in Indo-China by 1914.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the emergence of
      nationalism in Indo-China by 1914. Candidates may refer to the social, political and/or economic
      conditions that existed in Indo-China and/or the nature of French colonial rule. Social reasons may
      include a discussion of the impact of Catholicism and the work of missionaries in education.
      Economic reasons discussed may include the exploitation of local resources and the issue of
      taxation. Political reasons may include the rebellions that began from 1885 onwards. French
      suppression of these rebellions also increased nationalist sentiment. Candidates may suggest that
      nationalism was still in its infancy and that most opposition to the French was regarding local
      issues. Candidates may argue that the First World War was a turning point in the emergence of
      nationalism but the response should be focused on the period prior to this.
                                                  – 10 –               N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 6        India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   Discuss the reasons for the increasing dominance of the British East India Company in India during
      the period between 1750 and 1857.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the increasing
      dominance of the British East India Company in India. Candidates may refer to a range of political,
      economic and military reasons. Points discussed may include the strength and status of the British
      East India Company and the growing power of the British in this region. This growing power could
      be attributed to the decline of the Mughal Empire and/or the defeat of the French. Candidates may
      also discuss the nature of Company rule and the role of the Governor-Generals in helping to
      achieve British dominance. To support this argument, candidates may discuss the actions of
      individual Governor-Generals which may include Hastings peace with the Marathas and/or
      Dalhousie’s annexation policies.


12.   Discuss the reasons for, and the consequences of, the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and consequences of,
      the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Both reasons and consequences must be discussed but there
      does not need to be an equal focus on each. Reasons for the Second Anglo-Afghan War may
      include a discussion of “The Great Game” between Britain and Russia. Both countries felt that
      control of Afghanistan would protect their interests in this region. Russia was fearful that British
      trade interests would make inroads into Central Asia and Britain was fearful that Russia may be a
      threat to India. For consequences, candidates may refer to the fact that the British did manage to
      install a new friendly Amir who was acceptable to British interests. The British were also able to
      establish a mission in Kabul and gain jurisdiction over territories, such as the Khyber Pass.
                                                 – 11 –               N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7        Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Discuss the reasons for, and consequences for Chinese society of, the failure of the Taiping
      Rebellion.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and consequences for
      Chinese society of, the failure of the Taiping Rebellion. Both reasons and consequences must be
      discussed but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. Reasons for the failure of the
      Taiping may include a discussion of internal dissension within the movement and their failure to get
      the support of Han Chinese bureaucrats or western missionaries. The intervention of the west also
      ensured the Manchus maintained control of key cities which limited Taiping support. When
      discussing consequences of the failure candidates may refer to the enormous physical destruction
      and loss of life. Candidates may also refer to the eventual decline of the Manchu dynasty.
      Consequences may extend beyond the timeframe of the topic but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question.


14.   With reference to the period up to 1868, evaluate the impact on Japan of Commodore Perry’s
      expedition.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of isolation on Japan by considering the positive
      and negatives effects of this policy. Both positive and negative impacts must be clearly indicated
      but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. Candidates should explain the degree to
      which Perry’s arrival had an impact but candidates may also argue that these changes occurred
      due to internal Japanese issues. Candidates may predate the timeframe by discussing existing
      problems in Japan before Perry, such as the decline of the samurai and/or peasant unrest, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may discuss how the arrival
      of Perry led to social unrest, including a rebellion by the Satsuma and Chosu clans, and
      undermined the Shogunate. Perry’s arrival ultimately led to a political revolution which resulted in
      the restoration of the Emperor.

Section 8         British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   “The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) failed to resolve conflict between the settlers and indigenous
      peoples.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the Waitangi Treaty failed to
      resolve the conflict between the settlers and the indigenous peoples. Candidates may refer to the
      fact that the treaty only addressed the issue of land and did not address other areas of conflict
      such as Maori political representation. In terms of how the treaty addressed conflict over land
      candidates may refer to the fact that Maori rights to own land and property were recognised and
      the terms stated that Maori land needed to be bought officially by the crown. Candidates may
      argue that while this did initially protect Maori rights as Maori communities became more reluctant
      to sell the methods used to acquire Maori land became more questionable. Candidates may also
      suggest that different interpretations of the treaty made it difficult to determine its impact.


16.   Evaluate the social and economic effects of the gold rushes in Australia.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the social and economic effects of the gold rushes in
      Australia, weighing up the positive and negative effects. There does not need to be equal
      coverage of social and economic effects but both aspects will be a feature of the response. In their
      evaluation of the social effects of the gold rushes candidates may refer to the trebling of Australia’s
      population due to an influx of people from overseas. Although this had many positive benefits, in
      terms of the development of towns, candidates may also argue that it led to racial tensions and
      high crime rates. Candidates may also refer to the beginnings of an Australian identity as
      “mateship” developed between the gold diggers. Economic effects were generally positive and
      candidates may refer to the development of cities and infrastructure and an increased standard of
      living.

Section 9         Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   To what extent was Cixi the most significant obstacle to the success of the Self-Strengthening
      Movement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Cixi was the most significant
      obstacle to the success of the Self-Strengthening Movement. While other relevant factors may be
      referred to, a significant amount of the response will remain focused on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement. Candidates may
      argue that Cixi was anti-foreign, corrupt and conservative in nature and that her actions during the
      Self Strengthening Movement demonstrated her fear of losing any authority within the court.
      However, some candidates may argue that Cixi was used as a scapegoat for the failure of the
      reforms and that there was in fact a general lack of support for the reforms within the court but also
      amongst the bureaucrats, scholars and farmers. Candidates may also suggest other reasons for
      the movement’s failure such as strong regionalism which prevented any national developments.


18.   To what extent did the Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905) change the balance of power in East
      Asia?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the Russo-Japanese War
      changed the balance of power in East Asia. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe but must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may argue that Japan’s victory
      against a European power and the acquisition of key territory in Manchuria marked the beginnings
      of Japan’s control of the region. Japan’s victory led to its increasing influence over Korea and in
      1910 Japan annexed Korea and would later occupy it fully. The war also had an impact on the
      stability of the imperial regime in China, and partly contributed to the Revolution of 1911.
      However, candidates may also argue that Japan had already shown itself to be the dominant
      power in the region following the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 and the establishment of the
      Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902.

Section 10        Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   To what extent was the partition of the South Asian subcontinent in 1947 mainly a consequence of
      British policy?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the partition of the South
      Asian subcontinent in 1947 was mainly a consequence of British policy. While other relevant
      factors may be referred to, a significant amount of the response will remain focused on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the British rule of divide and rule and the effects of
      the Communal Award of 1931 and the Government of India Act of 1935. British policy under
      Mountbatten was to hasten British withdrawal from India as this contributed to partition.
      Candidates may also consider other factors such as the actions of the Indian National Congress
      leaders and their reluctance to adopt a more federal system of government. Jinnah and the
      Muslim League may also be discussed along with the development of the Two-nation theory.


20.   Evaluate Jawaharlal Nehru’s domestic policies in India between 1947 and 1964.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of Nehru’s domestic policies weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of them in India from 1947 to 1964. Both success and failures must be clearly indicated
      but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. Candidates may approach this response
      thematically by evaluating social, economic and political developments or they may discuss
      successes and failures separately. Social policies may include developments relating to the
      treatment of women, minorities and different religious groups. Educational developments,
      especially the attempt to introduce primary education may be referred to. Economic policies could
      include the successful development of agriculture, industry and trade although candidates may
      also refer to the failure to redistribute land. Political developments may include the setting up of
      democratic processes and the creation of a federation although candidates may also refer to the
      failure to respond to corrupt politicians.

Section 11       Japan (1912–1990)

21.   “Taisho democracy (1912–1926) was fragile.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Taisho democracy
      (1912–1926) was fragile. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
      Candidates may refer to events after 1926 as evidence that democracy was not effectively
      established during the Taisho era or to argue it was only events after this period that undermined
      democracy however, the bulk of the essay should be focused on the period 1912 to 1926.
      To support the statement that Taisho democracy was fragile candidates may refer to methods
      used by Prime Minister Hara to ensure a majority for his party, the Peace Preservation Law, the
      failure to enfranchise women, the assassination of Hara in 1921 and the failed assassination of
      Hirohito in 1923. To challenge the statement candidates may refer to the granting of universal
      male suffrage in 1925 and the appointment of the commoner Takashi as Prime Minister.


22.   To what extent was Japan’s military power responsible for its initial success in the Second
      World War?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that Japan’s military power was
      responsible for its initial success in the Second World War. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement. Candidates may discuss events that predate the Second World War
      but these must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. To support the statement
      candidates may discuss the nature of the Japanese Military and note its size, discipline,
      technologies and the experience it had gained in the war with China. Japan’s military plans, the
      “Southern Plan” and the “Eastern Plan” may also be discussed to show that the Japanese military
      had clear strategical objectives. Candidates may challenge the statement by identifying other
      factors for Japanese success. These could include the impact of the Tripartite Pact of 1940 and
      the weaknesses of the Allied powers in the region.
                                                  – 16 –              N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 12       China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Discuss the factors that helped and hindered the rise of Communism in China in the 1920s.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that helped and hindered the
      rise of Communism in China in the 1920s. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach to this
      response to show the development of the party or they may address factors that helped and
      hindered communism separately. It should be noted that many events, such as the creation of the
      First United Front, could be said to have helped and hindered the party. Candidates may refer to
      the May 4th Movement, the creation of the Chinese Communist Party and the role of Comintern in
      its development. Candidates may discuss how the Northern Expedition enabled the CCP to gain
      support amongst the peasantry. Candidates may argue that Sun Yixian’s death and the
      emergence of Jiang as leader of the GMD hindered the development of communism as Jiang
      launched the White Terror to eliminate communists.


24.   “Japanese rule of Korea had an entirely negative impact on Korea’s economy and society.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Japanese rule of
      Korea had an entirely negative impact on Korea’s economy and society. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement. The impact on economy and society must be clearly
      indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on both. Candidates may refer to the
      annexation of Korea in 1910 and the changes that occurred in Korean society and economy
      following this. For impact on society candidates may discuss the ways Korean culture and
      language were undermined, particularly from the 1930s onwards with the policy of assimilation.
      Under this policy, Koreans were to regard themselves as Japanese and, any resistance to this,
      was brutally suppressed. Candidates may refer to economic impacts including land reform,
      industrialisation, the development of infrastructure and the conscription of Koreans into civilian
      labour during the Second World War.
                                                   – 17 –                N17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 13        Impact of the world wars on South-East Asia

25.   Discuss the nature and impact of Japanese occupation on South-East Asia.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the nature and impact of Japanese
      occupation on South East Asia. Candidates may argue that although Japanese occupation was
      often brutal and repressive it did also lead to increased support for nationalist and independence
      movements. Responses may focus on one country in depth or a broader discussion of South East
      Asia and either of these approaches is valid. The nature of Japanese occupation may include a
      discussion of responses to occupation including resistance and collaboration. Occupied countries
      often experienced harsh rule including arbitrary arrests, sex slavery, forced labour and executions.
      For those countries that collaborated, occupation provided opportunities for local populations to
      gain experience of ruling which prepared them for independence. In other countries resistance to
      the Japanese was strong and these groups fought for independence after the war. The responses
      will vary greatly depending on the country or countries chosen.


26.   Evaluate the importance of the Second World to the growth of nationalism in Malaya.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of the Second World War to the growth of
      nationalism in Malaya. Candidates may argue that Japanese occupation was the turning point for
      the growth of nationalism or they may suggest that other factors were more significant. Candidates
      may also evaluate events that preceded and/or followed the war. Candidates may refer to the
      nature of British rule before the war which led to the rise of leftists, Islamic groups and conservative
      elites demanding independence. In evaluating the importance of the Second World War
      candidates may discuss the collaboration of the nationalist group Kesatuan Melayu Muda, the
      decision of the Japanese to allow Thailand to annex four Malay states and the fact that brutal
      treatment of Chinese Malays strengthened support for the Malayan Communist Party. The weak
      economic state of Britain at the end of the war may also be discussed.

Section 14       The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Mao’s social policies.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the strengths and weaknesses of Mao’s
      social policies. Candidates may argue that the vision behind Mao’s social policies was generally
      positive but when the policies were implemented there were many failings. Aspects of Mao’s
      methods of control and economic policies had social implications and candidates may consider
      these but the response must remain focused on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to the establishment of equal rights for women under the New Marriage Law of 1950, the
      introduction of communal living, literacy programmes and increased educational opportunities and
      schemes to improve health and living standards, such as the Barefoot Doctors. Candidates are
      required to present a balanced review so they should find the strengths and limitations, where
      appropriate, in these developments. Candidates may discuss the Cultural Revolution in relation to
      the damage it caused to social developments.


28.   Discuss the reasons for, and the results for China of, the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations by
      1976.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and the results for
      China of, the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations by 1976. Candidates may refer to events that
      predate the timeframe to show that relations between China and the USSR had been tense for
      some time but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Reasons for the
      breakdown in relations may include a discussion of the Korean War, China’s nuclear development
      programme, destalinization, the Sino-Soviet Split, the Cultural Revolution and fundamental
      ideological differences between the two nations. Results of the breakdown in relations may include
      a discussion of the Sino-Soviet border conflicts, the dismissal of Soviet advisors in China, Ping
      Pong Diplomacy and China’s rapprochement with the US in the 1970s which led to the acceptance
      of China into the UN.

Section 15       Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   Discuss the impact of foreign intervention in the Korean War (1950–1953).

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the role of foreign intervention in the
      Korean War. The actions of the US, the UN, the USSR and/or China may be discussed but there
      is no requirement to include all of them. Candidates may discuss events predating the war, and/or
      immediately following the war, but they must be clearly linked to the issue in the question.
      Candidates may argue that international involvement was responsible for starting, prolonging
      and/or ending the conflict. Candidates may argue that the influence of the two superpowers in
      Korea from 1945 made conflict inevitable. Candidates will discuss examples of UN, US, Soviet
      and/or Chinese military involvement and how foreign troops and equipment intensified the war.
      There were approximately 2.5 million casualties as well as a severe refugee problem because of
      heavy bombing. The role of foreign intervention in armistice talks may also be discussed.


30.   “Sihanouk was mainly responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that Sihanouk was mainly
      responsible for the rise of the Khmer Rouge. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement. Candidates may refer to Sihanouk’s attempts to maintain Cambodian neutrality at
      the outbreak of the Vietnam War. However, North Vietnamese troops began to use Cambodian
      territory for supply routes and this resulted in US bombing raids. US bombing reduced support for
      Sihanouk as he seemed unable to prevent them and civilian casualties were growing. The raids
      also benefited the Khmer Rouge as people fled the cities for the countryside where the Khmer
      Rouge had more influence. Following Sihanouk’s removal from power, he began to support the
      Khmer Rouge which enabled them to further extend their influence. Long term social and
      economic problems in Cambodia as well as the popular appeal of the Khmer Rouge may also be
      discussed.

Section 16       Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the governments of either Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Pakistan
      or Indira Gandhi in India.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the strengths and weaknesses of the
      governments of either Zulfikar Ali Bhutto or Indira Gandhi. Candidates may choose to discuss
      Bhutto who was the leader of Pakistan from 1971 to 1977. Possible strengths discussed may
      include Pakistan’s role in the non-alignment movement, the nuclear programme and peace talks
      with India. Weaknesses discussed may include Bhutto’s treatment of political opponents, human
      rights abuses and causing the Bangladesh Liberation War by not accepting the outcome of the
      democratic elections. Candidates may choose to discuss Indira Gandhi who was prime minister of
      India for four terms between 1966 and 1984. Possible strengths discussed may include her
      intervention in the Bangladesh conflict, the Green Revolution and her role in the non-alignment
      movement. Weaknesses discussed may include the accusations of nepotism, corruption, her
      disregard for democratic processes and the attack on the Golden Temple in 1984.


32.   To what extent had the challenges facing Bangladesh been resolved by the end of the
      20th century?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the challenges facing
      Bangladesh had been resolved by the end of the 20th century. Candidates may adopt a
      chronological approach to this response or they may take a more thematic approach addressing
      social, economic and/or political challenges. The nature of the question is very broad and
      candidates will not be able to discuss all the challenges facing Bangladesh. Social challenges may
      include a discussion of the effects of poverty, AIDS, status of women and ethnic minorities as well
      as the pressures on urban areas due to a rapidly growing population. Economic challenges may
      include slow economic growth, low energy production, poor infrastructure, corruption and lack of
      foreign investments. Candidates may refer to political challenges that Pakistan faced including
      consolidating democracy, combatting Islamic radicalization and terrorism.

Section 17       Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   With reference to either Australia or New Zealand, to what extent did the role of women
      significantly change between 1945 and 2005?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the role of women changed
      significantly in either Australia or New Zealand. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach
      or they may take a more thematic approach addressing social, economic and/or political
      developments. For Australia, candidates may refer to the increased number of women involved in
      politics and the establishment of the Women’s Electoral Lobby. Employment opportunities also
      increased and the Equal Pay Act of 1969 saw women win equal pay rates with men. The feminist
      movement grew and some, like Germaine Greer, achieved notoriety. For New Zealand,
      candidates may refer to the increased number of women involved in politics, for example New
      Zealand had two female Prime Ministers in this period Jenny Shipley in 1997 and Helen Clarke in
      1999. New Zealand passed the Equal Pay Act in 1972 and laws were also passed to protect
      women’s rights.


34.   “The successes of the Menzies government outweighed the failures.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the successes of the
      Menzies government outweighed the failures. Candidates are required to discuss a range of the
      policies of Robert Menzies, who was Australia’s longest serving Prime Minister holding office from
      1949 to 1966. The question is open so candidates may cover a broad range of social, economic
      and foreign policies or focus on one area in more depth. Candidates are required to address both
      positive and negative developments. Discussion of successes may refer to Australia’s economic
      boom and the signing of the ANZUS Treaty and SEATO. Candidates may also refer to social
      developments including ending restrictions on Aboriginal voting rights and increasing higher
      education opportunities. Failures may include the recession that Australia experienced in 1961,
      growing unemployment and Australian involvement in the Korean War and the Malayan
      Emergency.

Section 18       Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
                 India) (1980–2005)

35.   With reference to two countries of the region (excluding China, Japan and India), compare and
      contrast the reasons for economic growth between 1980 and 2005.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the reasons for
      economic growth in two countries referring to both throughout. Both similarities and differences
      must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each. Candidates may
      refer to the effectiveness of government policies to increase foreign trade. The nature of the
      society and having an effective labour force might be discussed as this was a key factor in the rise
      of the Asian Tiger economies. Candidates may refer to the development of infrastructure that
      supported industrial development and the growth of tourism. The stability of the chosen countries
      may also be discussed as this was a key factor to attract foreign investment. Other factors
      discussed may include the presence of natural resources, the context of the Cold War and the
      creation of ASEAN.


36.   Excluding China, Japan and India, discuss the reasons for immigration in one country and
      emigration in one other country of the region between 1980 and 2005.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for immigration in one
      country and emigration in one other country of the region. Candidates may refer to economic
      factors such as lack of opportunity or economic hardship. For example, large numbers of unskilled
      workers from Bangladesh and the Philippines migrated to Singapore to find employment. Active
      recruitment of labour by other countries also encouraged emigration. For example, in the 1950s
      and 1960s New Zealand actively recruited labour from the Pacific Islands. Fleeing various forms of
      persecution led to increased migration during this period. Because of the genocide in Cambodia it
      was estimated that approximately 750,000 Cambodians sought refuge in Thailand. Governments
      developed agreements and systems to support migration. Bilateral agreements signed between
      Singapore and Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Philippines made the migration process
      easier for unskilled workers looking for employment in Singapore.
