                                               Section B
Answer the following question.

4.   Some teachers have complained that Mrs K is too strict and treats them like students.
     These teachers want more freedom in choosing what to do in their lessons. However, other
     teachers like the certainty and clear instructions they receive at the weekly staff meetings
     and appreciate that Mrs K takes a close interest in everything they do. Mrs K makes all the
     day-to-day decisions at the school, and sometimes would like more guidance from Jacob, but
     she is pleased that he makes all the strategic decisions.

     Jacob has delegated the day-to-day running of the school to Mrs K. Whenever he meets the
     staff at the school he likes to listen and he wants to learn about what challenges them in their
     work. The teachers and management want to help Jacob achieve his vision for the school.
     He is very effective at negotiating with external organizations and promoting the school, and
     is the main force for innovation and change.

     Jacob has undertaken further market research into what families living in Dodoma want
     from a school. He used a convenience sampling method that involved talking to friends
     and relatives.

     Jacob is concerned with cash flow. Although the school year starts in January, fees are not
     collected until April, the time when local people traditionally have higher incomes. At the
     moment all purchases are made in cash. Table 1 shows the latest cash-flow forecast for the
     next six months.

     (a)   Define the term economies of scale (line 36).                                                 [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Jacob of using convenience
           sampling.                                                                                     [4]

     (c)   (i)    Calculate the value of X and the value of Y in Table 1.                                [2]

           (ii)   With reference to Table 1, explain one way in which MSS could improve
                  cash flow.                                                                             [2]
