Answer one question.

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and, where relevant, large,
well drawn maps, sketches and diagrams.

1.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the role of global interactions in the growth of environmental
           awareness.                                                                               [10]

     (b)   Discuss the reasons for the global diffusion of consumer culture.                        [15]


2.   (a)   Analyse the causes and environmental consequences of the international relocation of
           polluting industries.                                                                    [10]

     (b)   “Barriers to globalization are no longer falling but are rising instead.” Discuss this
           statement.                                                                               [15]


3.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the reasons why some places have become international
           outsourcing hubs.                                                                        [10]

     (b)   Examine the challenges that increased global adoption of information and
           communications technology (ICT) brings to different places.                              [15]
