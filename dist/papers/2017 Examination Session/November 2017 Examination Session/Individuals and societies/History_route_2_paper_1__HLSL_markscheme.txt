                                   Section 1: Military leaders
For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, were the factors that encouraged Mongol expansion?           [3]

           • Economic factors, as reflected in an unstable economy and lack of trade, played a
             significant part.
           • The Mongols’ military strengths and advantages encouraged attacks against neighbouring
             states.
           • The “toughness of steppe life” made them aggressive and led them to attack neighbouring
             states.
           • Their hunger for booty and spoils was, according to some scholars, a motivation.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source D suggest about the Mongols’ military equipment and tactics?             [2]

           • The Mongols used cavalry.
           • Mongol soldiers were able to utilize a wide variety of military equipment.
           • Soldiers were adequately clothed and protected, which allowed them to adapt to difficult
             climatic conditions and/or survive in battles.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source C
     for an historian studying Genghis Khan’s [Temujin’s] military campaigns and tactics.             [4]

     Value:
     • The author is a professor of anthropology and tribal peoples and is therefore likely to provide an
       anthropological, rather than an historical, perspective about Genghis Khan’s organization.
     • The book was published in 2004 and is aimed at an academic audience. It is therefore likely to
       have incorporated latest research and theories.
     • The source provides an overview of Genghis Khan’s military tactics.
     • The source contextualizes Genghis Khan’s contribution to the modern world.

     Limitations:
     • The book does not exclusively focus on military history, thus information on Mongol military
       tactics and strategies might be limited.
     • In contrast to the first bullet point of “Value”, some candidates may argue that the author is not
       an historian but a social anthropologist who specializes in tribal peoples.


     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
     are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
     supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
     be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources B and C reveal about the factors that led to the success
     of Genghis Khan’s military campaigns.                                                                [6]

      Marks     Level descriptor
       5–6      • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
       3–4      • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                   although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2     • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or general
                   comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison or of
                   contrast.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and award
     credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
     candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
     no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources point out the weaknesses of the enemy.
     • Both sources highlight the role of Genghis Khan as an effective leader.
     • Both sources emphasize the military advantage that the Mongols had; in terms of the
       cohesiveness of their military in Source B and their innovative military strategies and unity in
       Source C.

     Contrasts:
     • Source C states that the Mongols’ enemy was perplexed [confused] and, therefore, weak
       whereas Source B identifies weakness as a consequence of political disunity.
     • Source B points out that religious tolerance made the Mongols welcome in some regions
       whereas Source C emphasizes the Mongols’ military advantages and the role of Genghis Khan.
     • Source B emphasizes the importance of the cohesion of Mongol military forces whereas
       Source C focuses on the importance of Genghis Khan’s development of military tactics and
       strategies.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree that Mongol military
     strength under Genghis Khan contributed to the Mongol takeover of Central Asia and the
     Near East?                                                                                          [9]

     credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
     candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
     no set answer is required. While it is expected that there will be coverage of at least two of the
     sources, candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             Highlights factors that explain the Mongols’ rise and emergence including the
                          extent of their motivation. Their military superiority and their aggression
                          facilitated attacks against their neighbours and their hunger for booty and
                          spoils contributed to the takeover of Central Asia and the Middle East.

     Source B             Acknowledges the cohesion of the Mongol military; however, it emphasizes
                          other factors in explaining the success of the Mongols’ military campaigns
                          under Genghis Khan, including the disunity of the enemy, the religious
                          pluralism of the Mongols, and collaboration among the local populations.

     Source C             Highlights military aspects, including innovative and diverse military tactics
                          that the enemy could not compete with. In addition, it highlights the discipline
                          and unity that characterized the army and its obedience to commanders and
                          loyalty to Genghis Khan.

Source D        The Mongols' war equipment was diverse in nature, thus ensuring an array of
                items used in battles.

Own knowledge   There may be reference to the characteristics of the Mongol army and its
                overall organization, including reference to the decimal system (in which
                forces were organized into groups of 10, 100, 1 000, 10 0000), training, mobility
                and speed. Reference could also be made to the Mongols’ range of
                techniques including intelligence, which was enhanced through organization of
                yams (a system of messengers), psychological warfare, military tactics (the
                use of felt puppets to create the illusion of a larger force and/or feigned retreat
                ploys) and logistics. Reference could be made to other wars that took place
                prior to Genghis’s era.
                Reference could also be made to other factors that contributed to the
                successful takeover of Central Asia and the Near East, including the role of
                the leadership—in particular Genghis Khan's personal role—and further
                details on the weaknesses of Genghis’s enemies.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

5.   (a)   What, according to Source F, were the effects of the abandonment of the pluralist [diverse]
           society in Spain?                                                                           [3]

           • Conversos and Moriscos become disadvantaged minorities.
           • The cult of the “purity of blood” began.
           • Official bodies and/or the university college of San Bartolomé began to discriminate
             against the New Christians.
           • Conversos were portrayed as dangerous to religious integrity and national security.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source H suggest about the changes in the life of the Jewish population of
           Spain under the Catholic monarchs?                                                          [2]

           • Entire families were displaced.
           • Jews became impoverished.
           • Jews were leaving Spain in distress.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source G
     for an historian studying the expulsions of the late 15th century.                               [4]

     Value:
     • The extract is from an official document contemporary to the events being studied.
     • It offers the historian an insight into how the Catholic monarchs justified the expulsion.
     • It shows the historian the process by which the Jews were to be expelled. It stipulates when
       and how the expulsions were to be carried out.
     • It shows that all Jews, irrespective of wealth, age or social position, were subject to the same
       treatment.

     Limitations:
     • In contrast to the first and second bullet points of “Value”, some candidates may argue that it
       only provides the official explanation of why the expulsions were ordered and/or it does not offer
       information on the extent of their implementation.
     • It may exaggerate the consequences of defying the orders so as to promote obedience.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
     are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as supporting
     evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must be at least
     one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

7.   Compare and contrast what Sources E and F reveal about the treatment of Jews and Mudéjars
     in the late 15th century.                                                                 [6]

     credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what
     candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
     no set answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources claim that the treatment of the Jews and Mudéjars was partly due to the desire for
       a unified Catholic faith in Spain.
     • Both sources suggest that there was long-term antipathy towards Jews in Spain.
     • Both sources claim that there was a desire for “purity of blood”.
     • Both sources relate religion to nationality.

     Contrasts:
     • Source E stresses the need to purge Jewish and Moorish elements whereas Source F indicates
       some allowance of assimilation via the forced conversion of the Mudéjars.
     • Source E suggests that the role of the Inquisition was to consolidate pre-existing prejudices
       whereas Source F suggests that the Inquisition was a trigger for spreading the idea that
       conversos were a “danger to religious integrity and national security”.

8.   “The expulsion of the Jews from Spain was carried out for religious motives” (Source F).
     Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with this claim?              [9]

     Indicative content

     Source E             Claims the Catholic monarchs wanted to achieve popular allegiance based on
                          the Catholic faith. However, it regards the Catholic religion as a pretext used
                          to achieve political unity, suggesting that the expulsions may have been
                          motivated by political factors.

     Source F             States that the expulsions were a consequence of pre-existing religious
                          motives. It also states that “New Christians” were perceived to be dangerous
                          to national security, which could be interpreted as a political motive for the
                          expulsions.

     Source G             The Catholic monarchs offered religious motives for the Edict of Expulsion
                          when they stated that Jews were a negative influence on the Catholic faith.
                          Reference to the confiscation of possessions could indicate the influence of
                          economic motives.

     Source H             The Jews travelled with limited material possessions, which may suggest
                          economic motives for their expulsion.

Own knowledge   The role of religious motives could also be supported with reference to the
                fervent Catholicism of Isabella and Ferdinand, the suspicion that converted
                Jews continued to practise Judaism in secret, and the role of Torquemada in
                the failure of negotiations between representatives of the Jews and the
                Catholic monarchs. Candidates may offer further details about the tensions
                between the Papacy and the Catholic monarchs.
                Candidates may argue that other factors also played a role in the expulsions.
                These could include the fear that religious diversity might weaken political
                power; the Catholic monarchs’ desire to destroy local autonomies; their
                definitive victory over the Muslims and the fall of Granada led to a rise of
                nationalism, which encouraged anti-converso and anti-Semitic attitudes in the
                population. There was also resentment of the prosperity of the Jews in
                Spanish society and candidates may offer further details on the confiscation of
                the (significant) wealth that could help to rebuild Spain after the wars.

candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

9.   (a)   What, according to Source I, were the challenges facing Japanese national policy?           [3]

           • The great powers were perceived as being an aggressive force that Japan had to
             overcome.
           • Japan needed to strengthen Manchukuo against the threat from the Soviet Union.
           • Great Britain and the US stood in the way of Japan’s economic development.
           • Japan had to extend her influence without alienating other powers.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source L suggest about Sino-Japanese [Chinese-Japanese] relations in 1937? [2]

           • Japan had already cut off (annexed) Manchukuo and was ready to invade the rest of
             China ignoring any possible appeal by China to the League of Nations.
           • China was defenceless against Japan.
           • Japan is portrayed as an armoured samurai warrior, implying a military threat to China.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source I for
      an historian studying Japanese foreign policy in East Asia.                                        [4]

      Value:
      • It is an official Japanese government policy statement dated August 1936.
      • It outlines Japan’s intentions for foreign policy in the future.
      • It demonstrates the importance of Manchukuo, both economically and strategically, to Japanese
        foreign policy.
      • It indicates that Japan perceived the Soviet Union, Great Britain and the US as being a threat to
        Japanese policies.

      Limitations:
      • As it is a statement of principles there are no concrete proposals in the source about how these
        will be achieved. We do not know from the source whether Japan’s actions followed these
        guiding principles.
      • It could be used as propaganda camouflaging Japan’s real intentions, particularly towards the
        South Seas area.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

      candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
      no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources state that there was a need for economic expansion and investment programmes
        for Japan to have a strong industrial base.
      • Both sources mention the need to resolve the Chinese question, bringing it more under
        Japanese control.
      • Both sources identify the Soviet Union was a major area of concern; one that needed to be
        resolved by strengthening Japan’s military defences.

      Contrasts:
      • Source J suggests that Japan’s aim was to maintain peace in the region by diplomacy and to
        pursue co-prosperity and coexistence whereas Source K states that Japan’s aim should be to
        defend itself through aggressive military operations against its enemies.
      • Source J maintains that Japanese ministers in Tokyo believed that there should be no territorial
        expansion whereas Source K clearly indicates the expansionist tendencies of the Japanese
        army in Manchuria.
      • Source J states that China should be brought into line by diplomatic pressure from Japan
        whereas Source K argues that Japan should achieve this by defeating China militarily.

     Indicative content

     Source I             Asserts that the great powers, in particular the Soviet Union, had aggressive
                          policies that were a threat to Japan. However, it also indicates that Japan’s
                          relationship with the other powers should be developed through “friendly
                          relations.”

     Source J             Indicates that Japanese relations with other peoples in the area would be
                          based on coexistence and co-prosperity. Any interests in South-East Asia
                          must be based on a non-aggressive policy based on a peaceful approach. It
                          also shows that the ministers in Tokyo were not interested in territorial
                          expansion through force but by exerting pressure on governments in Asia.

     Source K             Maintains that an industrial base would be needed in case of war and that
                          aggressive offensive operations of a short duration were necessary and would
                          necessitate the elimination of China militarily. Military action would also be
                          necessary against the Soviet Union.

Source L        Shows that the Japanese had aggressive intentions towards China and were
                threatening to annex it, as they had already done with Manchukuo.
                It suggests that Japan would not be afraid to use military force.

Own knowledge   By 1931, after the invasion of Manchuria, the Kwantung Army simply ignored
                efforts by the Imperial government in Tokyo to check its aggression. Militarists
                assassinated Prime Minister Inukai in May 1932, for trying to bring the
                Kwantung Army under control. By 1933 Jehol had been annexed and
                Manchukuo created under the puppet leader Pu Yi.
                By the mid-1930s, army extremists had become impatient with Japan's
                existing political and economic policies that led to the attempted coup on 26
                February 1936. Although the coup failed militarists were committed to
                extending Japanese territory by force.
                The signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany in November 1936 was
                seen as protecting Manchukuo against the Soviet Union and guaranteeing the
                safety of Japanese territory allowing for a more aggressive policy towards
                China.
                In July 1937, tensions between Chinese troops and Japanese troops led to the
                Marco Polo Bridge Incident after which Japanese armies invaded China’s
                northern provinces and quickly captured Beijing. The Japanese captured
                Shanghai in November 1937 and then attacked Nanjing in December 1937
                with the resulting massacre of the civilian population.

13.   (a)   What, according to Source M, were the problems faced by African Americans in the US? [3]

            • African American youths suffered due to “poverty, failure and isolation”.
            • There was a significant likelihood that they would be involved in crime and/or put in prison.
            • The Armed Forces mental tests suggested that young African American men had been
              given an inadequate education.
            • African Americans were not treated as equals (except in the armed forces).

            • Some senators were opposed to any speedy action.
            • President Johnson was impatient with the slow progress in achieving civil rights.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source M for
      an historian studying the social position of African Americans in the US.                         [4]

      Value:
      • It is an official report written in 1965 and its purpose was to justify the need for change on a
        national level. It outlines difficulties faced by African Americans.
      • It provides detailed statistical analysis on the arrest of African Americas, the African American
        prison population and the failure rate of African Americans in the Armed Forces mental test.
      • Moynihan’s academic status as a sociologist means that he is likely to have offered a useful
        insight into the position of African Americans in US society.

      Limitations:
      • In contrast to the second bullet point of “Value”, some candidates may argue that Moynihan’s
        service in the armed forces may have tempted him to exaggerate the extent to which African
        Americans were fairly treated in the armed forces.
      • Moynihan’s position as Assistant Secretary of Labor in Johnson’s government may have
        affected the report, and/or the title of the report may reflect the lack of objectivity in the report.
      • Caution may be required in using this information, as suggested by the language in the source,
        for example, “there is of course no absolute evidence” and “It is probable that”.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources indicate that there was increasing emphasis on direct action in the African
        American quest for civil rights.
      • Both sources agree that direct action would produce results.
      • Both sources indicate that violence between African Americans and white opponents was
        involved.
      • Both sources state that the US government was not doing enough to promote civil rights.

      Contrasts:
      • Source N indicates that there was interracial cooperation whereas Source P suggests a
        reluctance to fully accept interracial cooperation.
      • Source N suggest that direct action may have “provoked violence by white extremists” whereas
        Source P suggests that direct action was in self-defence as a response to existing violence.

      Indicative content

      Source M             The source refers to high levels of crime in the African–American community
                           and suggests that this was likely to foster discrimination. The source also
                           indicates the US armed forces were unique in treating African Americans on
                           equal terms with whites. This latter point suggests that the US government
                           was actively encouraging parity of status.

      Source N             This source indicates that civil rights progress was delayed because of a fear
                           of a violent southern white backlash. The source also suggests that the
                           delivery of civil rights was delayed because of a focus on Cold War issues.
                           However, the consequent publicity contributed to support for civil rights.

      Source O             The cartoon emphasizes the cautious attitude to civil rights, particularly the
                           opposition likely to be encountered in Congress. On the other hand, the
                           placard suggests that some progress might be achieved and that Lyndon B
                           Johnson was keen to advance civil rights.

Source P        The source suggests that violence was justified, especially in view of frequent
                police brutality against African Americans. It states that the government is
                unwilling to protect African Americans as it does not defend them from unjust
                and unlawful attacks.

Own knowledge   Reference may be made to congressional opposition and obstruction of civil
                rights legislation, and to the FBI’s efforts to undermine the civil rights
                movement. It could also be made to a discontinuity between the federal
                government’s intentions and actions taken by state governments.
                Further details could be provided on the actions taken by civil rights
                protestors, for example, in February 1960, CORE (Congress of Racial
                Equality) student sit-ins began. In August 1963 Martin Luther King delivered
                his “I have a dream” speech at the end of the March on Washington. In March
                1965, the Selma march took place, and the civil rights marchers met serious
                violence.
                Candidates may refer to the opposition encountered by the civil rights
                protestors, for example, the actions of Governor Fabius and Bull Connor in
                Birmingham 1963. Ku Klux Klan brutality and police brutality could also be
                mentioned. Further, in November 1962 President Kennedy ordered the
                ending of segregation in Federal housing, in November 1963 Governor
                George Wallace blocked integration in the University of Alabama, in June
                1964 three civil rights activists were murdered in Mississippi, and in August
                1965 the Voting Rights Act was passed, abolishing discrimination against
                minorities.

17.   (a)   What, according to Source Q, were the difficulties faced by Rwanda after the civil war and
            genocide in 1994?                                                                          [3]

            •   Returning Tutsi took Hutu jobs and this created social tensions.
            •   There was a lack of housing and/or 150 000 houses were destroyed.
            •   300 000 children were without parents, living in fear and isolation.
            •   Most of the police, the judges, schoolteachers, doctors, and nurses had fled or were dead.

      (b)   What does Source R suggest about the situation of Rwandan refugees in 1996?                 [2]

            • The Hutu militia were holding refugees hostage and/or they were in control of refugees.
            • The Hutu militia remained powerful because they were still armed and prepared to use
              violence.
            • The refugees were helpless.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source S
      for an historian studying the Rwandan refugee crisis.                                            [4]

      Value:
      • As UN High Commissioner for refugees Ogata may be well informed about the refugee crisis.
      • It is an official statement and it would give an insight into what the UN understood about the
        situation and what the world community was told at the time.
      • The content of the speech gives specific examples of issues the UNHCR has found and/or the
        language is politically “neutral”.

      Limitations:
      • As UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ogata may want to move responsibility for the refugee
        crisis and related problems away from the United Nations and its agencies.
      • Because the crisis was still unfolding, Ogata could not fully assess the impact of the refugee
        crisis, both on Rwanda and the local region.
      • The purpose is to gain support for new initiatives and therefore may only discuss elements of
        the crisis that can be addressed by UN intervention.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the question. If only value or
      limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used
      as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there
      must be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

      candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and
      no set answer is required.

      Comparisons:
      • Both suggest that a solution was going to be difficult because of the large numbers of refugees
        in the border camps.
      • Both sources suggest the former leadership was still powerful in the camps, which was an issue
        and/or they recognize that there were dangers within the camps—genocide intimidation and
        fear.
      • Both sources suggest that violence spread outside the camps.

      Contrasts:
      • Source T is very negative in its focus, highlighting the problems and contempt for the system in
        operation whereas Source S is more positive in its message suggesting that there could be a
        peaceful resolution to the conflict.
      • Source T identifies the UN /international community as a contributing problem whereas Source
        S suggests the main issue was the location of the camps.
      • Source T claims that Hutu propaganda was preventing their return whereas Source S claims
        that human rights abuses in Rwanda were also preventing repatriation from the camps.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             There were acute social problems after the war and the genocide. Returning
                           Tutsi exiles took Hutu jobs in the towns and this led to social tension. There
                           was a lack of housing and there were hundreds of thousands of orphaned
                           children. Justice and reconciliation would be difficult to find as most of the
                           police, the judges, schoolteachers, doctors and nurses were dead or had fled.

      Source R             A challenge to reconciliation was the dominance of Hutu leaders in the
                           refugee camps. They had been driven out of Rwanda but were still armed.

      Source S             The UN had difficulty in identifying and separating the “extremists” in the
                           refugee camps. This meant that the former leadership were still active and
                           had not been brought to “justice”. The location of camps may have been a
                           problem. Repatriation of refugees was difficult due to intimidation in the
                           camps, but also due to the threat of arrest in Rwanda. Another problem for
                           reconciliation and justice were human rights concerns in Rwanda.

Source T        The border camps posed problems for justice and reconciliation as Hutu
                Power leaders remained in control of over a million refugees. Hutu Power
                groups were still able to get weapons and launch attacks over the border into
                Rwanda. The UN was ineffective in addressing the domination or actions of
                these groups within the refugee camps.

Own knowledge   Reference may be made to the suggestion that the social impact of the
                genocide was immense, as evidenced by the proportion of the population that
                had been killed and the volume of internally displaced persons. There was a
                lack of security within Rwanda and continued ethnic tension between Hutu
                and Tutsi.
                The apparent lack of justice delivered by the International Criminal Tribunal for
                Rwanda was a challenge for reconciliation and justice. The Rwandan Patriotic
                Front (RPF) faced the challenge of consolidating their political control and
                removing elements of the radical Hutu party, the National Republican
                Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), which they banned. For
                justice and reconciliation there needed to be economic reconstruction. The
                economy needed foreign investment and loans to foster security and stability.
                The government also faced the external threat of continued war in the region,
                in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Zaire). The dismantling of the refugee
                camps was another challenge for the Rwandan government as thousands
                were killed in the process and refugees crossed over the border into Rwanda.
