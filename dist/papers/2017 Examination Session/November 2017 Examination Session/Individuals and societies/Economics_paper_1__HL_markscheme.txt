Microeconomics

1.   (a)       With reference to demand and supply in competitive markets, explain how the
               economic question “what to produce” is answered.                                  [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of demand, supply, competitive markets
               • diagram(s) to show demand and supply and the price mechanism
               • explanation of how scarcity and opportunity cost necessitates choices and
                 how the price mechanism works to provide incentives
               • examples of choices and price mechanism at work.

(b)   Discuss the reasons why firms compete or collude in oligopolistic markets.        [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of collusion, oligopolistic markets
      • diagram(s) to show oligopoly
      • explanation of why firms may choose to collude or not to collude, why
        interdependence is central to this decision, tacit collusion and price
        leadership
      • example of where firms have colluded or not colluded
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the information problem that oligopoly firms face,
      some consideration of why cartels are difficult to maintain due to their
      unenforceability, the incentive to cheat of members of cartels. Incentives to
      collude might be considered such as joint profit maximization.

             mobility to get a new job quickly

(b)   Discuss the view that the best way to reduce unemployment is through education
      and training.                                                                    [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of unemployment
      • diagram to show how education and training increases the supply of
        available labour and leads to a rise in employment
      • explanation that education and training increases the skill level of
        unemployed workers and increases their opportunities for employment
      • examples of where education and training has reduced unemployment
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of how education and training might be
      appropriate for structural unemployment, but might not be as effective with
      demand-deficient and frictional unemployment. There could be consideration
      of the cost and effectiveness of government run education and training. There
      could also be consideration that alternative policies are more effective than
      education and training in reducing certain types of unemployment.

(b)   Evaluate the view that the use of fiscal policy is the most effective way of reducing
      the rate of inflation in an economy.                                                         [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of fiscal policy, rate of inflation
      • diagram to show the impact of deflationary fiscal policy (shift AD left)
      • explanation of the mechanisms through which deflationary fiscal policy may
        lower the rate of inflation through its impact on AD
      • examples of fiscal policy being used to lower the rate of inflation
      • synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the importance of the type of inflation, possible conflicts
      with other objectives of economic policy, the direct impact on AD, the problem of
      time lags, political constraints, the use of fiscal policy to influence the supply side of
      the economy. There could also be consideration of alternative policies to reduce the
      rate of inflation, such as monetary policy and supply side policies.
