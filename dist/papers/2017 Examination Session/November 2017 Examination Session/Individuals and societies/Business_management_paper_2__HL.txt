                                                 Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   Pelican Pies (PP)

     Pelican Pies (PP) produces high-quality pies that have limited brand loyalty outside of their local
     market. The prices of the pies are higher than those of PP’s competitors.

     Table 1: Selected financial information for PP for the year ending 30 April 2017.

       Number of pies sold                              8000
       Price of each pie sold                          $4.00
       Cost of goods sold per pie                      $1.75
       Expenses
       • Electricity per month                          $200
       • Rent of premises per quarter                  $1000
       • Promotional expenses per year                 $1000
       8 % interest per year paid on a loan of       $40 000
       Tax                                         25 % of profits

     For 2018, PP’s owner, Austin, is looking to increase sales beyond the local market by lowering
     prices and spending a greater proportion of PP’s promotional budget on above-the-line methods
     such as regional newspaper advertisements.  To finance this type of promotion, Austin will have to
     increase his loan amount by $10 000.

     Table 2: Selected financial information for the year ending 30 April 2018.

       Number of pies sold                          20 % increase on 2017 figure
       Price of each pie sold                      30 % decrease on 2017 figure
       Cost of goods sold per pie                               $1.75
       Expenses
       • Electricity per month                                   $200
       • Rent of premises per quarter                           $1000
       • Promotional expenses per year             200 % increase on 2017 figure
       8 % interest per year paid on a loan of                 $50 000
       Tax                                                  25 % of profits


     (a)     Describe one reason why brand loyalty would be important to PP.                               [2]

     (b) 	 Construct a profit and loss account for PP for the year ending 30 April 2017 based on
           the figures in Table 1 (show all your working).                                                 [4]

2.   Tasty Cupcake (TC)

     Luis and José have set up a partnership, baking and selling cupcakes directly to consumers and
     supermarkets. They called the business Tasty Cupcake (TC). They used their savings of $3000
     as starting capital. The partners need an overdraft agreement from the local bank. The bank
     manager asked for a cash-flow forecast.

     Luis has forecasted the following sales and cost figures for the first six months of operation,
     beginning in January.

     Sales
     yyAverage selling price of one cupcake: $5.
     yySales of cupcakes: 1300 cupcakes in January and 1700 cupcakes per month from February
     • 70 % of customers who purchase cupcakes will pay in cash. The supermarkets will buy the
       remaining 30 % of cupcakes on credit and pay one month later.

     Costs
     yyRent: $6500, payable at the start of each quarter.
     yyLabour costs: $750 per month.
     yyRaw materials: 50 % of sales revenue per month, paid in cash.
     yyOverheads: $400 per month, paid in cash.


     (a)   State two features of a partnership.                                                        [2]

     (b) 	 Prepare a monthly cash-flow forecast for TC for the first six months of operation.          [6]

     (c)   Calculate TC’s forecasted net profit at the end of June (show all your working).            [2]

                                                Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Pedro

     Pedro is a farmer who operates as a sole trader in a developing country. Like other farmers in his
     community, he grows oranges, which are sold to buyers in developed communities and large cities.
     Working in the primary sector often results in very low income and poverty for some of the farmers.
     Most children do not go to school, as they are needed in the fields for manual work.  Cooperation
     between the farmers in this community is very limited due to linguistic and cultural differences.

     Recently, farmers’ incomes have fallen further. Pedro has conducted social, technological,
     economic, environmental, political, legal and ethical (STEEPLE) analysis and identified two main
     external threats that are impacting on farmers’ incomes:
     yycompetition from orange producers from developed communities and large cities with improved
        technology and higher productivity rates
     yya severe and sustained drought affecting the level of orange production in all developing
        countries.

     Pedro would like to improve productivity as an orange producer. Investing in new technology is
     risky and would require extensive research and development. The internet is unreliable and Pedro
     is unable to raise funds for this investment himself to change current production methods.

     Pedro has arranged an emergency meeting of local farmers. He proposes that all farmers in his
     community create an agricultural cooperative and collectively raise funds to invest in new
     capital-intensive farming methods. The investment in technology could allow them to diversify into
     the manufacturing of bottled orange juice drinks.


     (a)   Define the term productivity rate.                                                        [2]

     (b)   Explain how each of the two external threats arising from the STEEPLE analysis would
           have impacted on farmers’ incomes in the developing world.                                [4]

     (c)   Explain one cost and one benefit to Pedro of conducting extensive research and
           development.                                                                              [4]

     (d)   Examine Pedro’s proposal to create an agricultural cooperative in his community rather
           than continuing to operate as a sole trader.                                             [10]

4.   Music Mania (MM)

     Music Mania (MM) is an independent store selling new and used music compact discs (CDs),
     DVD films and music vinyl records.  It is a sole trader business owned by André, who has 25 years
     of experience in the retail and music business. MM has loyal customers but its total revenue is
     falling. The store currently has a low market share in DVDs and vinyl records.

     André decided to conduct some primary and secondary market research, as the entertainment
     industry is changing rapidly. He discovered that:
     yythe market for DVDs is in rapid decline
     yyCD sales are declining slowly but new releases still sell well
     yyMM has had to stock computer games, which are selling out very quickly, and the sales of new
        vinyl records are growing slowly.

     André is accustomed to variations in sales but the current sales forecasts are, in his experience,
     the most worrying. He has decided to create an e-commerce website to increase his sales of new
     and used vinyl records and CDs. André is also aware that new free online music streaming and
     gaming sites are being launched.

     André has only limited internal sources of finance to set up the website.  Two new tactics to ensure
     future success for MM being considered are:
     yyto stop selling DVDs
     yyto increase below-the-line promotional spending on vinyl records.


     (a)   Define the term secondary market research.                                                  [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for MM of using sales forecasting.               [4]

     (c)   Explain one cost and one benefit for MM of setting up an e-commerce website.                [4]

     (d)   Using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, discuss the two new tactics André is
           considering to ensure MM’s future success.                                                [10]

5.   Green Clean (GC)

     Green Clean (GC) is a private limited company.  Its unique selling point (USP) is offering
     high‑quality and reliable cleaning services by teams of professional cleaners who clean offices
     and houses.

     GC has strong ethical objectives. They only use eco-friendly cleaning products and pay their
     employees fair wages. Labour turnover is low and many cleaners have worked for the company
     for over two decades.

     However, the cleaning market has become very competitive. GC has been slow to react. Other
     cleaning companies are beginning to offer a wider range of services.  GC’s management has
     decided to introduce a new gardening service to create new revenue streams. GC will have to
     recruit professionally trained gardeners from wide geographical areas, as they are difficult to find.  
     GC will have to pay these new gardeners at least 20 % more than cleaners to attract them. GC
     has limited experience in recruiting employees other than cleaners.

     The cleaners are becoming demotivated because they are unhappy about the difference in pay
     between cleaners and future gardeners. They believe that gardeners are not more skilled than
     cleaners but just have a different skill set.  Human resource managers are concerned about the
     potential impact of demotivated cleaners and are looking for ways to improve morale. One option
     they are considering is to offer cleaners an employee-share ownership scheme.  Shareholders,
     however, are opposed to this proposal.


     (a)   Define the term ethical objective.                                                             [2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage to GC of having low labour turnover.                [4]

     (c)   Explain two possible steps in the recruitment process of gardeners for GC.                     [4]

     (d)   With reference to two motivation theories, examine the motivation of cleaners at GC.          [10]
