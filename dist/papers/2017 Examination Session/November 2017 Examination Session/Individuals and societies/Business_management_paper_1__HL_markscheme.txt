                                         Section A
1.   (a)   Describe two advantages to MSS of being a charity (line 14).                         [4]

           Advantages to MSS include:
            land being donated – unlikely if not a charity
            grants – usually only available for charities
            books being donated
            the management being able to focus on their mission rather than profits, which
             may make the mission and vision more attractive to potential students/parents
            possible tax advantages
            charities often achieve strong reputations
            Limited liability for trustees for most charities.

           Accept any other reasonable description.

           Award [1] for each advantage, up to a total of [2].

           Award [1] for putting the advantage into context, up to a total of [2].

     (b)   Explain how the school could overcome high labour turnover.                          [6]

           Key aspects leading to high labour turnover are:
            poor accommodation
            having to teach only in English
            no career development
            no professional development
            access to technology for staff
            standard pay scales.

           Solutions likely to come from these including higher wages, more levels of
           hierarchy, access to new technology, staff involvement.

           Explanation/analysis will come from discussing these and any other relevant
           issue. Candidates do not need to discuss these in relation to motivation theories,
           such as Maslow, Herzberg, Taylor, Adams or Pink but these could be rewarded.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for only analysing one
           method/idea.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the analysis of two or more methods/ideas is mainly
           descriptive but in context.

           Only award [6] if answer takes into account constraints on methods/ideas eg
           limited finance, being a charity etc.
                                                  –8–                 N17/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe two features of the school’s marketing mix (line 54).                          [4]

           Context: The marketing mix can apply to: the IT centre, the product of an
           education for girls, boarding, a better school environment than most schools, and
           a humanitarian award.

           Features include:
            promotion by means of effective communication with customers
            a coordinated marketing mix
            branding based on the humanitarian award and the mission of the school
            the school and its location, which is the product and is differentiated from
             similar organizations
            Product: school environment, ethos, extra curricula activities, boarding school,
             other aspects of service.

           Remember: Place is about distribution, not location and is unlikely to apply
           to MSS.

           Accept any other reasonable description. (eg at HL can accept the 7Ps)

           For each feature: Award [1] for identifying the feature and [1] for relevant
           application to MSS.

     (b)   Explain, with reference to MSS, the purpose of the mission and vision statements
           (line 37).                                                                              [6]

           A mission statement is a statement of the purpose of an organization, in this
           instance providing an education for girls. It should refer to the key market
           (parents of girls), the contribution it makes to that market and what makes the
           service unique, so that the client chooses the school. The school’s ethics may
           play a part in this.

           A vision statement is a statement of an organization’s overall objectives designed
           to aid decision making. In this instance it will refer to future plans for growth and
           facilities.

           Mission statements and vision statements fulfill different purposes. A mission
           statement describes an organization’s purpose and answers the questions “What
           business are we in?” and “What is our business for?”. A vision statement
           provides strategic direction and describes what the owner or founder wants the
           company to achieve in the future.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum of [4] if either only one of mission statement or vision
           statement are addressed in context.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the analysis is mainly descriptive but in context.

           If there is confusion between mission statement and vision statement but there is
           some understanding shown of the concepts award a maximum of [4] if in context
           and [2] if no context. If the statements are not explained but purposes developed
           also award max [4].
                                                 –9–                 N17/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Describe one capital expenditure and one revenue expenditure for MSS
           (lines 1617)                                                                         [4]

           Capital expenditure could include: buildings, computers, books, equipment.
           Revenue expenditure could include: wages, materials, electricity, marketing, etc.

           Pens, paper and other consumables are revenue expenditure even if bought
           in bulk.

           Accept any other reasonable expenditures.

           For each capital expenditure: Award [1] for identifying the expenditure and [1] for
           relevant application to MSS.

           For each revenue expenditure: Award [1] for identifying the expenditure and [1]
           for relevant application to MSS.

     (b)   Explain a suitable promotional mix that MSS might use to attract new students.        [6]

           Relevant context:
            MSS is a charity so has a limited promotion budget
            the school is in a remote area, which has an impact on the choice
            ethical considerations
            USP considerations
            suitable methods
            is the promotion for the local area or in the cities? The outcome might be
             different for each.

           Above the line methods:
            advertising, but where?

           Below the line:
            sales promotion. How? Two for the price of one might apply to siblings.
            public relations. For a small school? Where?
            exhibitions, etc. But the school is remote.
            word of mouth. Probably the most likely in a remote location.
            can also include social media in below the line.

           Remember: This question is about a “mix” of promotional activities and therefore
           needs more than one promotional activity.

           Accept any other reasonable explanation.

           Analysis should come from explaining how the methods can achieve
           the objective.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.

           Award a maximum of [4] if the explanation is limited to only one promotional
           activity in context.

           Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is purely descriptive but in context.

           A judgement/recommendation is not needed for [6].

                                         Section B
4.   (a)   Define the term contingency plan.                                                    [2]

           A contingency plan is a systematic way of preparing for the unexpected. Can
           accept “planning”. This would be sufficient for [2].

           The aim is to reduce the possible impact of unexpected and unwanted events. If
           the definition relies on natural disasters, emergencies, crisis etc rather than
           “unexpected” only award [1] unless it is clear these are examples and that there
           is a “plan.”

           Award [1] for some understanding.

           Award [2] for a clear definition which must include a sense of preparing for the
           unexpected/unwanted/crisis or similar words.

     (b)   Explain the usefulness to MSS of the variance analysis in Table 1.                   [4]

           The variances suggest seeking answers to questions, helping future budgeting
           and identifying problems.

           The calculations show lower than expected fees. This helps plan for teachers
           and other resources.

           Higher than expected salaries. This helps questions such as “Have we recruited
           too many teachers”? and “Could we afford a pay increase?”.

           Higher cash purchases suggests looking at the value to MSS of cash purchases
           made. The overall profit figure has changed a great deal so considerable need
           for concern.

           Candidates are likely to explain the general meaning of variances and then
           illustrate their use by reference to the data in Table 1. However, do not reward a
           simple interpretation of the table without reference to use as this doesn’t answer
           the question.

           A description only/definition only does not gain marks however a very clear
           description of variance analysis together with a very good example of use from
           Table 1 could achieve [4]. Otherwise:

           Award [1] for each usefulness identified and [1] for its relevance to MSS, usually
           with reference to numbers.

     (c)   Explain two restraining forces relating to change at MSS.                            [4]

           Restraining forces include:
            poor electricity supply
            does the school have the expertise?
            limited finance available
            no internet
            maybe other priorities
            construction/implementation problems.

           Accept other reasonable alternative answers.

           Award [1] for identifying each restraining force and [1] for linking that force
           to MSS.

(d)   Discuss human resource strategies that could reduce the impact on employees of
      the changes suggested by Mrs K.                                                     [10]

      Proposed changes suggested by Mrs K:
       Increase teacher contact time with students
       Observe each other’s lessons and make suggestions for improvements
       Additional duties for teachers

      Possible strategies include:
       involving teachers in the decisions and their implementation
       allowing teachers to have employee representatives
       making sure staff understand the reasons for change
       bringing the changes in gradually
       making sure training is available – this may solve a range of problems
       working to ensure everyone shares Jacob’s vision.

      This question is more about management of change than human resources and
      high mark answers should reflect that.

      Accept reasonable alternative answers.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 4.

      Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer with no effective use of
      additional case material or reference to management of change.

      Award a maximum of [4] if the candidate only analyses/evaluates Mrs K’s
      changes.

      Award a maximum of [5] if only one strategy is considered in context.

      Award a maximum of [5] if there is no reference to the changes suggested by
      Mrs K.

      Award a maximum of [6] if more than one strategy is considered but there is
      limited use of data.

      Award a maximum of [8] if strategies/impacts are considered, there is good use of
      data, but lack judgement(s).

      For full marks more than one strategy should be considered, data used
      effectively, a clear development of the impact on employees given and
      judgements are made.

                                          Section C
5.   Using the information above and in Figure 1, recommend either Option 1 or Option 2
     for MSS. You will find it useful to calculate the payback period for the two options.   [20]

     Discussion could include:

     Option 1: IT centre
      Longer term option
      Higher risk
      Some funding has already been achieved
      It fits in with Jacob’s vision and mission
      It helps with a very valuable USP
      it could attract pupils from the city
      There is a higher risk of failure although loss is smaller, there are possible
       construction problems
      “Successful” returns are higher
      But large capital outlay
      Predicted outcome $1300
      Staff don’t like this option, but benefits for students
      ARR 26.7 %, NPV $1153, payback 2.14 years which is just less than 2 years and 2
       months.
      Donor already found for internet connection
     
     Option 2: minibus
      Solves an urgent problem
      Lower risk
      There is less likelihood of it attracting new students?
      The risk of failure is small and the probability of success higher.
      Predicted outcome $1165, less than the IT centre
      Staff like the idea
      It has a variety of uses
      Quicker payback (1.45 years, just more than 1 year and 5 months) and higher ARR
       (35.4 %) but shorter life, hence NPV lower ($567)
      Improves situation for teachers and students
      Purchase cost relatively low.

     Other issues
      Reliability of data?
      How realistic are probabilities?
      Are there other alternatives?

     Only some of these issues need to be discussed for a full response
     Accept any other relevant discussion.

     Marks should be allocated according to the assessment criteria on pages 7–8.

     Criterion A is concerned with what techniques and ideas are chosen to solve the
     problem.

     Criterion B is concerned with how effectively these techniques and the data are
     applied to the problem.
                                              – 13 –               N17/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C is concerned with how well arguments are balanced and recommendations
that are made.

Criterion A: Knowledge areas include: risk, decision trees and predicted outcomes, investment
appraisal, use and limitations of data, strategic decision making. No understanding of decision
trees and/or predicted outcomes and/or investment appraisal, marks limited to [3].

Criterion B: Application will be judged by the use of the stimulus material, in particular
the extra material. If only one option considered, award a maximum of [2]. If both
options considered but no use of additional material, award a maximum of [3]. If no
payback based on the original data or payback not used limit to [3].

Criterion C: Reasoned argument. For full marks there needs to be a comparison
between the two options and a supported recommendation. If analysis of only one,
award a maximum of [3]. If no comparison but analysis of both options award a
maximum of [2]. For simplistic analysis max [1].

Criterion D: Structure – see criterion.

Criterion E: Likely issues include: Groups: impact on communities, teachers
and/or other employees, students/potential students, parents, townspeople,
contractors, trustees, management, other stakeholders. Individuals: Jacob and
Mrs K.

0 = no relevant mention of any groups, individuals

1 = only group(s), or only individual(s) or both treated superficially

2 = group(s) and individuals(s) considered but either groups or individuals superficial

3 = groups and individuals considered more than superficially but not balanced

4 = groups and individuals given balanced consideration

Note: a recommendation that a decision cannot be made due to lack of information (eg
market research) can be regarded as a decision provided the arguments are
supported.

Do not penalise candidates who make little or no reference to the original pre-release
material.
