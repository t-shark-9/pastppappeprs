2.    Explain how young Nepalese men understand the connection between geographical
      mobility and social mobility.                                                                          [6]

      This response requires that candidates make the link that for young Nepalese men the change in
      location will bring about a change in status. However, this aspiration is not necessarily realized.
      Although they may be employed in jobs which do not make use of their skills (working in a call
      centre when having postgraduate level IT skills), they still perceive India to be a place where they
      can grow in ways that they would not be able to back in Nepal. India is also used as a stepping
      stone to places further away such as the Middle East or South East Asia, which are associated
      with even greater prestige by the Nepalese.

      There are several theories which might be used by candidates, including world systems theory and
      others relating to economic and materialist approaches, but responses should acknowledge that
      there is a cultural dimension to the migration and it is not solely about wage-labour. Structure-
      centred, agency-structured and idealist approaches are all applicable, and some may pick up on
      the liminal character of the pravasi Nepalis. (HL only)

      Candidates may identify a diachronic approach in the extract. Some may tease out elements of
      kinship (in supporting family back in Nepal) and gender (in that it is only men who are expected to
      travel and study abroad).



     Marks    Level descriptor

       0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

              The response is mainly descriptive and relies on quotations, but may demonstrate limited
      1–2
              understanding of relevant anthropological issues and concepts.
              The response demonstrates some understanding of relevant anthropological issues and
      3–4     concepts or theory, or the response recognizes the viewpoint of the anthropologist, but
              not all of these.
              The response demonstrates a critical understanding of relevant anthropological issues,
      5–6
              concepts and theory, and recognizes the viewpoint of the anthropologist.

3.    Compare and contrast the experiences of young Nepalese men in India
      with rites of passage in one society you have studied.                                            [8]

      The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. The question requires
      candidates to demonstrate an understanding of rites of passage. What constitutes a rite of
      passage can be defined broadly, and need not be limited to “classic” examples such as funeral or
      wedding rites, as long as the candidate makes a satisfactory case for its relevance.

      Some candidates may attempt a structural analysis of the two rites of passage and compare them
      in terms of pre-liminal, liminal and post-liminal rites and the associated changes in status, others
      may focus more on liminality and communitas as these are more evident in the extract. More
      sophisticated responses will take a more conceptual approach rather than comparing superficial
      details.

      The success of this answer depends on how candidates compare and incorporate ethnographic
      knowledge, rather than it being a test of knowledge of a similar case study.

       0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

              Comparative ethnography is presented in limited detail and its relevance is only partly
      1–2     established. It is not identified in terms of place, author or historical context. The
              response may not be structured as a comparison.
              Comparative ethnography is presented in limited detail but its relevance is established.
      3–4     The comparative ethnography is identified in terms of place, author and historical context,
              or the response is clearly structured as a comparison.
              Comparative ethnography is presented and its relevance is successfully established. The
              comparative ethnography is identified in terms of place, author and historical context, and

              the response is clearly structured as a comparison. Either similarities or differences are
              discussed in detail, but not both.

              the response is clearly structured as a comparison. Similarities and differences are
              discussed in detail. The response demonstrates good anthropological understanding.
