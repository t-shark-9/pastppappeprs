                                                         Ethiopia

          Ethiopia has the second-highest population in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a population of
           96.9 million, and a fairly high population growth rate of 3 %. Ethiopia is also one of the
           world’s poorest countries. The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is
           substantially lower than the regional average.

          However, the economy has experienced strong economic growth over the past decade, more
           than double the regional average of 5.3 %. Currently, agriculture is the major sector of the
           economy: 80 % of the labour force is engaged in agriculture and it contributes about 50 % to
           the nation’s GDP.

          The World Bank says that Ethiopia needs to diversify its economy so that more employment
           is generated by the manufacturing sector. Although small scale enterprises are doing
           well, their rapid growth is negatively affected by many obstacles. Access to credit is very
           difficult, and so domestically funded investment is hard to achieve, causing a significant
           investment gap. There are also problems with the provision of infrastructure like electricity,
           telecommunications and access to roads, particularly in rural areas.

          The government has been encouraging foreign direct investment from multinational
           corporations (MNCs) to attempt to solve some of Ethiopia’s economic problems and
           to break the poverty cycle. Much of the investment has come from China, whose total
           investment in the country has reached almost US$17 billion.

          China has established Ethiopia as one of its six “special economic zones” in Africa. The two
           countries have signed five cooperation deals relating to technologies, electric power, finance,
           energy and aviation.

          Last year, the Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe manufacturer, announced a US$2.2 billion
           investment plan in Ethiopia. They intend to set up an industrial zone, which is expected to
           contain approximately 45 textile and garment, leather and leather-products, chemical and
           pharmaceuticals, agricultural-processing and metal engineering factories. In the first year of
           the project, there should be 3000 jobs created. By the end of the project, approximately
           30 000 workers are expected to find employment there.

          Worries exist in Ethiopia about the country’s large trade imbalance with China and the
           influx of Chinese goods – China accounts for 21 % of total imports into the country but only
           11 % of Ethiopia’s exports go to China. There are also concerns relating to the over-use of
           resources.

                                              Aid to Papua New Guinea (PNG)

          A group of Australian politicians is visiting Papua New Guinea (PNG), a former colony, to
           see first-hand where Australia’s AU$477 million in foreign aid is being used. The aid is being
           spent on women and children who are crime victims, immunizations for young children to
           protect them from diseases such as polio, efforts to eradicate tuberculosis, provision of free
           education for girls, pre-school and early learning, and training for the next generation of PNG
           police officers. There is a lot of aid money being spent but it is making very little difference.

          Though PNG is close to Australia, it is very far away in terms of economic development.
           One non-governmental organization (NGO), Save the Children, reported that “the level of
           need in PNG is astonishing. Children are far more likely to die before their fifth birthday here
           in PNG than most other places in the world. There is a huge amount of violence against
           women and children”. The value of its Human Development Index (HDI) is 0.466, ranking it
           156 out of 187 countries.

          One of the Australian politicians is concerned that corruption is so widespread that it is
           preventing efforts to get PNG’s educational, health and justice systems to operate effectively.
           “Make no mistake, there are many problems, including problems with security, family
           violence and many other socio-economic concerns,” he said. “However, I think corruption is
           the largest issue confronting the challenges of PNG. You have to question whether you can
           address these issues without dealing with the issue of corruption first.”

          “These challenges cannot be met without a system of government that is functioning
           properly. This is a society that has been propped up by aid and the actions of NGOs.
           The government simply does not work.”

          Another member of the visiting group thinks improving agricultural productivity is a way
           forward for PNG economically and socially, with great potential for economic growth. A
           project spokesperson said that increased foreign aid could lift productivity and improve
           growth, by assisting PNG farmers to improve irrigation* and supply routes. He also said that
           research and development, in addition to training local farmers could help. Another project
           that the group is visiting runs a programme to encourage women to be more involved in
           decision-making in the growing and selling of coffee, a crop that is important to the
           PNG economy.

          The leader of the visiting group says that “our aid money here should ensure that more
           children are born in environments with supervised medical care, and that there is a police
           and justice system that protects the rights of children. Children should have the right to
           be free from violence and free from sexual assault, and should have access to the great
           transformative power of education”.

* irrigation: a method for regularly supplying water to plants. It is used to assist in
  the growing of agricultural crops particularly during periods of low rainfall.

		         (ii)   Define the term economic growth indicated in bold in the text (paragraph ).        [2]

     (b)   Using a demand and supply diagram, explain how the market for coffee in Papua New
           Guinea could be affected by improved irrigation (paragraph ).                             [4]

     (c)   Using an externalities diagram, explain why the introduction of free education for girls
           corrects a market failure (paragraph ).                                                   [4]

     (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, evaluate the
           role of foreign aid in contributing to economic development in Papua New Guinea.           [8]
