                                           Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

Criterion A                                                                                          [5 max]

The task is essentially focused on an analysis of a chosen passage from a prose text. Through this
analysis the level of understanding will be evaluated by the examiner. This “understanding” of the text
should include the relevance of the passage and its place in the context of the novel as a whole.
A synopsis of the plot of the text may be a first step towards demonstrating understanding but “good”
and “perceptive” understanding will evaluate style and theme as well as plot detail. The analysis and
understanding of these elements of the text will always be conducted with a view to the performance of
the chosen passage. The importance of support and validation of all ideas through reference to the text
is crucial. The text is fundamental and reference to it mandatory.


Criterion B                                                                                        [10 max]

The “ideas” for performance are generated from the text and should not be independent of it.
The textual “justification” required to support the “ideas for performance” in Criterion B will be drawn from
a thorough contextualization of the passage and a secure understanding of its relevance to whatever
issues the questions raise.

The association of “good” and “excellent” with the word “practical” attests to the value of ideas that can
be realized in a practical staging context. These are ideas for the stage or a staging area and
temptations to propose grandiose scenarios more applicable to “blockbuster” cinema than theatre should
be resisted.

The candidate may draw diagrams or make sketches if it is thought that these are necessary to
communicate the “ideas for performance” but such visual additions are not mandatory.


Criterion C                                                                                          [5 max]

This criterion evaluates the clarity and coherence of the language used in the essay and looks at the
appropriateness of the register, style and terminology which the candidate employs.

Clearly in an exercise which demands a facility in two disciplines, namely literature and performance, the
candidate will be expected to demonstrate a facility in the use of the terminology specific to each
discipline. As a writer of prose the candidate will be assessed on clarity, variety, precision and
concision. The clarity of a written communication depends on accuracy in grammar, spelling and
sentence construction. The effectiveness of a written communication will depend on the use of
vocabulary, a sense for precision or accuracy of expression and concision which argues for an economy
of expression. The persuasiveness of a piece of writing will depend on choice of idiom and style.
                                                    –4–                  N17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The following elements are particularly relevant to Criteria A, B and C:

1.   Credible to good candidates will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate to the question.
     They will attempt to contextualize it in order to establish its significance; this may involve a
     summary of the content of the passage that clearly identifies the clash of culture. Attention will be
     paid to the staging choices the question encourages the candidate to make in order to show the
     differences between the two cultures. The credible candidate may respond to the question in quite
     general terms but the good candidate will already be narrowing perspective around the clash, how
     it might be staged and how the design motifs may visually demonstrate the differences between
     the cultures for an audience. The way acting might register this dramatically for an audience is
     also likely to be important. There may also be references to different production effects that may
     provide further ways of dramatizing the action. The culture clash might be apparent on a number of
     different levels: material, spiritual or emotional.

      Credible to good responses will attempt to focus on the question but may not always succeed in
      doing so. They are likely to introduce references from the novel and be largely descriptive in their
      account, tending towards a narrative register. The candidates who achieve good responses will be
      establishing some analytical points in the passage that support the importance and significance of
      the clash of cultures. Specificity will distinguish the good from the credible candidate.

      Credible to good approaches to the movement from page to stage will vary from the candidate who
      may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, to the candidate who will be more liable
      to explore both text and stage. Thereby showing how the style of the prose description might be
      transformed into a dramatic scene that conveys the significance of the passage. The presentation
      of action will be set up against a backdrop that is designed to project this to an audience in
      particular ways. The examiner might reasonably expect to see lighting and staging used in
      conjunction to enhance these representations for an audience. Staging effects like design, lighting
      and sound are likely to be broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in the
      quality of the response. The good candidates will be able to see how use of the stage setting
      either spatially or through design (or both) can be manipulated to shape communication for an
      audience. The good candidate will not perceive representation in an exclusively literal manner.
      Attention to the role of sound, lighting, costume will contribute to staging and this attention will vary
      depending on choices the candidates make on where they choose to place their emphasis and on
      the quality of the work. It is likely that there will be a focus on the work of the actors on stage, the
      credible candidate will demonstrate this work in a general manner, the good candidate will be
      insightful enough to select particular features of the actor’s performance and connect them to the
      overall purpose of the scene by dramatizing the clash of cultures in an effective way.

      Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text. The
      overall concept for staging may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements, as this
      grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced, the work begins to characterize that
      expected from a good candidate. The understanding of stagecraft may well be a defining factor in
      responses to this question especially when candidates engage in production effects. These should
      be practical and feasible, not outlandish or cinematic. Particular design gambits and specific uses
      for production and design elements will serve as platforms for the representation of contrasting
      cultural elements. How they combine or conflict to affect the audience will be an important factor
      for the good candidate who will be aware of the audience’s response in a more detailed way than
      the credible candidate who is likely to make reference to the audience, but in a less strategic
      manner.

      Credible to good writing will be legible and clear. The credible candidate will express ideas
      reasonably well. There may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary will be
      subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be appropriate but
      a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the written work of the
      good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure of the response.
                                             –5–                 N17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The excellent candidate will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a
powerful understanding of why the clash of cultures is important in a wider context of the novel and
how acting, staging, design and production effects combine to impact the audience. The candidate
will immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in the analysis of the
literature, focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question. Embedded quotation will
be used and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for illuminating reference. The
tone, mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the way the candidate addresses
the task of analyzing the passage in relation to the foci of the question. The essence of the work
will be captured in the quality of the writing as the challenge of staging it is taken up. Quotation
may also be used structurally in the response as a device that achieves transition between one
idea and another; it will be continually relevant to the question.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology that reflects an
understanding of both literature and performance. The candidate will make staging and
acting/action choices on the basis of conveying the range of meanings, both explicit and implicit, to
the passage in the chosen performance space for an audience. Communication for an audience
will be the agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding of the genre
and the possibilities inherent in the application of the production and design elements to the
staging concept. The candidate will be aware of the dramatic context and the possible resonance
and dramatic implications of the two cultures. The chosen performance space will be a location
where action and movement will combine with carefully directed presentational strategies to
register meaning and significance to an audience. The aesthetics of performance will be keenly
felt and the encouragement this question gives to a strong contrast will be explored on stage. The
use of lighting and sound may be enhancements to these effects, as may an appreciation of the
effect of make-up and costume for the actor.

The excellent candidate will demonstrate an individual “style of writing”, sentences will vary in
length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and ensure that its presentation
is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic elements in the text and staging
elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will present work that, while concise,
nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the chosen passage in relation to the
subject of the question, namely the clash of two cultures.
                                                   –6–                  N17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Credible to good responses to this question will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate
     to the question. They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the context of the
     novel; this may involve a summary of the details of the passage and their connection to the
     “change of atmosphere” which has impact on characters and/or events. Attention will be paid to
     the choices the question asks the candidate to make. There should be some detail on what the
     candidate understands by the term “atmosphere” and reference may well be made to changes to
     the tone and mood of the passage. The good candidate will already be narrowing his perspective
     around the consequences of a choice of passage that provides the “descriptive writing” which may
     trigger ideas for a staging an event or sequence of action that has “atmosphere” as a focus. The
     atmosphere evoked by the descriptive writing is also an important factor to bear in mind,
     especially, in how this might provide a prevailing mood or a range of moods as a setting for the
     staging for the change and how it effects the characters involved in it or affected by it.

     Credible to good responses will attempt to focus on the question but may not always succeed in
     doing so. They are likely to introduce references from the text. These will be general in character
     and may look closely at plot and events from the novel with a tendency to narrate these; the
     candidates who achieve “good” responses will be establishing some staging foci that are explicitly
     linked to the question. Given the likelihood of the emphasis being placed on the staging of
     descriptive writing, there is a strong design element in the question that will need to be continually
     addressed. The good candidate will be efficient in selecting the focus while the credible candidate
     will be less certain in this area. The atmosphere registered in the descriptive writing might be
     conveyed effectively through design elements like costume or stage pieces and sets and through
     production effects like lighting designs or soundscapes. Masks may play a role in establishing
     intrigue and special effects might be harnessed to convey a sense of the abnormal or supernatural.
     The precision and detail brought to bear on these elements and effects will distinguish credible
     from good and good from excellent candidates.

     Credible to good candidates will differ in how they demonstrate the movement between genres; the
     former may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, while the latter will be more liable
     to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose description might be transformed by
     staging. The examiner might reasonably expect to see lighting and sound being used in
     conjunction with staging to enhance these representations for an audience. Staging effects like
     design, lighting and sound are likely to be broadly drawn with more detail again registering a
     difference in the quality of the response between the credible and the good candidate. The good
     candidate will be able to see how use of the stage space can be manipulated to shape
     communication for an audience and will not perceive representation in an exclusively literal
     manner. Attention to the role of sound, lighting, costume and movement to convey dramatic
     intention will vary between the credible and good candidate. The question of how much acting is
     used to address the question depends on the selected passage. This might combine descriptions
     of a location or an atmosphere with evocation of character and action. It is likely that suspense will
     be used to affect the audience and rhythm, pace and timing may also be important factors brought
     into play by the good candidate.

     Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text. The
     overall concept for the staging’s may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements, as
     this grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced the work begins to characterize
     that expected from a good candidate. The ability to distinguish design features for their
     effectiveness in creating effects for the audience will probably be attainable by a credible candidate
     who will be able to “identify” a lighting or sound effect in a functional manner. The good candidate
     will be able to, at least, begin to fit effects into aesthetic or dramatic purposes and make them work
     as part of subtle or forceful communications for the audience. The exploration of set design or the
     positioning of a set piece or the focus on movement on stage in the exploration of character in
     action may all typify ways “into” the question so how this might be achieved through dramatic
     means will also distinguish the credible from the good candidate. The credible candidate will
     recognize the importance of the choice of performance space, the design features and/or the
     acting style as aids to communication. The good candidate will be capable of building these
                                              –7–                 N17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


elements dynamically through production ideas that succeed in conveying a strong dramatic sense
of a change of atmosphere for the audience.

Credible to good writing will be legible and clear with the credible candidate being able to express
ideas reasonably well, there may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary will
be subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be appropriate
but a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the written work of
the good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure of the response.

Excellent responses will choose a passage that is immediately suitable as a response to the
question. There will be a powerful understanding of why the passage is suitable and how it
conveys the changing atmosphere of the fictional world it is designed to evoke. The candidate will
immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in the analysis of the literature,
focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question. Embedded quotation will be used
and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for illuminating reference. The tone,
mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the way the candidate addresses the
task of dramatizing the atmosphere for the audience. The communication of meanings through
different approaches to staging will capture the potential of the chosen passage. The essence of
the work will capture the quality of the writing as the challenge of staging it is taken up. Quotation
may also be used structurally in the response as a device that achieves transition between one
idea and another. It will be continually relevant to the question. The excellent candidate is likely to
have a very clear purpose for the passage and have selected the specific kind of atmosphere to be
conveyed. The way staging effects, design and/or styles of acting combine to dramatize this for an
audience will be registered in concise language that reflects a dynamic approach to the task.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology that demonstrates a
sophisticated understanding of literature and performance. The candidate will make staging and
acting/action choices on the basis of conveying the intention of the author in the chosen
performance space for an audience. Therefore communication for an audience will be the agent of
staging ideas and these will reflect a refined understanding of the genre and the possibilities
inherent in the application of the production and design elements to the staging concept. The
candidate will be aware of the text as a fluid entity and the performance space as a location where
action and movement may combine to register meaning and intention for the audience. The
aesthetics of performance will be keenly felt through the candidate examining approaches to
designing the passage and the encouragement this question gives to the creation of interesting
performance spaces will not be neglected. The use of lighting and sound may be enhancements
to these effects, as may an appreciation of the effect of make-up, masks and costume for the
actors. There may well be a connection established between the performance space, the actors
and the design features of the staging. The dramatization will be carefully paced in order to
maximize tension, shock or suspense for the audience if the chosen register calls for this.

The excellent candidate will demonstrate an individual “style of writing”, sentences will vary in
length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and ensure that its presentation
is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic elements in the text and staging
elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will present work that, while concise,
nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the chosen passage.
                                                   –8–                  N17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Credible to good responses to this question will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate
     to the question. They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the context of the
     novel; this may involve a summary of the details of the passage and a synopsis of the comic
     features inherent to the dramatic situation. Attention will be paid to the choice the question asks
     the candidate to make. The specificity of the comic treatment and the detail associated to it in the
     passage will be only be partially noted by the credible candidate. By comparison, the good
     candidate will be more in control of this material. The good candidate, in contextualizing the
     passage, will demonstrate its comic potential. This credible candidate will register this less
     convincingly.

     Credible to good responses will vary on what aspects of staging, acting and design effects the
     candidate focuses on. This makes for an open-ended approach to these elements. The examiner
     may expect the candidate to designate a performance space and explore how design elements
     and acting skills might best convey the entertainment value of the comic situation. The credible
     candidate will tend to identify broader effects and possibilities, while the good candidate will focus
     on specifics through analysis of the scene. A focus on what constitutes humor in the comic
     situation that is being dramatized is important and the good candidate will convey an
     understanding of how this humor might be conveyed through the use of theatrical elements. A
     credible candidate will be less assured in doing this. A sense for the pace of the scene, for stark
     incongruities, for status games and quick transactions and for farcical action that varies between
     frenetic movement and stasis may all be used as staging ploys by the candidate with varying levels
     of effectiveness.

     The credible candidate may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, while the good
     candidate will be more liable to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose
     description might be transformed into a stage language that reflects not only the comic situation,
     but will also go some way to capturing its dramatic significance through the design and
     performance choices made by the candidate. Staging effects like lighting and sound and use of
     space and acting are likely to be broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in
     the quality of the response from the credible to good candidate. Design elements will be
     distinguished using the same criterion. The good candidates will be able to see how use of the
     stage space can be manipulated by the actor to shape communication for an audience and will not
     perceive representation in an exclusively literal manner. They will also be able to move beyond
     simple identifications of acting style to how style may function in performance to entertain an
     audience. Strategic manipulation of the audience can be an important part of the task.

     Credible to good writing will be legible and clear with the credible candidate being able to express
     ideas reasonably well. There may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary
     will be subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be
     appropriate but a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the
     written work of the good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure
     of the response.

     Excellent responses will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a powerful
     understanding of why the chosen situation is comic and what can be drawn from it by way of
     humor to entertain an audience. The candidate will immediately focus on key detail and show an
     ability to be selective in the analysis of the literature, focusing only on the material that is
     responsive to the question. Embedded quotation will be used and this will allow both for a more
     concise writing style and for illuminating reference. The tone, mood and the vitality of the text will
     be captured by the way the candidate addresses the task of dealing with the question. Quotation
     may also be used structurally in the response as a compositional device that achieves transition
     between one idea and another; it will be continually relevant to the question.

     Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology. The candidate will make
     staging choices, beginning with the stage design for which there will be justification. The
     communication for an audience will be the agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a
                                            –9–                  N17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


sophisticated understanding of the genre and the possibilities inherent in the application of the
performance and design elements to the staging concept used for the dramatization of the chosen
theme. The candidate will be aware of the text as a fluid entity and the stage as a location where
design and action will combine to register meaning for an audience. Approaches to staging which
clearly dramatize the comic elements mentioned before will be confident and assured. The
candidate will demonstrate a control of the medium and find entertaining ways to register the comic
potential of the passage on stage.

The excellent candidate will convey ideas and proposals in an individual “style of writing”,
sentences will vary in length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and
ensure that its presentation is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic
elements in the text and staging elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will
present work that, while concise, nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the
chosen passage.
