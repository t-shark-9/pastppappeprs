Answer one question. Refer closely to the works of at least two poets you have studied.

1.   Poetry sometimes aims to quiet our fears about the present or the future, or alternatively, to
     intensify them. In what ways and with what success have at least two poets you have studied
     addressed such fears or anxieties?


2.   “Structure matters!” The way a poet structures thoughts and feelings can either engage the reader
     or cause a loss of interest. Show how at least two poets you have studied have used their choice
     of arrangements, both in words and visual effect, to ensure your interest or not.


3.   “Some poets seek to portray; others seek to persuade.” In the work of at least two poets you have
     studied, explore the ways in which you have observed the intent to persuade and how you have
     responded positively or negatively.


4.   “The imagination seeks to see the world through resemblances.” In the work of at least two poets
     you have studied, demonstrate how they have sought to clarify and express their way of seeing the
     world by including various forms of comparison.


5.   A sense of invisible forces or entities is sometimes explored in poetry. In the work of at least two
     poets you have studied, show how poets have created and used such elements to add a sense of
     mystery or nostalgia.


6.   What are often called “domestic matters” can form the basis of poems in which a poet builds a
     compelling portrait or reflects on these areas of life. In the work of at least two poets you have
     studied, explore the way such aspects as marriage, housekeeping, being part of a family, etc, have
     effectively shaped poetic materials and attitudes.
