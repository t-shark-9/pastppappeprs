                            Words are dangerous, especially
                            The simple kind you leave behind for others,
                            For undesirable relatives and assorted purposes.
                            They are understood simply, edited,
                        5   Taken with a kind of air, a careful disregard:
                            Their plainness complicates.

                            When you say Tell him please
                            That the anger has come to pass1
                            That friendship is not maimed...or
                       10   Please do come but after the
                            Fever has been put aside...
                            When you mean to be polite,
                            Careful, explicit, considerate, circumspect,
                            Adopting the proper tone,
                       15   You are likely to be quoted as saying
                            He won’t...

                            Words are neither valid, merciful nor bad,
                            In themselves, nothing unless used, urged,
                            Imported into dialogue,
                       20   Becoming part-anger, part-laughter, bruised,
                            Adding to the mood and gesture.

                            Words are words. Except for us
                            They are not personalities.
                            We make them into poems.

         Eight Hallmarks of a Healthy Communication Culture




         Every company has not only a corporate culture—with many subcultures—but also its own
         culture of communication. By culture of communication, we mean the particular way people
         customarily share and interpret information and ideas.

         A healthy communication culture has eight hallmarks that just coincidentally begin with the same
    5    letter: clear, credible, compelling (or cogent), constructive, continuous, collaborative, civil, and
         concise.

         Let’s briefly explore each of those eight hallmarks.

         Clear. You may think it is a simple thing to say what you mean. Unfortunately it is not.
         Strunk & White, the great arbiters of English composition, warned writers they were probably
  10     being unclear even when they thought they were being perfectly clear. (That’s why you should
         always let an important document or email “age” for a day before editing it and sending it.)
         This is especially true of corporate communication, which can be filled with jargon, spin, and
         arcane abbreviations.

         Credible. The legendary actor George Burns once advised young actors: If you can fake
  15     sincerity, you can fake anything. For many companies, credibility is something either to fake or
         to ignore and neglect altogether. It is one thing when the left hand doesn’t know what the right
         hand is doing; that happens. A deliberate and coordinated sleight of both hands2 is something
         altogether different, and not nearly so forgivable. When the deception involves employees,
         whose work is critical to any organization’s mission, it is a self-inflicted wound.
                                                       –9–                   N17/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

     20    Compelling (or Cogent). Official corporate pronouncements often strive to be inoffensive and
           polite. That’s fine as far as it goes, but if they achieve that goal by deliberately being indirect
           and ambiguous, it isn’t fine at all. That comes at the expense of coherence. Moreover, they
           frequently resort to the passive voice, which drains much of the energy out of communication.
           Because good communication functions as the energy of leadership, this represents a
     25    huge sacrifice.

           Constructive. The whole point of strategic communication is to support the execution of a
           strategy (or the implementation of a program, a policy, a process, or a priority). It is all about
           getting things done, about creating something new or bigger or better. Thus the communication
           should be constructive, and to do that it must be inclusive and relevant. It should have enough
     30    of the big picture to be inspiring and enough detail to be instructive and helpful.

           Continuous. Communication around business strategy should look, sound, and feel more like
           a rainforest than a cascade. It should be a steady drizzle or mist of information, punctuated by
           occasional thunderstorms. There should be few, if any, moments when employees feel they
           are kept in the dark. It is especially harmful to put front-line supervisors in a position where
     35    they are learning about an impending decision or policy by the grapevine3 or from subordinate
           employees.

           Collaborative. The best communication is a dialogue and a discussion, not a monologue or
           a lecture. It is an exchange of information, intuition, and ideas. Senior management in
           particular should be receptive to learning what employees in ground-level positions (the factory
     40    floor, the retail showroom, the warehouse, the lab) are observing and experiencing.
           This information is gold.

           Civil. People who spend so much time together, day after day and week after week, need to
           respect one another. There are big differences between delivering a message with an air of
           respect and reason and delivering the same message with disrespect and intimidation, fear, or
     45    arrogance. By the same token, there is a big difference between employees who speak up and
           share their observations—again, with respect and reason—and those who would just as soon
           deny that information to management out of spite.

           Concise. This is just a matter of getting to the point. Everyone is busy. Good communication
           respects time, so that people can meet their commitments and still get home to their families
     50    and activities. That isn’t to say there is no place for impromptu conversations or for
           non-strategic, water-cooler chit-chat about families, hobbies, and so forth; to the contrary, there
           is, and those conversations will properly meander. But the presentation of business information
           should be straightforward, timely, and compact.

           So that’s it: clear, credible, compelling (or cogent), constructive, continuous, collaborative, civil,
     55    and concise. Make certain your communication culture incorporates these eight hallmarks, and
           you will notice and like the results.
