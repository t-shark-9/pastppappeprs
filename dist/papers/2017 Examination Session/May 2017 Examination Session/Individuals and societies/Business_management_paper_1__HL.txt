Answer two questions from this section.

1.   (a)   With reference to Utopia, describe the importance of two external stakeholders
           (line 12).                                                                               [4]

2.   (a)   With reference to JAC, describe two advantages of internal growth (line 52).             [4]

     (b)   With reference to John, explain the key functions of management.                         [6]


3.   (a)   With reference to Utopia, describe two suitable sources of finance for the 3D printers
           (line 60).                                                                               [4]

                                              Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   Paul’s idea for 3D printing takes Utopia into a secondary sector activity that contrasts with
     its usual tertiary sector activities. In order to produce a sufficient number of souvenirs,
     Utopia would need to buy ten 3D printers at $1000 each. There would be material costs
     and significant operating costs, as well as time and additional labour. Paul has produced a
     net cash flow forecast for the project (Table 1) assuming a five year life for the printers. He
     likes the idea that each souvenir produced could be of a unique design and personalized.
     Some of the materials would be from recycled plastics obtained from waste at the resort.
     This example of lean production would be good for the resort’s environment and for Utopia’s
     caring image. The cost of recycling is uncertain.

     Liza does not like the idea of 3D printing. She is concerned that the souvenirs may damage
     Utopia’s exclusive brand. She can see difficulties with recruiting someone with both the
     necessary IT skills and the ability to make decisions about which types of souvenirs to
     produce. She is particularly concerned about the impact on Utopia’s current suppliers of
     souvenirs. She thinks that 3D printing is more suited to larger organizations.

     John believes that the 3D printing technology will bring other benefits to his businesses.
     He can imagine decorations and other useful items being produced for the resort and its
     offices.


     (a)    Describe one method of lean production other than recycling.                                [2]

     (b)    With reference to Utopia, explain two benefits of having a strong brand.                    [4]

     (c)    Using information from Table 1 and Table 2, calculate the net present value (NPV) for
            the 3D printing project.                                                                    [4]

     (d)    Using information from the case study, additional information above and your results
            from part (c), discuss whether Utopia should proceed with the 3D printing project.         [10]

                                                Section C

Answer the following question.

5.   John felt that the decision about expanding JAC into the international markets of the Pacific
     Islands did not depend on the decision about the 3D printing project. However, he decided
     that they should not enter the markets at the same time, so they had to choose between
     starting with Fiji, Samoa or New Zealand. John stressed to Liza that, as with the construction
     of the Utopia villas, the choice of a new international market should strongly consider cultural
     influences and norms. For this reason, John favoured Fiji and Samoa over New Zealand,
     arguing that they are more culturally similar to Ratu. However, the final decision not being
     made, John asked Liza to do some more research into the idea and into the two markets.
     The results of her ideas are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3.

involved in the decision.

      Using the case study and the additional information on pages 4 and 5, recommend which
      of the Pacific Island markets JAC should enter. Completing the decision tree and using the
      results could help you in your answer.                                                            [20]
