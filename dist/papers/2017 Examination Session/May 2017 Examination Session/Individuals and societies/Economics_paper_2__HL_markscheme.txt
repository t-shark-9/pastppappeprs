                      An explanation that it is one of the following:
                      • an increase in real GDP
                      • an increase in the real value of output (over time)
                      • an increase in potential output.

                  N.B. The term “over time” is not necessary for [2].

(b)   Using an international trade diagram, explain the impact on the Kenyan
      government of implementing a tariff on steel imports.                                    [4]

                upwards of the world supply curve, with enough labelling so that
                it is possible to indicate, in some way, the area representing
                government revenue or for providing an explanation that the
                tariff causes the world supply curve to shift upwards (or the tariff
                causes the price to rise), creating government revenue [1] with
                the amount referenced to the diagram [2].
       2        There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.           3–4
                For drawing a correctly labelled tariff diagram showing a shift
                upwards of the world supply curve (with enough labelling so that
                it is possible to indicate, in some way, the area representing
                government revenue) and for providing an explanation that the
                tariff causes the world supply curve to shift upwards (or the tariff
                causes the price to rise), creating government revenue [1] with
                the amount referenced to the diagram [2].

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of [3].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      The world supply curve must be labelled Sw, or Sworld. A title is not necessary.

                of the AD curve to the right and an increase in the real GDP or
                for providing an explanation that economic growth in
                neighbouring countries is likely to lead to an increase in Kenyan
                exports, leading to an increase in AD and real GDP.
       2        There is a correct diagram and an accurate written response.           3–4
                For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift
                of the AD curve to the right and an increase in the real GDP and
                for providing an explanation that economic growth in
                neighbouring countries is likely to lead to an increase in Kenyan
                exports, leading to an increase in AD and real GDP.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of [3].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level or average price level.
      The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real national
      output, national income, or GDP. A title is not necessary.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • definition of protectionist measures.

      Strengths of protectionist measures:
      • infant industry argument – allows steel and iron industry time to become
         internationally competitive, which can bring about growth
      • helps diversify economy away from over reliance on primary exports, which is
         necessary for sustained growth (paragraph )
      • create more jobs thus increase consumption, AD and growth (+ diagram)
         (paragraph )
      • raises government revenue (paragraph ) that can be invested by the
         government in ways that will promote growth
      • if imports are being unfairly subsidized, protectionism will level the playing field
         (paragraph )
      • can help correct the persistent current account deficit, which is hindering growth
         (paragraph ).

Limitations of protectionist measures:
• does not encourage long term efficiency, which may be better achieved through
   deregulation (paragraph )
• inefficient allocation of resources argument
• protected industries can become over-reliant on government support and so may
   not contribute to economic growth
• politically difficult to remove protectionist measure once in place
• revenue from tariffs can be subject to corruption
• potential problems of retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, which could damage
   Kenya’s exports and thus threaten future growth
• removing barriers and deregulation (administrative barriers) rather than
   protectionism could encourage domestic entrepreneurship and FDI which will
   support growth
• tariffs increase “cost of doing business” (paragraph ) for those producers reliant
   on imported components
• higher prices on steel and iron which will increase input costs for construction and
   infrastructure projects – necessary for economic growth
• higher input costs may reduce SRAS, causing a reduction in real GDP,
   threatening growth
• to achieve growth, Kenya should be producing goods in which they have a
   comparative advantage, not in which they need protectionism.

Any reasonable discussion.

                For providing an accurate definition of price elasticity of demand
                (or formula) or for noting that demand for commodities tends to
                be inelastic and since prices of exports are falling, total revenue
                will be falling because the percentage change in quantity is less
                than the percentage change in price.

      An alternate approach would be to explain that improved infrastructure allows firms
      to make more efficient use of their factors of production, leading to increased
      production possibilities.

      For a PPC diagram, there must be two goods or groups of goods competing for the
      same resources on the axes. Good X and Good Y are appropriate, but simply X
      and Y are not sufficient.

        education and training, increased trade protection, access to micro-credit.

Benefits of government intervention:
• government spending on infrastructure – “upgrading infrastructure”
  (paragraph ) including power plants (paragraph ) which could lead to
  increased growth and can contribute to economic development
• “create new jobs” (paragraph ), more employment leads to economic growth /
  higher incomes, a reduction in the unemployment rate and thus contributes to
  economic development
• “educate one of the world's youngest workforces” (paragraph ), this would allow
  the young workforce to get better paid jobs and support their families better
• increased access to credit and micro-credit (paragraph ), this would allow
  entrepreneurs to take out loans that otherwise they may not have access to.
  Having access to credit might stimulate the number of small businesses in
  Indonesia (which “play a critical part in Indonesia’s economy”, paragraph ),
  allowing for increased incomes and standards of living
• increased trade protection (paragraph ) – this would allow domestic firms to set
  up, or survive; it protects already existing businesses from cheaper imports,
  allowing economic growth to happen; more employment contributes to economic
  development.

Concerns (weaknesses of) about government intervention:
• interventionist policies may lead to inefficiency, bureaucracy and corruption,
  which hinder economic growth and economic development, which the citizens are
  hoping the new president will reduce (paragraph )
• budget implications of increased government spending, with possible implications
  for future government spending on development objectives
• poor planning of project and no long-term plans.

Benefits of market-oriented policies:
• reducing red tape (paragraph ), less bureaucracy and deregulation might lead
  to more incentives to set up formal businesses, which may lead to economic
  growth and economic development (more jobs); more (foreign) investment
• tax cuts, tax incentives (paragraph ), industries like transport,
  telecommunications, metal production and agricultural processing, which are now
  promoted on a national scale, which may lead to economic growth and economic
  development (through more jobs)
• reducing corruption (paragraph ), reducing costs for individuals and firms, more
  opportunities for entrepreneurs, more formal businesses that pay tax.

Concerns (weaknesses of) about market-oriented policies:
• reducing fuel subsidies (paragraph ), allowing world prices to determine the
  price of fuel (which might be seen as a necessity in Indonesia for transport,
  cooking), likely will result in higher prices of this essential product. This could be
  problematic for the 28 million people in absolute poverty (Figure 1)
• (greater) inequality, which already exists (Figure 1)
• intervention may be necessary to provide merit goods, correct market failures,
  and reduce poverty but market-oriented policies may be needed to ensure a high
  enough rate of economic growth (which is already slow, paragraph ).

Any reasonable discussion.

               shift of the SRAS to the left and an increase in the price level or
               for an explanation that the falling value of the kwacha results in
               higher costs of imported factors of production and thus a fall in
               SRAS and thus (cost-push) inflation.

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level or APL.
      The horizontal axis may be real output, national output, real GDP, national income,
      Y or GDP. A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using a Lorenz curve diagram, explain the meaning of the different Gini
      coefficient values for Zambia and Malawi shown in Figure 1.                             [4]

                Malawi’s Gini coefficient is lower than Zambia’s Gini coefficient,
                which means that Malawi’s Lorenz curve is closer to the line of
                perfect equality and so income distribution is more equal.

      The two curves may be shown on one graph, or may be shown on two graphs.
      If using two graphs, it must be clear that Malawi’s curve is closer to the line of
      equality than Zambia’s.

      The vertical axis should be labelled cumulative % of income, or % of income and the
      horizontal axis should be cumulative % of population or % of population. A title is
      not necessary. There must be a diagonal line, but it is not a requirement that it is
      labelled. There should be labels to indicate the difference between the two Lorenz
      curves.

      Command term
      “Discuss” required candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of economic development.

      Possible positive consequences:
      • may have been instrumental in allowing Zambia to become both a middle-income
        and a medium human development country (paragraph )
      • Zambian HDI higher than that of the sub-Saharan average (Figure 1) even
        though its GNI per capita is lower. This suggests that its economic development
        might be benefitting from the economic growth
      • creation of jobs in the copper sector (paragraph ) leading to higher incomes
        and improved standards of living
      • generation of tax/government revenue (paragraph ), which may be used to
        finance development objectives (through spending on health, education and
        infrastructure)
      • attraction of FDI = strong economic growth (paragraph ), plus the theoretical
        benefits of FDI (increase in AD diagram, increase in LRAS diagram, jobs,
        government revenue, multiplier effects, training for workers) and the ways that
        these might impact upon economic development (increased incomes, improved
        skill levels, government revenue to finance development objectives,
        paragraph ).

Possible negative consequences:
• “resource curse” arguments
• while growth rates have been good, there is evidence to suggest that the benefits
  have not been shared equitably (paragraph , paragraph , Figure 1 with
  inequality and poverty data)
• vulnerable to price volatility (both demand and supply of copper likely to be
  inelastic, so a fall in demand from China leads to a significant fall in the price)
  (paragraph )
• falling price may lead to a fall in Zambia’s terms of trade since copper generates
  80 % of its export revenues. If the terms of trade deteriorate, the current account
  will worsen since demand for copper is likely to be inelastic
• copper mining uses a lot of hydropower, possibly diverting its use from
  households and other industries
• the currency is vulnerable to changes in the price of copper
• threat to government budget when the price falls making it difficult for the
  government to finance its development objectives
• fluctuating revenues make it difficult for governments to plan for spending on
  development objectives
• copper mining may generate external costs and represent a threat to sustainable
  development (negative externalities of production diagram).

Any reasonable discussion.
