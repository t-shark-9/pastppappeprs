                                    Section 1: Military leaders
For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source B, were the problems facing the Mongols in launching an attack
           against the Jin?                                                                        [3]

           •   The Jin Emperor had sufficient manpower to assemble a large army.
           •   Jin cities were well fortified.
           •   The attack was logistically complex.
           •   A substantial distance had to be traversed.


The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each relevant point up
to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source D suggest about the Mongol battles with the Jin?                          [2]

           • The Mongols used a range of weapons in combat.
           • The Mongols used cavalry.
           • Battles took place in difficult terrain.


The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each relevant point up
to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source B
     for an historian studying the Mongol invasion of north China.                                    [4]

     Value:
     • The author is a professional historian so the book is likely to have been well researched; as a
       specialist in Chinese and Mongolian history he is likely to have detailed knowledge of the topic.
     • The source is from a book on Genghis Khan, one of the key actors in the Mongol invasion of
       north China.
     • The source discusses, and provides information on, the actions of the Mongols and the actions
       of the Chinese Jin army.

     Limitations:
     • The source was written almost 800 years after the event it describes, so it may have been more
       difficult to find source material.
     • The book is on Genghis Khan rather than specifically on the Mongol invasion of China, so the
       material offered on the invasion itself may be limited.
     • The mention of the word “resurrection” in the title of the book, a biography, may suggest that the
       author has placed too much emphasis on the achievements of Genghis Khan.

The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. The focus of the question is on the
value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2].
Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the
value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or
the limitations.

  5–6          • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
  3–4          • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast, although
                 these points may lack clarity.
     1–2       • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or general
                 comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison or of contrast.
      0        • The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and award credit
wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what candidates may elect
to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
required.

          Indicative content

          Comparisons:
          • Both sources highlight that the Jin were defeated despite having strong fortifications/defences.
          • Both sources comment on the army pretending to retreat in order to draw out the defenders and
            then to attack them.
          • Both sources highlight Genghis Khan’s role in sending Jebe to attack the Jin and in leading the
            main section of the Mongol army.

          Contrasts:
          • Source C blames Chih-Chung for Jin defeats whereas Source A indicates that the strengths of
            Genghis Khan and the Mongols are the reason for the outcome.
          • Source C comments on Genghis Khan “accepting the surrender” of other fortresses whereas
            Source A presents him as having a more active fighting role in additional attacks after Jebe’s
            victory.
          • Source A comments on the Jin army retreating whereas Source C comments on the Jin army
            surrendering.

4.        Using the sources and your own knowledge, examine the view that Jin mistakes were the main
          reason for Genghis Khan’s success in China.                                                [9]

to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is
required. While it is expected that there will be coverage of at least two of the sources, candidates are
not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

Indicative content

Source A                  Highlights the skills and tactics of Jebe, his use of the pretended retreat, which
                          drew the Jin from well-fortified positions he could not attack. It also comments on
                          the role of Genghis in the follow up.

Source B                  Argues that Mongol planning was essential to their success, overcoming water
                          shortages by spreading out and their use of messengers. However, it also
                          comments on Jin weakness, their failure to launch a surprise attack and the
                          betrayal by the Jin envoy.

Source C                  Suggests that the timidity of the Jin emperor was to blame and that his tactics
                          were a contributing factor as he delayed his response for too long. It also
                          mentions the use of the pretended retreat by the Mongols.

Source D                  The picture suggests the skill of the Mongol cavalry as they deal with the harsh
                          terrain. It also highlights the Mongols’ abilities with weapons such as swords and
                          bows.

Own knowledge   Candidates may consider the fierce reputation of the Mongols, which caused
                some to change sides. There may be some discussion of the “alliances” that the
                Mongols had built up with other groups, such as the Ongud, which weakened the
                position of the Jin. There may be discussion of the other attacks that the Jin
                were facing, such as the attack on the Song in 1216 that weakened their forces.
                Some candidates may consider the leadership skills of Genghis or the military
                ability of his commanders (in addition to Jebe).

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

5.   (a)   How, according to Source F, did the treaty of Granada affect the relationship between the
           Granadans and the queen and king of Castile and Aragon?                                   [3]

           •   Muslims would become vassals.
           •   Muslims would be able to retain their property.
           •   The Catholic monarchs would protect Muslims from harm.
           •   Muslims would be subject to taxation.


The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each relevant point up
to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source H suggest about the political relations between Muslim and Christian
           rulers?                                                                                    [2]

           • Muslim rulers were subservient to Christian rulers.
           • There was an economic aspect to the political relationship.
           • The nature of this relationship had existed for several hundred years.

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of
     Source F for an historian studying the final years of the Muslim kingdom of Granada.              [4]

     Value:
     • This is an official source that shows some of the terms of the Treaty of Granada signed in 1491
       between Abu Abdallah, sultan of Granada, and Isabella and Ferdinand, Queen and King of
       Castile and Aragon.
     • It clearly outlines the relationship between Granada, Castile and Aragon. Its purpose was to
       state and ensure the rights reserved to the Muslim population of Granada.
     • It demonstrates the subservient position of the Muslim population in relation to the Christian
       queen and king.

     Limitations:
     • As the Muslims had surrendered to the Christians, the source may lack the Muslim perspective
       of the treaty.
     • It does not outline the extent to which the terms were respected. It lacks historical hindsight.
     • Because it is an official document issued by the royal family, it is not possible to determine how
       it was received by other sectors of society such as the Church.

The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. The focus of the question is on the
value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2].
Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the
value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or
the limitations.

7.        Compare and contrast what Sources E and G reveal about the obligations of the Muslims to
          the Christian kings.                                                                          [6]

          Indicative content

          Comparisons:
          • Both sources reveal there were vassal relationships between the rulers of Granada and Castile.
          • Both sources focus on the parias the Muslim rulers must pay to Christian kings and consider
            them counterproductive.
          • Both sources mention other obligations due by Muslim rulers to Christian kings like the
            attendance at Christian courts and the sending of military contingents.

          Contrasts:
          • Source G indicates the payment and vassalage had a negative impact in Granada because they
            spoke of its inferiority regarding Castile whereas Source E ascribes the negative impact of
            payment and vassalage to the contradiction they posed to the principles of Islamic law.
          • Source G is more focused on the problems caused by the vassalage and the payments
            whereas Source E mentions that the vassalage at least enabled Granada to survive.
          • Source E states that the obligations led Muslims fighting against fellow Muslims, whereas
            Source G suggests that obligations only generated conflicts between Castile and Granada.

Indicative content


Source E                   Indicates that different pacts were signed (from truces to treaties of vassalage)
                           that allowed the Kingdom of Granada to survive. It also suggests the role of
                           other contributing factors in the fall of Granada, such as the demand for military
                           contingents to fight against fellow Muslims.

Source F                   The source demonstrates the undermining of the kingdom of Granada as an
                           independent state. It refers to, for example, the ongoing financial burden and the
                           vassalage of Granadans. It also states the taxes they must pay.

Source G                   Mentions the conflicts arising by the payment of tributes. The source indicates
                           that these payments led to a vassal relation between a Muslim ruler and a
                           Christian king.

Source H                   Depicts the submission of Muslim rulers to Christian authorities when paying the
                           parias and the goods delivered.

Own knowledge   Candidates may offer additional details on the system of parias and vassalage,
                which forced Muslims to collaborate with forces and money. These duties were
                onerous and, in the end, Muslim rulers had to levy new taxes on their own
                people. Strictly speaking, this policy was in contradiction with the Qur’an,
                according to which a Muslim had only to pay the zakat tax. However, Muslim
                states had always raised more taxes than simply the zakat. More important was
                the un-Islamic principle that Muslims should pay tribute to any ruler who was not
                a Muslim. Any rise in the amount of taxes was regarded as a policy out of the
                norm and the ruler, seen as unworthy. The rise in the parias was especially hard
                for the Granadan economy, since enemies surrounded the territory. They also
                faced an internal split (fitna) within the Nasrid camp: Abu al-Hasan had his capital
                in Malaga, while Abu Abdallah established his in Granada. The changes in the
                Christian context also affected Granada. The marriage between Isabella of
                Castile and Ferdinand of Aragon resulted in the union of two powerful kingdoms
                with an aim of unifying the entire Iberian Peninsula. From 1483 until the
                capitulation of Granada they launched several campaigns to gain fortresses,
                combining this with a strategy of burning and destroying the lands. In the end,
                the isolation of Abu Abdallah, who had no support (neither internally nor from the
                Marinid dynasty in North Africa), led to his capitulation.

9.   (a)   What, according to Source K, were the factors contributing to tensions between Japan
           and the US?                                                                                [3]

           •   The Tripartite Pact worsened relations between the US and Japan.
           •   Japan demanded permission to move troops to Indochina.
           •   The US oil embargo and freezing of Japanese assets increased tensions.
           •   Officers in the Japanese army resolved to go to war because of the oil embargo.

neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each relevant point up
to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   What does Source L suggest about Japanese expansion?                                       [2]

           • Japan was motivated by its declining oil reserves.
           • Japan had identified the Dutch East Indies as a target for accessing oil.
           • Japan was prepared to use force.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source K
      for an historian studying the tensions between the US and Japan.                                 [4]

      Value:
      • The source was written in 1968 and therefore offers a retrospective view within a generation of
        the actual events.
      • It offers detailed analysis of US-Japanese relations between 1938 and 1941 with focus on the
        reasons for the escalation of tensions.
      • The purpose is to analyse in depth the growth of tensions between Japan and the US. Because
        it is an article written by a Japanese academic, it is likely to offer a well-informed Japanese
        perspective of events.

      Limitations:
      • Because it discusses a very narrow period of time, it does not consider the tensions between
        the US and Japan between 1931 and 1937.
      • Focused on the deterrent policy, it doesn’t place US-Japanese relations in the broader context
        of the Second World War.
      • The author's nationality may have influenced his perspective of events.

The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. The focus of the question is on the
value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2].
Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the
value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or
the limitations.

          Indicative content

          Comparisons:
          • Both sources show Japan was dependent on foreign oil supplies.
          • Both sources suggest that the Japanese military was prepared to go to war against the US.
          • Both sources show that a diplomatic solution was unlikely, for example, because of forceful US
            responses such as imposing the oil embargo.

          Contrasts:
          • Source I claims that in 1941 the Japanese were still deciding between agreeing to US
            conditions in China or using force whereas Source J claims war might be difficult to avoid by
            then.
          • Source I suggests Japan was acting aggressively to obtain resources whereas Source J claims
            it was also responding to the military preparations and strengthening of the defences of Britain
            and the US in the Far East.
          • Source I states the Japanese diplomats and the Japanese military had opposing views as to
            how to address relations with the US whereas Source J does not suggest the existence of
            conflicting views among the Japanese authorities.

Indicative content

Source I                  The fact that Japanese diplomats were considering a partial withdrawal from
                          China could indicate their fear of the US. Japan's plans for a pre-emptive strike
                          against the US and its allies may be interpreted by some candidates as evidence
                          that the Japanese did not fear to provoke war against the US. Roosevelt's
                          decision to impose an oil embargo on Japan may be interpreted as a response to
                          US fear of Japanese hegemony in Asia.

Source J                  The Japanese military interpreted US and British defence of their military
                          installations as a threat to Japanese security. It also feared the strengthening of
                          US and British military preparations if war was postponed. Japan feared the
                          depletion of its own resources.
                                          – 19 –               M17/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source K        The source suggests that the US did not fear Japan as Roosevelt claimed he
                would not be intimidated by Japan. This is supported by the reference to US
                citizens increasingly supporting strong action against Japan. Also, the signing of
                the Tripartite Pact did not deter the US. Japanese officers feared that the
                embargo could turn the Japanese navy into a “paper navy”. This implies it could
                cease to be seen as a threat by the US and its allies.

Source L        It depicts the Japanese, ready to use military force because they were worried
                about the oil reserves.

Own knowledge   Candidates may argue that the US became increasingly fearful of Japan with the
                invasion of Manchuria (1931) and the withdrawal of Japan from the League of
                Nations. Although at the time US response was limited to moral denunciation,
                the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937 increased fears for US national
                security. Additionally, the Japanese naval expansion and the sinking of the
                American gunboat USS Panay (1937) contributed to the escalation of tensions.
                Japan's intention to implement the “Southern advance” and to mobilize bombers
                to attack Burma, Malaya and possibly the Philippines raised alarm in the US.
                Also, Japan feared the increasing involvement of the US in the Sino-Japanese
                War, such as financial and military aid to the Guomindang (GMD) was prolonging
                the war and pushing the Japanese economy to the limit. Candidates may offer
                additional material on economic factors, such as the negative impact on Japan's
                economy of the US protective tariffs or Roosevelt's decision in 1939 not to renew
                the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. These contributed to a negative
                perception of the US and to the rise of Japanese nationalism.
                Candidates may also argue that it was not only mutual fear that increased
                tensions between the US and Japan and refer to the fear of Soviet influence in
                China. The US began to move away from its isolationist policy more openly after
                1938 and by late 1941 some perceived the war against Japan as inevitable.
                Candidates may also refer to the failure of diplomatic negotiations (such as the
                US rejection of a partial Japanese withdrawal from China; the Hull note), the rise
                of Japanese militarism, Japanese alliances with Germany and Italy and the
                influence on Japan of Nazi victories in Europe.

            • The Supreme Court approved gradualism.
            • There were fears that desegregation may be applied inconsistently.
            • It was believed by some law-makers that desegregation may be delayed for a substantial
              period.
            • Black leaders believed that it indicated the Supreme Court’s willingness to engage with
              the wishes of southern segregationists.

14.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source O
      for an historian studying Brown v Board of Education (1954).                                     [4]

      Value:
      • It is the expression of a contemporary opinion and therefore can give an insight into feelings at
        the time.
      • To persuade people to oppose the Brown v Board of Education decision by the Supreme Court,
        his intention demonstrates the strength of feeling in favour of the retention of segregation.
      • The source reveals the arguments deployed by a leading supporter of segregation.

      Limitations:
      • The author was a leader of the pro-segregation White Citizens’ Council movement and
        therefore the pamphlet is intended to sway public opinion and whip up opposition to the
        Supreme Court’s judgment.
      • The extract’s inclusion of emotive language suggests the need for caution in interpreting this
        source.
      • Because the source was written shortly after the decision was taken, it cannot show its long-
        term impact.

The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses. It is
neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. The focus of the question is on the
value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations are discussed, award a maximum of [2].
Origin, purpose and content should be used as supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the
value and limitations. For [4] there must be at least one reference to each of them in either the value or
the limitations.

          Indicative content

          Comparisons:
          • Both sources reveal the existence of diverse attitudes among the members of the judicial
            system regarding the question of desegregation of schooling in the US.
          • Both sources demonstrate the existence of strong views on the issue of segregation in schools.
          • Both sources claim that the proposals therein would achieve the best possible educational
            outcome for students in public schools.
          • Both sources claim that their attitudes are derived from moral principles.

          Contrasts:
          • Source M is completely in favour of desegregation in schools whereas Source O is strongly
            opposed to racial mixing.
          • Source M’s views are based on an assumption that whites and blacks are fundamentally equal
            and therefore schools should be integrated whereas Source O’s argument is based on a belief
            that it is unnatural and ungodly to mix the races.

Indicative content

Source M                  This source seeks to justify the federal policy of desegregation by asserting the
                          principle of “separate but equal” is wrong and unequal. However, it can provide
                          no indication of compliance.

Source N                  This source suggests that opposition to desegregation was limited and peaceful.

Source O                  This source expresses opposition to the Supreme Court ruling. It is seeking to
                          whip up opposition to desegregation in schools. The source shows that there
                          was likely to be resistance to desegregation in the south.

Source P                  This source shows that the 1954 Brown v Board of Education was likely to be
                          ineffective in the southern states because in Brown II 1955 the Supreme Court
                          ruled that school desegregation need not be applied immediately, and it gave
                          local judges the power to decide when it would be feasible to do so.

Own knowledge   By 1956 250,000 people had joined the White Citizens’ Councils to demand
                continued segregation, and the Southern Manifesto 1956—signed by southern
                Congressmen—denounced the Brown ruling and asserted the right of southern
                states to maintain segregation in accordance with the doctrine of “separate but
                equal”. Southern state governments, southern judges and southern police used
                their powers to intimidate campaigners who sought to bring segregation to an
                end. The equation by segregationists of the demand for civil rights with
                “communism” (at a time during the Cold War of particularly acute fears of
                communist intentions), the association of the Brown ruling with the imposition of
                overweening federal power at the expense of states’ rights may also be
                mentioned. Answers may also refer to the events at Little Rock, Arkansas in
                1957.

17.   (a)   How, according to Source Q, were Albanians portrayed by Serbian propaganda?               [3]

            •   As a danger to the Serbs in Kosovo.
            •   Albanian men were portrayed as being violent to women.
            •   Albanian women were portrayed as “baby factories.”

            • Most perceptions were negative.
            • Many of the attributes given aligned with stereotypes.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source S
      for an historian studying the rise of ethnic tensions between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians

      Value:
      • It is a testimony from a Serb who cited hostility between Serbs and Albanians for the reason for
        his emigration.
      • The source offers insight into Serbian perspectives on the causes of the rise of ethnic
        nationalism.
      • In an interview with an outsider, in this case an American researcher, Bosko may have felt able
        to reveal his true feelings.

      Limitations:
      • As a testimony offered in 1995, his views were an immediate response to an environment of
        ethnic tensions and nationalist propaganda and cannot help an historian’s understanding of the
        subsequent escalation of tensions.
      • As a testimony offered by a Serb who left Kosovo, his views may be influenced by a desire to
        victimize Serbs.
      • As a testimony offered to an American, his views may be exaggerated to attract foreign support
        and cannot help an historian’s understanding of the subsequent escalation of ethnic tensions.

          Comparisons:
          • Both sources suggest that Serbs felt insecure living side by side with Albanians, which
            contributed to Serbian emigration from Kosovo.
          • Both sources suggest that Serbs may have left Kosovo in search of better opportunities.
          • Both sources imply that the demographics of the Albanian population meant that the Serbs
            feared that they would be outnumbered.

          Contrasts:
          • Source S exclusively describes Albanian hostility to Serbs whereas Source T offers a more
            balanced account outlining Albanian fears.
          • Source S suggests that economic problems were restricted to Serbs living in Kosovo (for
            example, they were never given promotions while government was buying properties for
            Albanians in Kosovo) whereas Source T suggests that poverty and economic crisis were
            generalized in Kosovo and Yugoslavia.
          • Source T suggests that problems stemmed from poverty whereas Source S suggests that they
            also stemmed from an Albanian desire for ethnic cleansing.

Indicative content

Source Q                  Explains the rise of Serbian nationalism as promoted by political elites, in an
                          atmosphere of political and economic insecurity.

Source R                  Suggests that longstanding ethnic stereotypes held by the Serbs may have
                          contributed to the rise of ethnic nationalism. Thus, this source may be seen to
                          suggest that ethnic nationalism among the Serbs was on the rise from the 1980s.

Source S                  Suggests that Albanian violence against the Serbian population living in Kosovo
                          may have contributed to the rise of Serbian nationalism and may have allowed for
                          the “victimization ideology” to catch on. Kosovar governmental policies and
                          Albanian immigration into Kosovo may have encouraged the rise of Serbian
                          nationalism.

Source T        Explains the rise in ethnic tensions as a consequence of economic difficulties,
                coupled with the Albanian population explosion in Kosovo. Suggests that ethnic
                violence (perpetuated by both Albanians and Serbs) contributed to the rise of
                mutually exclusive nationalisms.

Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss the impact of the 1990 constitutional reform (which
                abolished Kosovo's autonomy) in pushing Kosovar Albanians into a more radical
                national spirit. Candidates may discuss the impact of legislation passed through
                1990-1992 to “Serbianize” Kosovo (restrictions over property of the land;
                dismissal of Albanians in the public sector, civil service and managerial jobs;
                purges of Albanians in the police force) in promoting Albanian nationalism within
                Kosovo. Candidates may also discuss the impact of the imposition of a Serbian
                curriculum in Kosovo's educational institutions (including the Pristina University)
                in promoting Serbian nationalism among Kosovo's youth and further radicalising
                nationalistic Kosovar Albanians. Candidates may discuss the role of the parallel
                educational system, funded by Rugova's government-in-exile and international
                donations in promoting Albanian nationalism within Kosovo. Candidates may
                refer to the activities of the KLA as a provocation for Serbian retaliation (in an
                effort to garner foreign intervention). Candidates may also discuss the impact of
                the Yugoslav wars on the rise of ethnic nationalism.
