Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   A fall in income leads to a fall in demand for a good. Explain this relationship between
           the demand for the good and consumer income.                                               [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the consequences of rising incomes on service sector producers (such as
           hotels) and primary sector producers (such as rice farmers).                               [15]


2.   (a)   Explain why the consumption of merit goods, such as healthy food, can lead to positive
           externalities of consumption.                                                              [10]

     (b)   Discuss whether advertising by the government is the most appropriate way of
           increasing consumption of a merit good.                                                    [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain how aggregate demand might be affected by an increase in interest rates.         [10]

     (b)   Discuss whether the use of fiscal policy is the most effective way to bring an economy
           out of a recession.                                                                      [15]


4.   (a)   Explain the factors that cause demand-pull and cost-push inflation.                      [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that deflation will always be bad for an economy.                       [15]
