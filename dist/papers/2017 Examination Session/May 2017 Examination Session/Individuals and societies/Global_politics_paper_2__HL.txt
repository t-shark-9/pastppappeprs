Answer three questions, each from a different unit of study.

Each question is worth [25 marks].

Power, sovereignty and international relations

1.   Discuss reasons why the legitimacy of a state may need to be questioned.


2.   Examine the claim that economically powerful states are able to manipulate global governance
     institutions to their advantage.



Human rights

3.   Examine the claim that human rights as presented in treaties and covenants are not enforceable,
     and are therefore of little use to vulnerable populations.


4.   Discuss the claim that development in industrializing countries often violates universal rights to a
     clean environment and to the humanitarian treatment of labour.



Development

5.   Evaluate the claim that inequality encourages, rather than prevents, development.


6.   To what extent is the achievement of political and social stability essential for development?



Peace and conflict

7.   Compare and contrast two different approaches to peacemaking in one armed conflict you
     have studied.


8.   Discuss the view that peace is more than simply the absence of war.
