The following are the annotations available to use when marking responses.

General Marking Instructions


     Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through RM™ Assessor, by e-mail or telephone – if through RM™ Assessor
     or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise
     any queries they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader through RM™ Assessor or by e-mail
     at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking. For any queries regarding the use of RM™ Assessor, please contact
     emarking@ibo.org.


1.     Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.     Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

3.     Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves
       the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.     Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support
       your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
       additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.     Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.     Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question, use the “ZERO” annotation to award
       zero marks. Where a candidate has not attempted the part question, use the “SEEN” annotation to show you have looked at the question.
       RM™ Assessor will apply “NR” once you click complete.

7.     If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section of a paper, mark all the answers. RM™ Assessor
       will only award the highest mark or marks in line with the rubric.

8.     Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp “SEEN” on any additional pages that are
       blank or where the candidate has crossed out his/her work.

9.     Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they
       have got wrong. However, a mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
       text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject details: Nature of science standard level paper 2 markscheme

Candidates are required to answer all questions in Section A and Section B. Maximum total = 45 marks.

1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.
