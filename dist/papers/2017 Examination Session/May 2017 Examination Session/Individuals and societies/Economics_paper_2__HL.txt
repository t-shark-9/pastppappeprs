                              Relief as Kenya raises tariff for steel and iron imports

          Steel manufacturers in Kenya are set to benefit as the government moves to protect the local
           manufacturing industry from cheap steel and iron imports.

          In 2014 a government official announced an increased tariff on steel and iron imports.
           “Our steel mills are closing down due to unfair competition from cheaper imported iron
           and steel products,” he explained. “To protect and create more jobs in the iron and steel
           industries, tariffs on a wide range of imported iron and steel products will be increased
           from 0 % and 10 % to 25 %,” he said.  The government official further stated that as well as
           protecting the local industries from cheaper imports, the protectionist measures would raise
           an additional 2.6 billion Kenyan shillings (Kenya’s currency) annually in government revenue
           and support economic growth.

          The potential of local industries to expand and create jobs through trade has been held back
           by a number of administrative barriers.  The government remains focused on improving the
           business environment.  Over the past six months, the government has made it easier to
           register a company and trade across borders.  The time taken to move goods out of the main
           harbour has fallen sharply; non-tariff barriers such as roadblocks have also been reduced.  
           Importers of refined industrial sugar and wheat are also pleased after the government
           scrapped requirements to pay unnecessary administrative charges.

          However, there is a belief among manufacturers that there is a need for more deregulation to
           lower their costs of production and in effect reduce the cost of doing business.



                       Kenya sees gross domestic product (GDP) growth picking up but
                                           current account a concern

          Good economic growth rates in neighbouring countries like Uganda help to boost Kenyan
           exports, particularly for agriculture that makes up nearly a quarter of the Kenyan economy.
           The government suggests that the main risks to growth are the slow performance of
           developed economies that are key export markets for Kenyan goods and services, and
           Kenya’s large and persistent current account deficit of over 10 % of gross domestic product
           (GDP) in the last three years. This is a major concern for sustained economic growth and
           the value of the Kenyan shilling.

                                                Australia’s terms of trade

          Australia’s terms of trade fell sharply in the three months through to June 2015, the largest
           fall since the global financial crisis of 2008.  Official trade price data released by the
           Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) imply the terms of trade slumped by about 5.8 % from
           the March quarter. This may worsen the current account deficit.

          The terms of trade index is now significantly below its September 2011 peak because of
           ongoing falls in the prices of iron ore, coal and energy.  This is of critical importance given
           Australia’s growing reliance on income from exports of liquefied natural gas.

          “The golden age of commodity-driven income growth is long gone,” said an economist at
           Commonwealth Bank.  “The continued fall in the terms of trade reflects a pronounced fall in
           the purchasing power of Australian households and businesses. This has been a familiar
           theme over the past few years,” he said.  “Basically, falling commodity prices, namely iron
           ore and coal, have weighed heavily on export revenues and therefore, real gross national
           income growth.”

          Falling prices for exports are likely to damage the Australian government’s revenue
           expectations and to damage hopes for any rebound in economic strength in the near future.

          While the quantity of export shipments – chiefly iron ore – continues to break records,
           the revenues received by the nation’s biggest exporters continue to fall and several key
           economists fear that this may lead to a recession. This would break a 24-year run of
           unbroken economic growth.

          The Australian dollar’s 0.4 % fall in the exchange rate has done little to offset this effect,
           and the Reserve Bank of Australia continues to signal that it may take further measures to
           lower its current price of around AU$1 = US$0.73.

          The ongoing terms of trade collapse highlights the urgency for governments and companies
           to accelerate efforts at encouraging productivity.  The manager of the Reserve Bank of
           Australia said, “Australia’s dreadful productivity effort over the last decade was masked by
           the rapidly increasing terms of trade up until 2013. This kept our income growing but the
           weakness now is harshly exposed as commodity prices slide”.

3.       Study the extract and data below and answer the questions that follow.


                                              Indonesia’s economy

          Indonesians hope that their new president will be able to speed up reforms to stimulate
           economic growth and economic development.  These reforms include upgrading
           infrastructure, reducing red tape (excessive regulations) and reducing corruption.  It is also
           hoped that he will increase Indonesia’s global competitiveness, create new jobs and educate
           one of the world’s youngest workforces.

          Some government policies are already being implemented.  These include a large power
           plant construction programme, tax incentives to infant industries and tax cuts for industries
           like transport, telecommunications, metal production and agricultural processing. In addition,
           there has been a decision to reduce fuel subsidies in order to contribute funds towards the
           government’s record US$22 billion investment in infrastructure projects.  The subsidies had
           kept fuel prices low in a country where millions of people live in poverty.

          Despite the policies, Indonesia is struggling. Economic growth is slow and consumer
           confidence has deteriorated.  Indonesia’s main export commodities are coal, gold and palm
           oil, for which prices have fallen.  The inflation rate is 7.26 %, which is above the central
           bank’s target range of 3 to 5 %. Slower growth in the world economy makes the situation
           even worse for Indonesia’s struggling economy.

          Economists have said that the president must put his efforts into improving export
           competitiveness by making investments in education and training.

          The costs of doing business in Indonesia are high due to paperwork and confusing
           regulations.  The government has adopted policies to improve this.  These policies aim to
           create certainty and transparency for foreign investors and to empower small businesses,
           which play a critical part in Indonesia’s economy. Other policies, such as obtaining loans and
           encouraging micro-credit institutions, make it easier to gain access to credit.

          Trade protection and intervention are increasing as policymakers look to reduce imports,
           manage markets and promote domestic industries.

                                      Zambia’s reliance on copper exports

          Due to its economic success, Zambia has recently been classified as a middle-income
           country by the World Bank.  According to the United Nations (UN) classification, Zambia is in
           the medium human development category.  However, outside mining and export areas,
           the standard of living remains extremely low for Zambians.

          Zambia is one of the world’s top producers of copper. The country’s economy is reliant on
           copper exports, which make up 80 % of export earnings. Mining employs approximately
           90 000 people and contributes approximately 25–30 % of government revenue in Zambia.

          From 1997 to 2013, mining attracted US$12.6 billion in foreign direct investment, helping
           Zambia become one of Africa’s top economic performers, with average annual gross
           domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.4 % over the last decade.

          But now foreign and local businesses, including giant multinational mining corporations
           and small Zambian companies, have been hit hard by a rapid fall in the price of copper.  
           In January 2015, the price reached a five-and-a-half year low of approximately US$5353
           per tonne, below the estimated marginal cost of production of US$5500. Sadly for many
           domestic Zambian mines, their marginal costs are even higher because their mines are old,
           deep and expensive to operate.

          The fall in commodity prices is linked to the slowdown in Chinese economic growth. China
           accounts for 45 % of global copper consumption.  The situation highlights the vulnerability
           of Africa’s resource-dependent nations to changes in China’s economy. This is an indicator
           of the need for Zambia to diversify its economy away from primary commodities.  This will
           require the government to implement structural reforms to improve the supply side of the
           economy.

          Zambia is facing other economic problems as well as the falling price of copper. Most of
           Zambia’s electricity is produced from hydropower, but a severe drought has led to
           widespread power cuts, further threatening copper mining. The power problems and fall
           in copper prices have driven the Zambian kwacha (Zambia’s currency) to record lows due
           to a widespread selling of currencies which are linked to commodities. It lost 17 % of its
           value against the US dollar from December 2014 through to the end of March 2015.  
           The weakness of the Zambian kwacha is raising import costs and feeding into inflation.  

          The governing Patriotic Front party, which has been in power since 2011, attracted voters
           by promising to share the country’s mineral wealth more equitably, raise wages and improve
           infrastructure.  But now the government is struggling to maintain fiscal discipline, as the
           budget deficit has risen to an unacceptable level of approximately 10 % of GDP.

           There has also been much attention to the unsustainable mining practices of foreign and
            domestic mines in Zambia.  These have added to Zambia’s challenges of poverty alleviation,
            economic growth and economic development.
