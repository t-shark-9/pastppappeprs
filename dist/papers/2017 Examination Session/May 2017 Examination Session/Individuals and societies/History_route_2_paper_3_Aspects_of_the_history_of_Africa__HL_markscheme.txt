Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly.

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           • Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to support the
              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate
              and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
              historical context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.
           • The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical
              commentary, but this is not sustained.
  4–6      • The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While
              there may be an attempt to follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and
              coherence.
           • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.
                                            –6–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


1–3   • There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response is poorly
        structured or, where there is a recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on
        the task.
      • Little knowledge is present. Where specific examples are referred to, they are factually
        incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
      • The response contains little or no critical analysis. It may consist mostly of
        generalizations and poorly substantiated assertions.
0     • Response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

Section 1        The ‘Abbasid dynasty (750–1258)

1.   With reference to the period up to 900, discuss the consequences of the ‘Abbasid revolution.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the consequences of the ‘Abbasid
     revolution. Candidates may provide context by offering some background to the region prior to the
     revolution. They may identify an overarching consequence, such as the transformation of the
     Islamic world from a society dominated by Arabs to a more multi-cultural one, or they could offer a
     chronological approach in which individual consequences are discussed. Alternatively, candidates
     could offer a thematic approach; for example, they could address cultural changes, such as
     increased literary output and intellectual development. Other consequences may include greater
     knowledge of the world due to exploration, economic factors such urbanisation and increased
     trade, sectarian and ethnic divisions, the political fracturing of the Muslim world, and the spread of
     Islam due to proselytization. Other relevant factors may be referred to.



2.   To what extent did rifts and divisions within the ‘Abbasid Empire contribute to its decline?

     Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that rifts and divisions
     contributed to the decline of the ‘Abbasid Empire. Candidates may argue that these rifts and
     divisions were wholly or partially responsible for the decline, or they may suggest other factors, and
     consider them as being more significant. However, whichever method is chosen, candidates are
     required to deal with the issue of rifts and divisions in their responses. These may include
     geographic factors such as the vast extent of the empire, ethnic factors such as rivalries between
     Arabs and non-Arabs, political differences such as dynastic conflicts, economic factors such as
     growing wealth disparities, or religious differences such as those between Sunni and ‘Shia. Other
     relevant factors such as the impact of warfare may be referred to in candidate responses.

Section 2        The Fatimids (909–1171)

3.   Evaluate the importance of economic and social factors in the rise to power of the Fatimids.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of economic and social factors, weighing up their importance or
     otherwise to the rise to power of the Fatimids. Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic
     and social factors, or they may prioritize their discussion of one over the other. However, both
     aspects must be a feature of the response. Candidates may or may not choose a comparative
     approach. They may consider economic factors such as commercial activity and trade and the
     expansion of the navy, which supported their trading power in the Mediterranean and Red Sea.
     Social factors may include the divisions within the ‘Abbasid Empire that enabled the Fatimids to
     recruit supporters even among non-Muslims, or the Fatimid’s emphasis on religious learning,
     culture and intellectual development, which also attracted much support. Both
     strengths/importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there need not be an equal
     focus on each.



4.   “Institutions of learning (Dar al-‘Ilm) were more significant than government institutions during the
     height of the Fatimid Empire.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that institutions of learning
     were more significant than government institutions during the height of the Fatimid Empire.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of institutions of learning and government institutions, or they
     may prioritize their discussion of one over the other. However, both aspects must be a feature of
     the response. Candidates may or may not choose a comparative approach. Discussion may
     include the Fatimid Empire’s considerable devotion to higher learning in both religious and non-
     religious spheres. This gave the Ismaili sect an intellectual basis and attracted many to the Islamic
     faith. Learning institutions may be compared to government institutions where non-sectarian
     appointments based on merit were a revolutionary concept. Candidates may agree, partly agree
     or disagree with the statement.
                                                  –9–                  M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AF/M


Section 3        The Crusades (1095–1291)

5.   Discuss the reasons why the crusading movement failed to repeat the success of the First
     Crusade.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why the crusading
     movement failed to repeat the success of the First Crusade. Candidates may discuss the
     conditions that led to the success of the First Crusade to provide context, but this should not be the
     focus of the response. They should discuss the reasons why the conditions present during the
     First Crusade no longer applied during the later crusading movement, and consequently what new
     circumstances had arisen to limit the success of the subsequent campaigns. Candidates may
     discuss how the First Crusade benefited enormously from Muslim disunity and inability to organize
     resistance, or the differences in leadership between the First Crusade and later crusades. Other
     factors may include declining European support, political disunity amongst crusaders, and political
     and military changes in the Muslim world.



6.   “Weapons rather than tactics determined the outcome of the Crusades.” Discuss with reference to
     two of: the First Crusade (1096–1099); the Second Crusade (1145–1149); the Third Crusade
     (1189–1192).

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that weapons rather than
     tactics determined the outcome of two of the Crusades. Candidates must discuss both weapons
     and tactics with respect to their two chosen crusades, although some imbalance is permitted.
     Candidates may or may not choose a comparative approach. They may discuss how the weapons
     of both sides remained virtually unchanged throughout the crusading period, and how the most
     significant victories of the Muslims, for example Hattin, were the result of poor tactical decisions by
     the crusading forces. References may be made to the importance of siege warfare in terms of
     developments in siege weapons and tactics. While other—relevant—factors may be referred to, the
     bulk of the response must focus on weapons and tactics. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the statement.

Section 4       The Ottomans (1281–1566)

7.   Evaluate the factors that contributed to the Ottoman rise to power.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of a range of factors, weighing up their importance or otherwise
     to the rise to power of the Ottomans. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly
     linked to the rise of Ottoman power. Candidates may refer to geographical factors such as the
     location of Ottoman territory in Western Anatolia. They may also address the strength of the Ottoman
     army and use of military technology, the leadership skills of rulers such as Osman, the political and
     economic divisions of their opponents, coherent administrative structures, and the recruitment of
     talented non-Ottomans. Alternatively, they may adopt an alternative approach by focusing on the
     internal and external factors that contributed to the rise to power of the Ottomans. Candidates may
     reach a conclusion about the relative importance of the various factors which they identify.



8.   Evaluate the impact of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire on Europe and Muslim lands.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of consequences of the foundation of the Ottoman Empire,
     weighing up its impact (or lack thereof) on Europe and Muslim lands. Candidates may offer equal
     coverage of Europe and Muslim lands, or they may prioritize their discussion of one over the other.
     However, both regions must be a feature of the responses. Candidates may or may not choose a
     comparative approach. They may address the positive and negative effects of the foundation of the
     Ottoman Empire, or alternatively they may focus on short- and long-term effects. Some candidates
     may opt to divide their evaluation into social factors, including the influence of Ottoman dress and
     architecture and migration of population, economic factors such trade and economic growth, and
     political factors such as loss of territory to the Ottomans.

Section 5        Trade and the rise and decline of African states and empires (800–1600)

9.    Evaluate the reasons for the rise of the Ghana Empire.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the rise of the Ghana Empire, weighing up
      their importance. Candidates may refer to internal and external reasons that contributed to the rise
      of the Ghana Empire and/or they may categorize these into long- and short-term causes.
      Additionally or alternatively, candidates may consider the social, political and/or economic reasons
      for its rise. Factors identified may include the strong, centralised administrative structure of the
      empire and the personal wealth of the king, the strategic location of the empire along the trade
      routes for gold, salt and ivory and taxation of commodities which led to the collection of vast
      revenues, the possession of fertile agricultural lands, military strength and conquest, and the
      requirement of vassal states to pay annual tribute. Candidates may reach a conclusion about the
      relative importance of the different factors which they identify.



10.   Evaluate the reasons for the decline of the Mali Empire by 1600.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the reasons for the decline of the Mali Empire, weighing up
      their importance. Candidates may refer to internal and external reasons that contributed to the
      decline of the Mali Empire. Alternatively, they may categorize their responses into long- and short-
      term causes. Additionally or alternatively, candidates may consider the social, political and/or
      economic reasons for the decline. Factors identified may include weak leadership after the death
      of Mansa Musa, external threats and attacks by rivals such as the Mossi and Tuaregs, economic
      decline and bankruptcy due to poor administration and the loss of trade routes, internal rebellions
      which led to territorial disintegration, and the rise of new, powerful rivals such as the Songhai
      Empire. Candidates may reach a conclusion about the relative importance of the different factors
      which they identify.

Section 6        Pre-colonial African states (1800–1900)

11.   Discuss the factors that contributed to the rise of the Zulu Kingdom.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that contributed to the rise of
      the Zulu Kingdom. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the rise of
      the Zulu Kingdom. Candidates may categorize these into long- and short-term factors or they may
      group them in terms of the social, political and economic factors that contributed to the rise of the
      Zulu Kingdom. Additionally or alternatively, they may organise their responses according to
      internal or external factors. Factors may include the role of leaders such as Shaka and
      Dingiswayo, the military and regimental system of the Zulu and innovations in tactics and
      weaponry, the defeat and conquest of neighbouring kingdoms during the Mfecane and the
      absorption of the populations and economies of these kingdoms, and the emphasis on Zulu
      cultural and political unity.



12.   Discuss the reasons for the rise of the Mahdist state in Sudan.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for the rise of the Mahdist
      state in Sudan. Factors may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      identified in the question. Candidates may categorize reasons into long- and short-term factors, or
      they may group them into the social, political and economic reasons that contributed to the rise of
      the Mahdist state. Additionally or alternatively, they may consider internal or external factors.
      Factors identified may include the leadership and charisma of the Mahdi, popular dissatisfaction
      with Egyptian and British rule, heavy taxation, British control of trade and restriction of slavery,
      Egyptian weakness and initial British disinterest in the Sudan, a factor which created a political
      opportunity for the Mahdi, and jihadism and how this stimulated popular support.

Section 7         The slave trade in Africa and the Middle East (1500–1900)

13.   “The expansion of the East African slave trade was simply an extension of existing practices.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered review of the statement that the expansion of the East African
      slave trade was simply an extension of existing practices. They may agree, partially agree or
      disagree with the statement. Candidates may suggest that traditional trade in slaves and
      commodities such as ivory and spices between peoples in the region established trade links and
      laid the foundation for the later slave trade between East Africa and the wider Indian Ocean region.
      They may demonstrate an understanding of which features were carried forward from existing
      practices and which were new developments. Other contributory factors to the expansion of the
      East African slave trade, such as the role of the Sultanate of Oman and British decision to ban
      slavery which led to closure of West African slave markets, may be referred to.



14.   Examine the impact of anti-slavery legislation in the 19th century.

      Candidates will consider the impact of anti-slavery legislation in the 19th century. The examination
      of impact may extend beyond the timeframe but impact identified must be clearly linked to
      nineteenth century legislation. Candidates may refer to the long- and short-term impact or
      alternatively, they may identify and categorize the social, economic and political impact of the
      legislation. Examples of legislation may include the 1807 Slave Trade Act, the 1833 Abolition of
      Slavery Act and the 1885 Berlin Act among others. While some of the causes of the introduction of
      legislation, such as evolving popular attitudes towards slavery, may be mentioned to provide
      context, the bulk of the response must be focused on impact. Impacts identified may include the
      gradual abolition of the practice of slavery, the liberation of large numbers of slaves and the decline
      of the slave trade, and its replacement with legitimate commerce.

Section 8        European imperialism and the partition of Africa (1850–1900)

15.   “Economic weaknesses in Europe were the main cause of the partition of Africa.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered review of the statement that the main cause of the partition of
      Africa was economic weaknesses within Europe. Candidates may emphasize the role of economic
      weakness within a specific European country as a catalyst, but it is likely that they will focus on
      wider economic woes within the continent. Candidates may refer to the economic recession which
      hit Europe in the 1870s and led to reduced returns on investment and the problem of surplus
      capital. Countries also sought colonies in Africa as sources of raw materials and markets for
      manufactured products. While other—relevant—factors, for example political, social, strategic
      and/or humanitarian factors, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      of economic problems. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.



16.   Evaluate the impact of Leopold II and De Brazza in the Congo region.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of Leopold II and De Brazza in the Congo region,
      weighing up importance or otherwise of each. Candidates may offer equal coverage of Leopold II
      and De Brazza, or they stress the role of one as being more significant than the other. However,
      both will be a feature of the response. Candidates may or may not choose a comparative
      approach and/or they may consider the social, economic and political impact of each. They may
      refer specifically to the convening of the Berlin West Africa Conference, the partition of the Congo
      region between Leopold and the French, the brutal impact of colonialism on the local population of
      the Congo Free State and renewed colonial rivalry in Africa as a whole. Both importance and
      limitations in the role of each must be clearly indicated.

Section 9         Response to European imperialism (1870–1920)

17.   Evaluate Mandinka resistance to French rule.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of Mandinka resistance to French rule, weighing up its
      strengths and limitations. Candidates may refer to the initial success and duration of resistance, and
      how and why this resistance was ultimately unsuccessful. They may also emphasize the strength
      of the Mandinka state, its economic success, ability to procure firearms, and the role of Samori Toure
      as a leader and military strategist in the resistance against the French. They may also focus on
      Samori’s tenacity and his ability to adopt new tactics such as guerrilla warfare, the failure of the
      Mandinka to attract allies such as the British, and the role of superior French military power in their
      eventual victory. Both the importance and limitations of Mandinka resistance must be clearly
      indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.



18.   “The advantages of collaboration with colonial powers outweighed the disadvantages.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the advantages of
      collaboration with colonial powers outweighed the disadvantages. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of advantages and disadvantages, or there may be some imbalance between the two.
      They may refer to the reasons why some African groups chose to collaborate with colonial powers.
      These reasons may include existing relations of trade and the anticipated political and economic
      benefits, sometimes in terms of the exercise of sub-imperialism over other African groups. The
      presence of missionaries may have also encouraged collaboration. Candidates may point out that
      one obvious disadvantage of resistance was military defeat and/or destruction. They may also
      stress the fact that some groups did not have the luxury of choosing collaboration, as the colonial
      power was determined to destroy their independence. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement.

Section 10        Africa under colonialism (1890–1980)

19.   Evaluate the factors that contributed to the creation of the Central African Federation.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the factors that contributed to the creation of the Central
      African Federation, weighing up the importance or otherwise of each. Candidates may provide
      context by briefly outlining the nature and membership of the federation. They may discuss social
      factors, such of the role of settler populations in Southern Rhodesia who wished to advance their
      interests at the expense of the local population. Economic factors may include the need to more
      effectively mobilise African labour and exploit raw materials such as copper. Candidates may also
      address political issues such as the desire of the colonial power to limit the growth of nationalism in
      the territory. They may argue that the establishment of the federation was opposed by most
      Africans, and its creation led to a surge of nationalist sentiment across the region.



20.   Discuss social and economic development in Nigeria under the British.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social and economic development in
      Nigeria under the British. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic
      developments, or there may be some imbalance between the two factors. They may also stress
      the strong connection between the two. They may refer to British indirect rule, which entailed a
      more hands-off approach to African societies. Alternatively, they may focus on initiatives such as
      the establishment of government schools in non-Islamic areas and the subsequent increase in
      literacy levels, on British encouragement of the growth of cash crops such as palm oil and cotton,
      or improvements to transportation and communication such as the construction of railways, a
      telegraph system and all-weather roads. Candidates may stress positive as well as negative
      factors. They may stress differences in developments in different regions of Nigeria.

Section 11       20th-century nationalist and independence movements in Africa

21.   Examine the role played by the South West Africa People’s Organisation (SWAPO) in the
      achievement of Namibian independence.

      Candidates will consider the role and significance of the South West Africa People’s Organisation
      (SWAPO) in the achievement of Namibian independence. Candidates may refer to the role of
      SWAPO in securing Namibia’s achievement of independence through both armed resistance and
      diplomatic methods. Armed resistance may refer to the guerrilla strategies against South African
      forces and the use of cross-border bases in Angola. Diplomatic methods may include campaigns
      conducted within the United Nations where SWAPO was recognised as the legitimate
      representative of the Namibian people, and where a Permanent Observer was able to apply
      pressure on the South Africans. They also gained the support of other states, including African
      countries, as part of the wider anti-apartheid movement. Candidates may examine the leadership
      of SWAPO, especially the role of Sam Nujoma.



22.   Evaluate Nkrumah’s contribution to Ghana’s achievement of independence.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of Nkrumah’s role, weighing up its importance or otherwise in
      the context of the achievement of Ghanaian independence. Candidates may refer to Nkrumah’s
      personality and role as leader of the Convention People’s Party, the main independence party in
      the country. They may also focus on his increasing radicalism, especially his role in the Positive
      Action Campaign against British rule. They may also look at his later willingness to work with the
      British and his appointment as ‘leader of government business’. Candidates may refer to factors
      other than Nkrumah, such earlier constitutional developments in the Gold Coast under the British,
      post-war economic problems in Britain and the relative development of the Gold Coast which
      would ensure its economic viability. Ultimately Britain was willing to grant independence to ensure
      a close post-independence relationship with their former colony.

Section 12       The Ottoman Empire (c1800–1923)

23.   “The actions of the major powers were the most significant factor in Greece gaining independence
      in 1831.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement that the actions of the
      major powers were the most significant factor in Greece gaining independence in 1831.
      Candidates may refer to factors such as the intervention of European powers, both militarily,
      including the Battle of Navarino Bay, and diplomatically, such as the Treaty of London of 1827 and
      the London Protocol of 1830. Candidates may consider other factors such as the strength of the
      demand for Greek independence and the weaknesses and internal divisions of the Ottoman
      Empire, referencing the revolt in the Morea and Muhammad Ali in Egypt. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement. They may conclude that Greek independence was
      achieved because of a combination of foreign intervention and Ottoman weakness.



24.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War on the Ottoman Empire.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the impact of the First World War on the Ottoman Empire,
      weighing up its importance or otherwise. Impact may include territorial changes because of the
      war, and in the Treaties of Sevres and Lausanne. Candidates may also focus on economic impact
      due to loss of empire and reparations, and social impact such as the migration of significant ethnic
      populations. Political impact may refer to the collapse of the Empire and the Caliphate, Turkish
      resistance to the Treaty of Sevres and the subsequent war of independence with Greece and other
      major powers, the establishment of a secular Turkish Republic under Ataturk, and the emergence
      of a Turkish national identity. Candidates may refer to long-term hostilities between the new
      Turkish state and other groups such as the Armenians and the Greeks.

Section 13       War and change in the Middle East and North Africa 1914–1945

25.   “The Paris peace treaties created more conflict than peace in the Middle East.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered review of the statement that the Paris peace treaties created more
      conflict than peace in the Middle East. Candidates may refer to specific decisions made at the Paris
      conferences and how these may have, individually or collectively, incited resistance and conflict
      amongst the people in the region rather than promoted peace. Candidates may refer to the failure
      of powers to acknowledge the growth of Arab nationalism in the region, ignoring the Wilsonian ideal
      of self-determination. The creation of new states and the establishment of mandates such as Iraq,
      Syria, Transjordan and Palestine all led to increasing tensions in the region, as well as resentment
      towards the continued influence and control of France and Britain. Some reference may be made
      the contradictory wartime promises such as the Balfour Declaration and the Hussein-McMahon
      Correspondence.



26.   Examine the impact of the First World War on the movement for Egyptian independence.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between the First World War and the movement for
      Egyptian independence. Candidates may refer to the growth of political movements in Egypt such
      as the Wafd, which evolved as a result of the First World War, and the decisions made at the
      subsequent peace settlements. They may show an awareness of changing British attitudes toward
      Egypt, such as the Milner report, and/or reflect on any possible reduction in British capabilities to
      retain control of Egypt after the war. There may also be an examination of the extent to which the
      independence movement was active prior to the war. The various effects of the war may be
      addressed chronologically, in terms of their positive and negative impact, or they may be grouped
      into categories such as their social, political and economic impact.

                  (20th century)

27.   Examine the impact of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU) up to
      2000.

      Candidates will consider the impact of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the African
      Union (AU) up to 2000, uncovering any assumptions and/or interrelationships. Candidates may
      consider the positive and negative impacts and/or the social, political and economic effects of the
      two organizations. They may refer to the role and success of the two organisations in respect to
      conflict resolution and peacekeeping, as well as their efforts to promote social and economic
      development on the continent. They may also focus on factors that inhibited the success of the
      two organisations, including corruption and other economic problems, external interference, and
      rivalries between member states. Reference may be made to the decision to disband the OAU,
      which some may interpret as a recognition of failure, and create a new African Union. Specific
      examples of countries that may be the focus of the response include Somalia, South Africa and
      Mozambique. Candidates may note that the AU was founded only at the end of the period.



28.   Compare and contrast the results of United Nations (UN) intervention in Congo and Mozambique.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the results of United
      Nations (UN) intervention in Congo and in Mozambique, referring to both throughout. Candidates
      may refer to positive and negative results, or they may categorize the results in terms of their
      social, political and/or economic impact. Candidates may argue that the intervention in both
      countries was largely successful, largely a failure, or that one was more successful than the other.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each. Similarities may include success in stabilising war-torn countries, maintaining
      their territorial integrity and providing humanitarian support. Differences may include the fact that
      Congo later returned to civil war while Mozambique remained peaceful, and the fact that the
      intervention in Congo was less successful, due in part to a lack of international support for the
      mission.

Section 15       Developments in South Africa 1880–1994

29.   Evaluate the causes of the South African War (1899–1902).

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the causes of the South African War (1899–1902), weighing
      up the importance of each. Candidates may refer to the social, economic and political causes, or
      alternatively, the long- and short-term causes of the war. The may focus on long-standing tension
      and hostility due to the federationist ambitions of the British and Boer resistance to attempted
      colonisation. They may also refer to the discovery of gold in the Transvaal and the argument that
      the British wished to control the source of this wealth. They may also note the role of the Uitlander
      community and the resentment of the Boers towards an alien cultural presence and the threat this
      posed to their traditional way of life. The may also refer to the intransigence of leaders such as
      Kruger and Milner, especially at the Bloemfontein Conference, as a cause of the conflict.



30.   Evaluate the importance of international opposition to apartheid.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the importance of international opposition to apartheid
      weighing up the importance or otherwise of a range of factors. Candidates may refer to different
      forms of international opposition to apartheid and determine the degree to which these forms of
      opposition were, individually or collectively, a significant factor in the demise of the system.
      Specific examples may include the role of the United Nations and/or the economic and social
      sanctions that were imposed on South Africa. These may include trade sanctions, economic
      disinvestment, and sporting boycotts. The importance and limitations of international opposition to
      apartheid must be clearly indicated and, while other—relevant—factors, such as a range of internal
      forms of opposition, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in
      the question.

31.   Examine the ways in which colonialism changed the role and status of women in Africa.

      Candidates will consider the interrelationship between colonialism and the changing role and
      status of women in Africa. Candidates may consider the positive and the negative changes, social,
      economic and political changes or alternatively look at the long- short-term changes to the role and
      status of women in Africa. Focus may be on the ways in which the economic and educational
      prospects of women were altered by colonialism and/or on how colonialism effected changes to
      their social status, including the abolition of traditional practices such as polygamy. Candidates
      may challenge the assumption in the question that change occurred and they may stress that there
      were elements of continuity in the female experience. Nevertheless, emphasis should be on
      change. While other—relevant—interrelationships may be considered, the bulk of the response
      will remain on that raised in the question.



32.   With reference to two countries, discuss the impact of colonialism on African art and culture.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of colonialism on African art
      and culture. The impact of colonialism on the art and culture of the chosen countries may or may
      not be contemporaneous. Candidates may offer equal coverage of their chosen countries and they
      may offer equal coverage of the impact on art and culture. Alternatively, in either—or both—cases
      there may be some imbalance between the factors. However, two countries will be featured in the
      response and both art and culture will be addressed. Candidates may or may not choose a
      comparative approach, but they will—where appropriate—refer to positive and negative impacts of
      colonialism on African art and culture. While it may be argued that other factors had a more
      significant impact on art and culture in the two countries chosen, the bulk of the response must be
      focused on colonialism.

      Candidates will consider the reasons for the outcome of the Six Day War and the 1973 War.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the Six Day War and the 1973 War, or there may be some
      imbalance between the two wars. However, both wars will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may or may not choose a comparative approach. They may refer to the long- and
      short- term reasons for the outcome, or alternatively the social, economic and political reasons for
      the outcomes. Reasons may include the weaknesses of Arab states and their failures to effectively
      co-operate militarily and diplomatically, superior Israeli military technology, strategy and morale,
      and the influence and involvement of foreign powers—especially the support of the US for Israel
      and Soviet pressure on the Arab states to negotiate.



34.   To what extent did Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi modernize and westernize Iran?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that Mohammad Reza Shah
      Pahlavi modernized and westernized Iran. Candidates may refer to the policies of the Shah such
      as the White Revolution and its impact on Iranian society and economy. Additionally or
      alternatively, his policies on the agrarian sector, education and the franchise, which was extended
      to include women, may be addressed. There may also be consideration of huge investments to
      modernize infrastructure and the wider economy. They may also stress his secularism and the
      persecution of Shi’a clerics, which led to the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the reversal of many of
      his reforms. Relevant westernizing and/or modernizing forces other than Mohammad Reza Shah
      Pahlavi may be identified but the focus must be on the Shah’s policies.

35.   Examine the impact of ethnic conflict in two African countries.

      Candidates will consider the impact of ethnic conflict in two African countries. While the ethnic
      conflict within the two countries chosen must be from within the timeframe, they may or may not be
      contemporaneous. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries chosen, or there
      may be some imbalance between the two. However, the two countries will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may or may not choose a comparative approach. They may select
      countries where the results of ethnic conflict have been significant, such as Nigeria, Rwanda or
      Sudan. They may categorize the impact as being social, economic and/or political. Effects may
      include political divisions and instability, changes in leadership, lasting rancour and discord, mass
      genocide, intervention by foreign forces, and social and economic problems including famine and
      forced migrations.



36.   With reference to two post-independence African countries, examine the reasons for economic
      growth and development to 2005.

      Candidates will consider the reasons for economic growth and development in two African
      countries. They may look at the economic problems experienced in the post-independence period
      in two African countries, but the focus of the response must be on the reasons for economic growth
      and development. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two chosen countries, or there may
      be some imbalance between the two. However, the two countries will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may focus on countries such as South Africa, Ghana, Kenya and
      Zimbabwe, but there is a wide range of possible examples that could be used. Reasons identified
      may include increased demand for raw materials, an increase in strategic investment in civil
      infrastructure, improved communication and the end of civil wars and wars between states.
