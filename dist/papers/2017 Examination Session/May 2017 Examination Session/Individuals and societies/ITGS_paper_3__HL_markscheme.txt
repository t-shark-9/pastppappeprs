Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation - Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis - Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation - My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

If candidates answer more than the prescribed number of questions:

• In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
  Disregard incorrect answers.

• In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts eg “describe two kinds”,
  mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions, one description and
  one identification, or two identifications.

• In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations eg “explain
  two reasons”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two full explanations,
  one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

1.   (a)   Insurance companies will use data gathered by the KHT watch when deciding
           on the price of an insurance policy.

           Identify two items of data that could be collected by the KHT watch.                 [2]

           Answers may include:
           • time spent exercising
           • max heart rate achieved/resting heart rate
           • heart rate/heart beat/pulse
           • calories used during exercise
           • nature of exercise such as gentle, fat burning
           • age, gender, weight, height
           • number of steps
           • amount of activity (if rewarded, then do not give a further mark for detail of
             activities, ie different level of activity) – not just “activity” on its own
           • sleep patterns
           • percentage of recommended daily activity.

           Do not accept features that the KHT watch does not yet measure, eg glucose.

           Award [1] for each item of data collected by the KHT watch that would be useful
           for an insurance company when deciding on the price and conditions of an
           insurance policy up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Outline one reason for using XML to format the data produced by the
           wearable devices.                                                                    [2]

           Answers may include:
           • Basic answer:
             ‒ easier to manipulate than other formats
             ‒ common standard
             ‒ different computers can understand it easier
             ‒ cross platform in nature (compatibility)
             ‒ it is readable by both humans and machines
             ‒ easier to synchronise data to different websites
             ‒ can hold many different type of data
           • Development of the basic answer:
             ‒ XML provides a common syntax for messaging systems for the exchange
               of information between applications
             ‒ XML information can be manipulated programmatically (under machine
               control), so XML documents can be pieced together from disparate
               sources, or taken apart and re-used in different ways
             ‒ XML lets you separate form (appearance) from content. Your XML file
               contains your document information (text, data) and identifies its structure:
               your formatting and other processing needs are identified separately in
               a stylesheet or processing system
             ‒ XML provides a robust and durable format for information storage and
               transmission. Robust because it is based on a proven standard, and can
               thus be tested and verified; durable (persistent) because it uses plain-text
               file formats which will outlast proprietary binary ones
             ‒ XML allows sets of documents which are all the same type to be created
               and handled consistently and without structural errors, because it provides
               a standardised way of describing, controlling, or allowing/disallowing
               particular types of document structure.

NB: Marks are not awarded for a definition of XML.

Award [1] for a general reason related to the use of XML as a format for the data.
Award [2] for a technical development of the reason related to the use of XML as
a format for the data.

2.   A group of students who own KHT watches decided to compare their watches.
     Although they completed the same activities they found information, such as the
     number of steps walked, differed between the watches.

     Explain three reasons why these differences may occur.                                           [6]

     Answers may include:
     • malfunction/broken (as long as detail is given, such as the type of malfunction or
       when it occurred)
     • lack of accuracy of GPS tracking
     • different results could be obtained depending where the device is worn on the body
       (eg arm, hand, inside a pocket)
     • slight variation in the route taken
     • slightly different level of effort during the exercise (this would affect the total calories
       calculation for example)
     • physical differences (weight, height, etc)
     • sensitivity of sensors: different calibration, different power required to activate the
       software to count the steps
     • type of walking – flat, hilly, steps that may not be taken into account by the software
       in the wearable tech
     • stride measurement not taken into account or assumed to be a particular value
       which may be different to that if the user is very tall or the watch may not be
       calibrated, etc
     • light sensors interacting with the body for heart rate, glucose, etc may be affected by
       the skin colour, hairs, tattoos, etc in different ways
     • watches are different versions/models of KHT watch
     • difference in time of the watches (ie if one was set to a different time zone and the
       other was not, this might affect the totals for that day).

     NB: The question is referring to the data stored on the watch and not the data synced to
     the phone.

     Award [1] for identifying why information such as the number of steps walked, differed
     between the watches. And [1] for development of that point to explain the difference
     up to a maximum of [2].

     Mark as [2] + [2] + [2].

3.   KHT has received requests from some customers to include features that they can use
     to help them manage their own health and well-being (lines 96–99, 103–105).

     Discuss whether KHT should develop its wearable technologies so that customers can
     use them to help manage their own health and well-being.                                    [8]

     Answers may include a range of reasons from either one or both of the two possible
     perspectives. Entry to the top markbands will depend on how well the reasons are
     used to justify a conclusion/judgement.

     Reasons why KHT should develop its wearable technologies:
     • greater customer satisfaction with the product
     • customers can use this to track and monitor specific data and trends from their daily
       life routine which can be used to manage their health
     • makes the product more adaptable and able to be accurately set for customers with
       different needs, eg children, sports people, aged
     • gives customers greater ownership of their healthcare program
     • customers can set and reach goals that will benefit their health and wellbeing
     • KHT could cater for niche markets as the setting can be adapted to the specifics of
       the user group, eg aged, sports, children
     • KHT could obtain useful feedback about whether to further develop in niche markets
       such as elite athletes, elderly customers, children
     • KHT could provide links with healthcare companies which may lead to them
       investing in KHT
     • KHT could collect data that is specific to particular health and lifestyle issues which
       is more valuable than general data
     • KHT may obtain a competitive advantage in this field.

     Reasons why KHT should not develop its wearable technologies:
     • it could require the development of new hardware for certain activities which could
       be an expensive/risky development
     • it may include unnecessary features for most customers who just want a simple
       fitness device
     • the algorithms used to develop the wearable technology may not apply to many
       customers (may be set at a general level)
     • customers may not feel confident in understanding their own health requirements
       sufficiently to adapt the safe range of the wearable technology
     • it could lead to litigation issues if customers have a heart attack or other heart
       problems due to setting unrealistic boundaries for their vital signs
     • developing the new products may be very expensive and not recouped from sales
     • KHT may not be able to ensure the privacy and security of the data which is
       collected
     • consulting health and lifestyle experts (in developing the accompanying technology)
       would be expensive.

4.   To reach the highest markband, the response to question 4 must include evidence of
     independent research linked to the KHT case study.

     The wearable technology developed by KHT enables the company to continuously
     gather data from its customers during their normal daily activities. Fajar and Adel have
     agreed to share this data with a number of healthcare organizations. This data could
     then be used to assist doctors in making recommendations to their patients
     (lines 20–21, 70–81, 111–121).

     Discuss whether doctors should use this data when making recommendations to their
     patients.                                                                                   [12]

     Answers may include:

     Reasons for using data from KHT products
     • the data provides additional data that may not be available from other sources such
       as providing information about an undiagnosed condition
     • the data may be the only data that is available at the time of treatment as the patient
       may not have realized that they had the condition
     • may provide the only source of continuous information that previously could only be
       collected by a patient being in a hospital
     • there may be an expectation by managers in the healthcare organization that the
       data should be used as they see many possible benefits
     • doctors may use KHT wearable tech to collect continuous data after the first
       examination to supplement the data they have collected
     • use of KHT data may save money/time/effort required to gather the data for the
       health authorities as KHT will effectively be doing this for them by collecting
       customers’/patients’ data.

     Reasons for not using data from KHT products
     • data may not be considered reliable enough to be used for medical purposes, this
       may be because of the quality of the sensors in the wearable tech
     • doctors may be concerned about whether the data has been collected ethically
     • doctors may be concerned that the data is collected as reliably as they could do in
       the hospital
     • doctors may be dealing with aggregated data rather than that of the patient and this
       may lead to questions about whether it is appropriate and a benefit to use data
       based on many patients
     • there would be an enormous amount of data available to doctors. There would be a
       cost to securely store this data and a significant time needed to analyse it.
     • due to the volume of data a doctor may not have time to read/interpret all the
       information. Would he then be liable if he missed diagnosing a serious condition?
     • there may be a directive by the managers of the Healthcare organizations that the
       data from KHT is not to be used for a number of reasons (eg possible legal issues)
     • there may not be interoperability between KHT systems and those of the Healthcare
       organizations that allows for the real-time interchange of data
     • there may be privacy concerns raised by the patient about the security and privacy
       of the data collected
     • the healthcare organizations would need to develop policies and procedures for
       handling the data at some cost and possible inconvenience
     • doctors could lose face to face time with patient´s when under observation.
