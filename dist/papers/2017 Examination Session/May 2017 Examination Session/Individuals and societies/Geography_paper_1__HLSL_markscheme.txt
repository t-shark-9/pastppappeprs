                               Core theme – patterns and change

                                                Section A
1.   Populations in transition

     (a)   Describe the trends in numbers of internally displaced persons (IDPs) between
           1990 and 2010 as shown on the graph.                                                     [3]

           Three valid descriptions are needed and there must be some reference to data
           for full marks.

           Possibilities could include:
            increase 1990–94 (22 to 28 million)
            decrease 1994–97 (28 to 17 million)
            stable/slow increase/fluctuating 1997–2010
            increase 1997–2001 (17 to 24 million)
            overall increase 1990–2010 (22 to 27 million)
            overall fluctuation.

           Reference to data needs to illustrate trend and not a single point on the graph.

     (b)   State the key factor that determines whether a forced migrant is a refugee or
           an internally displaced person (IDP).                                                    [1]

           Whether they are still within their country of origin or not.

     (c)   Suggest one political and one environmental cause of the rapid increase in the total
           number of forced migrants since 2011.                                                  [2+2]

           Award [1] for each reason and [1] for further development or expanded
           exemplification.

           Possible political causes:
            War/conflict [1] – people flee dangers from fighting such as injury and death
             [1] eg Syrian refugees fleeing fighting [1].
            State persecution [1] – denial of the human rights of individuals or groups [1]
             eg LGBT in Uganda flee anti-homosexuality laws [1].
            Political ideology [1] – people flee a political regime that is against their own
             philosophy [1] eg people fleeing communism in Cuba [1].

           Possible environmental causes:
            Climate change increasing the incidence of drought/flooding [1] – people
             forced to migrate to access food [1] eg famine caused by drought causes
             people to flee from Somalia to Kenya [1].
            Hazard events such as earthquakes [1] affecting more people who have been
             made homeless [1], eg Haiti to Dominican Republic after 2010 earthquake [1].
            Slow onset environmental change such as desertification [1] – people no
             longer able to maintain farming or hunting [1] land degradation in Mexico’s
             drylands causes rural to urban migration.

           Do not award credit for simply naming a country without a detail.

(d)   (i)    State two incentives used in a recent pro-natalist national policy.                [1+1]

             Award [1] for each valid, distinct incentive related to identified country.

             Possibilities (must relate to named country) and could include:
              tax incentives
              cash payouts when giving birth
              state-funded financial assistance to larger families such as medical care
              priority for housing
              government-subsidized day care
              parental leave – paternity and maternity
              positive portrayal of motherhood
              campaigns to encourage pregnancy.

      (ii)   Explain why these incentives were introduced in the country you named in (d)(i).     [2]

             Award [1] for identification of reason and [1] for how it relates to the country
             (either by use of data or explaining the issue that the country is trying to
             tackle).

             Possible explanations (related to the named country) could include:
              ageing populations
              low birth rates
              low fertility rate
              shortage of economically active population.

             For example: In France, the fertility rate fell below the replacement level [1].
             The population was ageing and the workforce was getting smaller [1].

2.   Disparities in wealth and development

     (a)   Describe the trends in the cost of sending remittances from the three regions
           shown on the graph.                                                                   [2]

           Award [1+1] for two valid descriptive points. Must make use of data for the full
           two marks.

            Fluctuating – [1] can be awarded for comment that covers all three regions as
             a group or separate descriptions of fluctuation for all regions.
            Decreasing – [1] can be awarded for comment that covers all three regions as
             a group or separate descriptions of decrease for all regions.


     (b)   Outline one possible reason why transferring remittances creates costs for
           foreign workers.                                                                      [2]

           Award [1] for each reason and [1] for further development or exemplification.

           Possibilities could include:
            bank charges
            money transfer percentages
            commission charged
            internet charges
            exchange rates
            shipping costs.

           For example:
           When money is transferred into another currency money is lost through exchange
           rates [1] as different currencies have different values on the open market [1].

           Transaction charges are made by banks [1] when money is transferred through a
           bank they make a fixed charge or take a percentage of the transfer [1].

     (c)   Explain two reasons why remittances are often an effective way of reducing
           global disparities.                                                                 [2+2]

           For each distinct reason award [1] for the reason and [1] for further explanatory
           development/exemplification.

           For example: Money or goods help fund education programmes [1], increasing
           future job/salary-earning potential [1].

           Other possibilities could include:
            often hard currency/greater value in receiving country
            increases local spending/boosts local market
            often shared with extended families/increases standard of living of a large
             number of individuals
            large amount of money is transferred/gives large investment fund for
             communities
            remittances are stable source of money/reliable for development whereas
             other forms of investment, such as aid, can vary
            flows in one direction / does not result in external debt.

(d)   Explain how inequalities can arise from ethnic differences in one named country.        [4]

       identification of valid country where ethnic differences give rise to inequalities
        [1]
       identification of the ethnic group(s) involved [1]
       description of the nature of the inequality eg education, employment, access
        to housing [1]
       explanation of the origin of the inequality [1].

      For example:
      South Africa [1]:
      Inequalities have arisen between groups of African (black) and European (white)
      origin [1]. This is the result of differences in the quality of education between the
      two groups as the white population has access to better education facilities [1].
      These differences are the result of the black population being unable to afford to
      send their children to school [1].

      UK [1]:
      Inequalities in housing occur in the UK where there is a high percentage of
      Bangladeshis [1] of whom about 30% live in overcrowded accommodation [1].
      This can be seen to be the result of their disadvantaged position in the labour
      market where they occupy lower paid employment [1].
                                                   –8–                 M17/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Patterns in environmental quality and sustainability

     (a)   Identify the country shown on the graph with the lowest percentage of forest cover.             [1]

           Mexico

     (b)   Distinguish between forest cover and biodiversity.                                              [2]

            forest cover is the proportion/percentage/area of a region/country [1]
            biodiversity refers to all the different kinds of living organisms within a given area
             including plants, animals, fungi, and other living things [1] (or alternatively biodiversity is
             the existence of a wide variety of plant and animal species living in their natural
             environment [1]).

     (c)   Suggest two reasons why forest cover in some countries has increased in
           recent years.                                                                                 [2+2]

           In each case, award [1] for a distinct, valid reason, and [1] for
           development/exemplification.
           There are two approaches that could be taken to answer this question – strategic
           reasons that explain the increase in forest cover, and operational reasons. Either
           approach, or a combination of the two, is acceptable.

           Possible strategic approaches could include:
            Trees have been planted [1] to create new areas of woodland, including [1]
             commercial forestry plantations (reforestation) [1].
            The introduction of a moratorium (or strict control) on forest clearance [1],
             which allows natural forest regrowth to occur faster than clearance. [1]
            Designation of protected areas such as National Parks [1], such as those of
             Yunan Province, China, provide protection and allow the expansion of forests
             [1].

           Possible operational approaches could include:
            conservation to protect wildlife
            prevent soil erosion
            increase the carbon sink
            encourage tourism
            disaster prevention in mountainous areas
            less land required for farming.
                                              –9–                M17/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Explain two consequences of the reduction of biodiversity in some tropical rainforests. [2+2]

      In each case, award [1] for a valid consequence and [1] for
      explanation/exemplification.

      Possible consequences include:
       loss of biomedical resources (actual or potential)
       reduced genetic diversity
       adverse impacts on way of life for some indigenous peoples
       adverse impacts on regional water and/or food supplies.
       extinction of species
       loss of natural resources
       reduction in value for ecotourism.

      For example:
      Loss of potential biomedical resources [1], with resultant adverse impacts for
      population and economy [1].

      Less genetic diversity [1] leading to loss of ecological resilience
      when coping with climate change [1].

4.   Patterns in resource consumption

     (a)   State and outline the units used to measure the global ecological footprint.           [2]

           Units: Global hectares (Gha; accept Global hectares/person) [1].

           Outline: area of land and water required to produce the resources consumed [1].

     (b)   Suggest two reasons why the total ecological footprint of a country may grow very
           rapidly in the future.                                                               [2+2]

           For each distinct, valid reason, award [1] for the reason and [1] for
           development/exemplification.

           Possible reasons include:
            increase in living standards [1] – rise in use of non-renewable resources
             required to fulfil higher living standards [1]
            industrialization of the economy [1] – industrial development or
             industrialization of agriculture consume more mineral resources for fertilizer
            rise in population [1] – each extra person requires food/energy / has to
             dispose of waste
            rise of consumerism [1] – people want more disposable goods which
             increases use of resources
            Urban sprawl [1] – urban dwellers consume more energy resources for
             transport.

           For example:
           The rise in wealth [1] of the people of China means that they can afford more
           consumer goods which take up more resources such as oil and minerals [1].

           Some countries have seen a large increase in population size [1]. These have to be
           fed which takes up more land for agriculture [1].

     (c)   Explain the neo-Malthusian view of the relationship between population and
           resource consumption.                                                                  [4]

           Award [1] for each valid point:
            human population has a carrying capacity [1]
            because it increases geometrically while resources increase arithmetically [1]
            population growth outstrips available resources which leads to famine [1]
            leading to a check/crash/adjustment [1]
           This constitutes the Malthusian approach (maximum [2]).

            neo-Malthusians such as Erlich/Club of Rome [1]
            increase in environmental degradation [1]
            thus a need for population control [1]

           Other valid points may be credited.

           Award a maximum of [2] for answers that only consider a Malthusian approach – for
           full marks, points from the neo-Malthusian view are needed.

5.   Discuss the main reasons why attempts to reduce socio-economic disparities
     sometimes fail.                                                                           [15]

     There are a number of possible approaches to this question that may address
     disparities at a variety of scales.

     Responses are likely to touch on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
     initiatives, remittances, trade, debt relief, aid and market access as “attempts” to
     reduce socio-economic disparities. An examination of the factors that dilute or hamper
     these attempts would be expected. It is possible that responses look at two or three of
     these attempts and address their disadvantages in relation to their advantages as
     development tools. Alternatively, responses may focus on the reasons why they fail or
     succeed. Likely reasons that can be addressed are numerous and will depend on the
     examples used. Possibilities include: population growth diluting progress made in
     some regions; inappropriate and/or inadequate aid; dependency; protectionism; food
     dumping; falling commodity prices; debt; charges to remittances; environmental issues;
     youthful populations; lack of gender empowerment, international financial institutions,
     etc.

     At band D, responses are likely to describe some of the reasons why some of the
     attempts to reduce disparities fail.

     At band E, responses are likely to give either detailed explanation of reasons/attempts
     to reduce socio economic disparities or an evidence-based, structured discussion of
     what could be considered the main reasons for failure or success.

     At band F, expect both.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

6.   “Climate change will only increase global disparities in wealth.” Discuss this statement.   [15]

     There are many possible approaches to this question, and each should be marked on
     its merits.

     It is hoped that candidates will interpret global climate change as having a wider
     meaning than “global warming”. The disparities in wealth may be considered at any
     scale: regional, national or sub-national. Effects may be due to higher temperatures,
     change in rainfall amounts or timing, rising sea levels, and may impact the
     environment, population, settlement and economic activities. Effects may include:
     changes in farmland productivity; loss of tourism earnings; reduction in water quality
     and/or availability; population migration; change in distribution of natural vegetation
     zones; increased incidence of climatic hazards.

     Discussion of the statement may have a number of approaches: there could be a
     discussion of the positive and negative impacts of climate change on wealth; a
     discussion of the magnitude of the impacts of climate change on wealth; a discussion
     of geographical variations in the impacts of climate change on wealth; a discussion of
     how the impacts of climate change on wealth vary over time; or a discussion of how the
     impacts of climate change on wealth vary with access to technology/investment.
     Accept other valid discussions.

     Responses at band D are likely to describe ways in which climate change could affect
     the wealth of different people and places.

     At band E, expect either more detailed explanation of how climate change could increase
     and/or decrease the wealth of different people/places or a structured discussion of the
     concept of global disparities in the context of climate change from a positive and/or
     negative viewpoint.

     At band F, expect both.

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

7.   Examine the changing importance of oil as an energy source.                                  [15]

     Answers should focus on the recent changing importance (production/consumption) of
     oil. This may be relative to the changing use of other sources, or in relation to
     consumption trends and conservation.

     Answers should recognize that the global demand for oil is increasing as populations
     grow and countries develop economically. Some quantitative or qualitative detail would
     be expected in terms of explaining and comparing the changed importance. There
     may be some discussion of the price of oil which, at the writing of this in January 2016
     has fallen to below $30 a barrel. This “cheap” oil will boost its importance as an energy
     source at the expense of many cleaner alternatives.

     Responses could briefly look at the importance of oil in relation to other non-renewable
     fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas and renewable energy sources. It is also
     possible that they look at new sources of oil, eg tar sands extraction in Canada, or
     fracking and the revolution that it has brought to US energy security.

     Responses may address the externalities of oil production. The importance of oil has
     been impacted on by environmental damage caused by spills and pollution resulting
     from extraction. There are also geopolitical consequences of oil production when
     exploration for new sources causes conflict between nations.

     Answers may also refer to any scale (local, national, regional, global), but this is not a
     requirement for the award of full marks.

     Students whose world view of the importance of oil are outdated but still in line with
     their lifetime or in line with text book material should not be penalized.

     At band D expect description of the importance of oil as an energy source over time.

     At band E expect either detailed explanation of the changing importance of oil
     (probably in relation to other sources) or some examination of what is meant by
     “importance” (may examine trends for different countries/regions, or contrast local and
     global scales).

     At band F, expect both.
