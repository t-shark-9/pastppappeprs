                              Relief as Kenya raises tariff for steel and iron imports

          Steel manufacturers in Kenya are set to benefit as the government moves to protect the local
           manufacturing industry from cheap steel and iron imports.

          In 2014 a government official announced an increased tariff on steel and iron imports.
           “Our steel mills are closing down due to unfair competition from cheaper imported iron
           and steel products,” he explained. “To protect and create more jobs in the iron and steel
           industries, tariffs on a wide range of imported iron and steel products will be increased
           from 0 % and 10 % to 25 %,” he said.  The government official further stated that as well as
           protecting the local industries from cheaper imports, the protectionist measures would raise
           an additional 2.6 billion Kenyan shillings (Kenya’s currency) annually in government revenue
           and support economic growth.

          The potential of local industries to expand and create jobs through trade has been held back
           by a number of administrative barriers.  The government remains focused on improving the
           business environment.  Over the past six months, the government has made it easier to
           register a company and trade across borders.  The time taken to move goods out of the main
           harbour has fallen sharply; non-tariff barriers such as roadblocks have also been reduced.  
           Importers of refined industrial sugar and wheat are also pleased after the government
           scrapped requirements to pay unnecessary administrative charges.

          However, there is a belief among manufacturers that there is a need for more deregulation to
           lower their costs of production and in effect reduce the cost of doing business.



                       Kenya sees gross domestic product (GDP) growth picking up but
                                           current account a concern

          Good economic growth rates in neighbouring countries like Uganda help to boost Kenyan
           exports, particularly for agriculture that makes up nearly a quarter of the Kenyan economy.
           The government suggests that the main risks to growth are the slow performance of
           developed economies that are key export markets for Kenyan goods and services, and
           Kenya’s large and persistent current account deficit of over 10 % of gross domestic product
           (GDP) in the last three years. This is a major concern for sustained economic growth and
           the value of the Kenyan shilling.

                           Australian economy feels the effects of falling iron ore price

              Iron ore is Australia’s largest export and the double effect of slowing growth in China and
               higher levels of production in Australia has driven the price of iron ore lower.  In addition, the
               Australian dollar (AU$) has experienced a 10 % depreciation against the US dollar (US$).
               These two factors combined have caused a dramatic worsening in the current account.

              Australian mining companies are losing significant revenue from falling commodity prices and
               this is further worsened by the rapidly depreciating currency. The Australian dollar traded at
               US$0.7375 on Wednesday, nearly at a six-year low.

              Australia recorded a monthly balance of trade deficit of AU$2.61 billion in May 2015,
               compared with a deficit of AU$1.61 billion a year earlier.  The increasing deficit in Australia’s
               balance of trade is an indicator of potential declines in growth and employment, according to
               a foreign currency expert.

              The price of iron ore has fallen more than 67 % between February 2013 and July 2015.
               In Australia, falling iron ore prices create downward pressure on economic growth.
               Australia’s real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 2 % in 2015, down from 2.5 % in 2014.
               Some economists noted that falling commodity prices reduced Australia’s export revenues by
               more than 2 % of GDP in 2015.

              An expanding group of Australian-based economists argue that the central bank should
               further cut interest rates because of global economic uncertainty, falling commodity prices,
               weak consumer demand, and persistent weakness in non-mining sectors, such as tourism
               and education exports. Australia has been a popular destination for tourists and attracts
               many international students.

                                                 Angola

       Angola’s economy is driven by its oil sector.  It is the second largest oil producer in Africa.  
        Oil production and its supporting activities contribute about 50 % of gross domestic product
        (GDP), more than 70 % of government revenue and more than 90 % of the country’s exports.  
        Diamonds contribute an additional 5 % to exports.  Subsistence agriculture provides the main
        livelihood for most people in Angola, but half of the country’s food is still imported.

       Since 2005, the Angolan government has borrowed billions of US dollars from China,
        Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain and the European Union (EU) to help rebuild Angola’s
        infrastructure. The global recession that started in 2008 slowed economic growth.
        In particular, lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global recession slowed GDP
        growth to 2.4 % in 2009, and many construction projects stopped.

       Falling oil prices and slower than expected growth in non-oil sectors have reduced growth
        prospects for 2015.  Angola has responded by reducing government subsidies and by
        proposing import quotas and making it more difficult to import.  Domestic fuel subsidies have
        been eliminated. Corruption, especially in the mining sector, is a major long-term challenge.



                                                Namibia

       Namibia’s economy is heavily dependent on the mining and processing of minerals for
        export.  Mining accounts for 11.5 % of GDP, but provides more than 50 % of foreign exchange
        earnings. Namibia is a primary source for high-quality diamonds. In addition, Namibia is the
        world’s fifth-largest producer of uranium, produces large quantities of zinc and is a smaller
        producer of gold and copper. The mining sector employs less than 2 % of the population.
        Namibia normally imports about 50 % of its grain requirements.

       A high per capita GDP, relative to the region, hides one of the world’s most unequal income
        distributions. The Namibian economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian
        dollar pegged one-to-one to the South African rand.  Namibia receives 30 % to 40 % of its
        revenues from the countries in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Angola is not
        a member of the SACU.

       Namibia’s economy remains vulnerable to world commodity price fluctuations and
        drought.  The rising cost of mining diamonds, increasingly from the sea, has reduced profit
        margins.  Namibian authorities recognize these issues and have emphasized the need for
        diversification.

                                              Sri Lanka’s economic reforms

          After Sri Lanka’s 25-year civil war ended in 2009 it became one of the world’s fast-growing
           emerging markets, helped by billions of US dollars worth of infrastructure investment from
           China.  Sri Lanka’s new government plans to implement a range of market-oriented policies
           to open up its financial system, liberalize the Sri Lankan rupee (Sri Lanka’s currency) and
           make new trade deals with both India and China.

          Sri Lankan economists and corporate leaders are urging “tough” economic decisions,
           reducing the bureaucracy and eliminating costly inefficiencies in state enterprises.  
           300 state-owned firms dominate the economy, and there is pressure for them to enhance
           their competitiveness.  One realistic option is a policy of privatization. Another policy is
           the establishment of 46 economic zones across the country with low tax rates. This should
           encourage the private sector to invest in setting up these zones.

          Improving infrastructure is also a priority.  Power supply is unreliable and broadband speeds
           are slow in rural areas.

          Another priority is to reduce controls on exchanging currency.  Sri Lankans find it difficult
           to obtain foreign exchange, limiting tourism and business overseas.  Improving access to
           foreign currencies would make people’s lives easier and encourage more business.

          On a positive note, improved international relations has increased tourism.  To take
           advantage of this, the government should now implement a strategy to further promote
           tourism.

          A major challenge for the government is that more than 25 % of the population lives below
           US$2.50 per day.  This is caused largely by the fact that 30 % of the population is involved in
           agriculture, which contributes less than 10 % of gross domestic product. In addition, tackling
           youth unemployment and increasing household incomes are challenges.

          But perhaps the greatest problem confronting the government is the country’s massive
           debt burden, which is equivalent to 700 % of its tax revenue.  This creates a significant debt
           servicing problem, especially because much of the debt is foreign owned.  

          Another problem is a current account crisis. Sri Lanka needs to replace its reliance on
           payments from Sri Lankans employed overseas with export revenues.  And instead of relying
           on borrowing from overseas to finance its current account deficit, the country needs to attract
           foreign direct investment.

          There is also a need for the government to try to improve the ability for companies to do
           business, such as by reducing the time it takes to register a business and by improving
           access to credit for small companies, which would significantly stimulate the economy.  
           Business confidence has to improve in order to stimulate new investments and economic
           growth.
