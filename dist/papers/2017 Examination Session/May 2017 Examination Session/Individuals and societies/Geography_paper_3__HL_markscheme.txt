1.   (a)   Explain how the actions of world trading organizations and financial institutions
           (such as the International Monetary Fund) influence global financial flows.              [10]

           AO1/2 Indicative content
           Credit reference to the IMF, World Bank, WTO, New Development Bank (NDB),
           China Development Bank. Also credit trading blocs/MGOs such as ASEAN, APEC,
           NAFTA and EU/EEA.

           Financial flows may include:
            loans (with structural adjustment programmes)
            commodities (with the WTO encouraging free trade)
            remittances (linked with EU rules; or development policies of the World Bank)
            movements of capital and FDI (made easier by EU or NAFTA, etc)
            aid flows (providing this can be linked with the work of world trading organizations
              and financial institutions).

           Credit other valid flows and institutions.

           Good answers might provide data and evidence for financial flows or they may offer
           a structured (AO4) explanation of how different institutions influence different types
           of flow. Another approach might be to explain financial flows in ways that show they
           are sometimes interrelated and could influence one another (lending can help a
           country to develop, in turn attracting FDI; this in turn may encourage migration and
           remittances).

           For band C (4–6), two financial flows should be outlined and linked weakly with the
           influence/actions of one or more financial institutions.

           For band D (7–8), expect a structured, well-evidenced analysis of
            either two or more detailed financial flows
            or detailed actions/ influence of different named institutions

           For band E (9–10), expect both band D traits.

(b)   Discuss the economic and environmental consequences of more people choosing
      to buy locally produced food and goods rather than globalized products.             [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Possible AO1/2 indicative content

      Themes for synthesis from the geography guide include:
       fewer food miles
       reduced carbon/ecological footprint / climate change mitigation
       less trade/financial flows between core/periphery (de-globalization)
       renewed economic growth in localities where local production is renewed
       rejection of globalization production / TNCs / falling profits for agribusiness
       reduced interdependency between countries
       protectionism / isolation / less need for MGOs.

      Answers scoring highly according to the AO3 criteria for evaluation:
       might be structured around different kinds of geographical consequences (eg
         consequences for old producer and new producer regions; costs and benefits for
         different groups/places)
       might systematically discuss the effects of changes for different types of
         globalized product.

      For band C (5–8), expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant
      economic and/or environmental themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12), expect
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced and
         well-focused themes from the geography guide (both economic and
         environmental)
       or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15), expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the role civil societies play in national resistance to global
           interactions.                                                                              [10]

           AO1/2 Indicative content
           Civil society is defined in the geography guide as: “Any organization or movement
           that works in the area between the household, the private sector and the state to
           negotiate matters of public concern. Civil societies include non-governmental
           organizations (NGOs), community groups, trade unions, academic institutions and
           faith-based organizations.”

           Citizens can:
            form anti-globalization movements and groups (eg Occupy)
            vote for/establish nationalist parties/policies (anti-immigration eg UKIP; resource
               nationalism)
            support local sourcing or other initiatives
            organize resistance movements against globalization/global
               capitalism/modernity which are informed by their ethnicity/identity (eg First
               Nations in Canada; Ogoni in Nigeria; Amish in USA).

           Credit other valid forms of civil society resistance in particular national contexts.

           Do not credit government or state actions. Do not credit actions of TNCs.

           Good answers are likely to provide detailed exemplification. They are also likely to
           make a better effort to analyse “the role” that citizens/organizations play in
           determining how a country/government responds to global interactions/globalization
           (direct and indirect, or lawful and illegal means, for example). Or they may be more
           selective in the way they analyse global interactions (eg by breaking this concept
           into constituent parts such as flows of migrants, imports, data, etc).

           For band C (4–6), an outline should be provided of either the general resistance role of
           civil society or two weakly-evidenced examples of civil society resistance.

           For band D (7–8), expect a structured, well-evidenced analysis of
            either two or more detailed examples of civil society resistance
            or the varied ways civil society plays a role in resisting global interactions.

           For band E (9–10), expect both band D traits.

(b)   Examine the ways in which the world’s cities and their societies are becoming
      increasingly uniform.                                                                     [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Possible AO1/2 Indicative content

      Uniformity in this context refers to global homogeneity, ie all places coming to
      resemble one another through the adoption of common visual styles and forms.
      While it can be argued that many cities are becoming increasingly uniform, the
      proposition needs to be examined more carefully in the context of societies (many of
      which now have record levels of diversity due to migration).

                   Themes for synthesis from the geography guide include:urban
          landscape/styles
         migrants/diaspora/ethnic neighbourhoods
         presence of TNCs/logos/brands
         cultural uniformity (languages spoken, foods consumed, restaurants)
         technology and the “global village” and time–space compression.

      Do not over-credit answers that argue against the proposition that places are
      becoming uniform: this is not asked for. However, it is perfectly acceptable to reflect
      critically on the degree of uniformity as part of the examination of the statement.

      Answers scoring highly according to the AO3 criteria for evaluation:
       might be structured around an examination of different aspects and degrees of
         uniformity (eg contrasts entirely homogenous “clone towns” with cities that have
         retained a greater degree of including character/heritage, and some examination
         of the reasons for this)
       might examine more carefully the distinction between the city landscape and the
         actual societies that live there (which can be very diverse, despite an apparently
         “uniform” landscape).

      For band C (5–8), expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes
      from the geography guide which focus on how cities/societies are becoming uniform.

      For band D (9–12), expect
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced and
         well-focused themes from the geography guide
       or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15), expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Explain why the increasing needs of some countries for one or more raw materials
           are a cause of environmental concern.                                                 [10]

           AO1/2 Indicative content

           Raw material(s) can include timber, copper, soya, oil, shale gas etc.
           An account focused only on water should not progress beyond [6].
            The environmental concerns should clearly relate to the raw material chosen.
            There may be local and global dimensions (deforestation causing local
             degradation in addition to rising global carbon emissions).
            The countries/markets for the raw material can be identified.

           Good answers may explain explicitly why there is concern over the increasing
           demand made by certain countries and may provide evidence to support this
           (eg China’s predicted growth in demand). Another approach might be to structure
           the explanation carefully around different categories of environmental concern.

           For band C (4–6), an outline should be provided of either environmental
           problems/concerns linked with using raw material(s) or the needs of some countries.

           For band D (7–8), expect a structured, evidenced analysis of
            either detailed environmental concerns linked with raw material(s) use/demand
            or the increasing resource needs for specified countries.

           For band E (9–10), expect both band D traits.

(b)   “People living in the world’s most peripheral regions do not experience a ‘shrinking
      world’.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?                                [15]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Possible AO1/2 indicative content

      Peripheral regions: this is a contested term and is open to a variety of
      interpretations, ranging from isolated tribes, to landlocked African nations, to India
      and China (in relation to the G7/8 global “core”). Credit the “political periphery” of
      North Korea also. Each approach should be judged on its merits in terms of
      supporting evidence and argument.

      Shrinking world: this refers to the way distant places are perceived to be nearer due
      to falling transport times and the instantaneous nature of electronic communications
      and data transfers.

      Themes for synthesis from the geography guide include:
       Even peripheral places are connected to global/regional internet/mobile networks.
       Peripheral places are connected to the core via flows of aid (including internet
        donations following disasters).
       The global spread of consumerism affects even peripheral places through the
        availability of imported food and goods.
       Media corporations have fostered widespread consumption of films and TV.
       Peripheral societies are visited by tourists.
       Exposure to global movements of pollution/waste may foster the sense of a
        shrinking world.

      Answers scoring highly according to the AO3 criteria for evaluation:
       might be structured around different strands of the shrinking world effect, eg use
         of transport, arrival of tourists, exposure to information flows
       might reflect critically on what is meant by “most peripheral”, who lives there,
         and the extent to which different groups of people in peripheral areas have
         differing experiences/perspectives on a shrinking world
       might reflect on the extent to which the world’s poor are sometimes compelled to
         travel as refugees or economic migrants, often considerable distances; while
         poor places are visited by representatives of the wealthy (charities, agencies),
         which provides some sense of “shrinking world” to both parties.

      For band C (5–8), expect weakly-evidenced outlining of two or three relevant
      shrinking world/globalization themes from the geography guide.

      For band D (9–12), expect
       either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced and
         well-focused themes from the geography guide
       or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation).

      For band E (13–15), expect both of these traits.
