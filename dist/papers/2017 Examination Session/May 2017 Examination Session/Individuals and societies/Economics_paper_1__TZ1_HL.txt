Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain how the overuse of common access resources can lead to negative
           externalities.                                                                            [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that the best way to reduce the threat to sustainability, arising from
           the burning of fossil fuels, is for the government to provide subsidies to firms that
           produce energy through renewable sources.                                                 [15]


2.   (a)   Explain why a loss-making firm in perfect competition would shut down in the long run.    [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that perfect competition is a more desirable market structure than
           monopoly.                                                                                 [15]

                                              Section B

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain the impact that a fall in the world price of oil might have on aggregate supply
           and gross domestic product (GDP) in an economy.                                           [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the view that economic growth is best achieved through improvements in
           technology.                                                                               [15]


4.   (a)   Explain why a high rate of inflation may negatively affect both a country’s export
           competitiveness and the level of capital investment by firms.                             [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that the use of monetary policy is always the best way to reduce
           inflation.                                                                                [15]
