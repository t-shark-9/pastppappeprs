                                              Section A
Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one effect of neurotransmission on human behaviour.                                    [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account that clearly
     illustrates one effect of neurotransmission on human behaviour.

     Examples of responses include, but are not limited to:
      the role of serotonin in depression
      the role of acetylcholine in memory
      the role of dopamine in addiction
      the role of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in attention.

     Studies may be presented, but the focus of the response should be on the effects of
     neurotransmission on behaviour and not on the description of a study.

     Animal research may be used to describe an effect of neurotransmission, but the
     response must then be linked to human behaviour. If there is no explicit example of a link
     to human behaviour, a maximum of [5] may be awarded.

     If a candidate describes more than one effect of neurotransmission, credit should be given
     only to the first effect described. If a candidate describes one effect that involves several
     neurotransmitters (for example, Fisher on the role of neurotransmission in human
     attraction) this would be acceptable as the focus of the question is on neurotransmission.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Describe one ethical consideration related to one research study at the cognitive level
     of analysis.                                                                                          [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one ethical
     consideration in relation to one research study at the cognitive level of analysis. Ethical
     considerations can be positive (what guidelines could be followed) or negative (what guidelines
     were not followed).

     Ethical considerations which may be discussed include, but are not limited to:
      deception
      protection from physical or mental harm
      briefing and debriefing
      right to withdraw from a study
      informed consent
      anonymity/confidentiality.

     Research studies could include studies that investigate biological or sociocultural factors that affect
     cognitive process. However, responses should clearly relate the study to the cognitive level of analysis
     and must focus on the cognitive aspects of the research.

     Responses should make a clear link between the study at the cognitive level of analysis and the ethical
     consideration. If there is no explicit link between the study and the ethical consideration, award up to a
     maximum of [6].

     If a candidate describes more than one ethical consideration in relation to one or more research studies,
     credit should be given only to the first ethical consideration described in relation to the first research
     study used. Candidates may briefly refer to another ethical consideration or considerations but this
     should only be in the context of one ethical consideration that is explicitly described.

     If a candidate describes one ethical consideration without making reference to one research study from
     the cognitive level of analysis, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [4].

     If a candidate describes a study but one ethical consideration is not explicitly addressed, up to a
     maximum of [3] should be awarded.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   Describe one explanation for the formation of stereotypes.                                        [8]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one explanation
     for the formation of stereotypes.

     Research explaining the formation of stereotypes may include but is not limited to:
      Tajfel’s (1969) social categorization theory (stereotypes acting as cognitive schemas in
       information processing)
      Campbell’s (1967) theory of gatekeepers and the grain of truth hypothesis
      Hamilton and Gifford’s (1976) illusory correlation theory
      conformity to dominant social representations (Rogers and Frantz, 1962)
      realistic conflict theory (Sherif)
      social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner)
      the Princeton trilogy studies.

     If a candidate describes more than one explanation of the formation of stereotypes, credit
     should be given only to the first description.

     Whether a theory and/or a study is presented, a clear link to the formation of stereotypes must
     be made for full marks to be awarded.

     If a candidate only presents a relevant study without making reference to the formation of
     stereotypes, up to a maximum of [3] should be awarded.

                                              Section B
4.   Discuss the use of one or more brain imaging technologies in investigating the relationship
     between biological factors and behaviour.                                                        [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the use of
     one or more brain imaging technologies in investigating the relationship between biological
     factors and behaviour.

     Brain imaging technologies could include, but are not limited to:
      CT (computerized tomography)
      PET (positron emission tomography)
      MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
      fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)
      EEG (electroencephalography).

     Candidates may refer to studies such as:
      Corkin (1997) using MRI to investigate the effect of damage to HM’s medial temporal
       lobes and the effect on memory formation.
      Brefczynski-Lewis et al.’s (2007) study to investigate the effect of meditation on the brain
       using fMRI.
      Maguire et al.’s (2000) study using MRI scans to investigate spatial ability and neuroplasticity
       in taxi drivers.
      Ogden’s (2005) study using CT scans to investigate the effect of brain damage on
       hemineglect.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
      how brain imaging technologies have changed and furthered the study of behaviour
      differences in why and how different technologies are used
      evaluation of the techniques (for example, cost/benefit analysis, reductionism)
      ethical and methodological considerations in the use of the technology.

     The focus of the response must be on how brain imaging technology is used to
     understand the relationship between biological factors and behaviour. Although an
     understanding of how the technology functions may be included, it is not required for top
     marks to be awarded.

     Candidates may discuss one brain imaging technology in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss more than one brain imaging technology in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may address one biological factor, or more than one. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

5.   Discuss how social and/or cultural factors affect one cognitive process.                        [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of how social and/or
     cultural factors affect one cognitive process. As the concepts of social and cultural factors
     are arguably very much related, a distinction between the two is not necessary.

     Candidates should give a considered review of the way in which social and/or cultural
     factors affect how people process information, for example, memory, thinking, perception,
     attention, decision-making or language.

     Examples of appropriate factors include, but are not limited to:
      the effect of cultural norms and past experience on memory (Bartlett, 1932)
      the effect of social identity on formation of flashbulb memories (Luminet and Curci,
       2009)
      the effect of schooling on encoding strategies (Cole and Scribner, 1974)
      the effect of cultural upbringing on memories of self (Wang, 2006)
      the effect of poverty on cognitive processing, in particular free recall tasks (Mani, 2013;
       Pollitt, 1995)
      the role of environmental factors on perception (Deregowski, 1972; Segall et al.’s
       carpentered world hypothesis, 1966).

     Discussion of the cultural and/or social factors may include, but is not limited to:
      Methodological considerations
      Empirical support and contrary findings
      Application of empirical findings.

     If a candidate discusses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to the
     first discussion.

     If a candidate discusses only one social and/or cultural factor, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5] for criterion A and a maximum of [2] for criterion C.

     Candidates may discuss a small number of factors in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of factors in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

6.   Discuss the role of one or more cultural dimensions on human behaviour.                          [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the role of
     one or more cultural dimensions on human behaviour.

     Cultural dimensions include, but are not limited to:
      power distance: the way people perceive power differences and how they react to
       power relations
      individualism versus collectivism: how much people define themselves apart from their
       group memberships
      masculinity versus femininity: differences between “masculine” and “feminine” cultures
      uncertainty avoidance: society’s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity
      long-term versus short-term orientation (Confucian dynamism): time perspective in a
       society for the gratification of people’s needs
      monochronous versus polychronous time orientation: another form of time perspective
       in which punctuality, deadlines, and future orientation affect behaviour.

     It is important that candidates make a link between cultural dimension(s) and human
     behaviour, demonstrating how the selected cultural dimensions affect human behaviour.
     For example, when discussing the role of individualism and collectivism, responses may
     address human behaviour such as conformity, attribution, compliance or depression.
     When discussing the role of masculinity and femininity, responses may refer to gender
     roles, competitiveness, materialism or human relationships. When discussing the role of
     Confucian dynamism, responses may refer to how it affects management leadership,
     creative behaviour, identification with workplace, perseverance, and/or respect for tradition.

     If a candidate addresses one or more cultural dimensions but does not explicitly link any
     of these to human behaviour, the response should be awarded up to a maximum of [5] for
     criterion A, knowledge and comprehension, up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B , critical
     thinking, and up to a maximum of [2] for criterion C, organization.

     Discussion may include but is not limited to:
      methodological and ethical issues
      empirical evidence
      application of the findings
      alternative explanations.

     Candidates may discuss one cultural dimension in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of cultural dimensions in order to demonstrate
     breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
