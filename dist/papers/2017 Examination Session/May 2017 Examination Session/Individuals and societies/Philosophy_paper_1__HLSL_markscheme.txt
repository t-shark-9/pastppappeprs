How to use the Diploma Programme Philosophy markscheme

The assessment markbands constitute the formal tool for marking examination scripts, and in these
assessment markbands examiners can see the skills being assessed in the examinations. The
markschemes are designed to assist examiners in possible routes taken by candidates in terms of the
content of their answers when demonstrating their skills of doing philosophy through their responses.
The points listed are not compulsory points, and not necessarily the best possible points. They are a
framework to help examiners contextualize the requirements of the question, and to facilitate the
application of marks according to the assessment markbands listed on page 5 for the core theme and
page 8 for the optional themes.

It is important that examiners understand that the main idea of the course is to promote doing
philosophy, and this involves activity and engagement throughout a two-year programme, as opposed to
emphasizing the chance to display knowledge in a terminal set of examination papers. Even in the
examinations, responses should not be assessed on how much candidates know as much as how they
are able to use their knowledge in support of an argument, using the skills referred to in the various
assessment markbands published in the subject guide, reflecting an engagement with philosophical
activity throughout the course. As a tool intended to help examiners in assessing responses, the
following points should be kept in mind when using a markscheme:

• The Diploma Programme Philosophy course is designed to encourage the skills of doing philosophy
  in the candidates. These skills can be accessed through reading the assessment markbands in the
  subject guide
• The markscheme does not intend to outline a model/correct answer
• The markscheme has an introductory paragraph which contextualizes the emphasis of the question
  being asked
• The bullet points below the paragraph are suggested possible points of development that should not
  be considered a prescriptive list but rather an indicative list where they might appear in the answer
• If there are names of philosophers and references to their work incorporated into the markscheme,
  this should help to give context for the examiners and does not reflect a requirement that such
  philosophers and references should appear in an answer: They are possible lines of development.
• Candidates can legitimately select from a wide range of ideas, arguments and concepts in service of
  the question they are answering, and it is possible that candidates will use material effectively that is
  not mentioned in the markscheme
• Examiners should be aware of the command terms for Philosophy as published on page 54 of the
  Philosophy subject guide when assessing responses
• In Paper 1, examiners must be aware that a variety of types of answers and approaches, as well as a
  freedom to choose a variety of themes, is expected. Thus, examiners should not penalize different
  styles of answers or different selections of content when candidates develop their response to the
  questions. The markscheme should not imply that a uniform response is expected
• In markschemes for the core theme questions in Paper 1 (section A) the bullet points suggest
  possible routes of response to the stimulus, but it is critical for examiners to understand that the
  selection of the philosophical issue raised by the stimulus, is entirely at the choice of the candidate so
  it is possible for material to gain credit from the examiner even if none of the material features in the
  markscheme.

           minimal focus on the task.
          The philosophical issue raised by the stimulus material is implied but not explicitly
           identified. There is minimal or no explanation of how the issue relates to the stimulus

           material or links to the question of what it is to be human.
          There is little relevant knowledge demonstrated, and the explanation is superficial.
           Philosophical vocabulary is not used, or is consistently used inappropriately.
          The essay is descriptive and lacking in analysis.
          There is some attempt to follow a structured approach although it is not always clear what
           the answer is trying to convey.
          The philosophical issue raised by the stimulus material is implied but not explicitly

        The philosophical issue raised by the stimulus material is explicitly identified. There is a
         well-developed justification of how the issue relates to the stimulus material and to the
         question of what it is to be human.
        The response contains relevant, accurate and detailed knowledge. There is a
 21–25
         well-developed explanation of the issue. There is appropriate use of philosophical

Core theme: Being human

1.   Excerpt from Sex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexuality                          [25]

     The following paragraphs provide only a framework to help examiners in their assessment of
     responses to this question. Examiners should be responsive to a variety of philosophical
     perspectives and approaches. Examiners should be aware that candidates might respond to this
     passage in a variety of ways including ones not mentioned in the summary below.

     This question requires candidates to identify and discuss philosophical issues and/or concepts in
     the text related to the question of what it is to be human. Responses may focus on: Various
     concepts of human nature, or lack of one; the degrees of freedom or determinism that arise from
     particular views of human nature; individuality and a common human nature; the
     repression/suppression of certain aspects of human nature and its consequences; human nature in
     contrast to the human condition.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Are we fated to live according to “our” nature?
      What are these wild and dangerous roots? Are they dispositions, or traits, or instincts? Are they
        necessary for survival or do they promote higher activities, like art?
      Possible use of Freud as an explanation of drives and role of the id/unconscious
      Even if the assumptions in the text are true, should we not be on constant vigil to remove these
        dangerous traits?
      If I can act only according to my nature, then what is the level of my responsibility for
        my actions?
      Existentialism and other views as a contrast which propose that there is no essential
        human nature
      The extent of human freedom: Can I really change if I am destined to inherit the same cultural
        or genetic traits?
      Repression of instincts and desires and the birth of civilisation (Freud)
      The individual commitment to a ‘Social Contract’, which might also repress instinct and desires
      Non-Western responses to the question of human nature, eg Buddhism claims that the desire is
        cause of human suffering
      What is the root cause of alienation from others and ourselves? Some psychoanalysts, like
        Lacan, claim a basic human drive and experience of life is one of a profound “lack”, a desire
        never fulfilled
      Are we all noble savages?
      Theistic views invoke God as the ultimate creator and so is responsible for our human nature.
        Why would he/she make something with “built-in” dangers?

2.   Image of lady and identity masks                                                                     [25]

     The following paragraphs provide only a framework to help examiners in their assessment of
     responses to this question. Examiners should be responsive to a variety of philosophical
     perspectives and approaches. Examiners should be aware that candidates might respond to this
     passage in a variety of ways including ones not mentioned in the summary below.

     This question requires candidates to identify and discuss philosophical issues and/or concepts in
     the picture related to the question of what it is to be human. Responses are likely to focus on what
     we can know of others and ourselves that persists over time, how identity is revealed to others and
     the self in stages; different identities in different contexts; the role of gender, religion, language,
     environment in the formation of identity; the assumption of a core self only known to the individual.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      The public and private natures of personal identity suggest a social construction or at least
        social mediation of identity
      Identity and role playing: Child, sibling, spouse, employee, employer, etc
      The criteria for personal re-identification in contrast to the criteria of others
      What is it to be a person? What is the extent of this notion? Could animals or machines be
        persons? What are the defining features of being a person or human?
      The extent to which being part of a race, sex, language or religion is (and should be
        acknowledged as) constitutive of the individuals’ and communities’ identity
      If it is the case that my identity is made meaningful by others, then what are my responsibilities
        toward others? Toward myself? Which has priority, and when?
      Is it the case that if I find my identity via others, I must already have a concept of self in order to
        recognise the otherness of others? Is it more correct to say that others complete my identity?
      What is it about myself that I learn from others? Is it something essentially universal, or is it all a
        matter of identity being culturally defined? Would I be the same person in another culture?
      What are the factors that shape gender identity? Is the feminine constructed by patriarchal
        language, and so trapped by the constructions of others? Is there space for identity outside of
        language?
      From where does my sense of individuality stem? Is it different to my self-awareness? How
        important is social conformity to identity?
      Is the self a set of masks that we use in different situations? Are we really ciphers, or tabulae
        rasae that can be constantly overwritten?
      Gender as performance. Femininity (and masculinity) as social construction(s). The masks of
        gender, and the compulsions to “be happy”, wear a happy face, please others, be pleasant.
        Femininity as performance.

                                                Section B

Optional theme 1: Aesthetics

3.   Evaluate Dewey’s claim that art is the “beauty parlour (salon) of civilization” – the space
     where civilization portrays itself.                                                         [25]

     This question invites an analysis of the function of art as a means to an end or as an end in itself.
     The quotation, from John Dewey’s Art as Experience (1934), implies a specific view of art as
     strictly connected to society, politics and, in wider terms, civilization. Dewey considers art as a part
     of the societal whole, with an active role, particularly in the political and moral fields. Art is not
     autonomous or independent from any kind of judgment, since it embodies political and moral
     values or can produce political and moral effects. Analogously, the assumption of such a
     connection between art and society puts the former in the conditions of being a possible tool for
     politics or economics: Art can be used for the sake of political or economic interests or, generally,
     for the sake of specific powers. Responses might evaluate whether art is connected to society or
     not and offer historical cases of censorship or propaganda (eg in totalitarian regimes), religious
     uses of art (painting, music, sculpture, and so on), or civic uses of art (eg industrial or urban
     architecture), according to a conception of an everyday “art as experience”, in contrast with
     “a museum conception of art”. In Dewey’s view, it is possible to gauge the quality of life or the
     level of development of a society by its art: The beauty or ugliness of its buildings, the use of
     landscapes, the exploitation of land, the people’s possibilities of expressing creativity and
     imagination, and so on. Of course, responses might well criticise the view of art having a social
     function: The autonomy of the artist, the role of inspiration, creativity, and imagination, the
     possibility/impossibility of any kind of judgment, the role of the observer and the importance of
     perception might all be possible patterns. Candidates might also focus on the possibility for the
     artist to be a reflector and repeater of existing values (as a conformer or a means for conformism)
     or an agent of change, even a revolutionary. Or, even further, responses might consider a critical
     view, such as the one that has been well expressed in Rousseau’s Discourse on the Moral Effects
     of the Arts and Sciences (1750), by underlining the inauspicious connection between art and
     human progress.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Whether art has a social function
      Historical examples of political uses of art
      Art serving propaganda
      Art being affected by censorship
      Autonomy of the artist/the artistic process
      Role of creativity and imagination
      Whether art can be a means for the human progress
      Views of art as connected to social life and civilization, by continental philosophers, eg Hegel,
        Croce, Collingwood, the Frankfurt School, Adorno, Marcuse, Freud and others.

4.   Evaluate the claim that “taste is the capacity for judging something to be beautiful on the
     basis of an entirely ‘disinterested’ delight”.                                            [25]

     This question focuses on an issue, which is central to the argument of Kant’s Critique of Judgment
     (1790): The disinterestedness of the pleasure in the beautiful. In Kant’s view, disinterestedness is
     the condition for the judgment, 1) to satisfy the requirement of universality that aesthetic judgments
     have to have and, 2) to avoid being grounded solely on subjectivity. The Kantian argument offers
     the chance widely to investigate the nature of aesthetic judgment and its possibilities, the
     relationship between subjectivity and universality, the issues related to individual tastes and shared
     and agreed judgments. Reference to Hume (On the Standard of Taste (1757)) might be
     appropriate with regard to discussions of taste and/or as a possible criticism of Kant’s view.
     Nietzsche’s critique of the Kantian argument of pleasure and disinterestedness might be analysed
     (particularly On the Genealogy of Morals (1887) and concerning the importance of passions and
     desires that Nietzsche maintains are necessary in connection to pleasure). The question also
     invites a discussion of the role played by the observer or audience/spectator and the related
     argument of perception, by which art might be judged or appreciated. Another possible path might
     take into account the meaning of pleasure, desire, delight, passion, and the role they play in
     relation with beauty, ugliness, or the sublime. Responses might consider and mention the
     possibilities of communicating the aesthetic experience, also depending on whether it is an
     individual and subjective understanding or a shareable one. Candidates might also choose to
     discuss whether any sort of judgment is possible or not, regardless of the issues of subjectivity and
     universality, trying to answer the question whether it is possible to judge a work of art or not.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Kant’s aesthetic judgment and possible criticisms, eg Hume, Nietzsche, Deleuze
      The meaning and role of disinterestedness of pleasure in the beautiful
      Critical questioning of “disinterestedness” in art by feminists and others
      Subjectivity and universality of any possible judgment
      Discussions of taste, eg Hume
      The role played by the spectator/audience
      The importance of perception and interpretation in judging a work of art
      The nature of aesthetic experience and its possible communication
      The meaning of pleasure, desire, delight, beauty, ugliness, sublime
      Is it possible to judge a work of art?
      The importance of sharing and agreement in shaping judgments.

Optional theme 2: Epistemology

5.   Evaluate the claim that out of the common three theories of truth (coherence,
     correspondence and pragmatism) the coherence theory is the most justifiable.                        [25]

     This question offers candidates an opportunity to reflect upon the central notion of truth by means
     of a discussion and evaluation of the three classical theories of truth. The question simultaneously
     opens the possibility of considering the notion of justification and related issues such as sources of
     knowledge, rationalism and empiricism, a priori and a posteriori and scepticism.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Two or more beliefs are said to cohere if they fit together or agree with one another; typically a
        coherence theory of truth claims that the beliefs of a given individual are true to the extent that
        the set of all their beliefs is coherent
      For a coherence theorist truth comes in degrees: A given judgment is true in the degree to
        which its content could maintain itself in the light of a completed system of knowledge, false in
        the degree to which its appearance there would require transformation
      Is truth a matter of the beliefs of an individual, or the beliefs of a greater collective, community,
        society, or a specialized group considered to have expertise on the question?
      A common objection to coherence theories is that the conditions they place on truth are too
        weak: On a coherence theory a well-written novel would be true
      The two oldest theories of truth in Western philosophy, those of Plato and Aristotle, are both
        correspondence theories. Such theories are often summed up with the slogans “truth is
        correspondence with the facts” or “truth is agreement with reality”
      Correspondence theories play important roles in philosophical semantics and in the physicalist
        programme, which is the task of reducing all non-physical concepts to the concepts of logic,
        mathematics, and physics
      Usual positions in the pragmatic theory of truth: a) A true proposition is one which would be
        endorsed unanimously by all persons who had had sufficient relevant experiences to judge it,
        and b) a proposition counts as true if and only if behaviour based on a belief in the proposition
        leads to beneficial results for the believers
      Discussion of a meta-reality, which can appear almost necessarily linked to an analysis of truth
      Theories of justification, for example, foundationalism and coherentism
      The dominance of paradigms: How ideas cohere with the dominant framework in play at a
        given time
      Contrast with other ways of understanding truth, eg the Chinese one: Truth as a way of life and
        self-realisation, different from the Western understanding of truth as a relationship between
        language and reality.

6.   To what extent does the right to access knowledge benefit people?                                   [25]

     The question opens a discussion and evaluation of the relations between knowledge, rights and
     benefits. The UN Declaration of Human Rights Article 27 reads: “Everyone has the right freely to
     participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific
     advancement and its benefits. Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material
     interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author”. The
     discussion of possible rights related to knowledge might serve as a platform to deal with a series of
     issues related to knowledge, technology and power. The discussion might also involve discussion
     of the extent to which knowledge should be ruled by ethical principles. Discussion might involve
     the way knowledge can be exercised for power and controlled by individuals or the state.
     Censorship might be raised as an issue about the dissemination of knowledge. Discussion also
     might involve the implications of scientific or technological developments for people.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Approaches to knowledge and science
      How important is the continuous development of knowledge for the advancement of humanity?
      The links between technology and knowledge
      The relationship between knowledge, control and power
      Universal access to knowledge and technology
      Who should control knowledge and how should it be made public?
      Knowledge and power, for example, Plato or Freire
      Access to knowledge and censorship
      Technology as a means of disseminating knowledge
      The “digital divide” – access to information and the economics controlling access to knowledge
      Knowledge as cultural capital and resource
      Differential access to knowledge due to social stratification and inequality. The problems and
        implications of this issue in addressing the question and the notion of “right”
      Foucault’s claim: Knowledge is power.

Optional theme 3: Ethics

7.   Evaluate the claim that the aim of all ethical principles is to cultivate our sympathy.      [25]

     This question invites the candidate to evaluate the claim that sympathy is the most important
     element for living an ethical life. A wider discussion of non-cognitive moral theories that involve
     sympathy is also relevant. Classical theories of moral sentimentalism, those of Hume and Smith,
     used sympathy and empathy to explain how our moral sense – a developed, not innate, capacity –
     works. Moral approval is caused by pleasure of a special kind, to feel a particular type of
     satisfaction. For Hume, sympathy is a kind of analogical association where the effects of a passion
     pass from the observance of the effects to their causes, and forms an idea so strong that it is
     converted into the passion itself. For Smith, sympathy worked more as a kind of simulation, an act
     of the imagination to place oneself into another’s position. Both views require a departure from
     one’s personal point of view, as resentment or approval are proper when every indifferent
     spectator agrees with the sentiments. Other more contemporary views are Emotivism (Ayer),
     Prescriptivism (Hare), Expressionism (Blackburn), and Error Theory (Mackie following Nietzsche).

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Empathy is often thought of as the experience or the ability to imagine oneself in another’s
        position, while sympathy is an understanding and caring for another’s position
      If, as Hume suggests, rightness and wrongness are a product of our sentiments, then are not
        right and wrong not dependent on my sentiments? If my sentiments change, do my concepts of
        right and wrong also change? If my sentiments vanish, does my moral life also disappear?
      If moral judgments really are projections of emotions or attitudes, then how can this projection
        be anything but a subjective response?
      The difference between feeling someone else’s pain or pleasure, and the concern for another’s
        pain or pleasure
      The connection, if any, between innate character and the capacity to feel sympathy or empathy
      The contrasts between moral sentimentalism and consequentialism, duty ethics, and virtue
        ethics as principals for ethics
      The insignificance of sentiments and character when applying normative rules like the greatest
        good for the greatest number, or protecting and supporting the rights of oneself and others
      What are we in sympathy with: The agent’s motives, the agent’s action, the agent’s pleasure
        or pain?
      Is reducing moral approval to a feeling legitimate?
      Does moral sentimentalism necessarily assume an innate moral sense?
      Do moral thoughts involve our attitudes towards desires and preferences?

8.   Evaluate the claim that a good person is a person of good character.                               [25]

     This question invites candidates to analyse and evaluate virtue ethics, or more broadly, the role of
     character in an ethical life. The characteristics of an ethical system based on virtue are: Defining a
     set of character traits that are worthy of acquiring and developing; observing human life to develop
     knowledge of human action and folly; learning how to observe from a mentor; that the context is all
     important in knowing how and when to practise a particular virtue; the aim of virtue ethics is for a
     good life, or a flourishing life. Aristotle called this eudaimonia. It is not just the individual that
     flourishes, but the emphasis is often that families, friends and communities should also benefit
     from the actions and presence of a virtuous person. What is usually lacking in virtue ethics are a
     universal set of rational principles for action and the lack of emphasis in following rules, though a
     number of classical virtue systems like Confucianism value ritual as a way of developing virtue. In
     the normative systems of consequentialism and duty ethics strictly interpreted and applied, the
     character of the individual is usually irrelevant if a rule that maximizes utility or pleasure is being
     followed, or that a duty has to be recognized.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      The criticism that when asked to answer the question of what counts as virtue, virtue ethics can
        only say “acts that are virtuous” – the issue of the lack of content
      Economic and class considerations: It is easier to flourish given a good education or a wealthy
        background
      The criticism that normative principles are necessary for settling disputes over moral judgments.
        The argument that it is preferable to apply moral principles to discover what is right rather than
        simply be left with a vague concept of flourishing
      The view that a virtue is a deeply rooted character trait that is a disposition to perform an action
        that goes well beyond a habit; as such it is connected to emotions, choices, values, desires,
        attitudes, and sensibilities
      There is an attitude or fundamental disposition that accompanies being virtuous; there is a
        range of consideration given for action
      Phronesis: Moral or practical wisdom. Lacking this quality is often the reason given for the
        necessity of a mentor
      The ability to evaluate each situation – the link with Situation Ethics
      Is there an assumption in consequentialism and deontology that morality needs a code
        consisting of universal rules and principles?
      If following rules is necessary for the good in consequentialism and deontology, then is it
        possible that the agent is ignorant of why the rule, and hence action, generates goodness?
      The circular nature of reasoning about virtue: What is good? That which is virtuous; what is
        virtuous? That which is good.

Optional theme 4: Philosophy and contemporary society

9.   With reference to one or more examples of the groups of people that can be marginalized in
     society, explain and discuss the philosophical issues that can arise from addressing
     inequality.                                                                           [25]

     This question involves considering philosophically a discussion of the basis for possible inequality
     in contemporary society. Some issues of inequality are historical and seemingly universal to
     cultures across time and across the globe. Other issues may arise from contemporary experience
     of society, including current political, economic or belief-system experiences. This question invites
     a treatment of the possible marginalisation of groups, which might offer an analysis of overall issue
     of power in society (eg Marx or Foucault) or the general structures that apply to social organisation
     (eg Weber, Durkheim, Lévi-Strauss). In selecting one or more examples of the basis and its
     treatment by past and contemporary thinkers, the answer can look philosophically at what is being
     addressed – and how.

     In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
      Marginalisation by gender, sexual orientation, race, language, belief, ethnicity
      The issue of minorities representation, especially in democratic systems of government
      The similarities or differences that arise in the marginalization of different groups
      The philosophical treatment of issues about social structure as opposed to the sociological
        approach drawing on data from social science
      Philosophical issues that arise when considering social groupings, ie how straightforward is it to
        classify membership of racial or gender groups?
      Issues of equality versus freedom
      Judging individuals and judging individuals as members of groups
      Tolerance and the issues that arise from different groups with different belief systems living
        alongside each other
      The application of a single rule of law to societies that comprise different groups
      Existentialist approaches to understanding social experience, eg treatment of gender, race etc
      Scientific approaches to understanding social groupings and variations like gender, race etc
      The issue of inequality, eg Rawls, Sen, Nozick.

10.   Evaluate the claim that “[the idea of] natural rights is simple nonsense”.                          [25]

      This question explores the notion of natural, or human, rights. Such rights can be compared with –
      or include – legal rights and how they are proscribed and enforced. As a utilitarian, Bentham
      claimed that all that counted for motivation of human behaviour was the guiding principle of avoiding
      pain and promoting pleasure, but this view is challenged by thinkers who believe in inherent rights
      possessed by human beings by virtue of being humans. Libertarian philosophers question claims
      about rights, drawing attention to the notion that rights can only be articulated when their delivery is
      understood, asking who takes the responsibility to deliver the right. Examples might be pursued like
      the use of violence for political ends, or the use, by the state, of the threat of force to protect the
      rights of some (or all).

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       What constitutes a right?
       What is the relationship between rights and responsibilities?
       Is there a metaphysical defence of the existence of rights, or are they to be explained by
         reference to biological or social necessity?
       The difference between political and legal rights
       The work of philosophers on rights (eg Locke, Bentham, Mill, Rawls, Nozick, Sen, Nussbaum)
       Examples in the history of rights include The Magna Carta, The Bill of Rights, The United States
         Declaration of Independence, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
       Positive and negative rights, reflecting the senses of “freedom from” and “freedom to”
       Rights of non-humans, including animal rights and environmental/ecological rights
       Universal political institutions like the United Nations which guarantee rights for children and
         cultural values (UNESCO) or individual health (WHO). Do they have precedence over
         autonomous political states?

Optional theme 5: Philosophy of religion

11.   Explain and discuss the conceptual issues that arise from attributing omnipotence to a
      Supreme Being.                                                                         [25]

      In most philosophical discussions about the nature of the divine, Supreme Being, the issue of
      God’s omnipotence, as a core attribute, is central. The reality of this attribute is encouraged in
      most scriptural traditions and subsequent philosophical traditions have grappled with its
      implications. From the Hebrew scriptures to Averroes and Aquinas, and into modern times, there
      have been attempts to provide an understanding of what omnipotence might mean, given the
      problems associated with the notion of the concept and how it fits with life in the world. Some
      responses may pay regard to modern attempts to assert God’s existence without his or her
      omnipotence being a necessary attribute, as outlined in Process Theology and its response to the
      issue of suffering in the world. Other responses may select one or two implications for attributing
      God’s omnipotence and the conceptual issues that arise, like whether God could break the laws of
      logic, or whether God could know the world as it changes as humans do, yet maintain immutability
      and thus omnipotence.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       Could God break the laws of logic? (No, says Aquinas, being omnipotent does not mean being
         able to do anything, but being able to do anything that is logically possible; JL Mackie agrees)
       Could God make a stone too big for her or him to move? The paradox of the stone, from
         Averroes, and modern attempts to solve the paradox
       Omnipotence and omni-benevolence: Is God’s omnipotence limited by God being unable to sin
         or cause evil/suffering? Why does an omnipotent God allow suffering if s/he could wipe it out?
         See Process Theology
       Omnipotence and omniscience: If God knows what is to happen, does God’s knowledge
         change, thus limiting immutability, and thus, omnipotence?
       God’s omnipotence and moral reality – the Euthyphro dilemma: If God decides what is moral, is
         it capricious or subject to change? If what is moral can be worked out without reference to God,
         then is there an alternative power, possibly greater, in the universe?
       If God is omnipotent, do humans have free will?
       God’s omnipotence and his/her relation to time (transcendence versus immanence; everlasting
         versus eternal).

12.   Explain and discuss the problems that arise from verifying claims made using religious
      language.                                                                              [25]

      This question enables a discussion of what constitutes religious language and how it applies to
      statements that involve propositional knowledge claims. There has been a long history of debate
      about religious language, from the medieval via negativa, to more recent interest in how philosophy
      can clarify the meaning of words through the work of philosophers like Hume, Kant, Russell, Ayer,
      Popper, and Wittgenstein. The ontological argument for the existence of God relies on the
      definitions of words and how those words relate to concepts and reality in the world. Other
      traditions, like Sufism, Kabbalah, many forms of Eastern mysticism, fideism in Western
      monotheism – and others – emphasize the desirability of direct knowledge of God gained through
      personal experience rather than through assent to propositions that are subject to rational
      discussion or evaluation. This question can allow for an exploration of different avenues for
      discussion of verification and the claims made in religious language.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       What is religious language? The attempts to describe the divine in human conceptual
         language, and possible difficulties associated with such attempts (ie via negativa)
       Is it possible to argue that religious language works in other ways, such as metaphor,
         symbolism, image and poetry?
       Descartes’s notion of “clear and distinct” ideas giving direct knowledge of God
       What is verification? The tradition of empiricism and its impact on philosophical treatment of
         language and meaning, eg Hume and his investigation of human knowledge and the dialogue
         concerning religion
       Reactions to verification, eg Logical Positivism and the Vienna Circle; Popper and falsification;
         Kuhn and paradigms
       Wittgenstein’s language games
       Direct knowledge of God – mystic traditions and the concept of meaning in different religious
         and faith traditions
       The Ontological Argument and its use of language definitions, and the relationship of concepts
         to reality
       Cognitivism and non-cognitivism
       Eschatological verification (Hick).

Optional theme 6: Philosophy of science

13.   Explain and discuss the role of induction in the development of scientific knowledge.            [25]

      This questions invites an investigation into the role and associated problems of the use of induction
      in science. It relates to the problem of moving from a number of examples to conclusions that
      cover all cases or cases that have not yet been observed. The role of assumption might be
      developed in the area of circumstances remaining the same and therefore there is consistency of
      consequences: The issue of past experience confirms a future belief. Whether nature behaves in
      a uniform way could be questioned as this is crucial to the use of inductive reasoning. Questions
      about the universality of what are in fact assumptions might be raised. Hume’s questioning of the
      inductive process might be raised. Popper’s claim that science does not use induction processes,
      but rather follows the “hypothetico-deductive method” might also be raised. Attempts to falsify
      assertions are a way of strengthening scientific claims. The problem of “projections” that is linked
      to the inductive process might also be raised (eg Kuhn’s theory of paradigms as underlying
      assumptions). Alternatives to induction such as the “entrenched” stance confirming accepted
      positions and the open-minded peer appraisal might be brought into challenge induction as a
      method in science.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       The relationship between hypothesis and induction
       Hume’s view on induction
       Are Popper’s challenges justified particularly in the light of Feyerabend’s critique of his
         approach?
       Is induction really a logical process?
       The problems of social/peer expectations that affect interpretation and assumptions
       The fundamental role of induction in all scientific process and how everyday experiences
         confirm or try to confirm scientific truth; whether inductive truth has a high status
       The role of scientific laws might be raised and how they can be superseded.

14.   Evaluate the claim that scientific progress is limited by the imagination of the scientist. [25]

      This question gives an opportunity to both discuss what scientific progress is and what drives it.
      Progress in science can be seen as ever increasing knowledge and understanding of nature and
      the universe, and also in a more “meta” sense of breaking out of fixed paradigms. The claim
      implies that one of the main driving forces is the creative element within the scientist and the
      scientific method to challenge given positions and also to investigate in greater depth.
      Consequently it might be seen that breaking paradigms and fashions are what produces progress.
      Alternatively the claim can be challenged by asserting that political and social pressures drive
      progress far more than the thinking of the scientist. Similarly financial constraints or incentives
      could affect progress. Such factors might generate more progress in less abstract aspects of
      science. Equally, the claim could be investigated by pursuing how scientists investigate accidental
      happenings or simply use their intuition. A less positive interpretation of “limiting” might result in
      discussion of how the status quo and fixed accepted positions block progress. Similarly accepted
      social norms and mores limit scientific activity.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       The nature of creativity in science
       Positive and negative applications of scientific knowledge might challenge what progress actual
         implies. Should scientific knowledge only focus on the amelioration of the human condition or
         just explain and understand it?
       The role of politics, market forces and power in relationship to scientific progress
       Ethical factors and their relationship to scientific progress
       The role of fear or superstition in blocking scientific progress
       Imagination as enabling scientific understanding and progress (eg Galileo, Arthur C Clarke,
         Asimov, Philip K Dick)
       Problems of the status of the observer in the data being evaluated (eg Planck)
       How perception can be changed so things are seen differently or new connections appreciated,
         eg Newton’s and Leibniz’s differing views on gravitation, Galileo and the relationship of the
         moon and tides
       Kuhn’s investigation of paradigm shifts.

Optional theme 7: Political philosophy

15.   Evaluate the view that justice gives everyone the best chance of achieving their own good
      that they can reasonably expect, in a setting where others are simultaneously trying to
      achieve their own different good.                                                       [25]

      The question asks for an evaluation of the idea of justice as mutual advantage, and when doing so
      it gives the opportunity to discuss other central conceptions of justice. Versions of justice as
      serving mutual advantage can be found in Thrasymachus’s “might is right” argument in Plato’s
      Republic and in the fraudulent social contract identified by Rousseau as having been perpetrated
      by the rich on the poor. The locus classicus of this theory is Leviathan by Hobbes.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       The common division between corrective and distributive justice
       In the history of thought about justice, the common justification of any given set of laws,
         conventions or practices has been to appeal to an external, including divine authority
       The natural law tradition: The positive law must itself be in accordance with a natural law which
         is knowable through the faculty of human reason (Stoics, Cicero, Aquinas)
       The utilitarian assumption that the good of different individuals can be in some sense lumped
         together, and the pursuit of aggregate utility proposed as the objective of everyone
       In the absence of an external lawgiver, how can an individual (not naturally benevolent) be
         encouraged to adopt the maximization of total utility as a binding demand?
       Justice as mutual advantage results in rules that constrain the pursuit of self-interest, but the
         content of those rules will correspond to those of ordinary ideas of justice only if a rough
         equality of power holds between all the parties
       Game theory and prisoner’s dilemma accounts of mutual benefit and self-interest
       Is there an objective standard for justice?
       The teleological approach states that an account of the good for human beings can be given
         and that justice is the ordering principle through which a society (or humanity) pursues that
         good
       The conventionalist view that what is due to each person is given by the laws, customs and
         shared understandings of the community of which the person is a member
       Justice as fairness: Justice is a thin concept which provides a fair framework within which each
         person is enabled to pursue their own good, eg Rawls
       Contractarianism, eg Locke, Rousseau, Kant
       The description of social justice as “an empty phrase without determinable content”.

16.   Explain and discuss the idea that human rights are inalienable and universal.                       [25]

      The question asks for an explanation and discussion of the idea of human rights following two
      central features: Its universality and inalienable character. Since World War II, human rights have
      increasingly occupied a central position within the theory and practice of international law and
      politics and have received more attention within moral and political philosophy. The natural rights
      tradition of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries prefigures the modern human rights
      movement. However, it focused on a few relatively abstract moral rights that all persons were
      claimed to have in a state of nature prior to or apart from any institutional context. The idea at the
      heart of the modern human rights movement initiated by the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human
      Rights is one of numerous and specific rights clearly oriented toward the institutional realities of the
      Twentieth Century.

      In addressing these philosophical issues candidates might explore:
       Whatever else they are or purport to be, human rights are rights, ie they show a deontic nature
         and intention
       The question of justification or philosophical ground for them beyond the claims that their
         recognition serves the cause of international peace and security and expresses and answers to
         the dignity and worth of human persons
       As moral rights they are proper objects of international concern and action apart from their
         current status within positive law, domestic or international
       They are universal in the sense that they are possessed by all human persons prior to and apart
         from any voluntary undertaking by the states to which they belong
       It is often said that human rights are the rights that all, and only, humans possess simply
         because they are human. However, some rights typically identified as human rights are rights
         that only human persons could plausibly be said to hold
       The proposal that human rights are a conventional rational social means to promoting the basic,
         general interest shared by all persons in developing and exercising the capacity for normative
         agency
       This capacity for normative agency is exercised and expressed when persons consider,
         evaluate, choose and revise their own course in life; this capacity is formed by: The capacity to
         make choices (autonomy), to act on choices (liberty), and to succeed in acting on choices
         (material welfare)
       The extent to which human rights include some material entitlements (eg the intention and
         consequences of mass migration)
       What rights do refugees who are stateless have? Who guarantees those rights? Are they
         enforceable? What are the implications of answers to these questions?
       Why are so many states erecting and reinforcing borders that directly deny some persons those
         inalienable rights to life and protection? Some say that they are doing so to protect the rights of
         their citizens. Account philosophically (being aware of different perspectives) for the conflicts
         underlying the issue of rights and who has them in these situations
       The broadening of the sphere of human rights to include the protection of the practices, needs
         and demands of social sub-groups; the additional related duty of the state to assist in promoting
         the diverse cultural features of a society
       The relation between human rights, cosmopolitanism, the ideals of global economic or
         distributive justice, the subordination of nation-states to a complex network of transnational and
         international institutions, or to some form of globally structured system of governance.
