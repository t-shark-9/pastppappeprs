                                                Section A

1.    Describe one feature of a wholesaler.                                                           [2]

           Common features of wholesalers include:

           • An intermediary along a distribution channel that breaks large quantities of
             product into small stock quantities for retail businesses.
           • generally offering stock for predominantly one industry (furniture, fruit, electronic
             parts, auto parts, etc) and building up product knowledge to help retail
             businesses increase the opportunities for retail success.
           • allow retail businesses to purchase on credit or even allowing retail business to
             purchase stock on a sale or return basis.
           • given the large quantities of stock purchases, being able to experience significant
             purchasing and marketing economies of scale.

           Accept any other relevant feature.


           Award [1] for a relevant feature with appropriate description up to a maximum of [2].
           It is not expected that candidates explain the benefits to any stakeholder
           Application to the organisation is not required.

           Do not credit an example of BF or any other organisation.

(b)   Using information in Table 1, calculate for BF:

            (i)    stock turnover in days for 2015 (X) (show all your working);                      [2]

                  Stock
                        × 365 =
                              stock turnover in days
                  COGS

                 4000
                       × 365 =
                             120.006 days (assuming 4000 is average stock)
                12166
           Accept 121 days

           Accept 120 days

           Do not credit for the use of a correct formula as it is given.

           Award [1] for some minimal understanding like at least two figures used are
           correctly.
           Award [1] for a final correct answer without working


           Award [2] for correct use of formula with clear working with no mathematical errors
           and the correct answer is given in days from working shown.
           For [2], “days” must be present, as this is the standard unit used.

           Do not accept a response that calculates the times it takes the stock to be turned
           over.


           (ii)    current ratio for 2015 (A) (show all your working);                                [2]

              Cash + Debtors + Stock
                                     = Current ratio
                 Current liabilities

              2000 + 1973 + 4000
                                 = 4.43
                  800 + 1000

              Accept 4.4


              Award [1] for some minimal understanding like all the figures/total for CA or
              CL are correct

              Award [2] for correct use of formula with no mathematical errors/the
              calculations are clear and correct.
              [2 ] cannot be awarded if the candidates expresses the figures in times/ units
              etc.


      (iii)    debtor days for 2016 (Y) (show all your working).                                    [2]

                    Debtors
                                  × 365 =
                                        Debtor days
              Total sales revenue

               6134
                     × 365 =
                           86.11 days
              26 000

              If a leap year figure is used, please accept 86.34 days.
              Accept 87 days.
              Accept 86 days.
              Do not credit for the use of a correct formula as it is given.


              Award [1] for some minimal understanding like at least two figures used are
              correct.
              Award [1] for a final correct answer without working


              Award [2] for correct use of formula with no mathematical errors. Units (days)
              are required for full marks.

(c)           Referring to information in Table 1 and your calculations, explain the change
              in BF ’s liquidity between 2015 and 2016.                                            [2]



              Given the changes in the current ratio from 4.4 to 5.47, one can say that BF’s liquidity
              has increased. Candidates may term this increase as an improvement or deterioration
              as BF’S ratios are high. The important issue is the increase in liquidity.
              The application should refer to the possible reasons/contributors for the changes like:
              An increase in stock from $4000 to $6164
              An increase in debtors from $1973$ to $6134.Possibly due to some difficulties of shifting
              the stock as evident in 2016 of an increased stock turnover and the level of stock despite
              a fall in cash from $2000 to $500.

Award [1] if the candidate comments that the liquidity of the company has
increased.

Award [2] for a clear explanation of one possible reason for the changes with
a use of actual figures.
It is expected that the candidates refer to some actual changes like debtors/stock for
full marks.
Candidates need to explain the changes- why/ the possible contributors to
rather than just ‘what’.

It is expected that the candidates comment on the direction of the change not
just say it has changes.


Allow for OFR.

2. (a) Describe one disadvantage for GD of leasing.                                            [2]

        One of the disadvantages for GD of leasing rather than buying the machinery is that
        the machine will not be recorded as part of its fixed assets. Hence, GD will show
        lower fixed assets on its balance sheet with some financial consequences, like fewer
        assets being available for collateral.

        By leasing, GD will have to pay for the machines throughout the time used but will
        never own the machines.

        Accept any other relevant description.

        Application is not expected.

        Do not credit examples

        Award [1] for identifying an appropriate disadvantage and [1] for an appropriate
        description up to a maximum of [2].

  (b)   Calculate the value (also known as net book value) of new machinery at
        31 December 2017 using the straight line depreciation method (show all your
        working).                                                                              [2]

        Purchase costs − Residual value
                                        = Annual depreciation
                  Life span

        All figures are in $

        50 000 − 8000
                      = 10 500 per year
              4

        By the end of 2017, the new machinery will have a book value of
        50 000 − (10 500 × 2 years) = $29 000


        Candidates do not have to present the formula in words as long as the figures are
        correct.

        Award [1] for a correct use of the formula and clear working.
        Award [1] for a correct final figure of net book value.

        Award a maximum of [1] if the final figures are correct but no working shown.

      It is expected that the candidates produce for each year a clear working of the
      depreciation allowance as well as the calculation of the net book. Marks to be
      awarded for the two stages.

      For the end of 2016:
      Award [1] for a correct working method and a figure of the depreciation allowance,
      and [1] for the correct working and figure of the net book value.
      Candidates can be awarded the marks even if the terms NBV or depreciation
      allowance are not explicitly written as long as the calculations are clear
      If only a correct figure is presented without working award a maximum of [1].

      The exact year or year 1or year 2 for which the calculations are done should be
      written for full marks.

      For the end of 2017:
      Award [1] for a correct working method and a figure of the depreciation allowance
      and [1] for the correct working and figure of the net book value. Candidates can
      be awarded the marks even if the terms NBV or depreciation allowance are not
      explicitly written as long as the calculations are clear
      If only a correct figure is presented without working award a maximum of [1].

      If the net book value is correct but there is no working/r evidence of the calculation
      of the depreciation allowance award [1]

      Producing a final correct figure of net book value for 2017 using a short cut
      mathematical formula with a use of graphic calculator is not sufficient for full marks
      as it is judged as using a one stage approach.


      Award [2] If mathematically the candidates arrived at the correct net book value for
      end of 2017 by using a mathematical formula which is stated/ presented with no
      interim explicit calculations/ expression of the depreciation allowance or the net
      book value for 2016.

      Allow OFR.

(d)   Explain one advantage for GD of using the straight line depreciation method.     [2]

      • The straight line method is simpler and therefore easier for GD to calculate and
        less time consuming. As GD is an engineering company rather than an
        accounting company as well as new company, perhaps the easier method will be
        chosen.
      • It allows for a constant expense to be accounted for in the profit and loss
        account. GD’s accountant might want to show a higher profit level to attract more
        investors. The use of a straight line depreciation method will result in lower
        expenses compared with reducing balance depreciation allowance. For example,
        10,500 as opposed to 20,000 using the reducing balance methods.
      • The use of a straight line method will result in the same figure $8000 as
        estimated as residual value hence make the process easier/ more accurate/ more
        straightforward for GD’s accountant.


      Award [1] for an advantage of the straight line method.
      Award [1] for some application to GD that goes beyond just mentioning the name
      GD.

3. (a) Describe one possible objective of a public health organization.                            [2]

    A possible objective of a public health organization – an organization in the public sector
    owned and controlled by the government – is to provide essential (medical)services to
    the community either free of charge or at a low or affordable price at the point of
    consumption.

    Accept any other relevant objective.

    Candidates are expected to explicitly mention the provision of health care/services, not
    just refer to a public organization for [2].

    Award [1] for identifying an appropriate objective and [1] for an appropriate description
    up to a maximum of [2].
    Do not credit an example.

(b) Explain two characteristics of an intrapreneur at HS.                                            [4]

   Possible characteristics of an intrapreneur in HS may include the following:


    The main characteristic of an intrapreneur at HS is to work within an established
    organization and to come up with new, creative and innovative ideas or concepts to
    reduce the costs of operation in order to adhere to budgetary constraints. The
    intrapreneurs should enable HS to create a USP and increase its customer base. HS is
    known for its creativity, hence indication of the success of the consultants as
    intrapreneurs for HS.
    A consultant, intrapreneur, does not risk his/her own capital in case of failure but
    takes risk for the organization for which he or she works. Nor does he or she come up
    with a new business venture, but the characteristic is to demonstrate the same traits of
    an entrepreneur, like being an independent thinker, proactive, flexible, innovative, turning
    ideas/projects into a profitable medical service for an organization within which he or she
    works, in this case, HS while working for an existing organization.

    Accept any other relevant/applicable role.
    Please note: For full marks the candidates should demonstrate an intrapreneur is an
    employees / works in a business otherwise some of the characteristics like risk taking,
    could be equally applicable to an entrepreneur.


        Mark as 2 + 2.

     Award [1] for each relevant characteristic explained and [1] for appropriate application
     to HS to a maximum of [2].

     [2] cannot be awarded for each reason used if the response lacks either explanation
     and / or application.
     For example:
     For an identification or a description of a characteristic with or without application
     [1].
     For explanation of a characteristic with no application [1].
     For explanation of a characteristic and application [2].

(c) Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for HS of using formative appraisal.            [4]

    Do not penalise candidates for not defining or describing formative appraisal.
    However, the explanation must show understanding of the nature of this type of
    appraisal as specified below or the difference between formative and summative.

              The possible advantages for HS of using formative appraisal:

    As an ongoing, continuous process of appraisal, the management of HS provides
    monthly feedback for consultants regarding their performance. Constant and regular
    feedback can be highly rewarding / motivating when good performance is commented on
    and some weaknesses can be improved with constructive feedback. As HS expects the
    consultant to be creative and ready to let them take a risk, one may argue that constant
    formative appraisal can be very effective in terms of identification of strengths and
    weaknesses of individual consultants and adjustment can often/frequently be made
    before major and costly problems occur. HS is therefore reducing the risk of failure as
    well as increasing motivation of its employees.

    Accept any other relevant / applicable advantage.
    Do not credit a statement on improving performance unless it is connected to the issue
    of formative/ on- going/ frequent / continuous feedback. Needs a reference to a time
    frame.

    The possible disadvantages for HS of using formative appraisal:
    Consultants may feel stressed, especially as they are likely to be highly skilled and
    possess the main characteristics of an intrapreneur.
    Formative appraisal, especially as it is done monthly, might take unnecessary
    time/resources/money and interrupt the consultant as well as the management work.
    Inefficiency and demotivation may emerge as consultants may feel that there is some
    inconsistency between the expectation to be intrapreneurs and constant monitoring.
    Projects may take longer than one month to carry out; constant monitoring might reduce
    the efficiency and quality of the service and stifle the much-needed creativity.

    Accept any other relevant / applicable disadvantage.
    It is not expected that the response will be as detailed as above but should cover the
    main issues.

    N.B. Candidates should refer to and show understanding of formative appraisal, not
    just appraisal.



     Mark as 2 + 2.

     Award [1] for each relevant advantage/disadvantage explained and [1] for appropriate
     application to HS to a maximum of [2].

     [2] cannot be awarded for each reason used if the response lacks either explanation
     and / or application.
     For example:
     For an identification or a description of an advantage/ disadvantage with or without
     application [1].
     For explanation of an advantage/ disadvantage with no application [1].
     For explanation of an advantage/ disadvantage and application [2].
                                              – 16 –               M17/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d) Recommend which of Option 1 and Option 2 HS should implement.                                 [10]

       Possible arguments for HS setting up a charity to create educational services
       to children with long-term health problems:

       • Dan’s suggestion fits the nature of the work that the consultancy actually does.
         A synergy can be created between HS and HSE.
       • HS can successfully market their ethical behaviour and their CSR, especially
         given that their consultants will visit the sick children and get personally involved.
         Moreover, the creation of the HSE name can further enhance HS’s brand image.
         Despite short-term costs of setting up the charity and the injection of part of the
         profit into it, in the medium to long term, HS’s brand image may be enhanced.
         Public support, recognition, trust and the demand for its services may rise. Profit
         may be the reward and opposition to the high fees will be reduced. One may
         judge this argument as highly significant as currently there is a public outcry
         about the fees the consultants are paid by a public sector organization.
       • HSE should be able to claim some tax exemption, but this argument cannot be
         judged as a significant one.

       Possible arguments against HS setting up a charity to create educational
       services to children with long-term health problems:

       • Some hospital managers/potential clients may look at the suggestion as a cynical
         attempt to raise publicity and increase profit. Setting up a charity might not
         outweigh the negative perception of HS due to the high price it charges public
         hospitals and the drain on the hospitals’ budget that could have been spent on
         sick patients.
       • Internal conflict may arise within HS. The employees might feel obliged and
         perhaps overworked. Their much-needed creativity/intrapreneurial spirit may be
         damaged as demotivation sets in.
       • Some of the shareholders with the short-term view of receiving dividends may
         object to the use of part of HS’s retained profit as funds for the charity.
       • Candidates might use other textbook disadvantages like inefficiencies, fraud and
         disincentive effects due to a lack of profit.

       Accept any other relevant argument for or against.

       Given the above, perhaps Lauren’s suggestion that reducing the high fees should
       be the priority.

       HS will still use the talent/skills of its employees/project teams to develop new
       untested software to significantly reduce the costs of operation; in turn HS could
       charge public sector hospitals a lower fee. Still, the lower fees might still be
       perceived as high or unjustified by the pressure groups protesting against the high
       fees charged by HS.
       However, this solution may be judged as a sustainable one as the use of public
       money on software to improve the hospital efficiency and keeping the hospital
       budget on target might be judged as a worthwhile expenditure.

       Although the development of the software is likely to incur time and costs for HS in
       the short run, the challenge might further motivate the consultants and complement
       or even enhance the intrapreneurial spirit that already exists.

       Being able to charge the hospital lower fees can be seen as a long-term competitive
       advantage and will be more likely to pacify the pressure group as it directly
       addresses the issue the pressure groups complained about. Creating a charity,
                                      – 17 –              M17/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


while likely to be generally welcome, might not reduce the pressure from the
pressure group if fees remain high.

However, the process might be long and very expensive and the software is
untested. Is there a contingency plan if the tests do not lead to the benefits
claimed?

Accept any other relevant argument for or against.

Conclusions/judgment:
It appears that venturing into the creation of a charity may take HS away from its
core competency and there are more significant arguments against. Using its core
competency and the talent of the consultants to create software will enhance
creativity and motivation as well as directly address the concern of the pressure
group and hospital manager and it will benefit more stakeholders.

It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated judgment.

Candidates can provide any conclusion and judgment as long as it is substantiated.

Accept any other substantiated judgment.

Examiners’ judgment should be based not just on the number of the arguments in
terms of balance but on the quality/ clarity /relevance of the argument.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

If a candidate evaluates / addresses only one option in a balanced manner award a

A balanced response is one that provides at least one argument for and one
argument against each option.

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced analysis
and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus material
but there is no judgment/conclusion.

4. (a) Describe one characteristic of a niche market.                                              [2]

      Characteristics of a niche - a segment within a segment - market include:

      • Highly differentiated well defined, small/narrow market with specific identifiable
        common needs and characteristics.
      • High end, highly differentiated products/ services being sold at a high price for a
        small/narrow group of consumers.

       Candidates must refer to the small size of the niche/ segment otherwise the answer can
       fit the characteristics of a segment.

      Accept other relevant characteristics of a niche market. Candidates are not expected to
       word their responses exactly as above.


      Award [1] for identification of a characteristic of a niche market.

      Award [2] for a full, clear description of the characteristic.

      Do not credit an example.

(b)      With reference to SV, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using
      secondary market research.                                                                   [4]

      Advantages of using secondary market research include:
      • Efficient in terms of time – the data on wine consumption patterns, for example, has
         already been collected by someone else and is available. SV needs to react quickly
         to the increased competition and therefore it is vital that the relevant information is
         collected quickly.
      • Effective in terms of cost – often secondary research is free and, when it is not, is
         typically less expensive than the process of gathering primary research. As SV is
         looking for other possible markets, it would be very time consuming and expensive to
         sample many regions. Often, sample secondary research already exists. It has
         allowed SV to consider new geographical markets /new segments which it may not
         have considered before.
      • SV researchers can conduct a STEELPE analysis on different regions to evaluate
         social, economic and legal factors before a decision is made.
      • Low cost to gather conflicting information/ opinions.
      • Given the question that should be answered- the decision about suitable regions, the
         scope for primary research is very limited.


      Disadvantages of using secondary market research include:
      • Lack of precise focus on the issue or problem concerning the business. The
          stimulus refers to potential markets. SV may have to consider carrying out primary
          market research in these “potential markets” to get specific responses to specific
          issues like the perceptions of its premium wines.
      • Lack of most up to date information– often secondary research is outdated. If SV is
          going to target different markets they need to be confident that this secondary
          research is relevant and up-to-date. What if external factors have changed since
          the data was collected?

•   Uncertainty about the quality of the data collection/research. Some information,
    perhaps put by the government on the health of the population/ the prosperity of
    some segment etc may be inaccurate and biased.

Accept any other relevant/ applicable advantage/ disadvantage.

(c) Given the intense competition, explain two pricing strategies SV might consider.             [4]

       SV is currently charging a relatively high/ premium price and the competition is
       increasing.
       Pricing strategies that SV might consider include:
       • Cost-plus (mark-up) – SV may want to return to this pricing strategy, with a
          lower mark up to remain competitive. This pricing strategy will guarantee that for
          each bottle of wine it sells the business is covering its per unit costs and making
          some profit.
       • Promotional prices
       • Loss leader – SV could try a loss-leader strategy as a short- term strategy,
          whereby it sells one of its wines at very low prices in an attempt to get consumers
          to buy SV wines. Other varieties of SV wines, however, would be priced in a
          fashion to compensate for the losses on the one type. This strategy, and other
          such as attracting customers through low prices, could weaken SV’s brand
          identity.
       • Price discrimination – SV might consider price discrimination. SV sets the
          prices based upon the market that it is entering. For example, SV might charge
          more for wines in New York City than in Charlotte, NC. Both cities (major
          banking centres in the United States) have affluent buyers. Nevertheless, prices
          of virtually all types of goods and services cost less in Charlotte than in
          New York. But rely on ‘separable’ markets. Third parties could buy the wine in
          Charlotte and sell in NY for a profit or for less than SV are selling it.
       • Penetration – SV could use this pricing strategy only if or when it enters a new
          market or introduce new types of wines It is important that the candidates
          demonstrate understanding of the suitability of this strategy for new markets or
          different products only. Penetration pricing would allow SV to attract first-time
          customers in new suggested markets with lower than the average market pricing.
          It is not an innovative product so perhaps this is a suitable strategy Also, there
          might be a possibility that once some brand loyalty develops, SV could then raise
          prices.

          Please note: Do not fully credit penetration strategy if the reference to new
          product/ or entering new markets is not made.

       If predatory pricing is used award full marks only if the candidate makes the
       assumption of a market leadership position and financial strengths of SV ‘s ability to
       use this strategy as it is a family business after all.

       Premium price/ price skimming are not relevant strategies given the competition
       and the fact that the wine is not an innovative product.

       Accept other relevant pricing strategies if there is a clear indication of why this may
       be acceptable to SV, given the increased competition and the nature of the premium
       market.
       For full marks If psychological pricing is used, the candidates should apply by
       explaining how the pricing strategy is relevant in relation to the competitors.
       Psychological pricing cannot be used as a source of competitive advantage
       as the competitors are likely to do the same.

       Candidates are not expected to provided counter arguments to their chosen pricing
       strategy as the command word is ‘explain’.

(d)   Recommend which of Option 1 and Option 2 SV should consider in order to
      increase sales.                                                                         [10]

      SV is considering two options:
      Option 1: open a business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce “store”.

      This option would involve selling wines online to consumers. They currently sell
      directly to customers at the vineyard.

      Benefits of this approach include:
      • SV can reach a wide market to guarantee more revenue and reduce the risk on
        relying on its current local market at a relatively short time and minimal
        investment.
        The set-up is relatively quick and the investment in an e-commerce store is
        relatively inexpensive. It is important for a company like SV trying to enter new
        markets to keep costs of entry low so it can compete on price, given the current
        competition.
      • Using e-commerce will enable SV to constantly adjust some of its marketing mix
        like pricing and promotion in line with the competitors or in more creative ways.
        Promotion and advertising can easily be extended via social network sites.
      • From a consumer perspective, B2C e-commerce also has benefits, especially the
        convenience and ability to compare prices and explain the differences between
        wines sold to make an informed decision which is important in a premium market.
      • Customers find the use of e-commerce easy and convenient. If SV ensures
        cheap/ free and efficient delivery, SV has a good chance of increasing its
        geographical or otherwise customer base. It is also utilising more of the ‘process’
        aspect of the extended marketing mix.
      • It will be easier for SV to withdraw this option compared with signing contracts
        with different wholesalers.


      B2C e-commerce also has disadvantages, which include:
       • Initially, customers who would have bought directly from the vineyard could go
         online instead. Overall sales may increase marginally.
      • SV would have to address consumer concerns that its site is secure
      • SV would have to incur costs making sure that the site is secure.
      • Competitors can easily track what SV is doing to promote and sell its products.
      • Selling small orders to individual throughout the US could increase the
         administration costs.
      • SV has to come up with a suitable and efficient physical distribution strategy How
         will the wine reach potential customers from all over the wold or even just the
         US?
      • New supply chains to reach new customers may have to be created adding to
         short-term costs. Wholesalers will have to be used to deliver the wine.
      • Alcohol is a heavily regulated product, especially in the United States, and it
         could be complicated and cumbersome for SV making sure that it complies with
         federal and state laws (laws regarding alcohol vary from state to state) and it
         might be even more legally complicated if selling abroad.
      • By selling online SV will lose its process and physical evidence of the marketing
         mix created by the interaction between the buyers and SV. A mix that was
         possibly one of its USPs given the information in the stimulus re: events,
         luxurious experience and so on.
      • SV would also have to make sure that selling wines online did not conflict with the
         premium brand identity that SV otherwise tries to maintain.

Option 2: sell SV wines to wholesalers serving the whole of the US market for
premium wines.

Advantages of this approach include:
• The wholesaler is likely to have a well-established network of other intermediaries
 and retail outlets. SV is likely to be able to penetrate many markets compared to
 the unknown chance of success using e-commerce.
• The wholesaler stores the product, thereby reducing storage costs of wine for SV.
• The wholesaler purchases in bulk and then breaks the bulk purchases into
   smaller batches for the retailers. This process means that SV does not have to
   concern itself with small orders from individuals or retailers as is likely to be the
   case when selling online. This may be important in a premium market.
• SV wants to sell to long distance markets – the entire United States – this
   approach pushes much of the complicated processes of distribution onto
   wholesalers.

However, working with wholesalers has disadvantages:
• Wholesalers sell the products of many companies, and their loyalties and highest
  priorities may be with other established brands.
• Working with wholesalers adds another intermediary and mark-up, which can
  lead to higher prices to consumers (who may respond by purchasing other
  products) or to thinner margins for SV. However, research revealed that there are
  other markets for high quality wine.
• Working through wholesalers and distributing across the United States, SV may
  not be able to afford national promotion. If it cannot, it will have to rely on the
  wholesalers and retailers for much of its promotion. SV cannot be confident that
  the wholesales will position SV’s new wines positively. Delays can seriously
  affect the quality and hence the reputation of SV which can undermine its current
  positioning/ brand image. Perhaps not a risk worth taking. Withdrawing some
  contracts can incur heavy legal costs to SV. Costs that are possibly unaffordable
  in a very competitive environment.
• Lacks important customer feedback that existing distribution allows.

 Accept any other relevant argument for and against each option.

Overall, option 2 is possibly the longer- term option, which involves considerable
costs, it is potentially the greater risk, but the profits could be considerable
compared to option 1. Perhaps SV should start with the option of e-commerce and if
successful use wholesalers to distribute the wine.

5. (a) Outline two features of an autocratic leadership style.                                     [2]

   • Decision making in an organization is restricted to a very small group of select
    individuals.
   • No consultation and discussion between management and employees. Employees
    are told about the decisions which are taken by an autocratic leadership.
   • Communication tends to be downward and one-way only.

    Award [1] for each correct feature identified.


    (b) Apply Daniel Pink’s motivation theory to the programmers at Gen Y.                         [6]

   Daniel Pink’s motivation theory identifies that there are three key drivers, or factors, that
   influence motivation for cognitive or thinking tasks leading to improved performance for a
   business. The three key drivers are:
     •        mastery
     •        autonomy
     •        purpose.

     From the stimulus we can argue that, before Petra’s potential involvement, Gen Y
     allows for:

   • Autonomy – Gen Y allows for employees to work on individual dream projects.
   They are also empowered to make their own decisions. The autonomy is evident in
   terms of time especially extra time given to work on dream projects, tasks, techniques to
   be used as well as trust, empowerment and delegation by the management.

   • Mastery – there is evidence from the stimulus that Gen Y has used cognitive
   training. This would presumably build or enhance capacity to develop and refine the
   programmers’ skills. The programmers and the coders are encouraged to be
   intrapreneurs and to take risks. as stated above, GenY supports employees to eliminate
   fear and anxiety about failure and boosting motivation according to Pink and allowing
   them to be more creative. The ‘dream’ project time also adds to this.

   • Purpose –the meaning of purpose in the stimulus is connecting to something larger
   than oneself that drives the highest motivation. The programmers and the coders
   develop the required sense of purpose that enhances motivation. Their ability to create
   high-quality reports providing innovative market research for other people. Work for its
   clients possibly creates purpose maximisation rather than just profit maximization. The
   employees can clearly see their contribution to the wider community, more than just
   themselves. This would act as a motivator for Gen Y programmers as they are carrying
   out ground-breaking work.

 For explanation of a factor/ drive and application [2].


 Just mentioning the name of the business does not constitute application.


(c)   Explain one reason, other than increased sales revenue, why it is important that
      Gen Y generates new revenue streams.                                                         [2]


 The question is about new revenue stream. Gen Y’s core business is the creation of innovative
 market research data reports. The business also allows employees to work on “dream
 projects” during the working week and provides cognitive training, which are all very expensive

 To remain innovative and sustainable Gen Y will need to secure new finance through new
 revenue streams as the current single revenue stream is not profitable.
 GenY should also find other sources of revenue generators, diversify into other markets or
 products to reduce the risk of relying on just one service/ product.

 Accept any of the above as one valid reason.

(d)   Discuss whether Zack should sell Petra half of his shares with her conditions.              [10]

      By selling his shares to Petra, Zack faces concerns not only of ownership but also
      that the culture of Gen Y – which by assumption has led to the success and
      motivation of employees – will have to be systematically changed. It is uncertain at
      this stage whether this change in culture will bring forward any improvements.

      In common with many other start-ups, profit for Gen Y remains elusive despite the
      considerable sums invested. Zack has tried to finance dream projects to turn
      inventions into innovation but without success. The harsh reality is that without
      funding coming into the business, the long-term sustainability of Gen Y is in doubt.
      If he does not take some action now and invite Petra into the business, then all jobs
      and intellectual property at Gen Y are under threat. Some programmers may leave
      the company if they sense that for some reason the opportunity to work on dream
      projects is cut back. Taking on Petra as a partner will weaken Zack’s control. Both
      will have equal power in decision making. However, it will ensure in the short term
      that Gen Y remains viable. Gen Y is in urgent need of finance so perhaps Zack does
      not have much of a choice.
      The importance of the venture capitalists’ view is also valid as with the sale they
      would now have the swing votes on important decisions. Does their exit strategy
      look better with Petra or Zack?

      However, to receive this funding, Petra has added conditions that Zack must accept.
      These conditions will not be popular in an organization that has strong links to
      Daniel Pink’s motivational theory. A leadership style change to autocratic will impact
      on the autonomy currently enjoyed by the employees. The purpose may also be
      affected, as Petra will wish to have a strong influence in the type of vision or
      direction she wishes to see Gen Y move to. The ending of innovative and
      revolutionary dream projects may be the first casualty. Motivation could be
      destroyed. Given the culture and the level of motivation one may judge this issue as
      extremely significant. The stimulus states ‘To retain the best programmers…….’.
      Those departing may turn into competitors.

      Further, the insistence on specific targets for programmers may impose
      deadlines/restrictions, which may be too much for the employees to take as they
      have been empowered to make their own decisions. A change of culture which will
      impact on creativity, innovation and motivation may have dire consequences in the
      medium to long term. Autocratic leadership styles and setting targets are opposing
      factors according to Pink compared to being motivated. Gen Y relies on its
      employees’ creativity, innovation and motivation for success.

      Accept any other argument for and against.


      Overall, the short-term situation is difficult for Zack. He has to balance the financial
      issues present in the case study with the idealism and motivation of his workforce.
      Petra’s conditions, whilst restrictive, may save Gen Y. Zack may be forced to sell
      this idea of Petra receiving half his shares to employees. Some employees may quit
      and be hired by competitors but perhaps they may not have been committed to Gen
      Y and Zack’s purpose. Either way, Zack will find it difficult to turn down Petra’s offer.

      Candidates might offer different solutions like not accepting Petra’s offer and look for
      venture capitalists with different views on what motivates employees. Or simply ask

 strategies emphasising the bottom-line

                                                Section C
Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on pages 4 to 5.

Additional examiner guidance may be added during standardization.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization on
      innovation.

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of ethics on
      organizational strategy.

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which culture can
      promote or inhibit change.



Candidates can use any change in the organization provided the nature of the change is well explained
and applied.
It is important that the candidate explain what existed before the change rather than just assert that change
has occurred.

In Q7 and Q8, the exact content is not specified. It is expected that the candidates select their content like
their chosen strategy or the exact change and fully and clearly explain and apply the relevant theoretical
terms/ content throughout.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria

For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect
of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for the impact of two concepts on content, examiners must allow
for unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One
concept may be more significant than the other.

It is expected that under the introduction, the candidates introduce the chosen organisation,
explain nature of the relevant concepts to be use when discussing the impact.

Criterion A
It is expected that the candidate use the relevant concepts throughout the response to
demonstrate the understanding of the concept. It is not sufficient just to define/ describe the
concept in the introduction.
                                                 – 30 –             M17/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1+1 arguments are expected per concepts.
• Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
   – therefore accept 2+2 arguments for a balanced response.
• Justification is through logic or data.
• For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
• For [3] there is some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.
The arguments and the counter arguments must be relevant/ appropriate for the question.
Do not accept any counter argument which does not address the question.

Criterion D
• Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
• The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
• A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occur. It is usually located
   between the introduction and the conclusion.
• Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
• One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However this could not be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management
   team.
• For [4], a balanced response: need to look at the perspectives of both individual and
   group(s). The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the
   question with specific explanation.
• Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.
• Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.
• Candidates should support their assertions on the impact on or the impact of their chosen
   stakeholders. The support does not have to come in real figures but with some evidence
   of impact for example, ‘the market share increased’ ‘staff turnover decreased’, ‘fewer
   defects were evident’.
