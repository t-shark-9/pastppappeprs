Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           • Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to support the
              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate
              and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
              historical context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.
           • The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical
              commentary, but this is not sustained.
  4–6      • The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While
              there may be an attempt to follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and
              coherence.
           • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.
                                            –6–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


1–3   • There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response is poorly
        structured or, where there is a recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on
        the task.
      • Little knowledge is present. Where specific examples are referred to, they are factually
        incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
      • The response contains little or no critical analysis. It may consist mostly of
        generalizations and poorly substantiated assertions.
0     • Response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

Section 1       Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   Evaluate the importance of the Mongol empire to the effective functioning of the Silk Road.

     Candidates will appraise the importance of the Mongol empire to the Silk Road, gauging how far its
     effective functioning was due to, or perhaps despite, the actions of the Mongol empire. Candidates
     may adopt a chronological approach, outlining how effectively the Silk Road functioned at the
     beginning, during and at the end of the Mongol period and address the ways in which this could be
     linked to Mongol activity, or they could choose a thematic approach and address the Mongols’
     impact on areas such as trade, travel and cultural exchange. While candidates may also reflect on
     other (non-Mongol) factors that aided or inhibited the effective functioning of the Silk Road during
     the period, the focus of the response must be on the importance of the Mongol empire.



2.   “The transmission of religious ideas was the most important consequence of cultural interaction
     along the Silk Road.” Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement, with which they may
     agree, partially agree or disagree. Candidates may suggest that the transmission of religious ideas
     was largely one directional, travelling from west to east and that, as such, its importance is
     dependent on geographical viewpoint. Additionally or alternatively, candidates may suggest that
     another (or a range of other) consequence(s) of cultural interaction were more significant. For
     example, the transmission of mathematical and scientific knowledge, the spread of literary works,
     the evolution of architecture, urban design and other artistic developments—such as in ceramics
     and jewellery—may all be used to elucidate the consequences of cultural interaction. While no set
     response is expected, candidates must incorporate a review of the importance or otherwise of the
     transmission of religious ideas.
                                                 –8–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2       Japan in the age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Evaluate the political impact of the Gempei War (1180–1185).

     Candidates will appraise the political impact of the Gempei War by weighing up how far the war led
     to changes in government structures and political elites. Candidates may adopt a chronological
     approach that outlines the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate and the reduction in power of
     the emperor and which identifies subsequent political implications. Alternatively, candidates may
     choose a thematic approach and address the impact of the war on aspects such as the different
     clans, the relationship between the emperor and the shogun, the changing nature of political elites,
     the geography of Japan and the feudal system. While candidates may also mention changes to
     lifestyle, religion or social structures these must be within the context of the political impact.



4.   Examine the impact of the samurai on Japanese society.

     Candidates will consider the impact of the samurai on Japanese society in a way that uncovers the
     interrelationships of the issue. Candidates may argue that a cultural shift occurred from admiration
     of scholarship and aesthetics to a worship of the way of the warrior or Bushido. Candidates may
     address the impact of the samurai on areas such as art, literature, religion, gender relations and
     economics and identify the connections. Candidates may also consider the impact on the
     emergence of the feudal system by the end of the 12th century and the subsequent political and
     economic outcomes. While no set response is expected, candidates may choose a chronological
     or a thematic approach and they must focus on the impact of the samurai.
                                                  –9–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3        Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   “European expeditions to East Asia and South-East Asia were motivated by a desire for wealth.”
     Discuss.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement, with which they may
     agree, partially agree or disagree. Candidates may suggest that the belief in Europe about the
     limitless wealth of the Orient fuelled a desire by both individuals and monarchs to explore and
     break the Ottoman monopoly of the spice trade in order to reap the material benefits. Additionally
     or alternatively, candidates may argue that a range of other factors were also significant. These
     may include the expansion of Christianity against the growth of Islam, the rivalry between
     Protestants and Catholics after the Reformation, scientific curiosity and national rivalry. While no
     set response is expected, candidates must incorporate a review of the desire for wealth.



6.   Discuss the reasons for Japanese isolationism in the 17th century.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for Japanese isolationism in
     the 17th century that includes a range of arguments and factors. Candidates may suggest the
     reasons for sakoku (closed country policy) were the Tokugawa Shogunate’s fear of foreign
     conquest and the perception that missionaries and traders facilitated this. Additionally or
     alternatively, candidates may consider other significant factors such as the conversion of dissent
     daimyo to Christianity and the Shogunate’s fear of rebellion, its desire to control trade and the need
     to exclude all foreign influences to maintain cultural cohesion and internal peace. While no set
     response is expected, candidates must incorporate a review of the reasons for isolationism whilst
     clearly presenting their argument.
                                                – 10 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4       The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   Evaluate the contribution of Babur and Humayun to the rise of Mughal power.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the contribution of both Babur and Humayun to the rise of
     Mughal power. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that outlines the rule of Babur
     followed by that of Humayun and which may identify the wars fought to consolidate each of their
     power bases as well as the nature of each administration. Alternatively, candidates may choose a
     thematic approach and address the contribution of both rulers in areas such as power struggles,
     geographical supremacy and the cultural nature of Mughal rule. Candidates may offer a
     comparison of both men or they may identify a progression from one to the other, but the focus
     must be on the rise of Mughal power.



8.   Examine the reasons for, and effects of, domestic opposition to Shah Jahan I.

     Candidates will consider the interrelationship between reasons for and the effects of domestic
     opposition to Shah Jahan I. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that identifies
     instances of opposition to Shah Jahan I, why they occurred and then directly addresses the
     outcomes. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and examine the reasons
     for, and effects of, domestic opposition in areas such as dynastic power struggles, geographical
     supremacy, imposition of Sharia law, religious intolerance, cultural matters and the bureaucratic
     nature of his administration. While candidates may also reflect on other factors concerning the
     success or otherwise of Shah Jahan I’s rule, the focus of the response must be on the domestic
     opposition.
                                                  – 11 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 5         Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Discuss the reasons for, and the consequences of, the introduction of the Liberal Policy by the
      Dutch in Indonesia in the mid-19th century.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for, and the consequences
      of, the Dutch introduction of the Liberal Policy that includes a range of arguments and factors.
      Candidates may suggest that widespread criticism of the Culture System and political changes in
      the Netherlands led to its introduction. Additionally or alternatively, candidates may argue that the
      influence of the business community and the potential of private enterprise to develop further
      ventures were significant factors. Candidates may question whether the subsequent profitability
      resulted from the Policy or from international trade. They may suggest that the exploitation
      continued and living standards fluctuated. While no set response is expected, candidates must
      incorporate a review of both reasons and consequences.



10.   Evaluate the significance of Rizal to the development of nationalism in the Philippines.

      Candidates will appraise the significance of Rizal to the development of nationalism in the
      Philippines. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that outlines his activism, the impact
      of his writing, the circumstances of his execution and that, perhaps, addresses his legacy.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and identify a range of factors in the
      development of nationalism such as Rizal’s moderate reforming methods, the revolutionary
      activities of Bonifacio and Aguinaldo, colonial economic exploitation and racial discrimination and
      changing attitudes in Spain. The focus, however, must be on the importance of Rizal in relation to
      these other factors and candidates may argue that Rizal became a symbolic figure.
                                                  – 12 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 6         India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)


11.   Evaluate the social impact of the policies of Dalhousie and Bentinck on Indian society.

      Candidates will appraise the social impact of the policies of Dalhousie and Bentinck on various
      aspects of Indian society. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that outlines the
      policies of Bentinck followed by those of Dalhousie and that identifies their impact on Indian society
      at the time. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic or a comparative approach and
      address the impact of their policies in areas such as the legal system, education, marriage
      customs, religious observance and inheritance patterns. Some candidates may mention that
      Dalhousie was an “Orientalist” while others may consider the extent to which Indian society
      became anglicized. The inclusion of economic and political changes must be within the context of
      the social impact.



12.   To what extent did Russo-British rivalry contribute to the outbreak of the First and Second Anglo-
      Afghan Wars?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the assumption in the question that Russo-
      British rivalry might have contributed to the outbreak of each war. They may fully agree, partially
      agree or disagree with this assumption. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that
      contextualises the wars and that addresses the role of Russo-British rivalry in each. Alternatively,
      candidates may choose a comparative approach or a thematic one and balance Russo-British
      rivalry against a range of other factors such as regional ethnic tensions, the struggle for power
      between Afghan rulers, the expansionist ambitions of individual Afghan rulers, the control of trade
      routes, and the issue of diplomatic relations with European powers. Whichever method is used
      both wars will be addressed.
                                                 – 13 –              M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7        Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Discuss the reasons why the western powers imposed unequal treaties on China in the 1840s.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why the western powers
      imposed unequal treaties on China that includes a range of arguments and factors. Candidates
      may suggest that the treaties reflected the western grievances that caused the First Opium War.
      Additionally or alternatively, candidates may consider how the circumstances of the war shaped
      the treaties and how their terms guaranteed the interests of the different western countries.
      Candidates may also question the extent to which they were unequal given that China did gain
      some benefit from the increased trade. No set response is expected; therefore, candidates may
      choose a chronological or a thematic approach.



14.   Evaluate the reasons for the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

      Candidates will appraise reasons for the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate by weighing up the
      significance of long- and short-term factors. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that
      outlines the nature of Tokugawa society prior to 1853 and then the consequences of the treaties
      and events between 1854 and 1868. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach
      and address aspects such as economic problems, the decline of the feudal system, the rise of the
      tozama clans, political challenges to the Shogunate and the impact of foreign demands. Some
      candidates may argue that reasons for the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate were inherent while
      others may consider the catalyst of Perry’s arrival more significant.
                                                   – 14 –              M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 8         British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   “Settlement schemes in Australia and New Zealand were too ambitious and often ended in failure.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement, with which they may
      agree, partially agree or disagree. Candidates will choose case studies from both Australia and
      New Zealand. Candidates may adopt an approach that outlines examples of settlement schemes
      in one country followed by those of the other. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic or
      a comparative approach and discuss the statement in areas such as different theories about land
      distribution and labour supply, penal settlements, government schemes to attract free settlers and
      women, private and church ventures, and chartered companies. Candidates are likely to review
      the aims and outcomes of various schemes in their discussion.



16.   To what extent did the growth of national identity contribute to the achievement of dominion status
      for either Australia (1901) or New Zealand (1907)?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the assumption in the question that the growth
      of national identity might have contributed to the achievement of dominion status in one country.
      They may fully agree, partially agree or disagree with this assumption. Candidates may adopt a
      chronological approach that outlines the circumstances leading to the achievement of dominion
      status and reflects on cultural changes that indicate the growth of national identity. Alternatively,
      candidates may choose a thematic approach and balance the growth of national identity against
      other factors such as economic and strategic concerns, and the country’s evolving constitutional
      status within the British Empire. In Australia, other issues such as the desire for uniform laws and
      Federation may also be considered.

Section 9        Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   Compare and contrast the attempts at modernization in China and Japan in the period up to 1895.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences between the attempts at
      modernization in China and Japan in the given timeframe by referring to both throughout the
      response. Candidates may address the similarities and differences chronologically and note that
      each country had phases in the modernization process with varying degrees of success at different
      times. Or they may identify the similarities and the differences separately. Alternatively,
      candidates may adopt a thematic approach and consider both in areas such as the problems
      posed by western demands for trade, the philosophy of self-strengthening, the challenges of
      population and geography, the issues of political structure and leadership, the way modernization
      was implemented, financial investment, industrialization and economic outcomes, the attempts at
      social and cultural change, and military developments.



18.   Evaluate the contribution of Sun Yixian to the causes of the 1911 Xinhai Revolution.

      Candidates will appraise the contribution of Sun Yixian to the causes of the 1911 Xinhai
      Revolution. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that contextualizes the revolution,
      outlines Sun’s ideas, activism and influence and which identifies his role as president.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and balance Sun’s contribution against
      other factors such as the weakness and unpopularity of the Qing government, the Boxer Protocol
      and its consequences, the failure of the Late Qing reform movement and the actions of other
      revolutionary groups and leaders such as Yuan Shikai. If a range of other factors are considered
      the ultimate focus of the response must be on Sun’s contribution.

Section 10       Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War on the demands for Home Rule in India.

      Candidates will appraise the impact of the First World War on the demands for Home Rule in India
      by considering changes to the expectations of the Indian nationalist movements. Candidates may
      adopt a chronological approach that outlines the establishment of the Home Rule Leagues—one
      by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and one by Annie Besant—and their activism, the responses of Congress
      and the All India Muslim League and the political implications of the British reactions both during
      and after the war. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and address whether
      the war led to a change in focus from power sharing to demanding home rule or even complete
      independence from the British.



20.   Discuss the role of Mountbatten in the partition of the South Asian subcontinent in 1947.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of Mountbatten’s role in the partition of the
      South Asian subcontinent that includes a range of arguments and factors. Candidates may adopt
      a chronological approach that contextualizes the issue of partition and outlines Mountbatten’s
      involvement. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and balance
      Mountbatten’s role against other aspects such as the actions of Wavell, the British government’s
      expectations, the demands of the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League, the
      contributions of Indian nationalist leaders such as Nehru, Gandhi and Jinnah, the needs of the
      princely states and the various proposals.

Section 11        Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War on the rise of militarism and nationalism in Japan.

      Candidates will appraise the impact of the First World War on the rise of militarism and nationalism
      in Japan. Some candidates may consider the immediate aftermath of the war whilst others will go
      up to 1941. However, both militarism and nationalism must be addressed. Candidates may adopt
      a chronological approach that outlines the reactions to the Treaty of Versailles and the Washington
      Naval Conference and the events of the 1920s and 1930s. Alternatively, candidates may choose a
      thematic approach and balance aspects such as international relations, domestic politics, imperial
      ambitions, cultural perceptions and the older institutions of the state and army against the rise of
      militarism and nationalism.



22.   With reference to the period up to 1990, examine the effects on Japanese society of globalization.

      Candidates will consider the concept of globalization in a way that uncovers the interrelationships
      of its effects on Japanese society. Candidates may initially define globalization and then identify its
      effects in areas such as the economy, working and living conditions, the structure of Japanese
      society, gender roles, immigration, education, religious practices and politics. Additionally or
      alternatively, candidates may suggest that Japan was not simply a passive recipient of change and
      they may stress Japan’s role as an agent of globalization. Some candidates may argue that
      globalization created positive outcomes while others may not. Although no set response is
      expected and candidates may choose a chronological or a thematic approach, they must focus on
      the effects of globalization.

Section 12          China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.     Evaluate the impact of the May Fourth movement (1919) on China.

      Candidates will appraise the impact of the May Fourth movement on China by weighing up its
      importance as a factor for change. Some candidates may focus on the immediate aftermath whilst
      others will extend their appraisal to 1949. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that
      contextualizes the movement, outlines the main ideas and identifies subsequent outcomes.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and address the impact on areas such as
      intellectual debate, cultural change and political ideologies that, in turn, led to future conflict. Some
      candidates may argue that other factors such as warlordism, weak government and Western
      exploitation were also significant in shaping the future whereas others will contend that the
      movement was critical.



24.     “Brutal and a failure.” Discuss with reference to Jiang Jieshi's rule in Taiwan up to 1950.

        Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the statement, with which they may
        agree, partially agree or disagree. Discussion should deal with the timeframe from 1945, after the
        Guomindang took control of Taiwan, to 1950. Candidates may outline the suppression of dissent
        after the 1947 riots, the imposition of martial law in 1949 and the arrival of Jiang, and argue that his
        rule was brutal. Some candidates may suggest it was not a failure because the Communists failed
        to capture Taiwan and he remained in power. Others may argue that Jiang survived because of
        US support and that the need for brutality demonstrated his failure to govern effectively.
        Candidates must incorporate a review of both aspects, but there may some imbalance.

Section 13        Impact of the world wars on South-East Asia

25.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles on South-East Asia.

      Candidates will appraise the impact of the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles by weighing
      up the strengths and limitations of their effect on political, economic, social or cultural aspects in
      the region. Some candidates may consider the impact on countries individually while others may
      choose a comparative approach that encompasses several countries in the region. Candidates
      may address areas such as the continuation of the colonial empires, the disillusionment after
      involvement in the war, discontent caused by the failure to recognize racial equality, the new ideas
      and Wilson’s Fourteen Points, which were catalysts for fledging nationalist movements, the appeal
      of the concept of self-determination and the emergence of nationalist leaders.



26.   Compare and contrast the impact of Japanese occupation during the Second World War on two
      countries in South-East Asia.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the impact of Japanese
      occupation during the Second World War on two countries in South-East Asia by referring to both
      throughout the response. Popular choices are likely to be Burma, Indo-China/Vietnam, Dutch East
      Indies/Indonesia, Malaya, Singapore or the Philippines. Candidates may address the similarities
      and differences chronologically and note the stages of Japanese occupation at different times in
      each country. Or they may identify the similarities and the differences separately. Alternatively,
      candidates may adopt a thematic approach and consider both in areas such as the restructure of
      government and administration, the development nationalist movements and leaders, the level of
      atrocities and violence, the social and economic changes, and the legacy after the war when the
      colonial powers returned.

Section 14       The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Discuss the reasons why Mao Zedong launched the Hundred Flowers campaign (1956).

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why Mao Zedong launched
      the Hundred Flowers campaign that includes a range of arguments and factors. Candidates may
      suggest he used repressive campaigns to consolidate his power. Additionally or alternatively,
      candidates may argue that the First Five-Year Plan influenced him to welcome discussion about
      China’s progress. Candidates may discuss different historians’ perspectives: Jung Chang
      contends that it was a trick to weed out potential opposition whereas Feigon believes Mao was
      initially genuine and Spence argues that his motives were ill defined. While no set response is
      expected, candidates may choose a chronological or a thematic approach, they must focus on the
      reasons why Mao launched the campaign.



28.   To what extent were the aims of the Tiananmen Square demonstrators achieved?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the assumption in the question that the aims of
      the Tiananmen Square demonstrators might have been achieved. They may fully agree, partially
      agree or disagree with this assumption. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that
      outlines the events leading to the Tiananmen Square demonstration, and the aftermath, and which
      then reflects on whether the aims of the demonstrators were achieved. Alternatively, candidates
      may choose a thematic approach and identify factors such as the demands for liberal democracy
      as a “Fifth Modernization”, the tensions within the Politburo and the harsh treatment of dissidents.
      Candidates may argue that economic reforms transformed the lives of many Chinese, but political
      change was not achievable.

Section 15       Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   With reference to the period from 1954 to 1963, discuss the reasons why conflict continued in
      Vietnam after the French Indo-China War.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why conflict continued in
      Vietnam that includes a range of arguments and factors. Candidates may challenge the
      assumption in the question that conflict might have ended in 1954. They may suggest that,
      although the division of Vietnam was meant to be temporary, external factors prevailed.
      Candidates may argue that Diem’s corrupt regime, US involvement and the containment policy
      prolonged conflict. Additionally or alternatively, candidates may contend that Ho Chi Minh’s
      leadership, Soviet/Chinese aid to North Vietnam and Viet Cong insurgencies were more significant
      factors. While no set response is expected and candidates may choose a chronological or a
      thematic approach, they must discuss the reasons why conflict continued.



30.   Evaluate the consequences for Afghanistan of the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989.

      Candidates will appraise the consequences for Afghanistan of the withdrawal of Soviet troops.
      Most candidates will focus on the 10 years following 1989. Candidates may adopt a chronological
      approach that that outlines the sequence of political events and the continued conflict.
      Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach and address aspects such as the
      continued Soviet support, the resistance fighters (mujahideen), involvement of the US, Pakistan
      and Saudi Arabia and the ascendency of the Taliban. Other consequences such as the presence
      of deserters from the Soviet army, the plight of refugees, opium production, and the impact of the
      continuing conflict on health, education and the role of women may also be considered.

Section 16        Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947

31.   Discuss the political and economic developments that took place in Bangladesh between 1971 and
      2005.

Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the political and economic developments in
Bangladesh that includes a range of arguments and factors. Candidates may outline political
developments followed by economic ones while others may adopt a chronological approach or a
thematic one. Candidates may argue that despite initial authoritarian governments Bangladesh became
democratic after 1991 and there were significant economic developments with diversified industries.
Additionally or alternatively, candidates may suggest that the democracy was compromised by
traditional power structures and the emergence of Islamist politics and that economic development was
limited by inefficient government and corruption. While candidates may also mention social and cultural
changes these must be within the context of the political and economic developments.



32.   Evaluate the causes of the civil war in Sri Lanka.

      Candidates will appraise the causes of the civil war in Sri Lanka by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of long- and short-term factors. Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that
      outlines the nature of society in colonial times and then the legislation and events after
      independence resulting in civil war. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic approach
      and address aspects such as ethnic tensions, British “divide and rule” policies, geographic
      distribution of ethnic groups, impact of the Citizenship Act, the issues of the official language and
      religion, access to education and the rise of militant Tamil groups. External factors such as the
      support for the Tamil cause from the United Kingdom and India may also be considered.

Section 17       Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   Evaluate the policies and achievements of the Whitlam government.

      Candidates will appraise the policies and achievements of the Whitlam government by weighing up
      their strengths and limitations. This government attempted to change many aspects of Australian
      society so candidates will need to decide on which policies became lasting achievements.
      Candidates may adopt a chronological approach that outlines the sequence of the policies
      implemented and which notes the achievements. Alternatively, candidates may choose a thematic
      approach and identify the domestic policies and achievements in areas such as health, indigenous
      affairs, education, equal opportunity, multiculturalism, Australian nationalism and infrastructure.
      Foreign policies and achievements such as the change in relations with the US and the People’s
      Republic of China and the shift in focus to Asia may also be addressed.



34.   Discuss the successes and failures of government policies towards the indigenous people of New
      Zealand between 1945 and 2005.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the successes and failures of
      government policies towards the indigenous people of New Zealand that includes a range of
      arguments and factors. Candidates may identify the successes followed by the failures or they
      may choose a chronological or a thematic approach. Candidates may suggest policies were
      progressive due to the original Treaty of Waitangi, the 1945 Maori Social and Economic
      Advancement Act and subsequent legislation. Alternatively, candidates may argue that
      governments were slow to respond to the changing needs of the indigenous people, particularly
      when Maori urbanization increased rapidly. While no set response is expected, candidates must
      incorporate a review of government policies towards the indigenous people.

Section 18        Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan and
                  India) (1980–2005)

35.   Evaluate the economic and social impact of the tourist industry in two countries of the region
      (excluding China, Japan and India).

      Candidates will appraise the economic and social impact of the tourist industry in two countries.
      The focus will be on impact not the causes of tourism or descriptions of locales. Candidates may
      adopt an approach that outlines the tourist industry in one country followed by that of another and
      identifies its economic and social impact on each. Alternatively, candidates may choose a
      thematic or a comparative approach and address the impact in areas such as infrastructure,
      investment, employment, the environment, the standard of living, family structures and values,
      religion, demographics and criminal activity. Some candidates may argue that the tourist industry
      created positive outcomes while others may not.



36.   Compare and contrast the impact of terrorism on two countries of the region (excluding China,
      Japan and India).

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences in the impact of terrorism on two
      countries of the region by referring to both throughout the response. Candidates may address the
      similarities and differences chronologically and note varying phases of terrorism in each country
      within the given timeframe for this section. Or they may identify the similarities and the differences
      separately. Alternatively, candidates may adopt a thematic approach and consider both in areas
      such as financial costs for increased security, changes in the economy, legal and constitutional
      amendments, human rights violations, censorship, domestic upheaval and disruption, the fear of
      terrorism amongst the population, the treatment of certain religious or ethnic groups, travel
      restrictions, increase in foreign aid to fight terrorism and changes in military alliances.
