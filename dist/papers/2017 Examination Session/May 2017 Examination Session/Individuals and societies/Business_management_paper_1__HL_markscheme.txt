                                               Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to Utopia, describe the importance of two external stakeholders
           (line 12).                                                                                [4]

           External stakeholders could be:
           • Suppliers – the local business in particular and coffee suppliers. The business
              relies on the quality of these products
           • Local craftsmen – can be considered different from suppliers
           • Customers – this is in the service industry and customers are critical. Word-of-
              mouth is so important in this industry and these will tend to be influential people
           • Banks, etc – unlikely to be important as the business does not use external
              finance
           • The government – very important for regulations such as H&S. Also collects
              taxes so has an impact on profits.
           • Local community – Utopia provides work, has focus on local suppliers
           • Pressure groups/media – no obvious importance although bad publicity to be
              avoided
           • Competitors are allowed as external stakeholders

           N.b.: shareholders are not external. Do not reward comments about stakeholders in
           general – there has to be references to specific stakeholders


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each correct stakeholder identified and [1] for a description of how that
           stakeholder relates to Utopia. Award a maximum of [2] per stakeholder.

     (b)   With reference to Utopia, explain the role of promotion (line 6).                         [6]

           Promotion will have to be very focused to be effective.

           Two aspects of promotion:
           • Providing information: This is an upmarket business offering quite a different
             kind of tourist service. Potential customers will want to know a great deal about
             the specialities, such as locally produced goods and services, local cuisine, local
             culture, luxurious facilities and services
           • Persuasion: Probably important early in the life of the business but less so as
             word-of-mouth promotion will now be a critical way to get new customers (C2C).
             How many customers are return visitors? Advertising through public relations
             may well be important, as tourist destinations often appear in travel pages of
             newspapers.

           Creating, maintaining, reinforcing the ‘upmarket’ brand and image is important.
           Promotion may not be quite as important as for other tourist destinations because its
           focus is going to be on a niche market.

           Accept any other relevant application.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.
           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of promotion is mainly descriptive but
           in context.

           For full marks the explanation needs to be developed and in context.

2.   (a)   With reference to JAC, describe two advantages of internal growth (line 52).           [4]

           Internal growth: selling more; widening product range; expanding facilities

           • JAC is a relatively small enterprise relative to Utopia so it would not be too
             difficult to raise the resources to grow JAC internally.
           • John Ariki’s philosophy is for internal growth.
           • Because of the emphasis on local culture, specialised coffee, etc, it is important
             for JAC to retain control – control might be diluted with external growth.
           • With outside influences the vision for JAC might be diluted.
           • JAC is part of Utopia so the vision for Utopia is relevant.
           • Gaining economies of scale e.g. bulkbuying coffee for the whole business
             Remember: JAC is owned as a sole trader


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each advantage identified, and [1] for the development of each of
           these key aspects in the context of JAC/Utopia/John, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   With reference to John, explain the key functions of management.                       [6]

           Key functions of management are:
           • setting objectives and planning
           • organising resources to meet objectives, including staff recruitment
           • directing and motivating staff
           • coordinating activities
           • controlling and measuring performance.

           With reference to John:
           • He created the original business plan.
           • He made decisions about reflecting local culture and resisting external
             stakeholders.
           • He organises local suppliers.
           • It was his decision to open café.
           • He creates crisis management and contingency plans.
           • He decides on options.
           • He delegates to his children but keeps the reigns.
           • He organised and managed a meeting between himself, Liza and Paul.
           • He monitors performance.
           • He sets organisational structure and manages changes.
           • He makes the final decision.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.
           Award a maximum of [5] if the explanation of functions is mainly descriptive but
           in context.

3.   (a)   With reference to Utopia, describe two suitable sources of finance for the 3D
           printers (line 60).                                                                         [4]

           Relative to the size of Utopia, the cost of the printers is not large.

           Sources could include:
           • retained profits – but are these sufficient after the problems of 2016?
           • sale of assets – but are there any? The villas are only just being rebuilt and the
             café is growing
           • reductions in working capital – impossible to say but it does seem an efficient
             organization
           • loans – although John does not want external influences, he is thinking that he
             will have to look outside. Loans would dilute his control the least. Debentures are
             unrealistic. Debt factoring
           • joint ventures, strategic alliances, franchising would seem rather unsuitable for
             the 3D printing as it is a small project. Would anyone be interested?
           • Shares: Unlikely to be suitable as John owns 100% of shares and does not want
             external influences
           • Hire purchase/leasing – would this be available from 3D printer manufacturers?
           • Can also consider grants

              Shares not acceptable as John owns 100% of shares. Remember, Utopia is a
              private limited company

           Accept any other relevant point.


           Mark as 2+2.

           Award [1] for each source identified, and [1] for the development of each of these
           sources in the context of the project, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Explain the role of ethics in John’s businesses.                                            [6]

           Ethical objectives are difficult to define and vary from culture to culture; however, the
           following might be regarded as ethical/socially responsible:
           • using local craftsmen
           • focussing on local culture
           • using local ingredients
           • using ethically produced fair trade coffee and paying above market prices.

           Importance relates to:
           • maintaining the goodwill of the community
           • maintaining the goodwill of suppliers, employees
           • maintaining the brand image (perhaps the most important).
           • Aiming to improve long term success and profitability of the business

           Accept any other relevant analysis.


           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer.
           Award a maximum of [5] if the analysis is mainly descriptive but in context.

           For full marks the explanation needs to be developed and in context.

4.   (a)   Describe one method of lean production other than recycling.                               [2]

           Lean production can include JIT inventory control, JIT production, capacity
           management, TQM, improved efficiency to improve capacity utilization, involving
           workers in internal markets, supply chains, flexible systems. Kanban, Kaizen,
           Andon. Allow quality assurance., Cradle to Cradle, ‘right first time’

           ‘Decreasing waste’ can only reach one mark since it is a definition of lean production
           rather than a method.


           Award [1] for a description that shows partial understanding. Award [2] for a
           description that shows full understanding.

     (b)   With reference to Utopia, explain two benefits of having a strong brand.                   [4]

           Brand: an identifying name, symbol, image or trademark that distinguishes a
           product/service from its competitors.

           The nature of Utopia is an upmarket expensive tourist destination. There are lots of
           alternatives, so Utopia has to market its uniqueness. Utopia’s marketing relies on
           word of mouth and social media. In order for these to be successful, the name
           (which is the brand) has to have an impact on potential customers. John believes
           that the beautiful location, the local craftsmen and materials, and the local food and
           coffee, together form the basis for the Utopia brand. So these each need to be
           strong for the brand to work.

           Benefits could include: emphasizing the uniqueness of service; reinforcing word of
           mouth; strengthening name; creating and maintain a strong image; easier to
           introduce new products through family branding; competitive edge.

           Accept any other relevant benefits


           Award [1] for each reason identified, and [1] for the development of each of these
           reasons in the context of Utopia.

     (c)   Using information from Table 1 and Table 2, calculate the net present value (NPV)
           for the 3D printing project.                                                               [4]

           Total NPV = $2510 (12,510 – 10,000)
           Lots of possibilities of rounding differences – allow especially if DCFs calculated with
           calculator rather than using given ones.

different answers due to rounding).
Award [3] for correct answer, but wrong units or for simple arithmetic error.
Award [2] for right approach but significant errors e.g. omitting capital cost or not
totalling the NPVs.
Award [1] for attempt that shows limited understanding.

(d)   Using information from the case study, additional information above and your results
      from part (c), discuss whether Utopia should proceed with the 3D printing project.     [10]

      In favour:
      • Positive NPV (but allow OFR)
      • Paul likes the idea
      • Unique souvenirs
      • Cost reductions
      • $10k is not large in the scale of the operation
      • Use of recycled materials fits in with Utopia’s ethos and image

      Against:
      • Does this market really do souvenirs?
      • Liza does not like
      • Recruitment difficulties
      • Impact on local people – may damage part of the ethos
      • Costs of recycling unclear
      • Not suited to niche market?

      According to Ansoff this might be diversification or new product depending on your
      point of view, but it does carry risks whichever.

      Decision depends on John and whether other option(s) are better. John believes
      the technology will bring other benefits, which may swing him that way, however the
      impact on local craftsman would weigh heavily.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6 .

      Award a maximum of [4] for a purely theoretical answer or with no effective use of
      case material.
      Award a maximum of [5] if only one side of argument is considered in context.
      Award a maximum of [6] if both sides are considered but there is limited use of data
      (e.g. no use of NPV). However, if limited statement(s) are made about NPV/Cash
      Flow could achieve [7]
      Award a maximum of [8] if both sides considered, there is good use of data, but an
      unsupported recommendation.
      For full marks two sides of the argument should be considered, data used
      effectively, and the recommendation supported.

      Note – a recommendation that a decision cannot be made due to lack of information
      (eg market research) can be regarded as a decision provided the arguments are
      supported.

     Marks should be allocated according to the assessment criteria on pages 7–8.

     Criterion A: Knowledge areas include: risk, decision trees and predicted outcomes,
     location decisions, use of data, strategic decision making. PEST (not necessarily
     formally), Ansoff and other appropriate ideas.. No understanding of decision
     trees/predicted outcomes, marks limited to [3]. Not all knowledge areas required, we are
     looking for tools that can be expected to help make a recommendation.
     Criterion B: Application will be judged by the use of the stimulus material, in particular the
     extra material. If only one option considered, award a maximum of [2]. If both options
     considered but no use of additional material, award a maximum of [3].
     Criterion C: Reasoned argument. For full marks there needs to be a comparison
     between the two options and a supported recommendation. If analysis of only one, award
     a maximum of [3]. If no comparison but analysis of both options awards a maximum
     of [2].
     Criterion D: Structure – see criterion.
     Criterion E: Likely issues include: impact on communities, workers, cultural differences,
     views of the shareholders/management, other stakeholders.
