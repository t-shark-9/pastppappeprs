Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain how the overuse of common access resources can lead to negative
               externalities.                                                                     [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of common access resources and negative externalities
               • diagram to show negative externalities arising from overconsumption (depletion
                 of common access resources) or production (environmental degradation as a
                 by-product of production activities)
               • explanation that overuse of common access resources can lead to environmental
                 damage or resource depletion, which are forms of market failure, leading to
                 negative externalities of production or consumption
               • examples of how overuse of common access resources leads to negative
                 externalities such as over-fishing, open-cast mining and deforestation.

(b)   Discuss the view that the best way to reduce the threat to sustainability, arising from
      the burning of fossil fuels, is for the government to provide subsidies to firms that
      produce energy through renewable sources.                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of subsidies and sustainability
      • diagram(s) to show the impact of subsidies on the market for renewable
        energy and the market for fossil fuels
      • explanation that subsidies reduce the costs of production for renewable
        energy firms and the price of renewable energy to consumers, which
        reduces the demand for energy produced by burning fossil fuels. This
        creates greater sustainability in the energy market
      • examples of subsidies on the market for renewable energy such as solar
        power and wind farms
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: alternative policies that could be used instead of
      subsidies, consideration of the impact of subsidies on different stakeholder
      groups, negative effects on the fossil fuel industry. It could also consider the
      short-term costs of subsidies and the long-term benefits on sustainability.

           • definitions of perfect competition and long run
           • diagram(s) to show the shut-down point in perfect competition

             firm can cover its variable costs in the short run but cannot cover its total
             costs in the long run. It is not making a normal profit

(b)   Discuss the view that perfect competition is a more desirable market structure than
      monopoly.                                                                             [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of market structure, perfect competition and monopoly
      • diagram(s) to compare and contrast perfect competition and monopoly
      • explanation that perfect competition has a number of advantages like lower
        prices, greater choice and allocative and productive efficiency compared
        with monopoly
      • examples of markets which have features of perfect competition and
        monopoly
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: reference to benefits of monopoly such as
      economies of scale, research and development, natural monopoly, and/or the
      disadvantages of monopoly (higher price, lower output). To focus on the word
      “desirable” in the question, discussion may also include the advantages and
      disadvantages of perfect competition.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain the impact that a fall in the world price of oil might have on aggregate supply
           and gross domestic product (GDP) in an economy.                                           [10]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of aggregate supply and GDP
           • diagram to show AS/SRAS shifting to right and GDP increasing
           • explanation that in an oil importing country a fall in the price of oil reduces
             production costs to industry and causes the aggregate supply to increase
             and GDP to rise
           • example of economies where fall in oil prices has increased aggregate
             supply and GDP in an economy.

           Explanation may include: the perspective of an oil exporting country as an
           alternative to an oil importing country. In this case, a fall in the world price of oil
           would mean reduced export revenues, and as net exports are a component of
           aggregate demand, this would cause aggregate demand and GDP to decrease.

(b)   Evaluate the view that economic growth is best achieved through improvements in
      technology.                                                                        [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • diagram to show LRAS increasing and real output increasing
      • explanation of how technological improvements cause LRAS to increase in
        the long term as industry becomes more productive
      • examples of technological improvements increasing LRAS in an economy
      • synthesis or evaluation.

      Evaluation may include: the effect of advances in technology being dependent
      on the skill level of the labour force and whether the technology is appropriate
      for the development level of the economy. The response may also consider
      how factors other than technology might affect LRAS such as the discovery of
      new natural resources and the importance of aggregate demand in affecting
      growth in the short term. A PPF diagram may be rewarded equally if used to
      explain economic growth effectively.

4.   (a)   Explain why a high rate of inflation may negatively affect both a country’s export
           competitiveness and the level of capital investment by firms.                        [10]

           Answers may include:
           • definitions of inflation, export competitiveness and investment
           • diagram to show the impact of inflation on the price level and output eg
             AD/AS
           • explanation of why inflation might produce adverse effects
           • example(s) of where inflation has affected a country’s export
             competitiveness and/or the level of capital investment.

(b)   Discuss the view that the use of monetary policy is always the best way to reduce
      inflation.                                                                          [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of monetary policy
      • diagram(s) to show the application of policy to deal with inflation, AD/AS
      • explanation of the way in which policy impacts the rate of inflation
      • examples of where such policy has been used
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: the impacts of monetary policy on the economy,
      trade, employment, households, savings, investment, confidence, etc. It may
      also consider the merits of monetary policy in comparison with alternative
      policies to control inflation. It may consider the merits of policy options in
      relation to cost-push versus demand-pull inflation.
