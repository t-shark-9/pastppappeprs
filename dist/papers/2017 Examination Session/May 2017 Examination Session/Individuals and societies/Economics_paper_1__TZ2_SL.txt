                                               Section A

Answer one question from this section.

Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain why an increase in incomes over time may lead to an increase in demand for
           some goods but a decrease in demand for other goods.                                      [10]

     (b)   The income elasticity of demand for primary commodities tends to be relatively low,
           while the income elasticity of demand for manufactured goods and services tends to be
           higher. Examine the likely effects of this for individual producers and for the economy
           as a whole.                                                                               [15]


2.   (a)   Explain why demerit goods are an example of market failure.                               [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of using indirect taxation to correct market failure.          [15]

Answer one question from this section.

Macroeconomics

3.   (a)   Explain what effect a reduction in interest rates might have on consumption and
           investment.                                                                             [10]

     (b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of using monetary policy to reduce the rate of inflation.    [15]


4.   (a)   Explain the causes of economic growth in terms of an increase in actual output and an
           increase in potential output.                                                           [10]

     (b)   Discuss the view that the consequences of economic growth are always beneficial.        [15]
