Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
 10–12     • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally
              well structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate
              and relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
  7–9      • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
           • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their
              historical context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.

Section 1       Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   Discuss the political organization of one pre-Columbian society.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the political organization of one society
     in pre-Columbian America during, although not necessarily spanning, the period from c750 to
     1500. While candidates may briefly contextualize the situation in the Americas in this period and
     offer information regarding the types of political entities that existed at this time—empires (Inca),
     kingdoms or cacicazgos (Chibchas), confederations (Iroquois), or tribes, clans or bands (Cherokee
     or Dakota), for example—the overall focus of their responses must be on the political organization
     of the chosen society. In answering the question, candidates may adopt a chronological approach,
     outlining how the political organization of the chosen society evolved in response to the pressures
     it experienced. Alternatively, candidates may identify a range of pressures, for example religious
     or geographical, that shaped the political organization of the society. A range of approaches is
     permissible.



2.   Discuss the scientific and artistic developments that took place in one pre-Columbian society.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the scientific and artistic developments
     that took place in one society in pre-Columbian America during, although not necessarily spanning,
     the period from c750 to 1500. Popular examples are likely to be the Mayan, Aztec and Incan
     cultures but discussion of any society from the region during the timeframe is acceptable.
     Candidates may adopt a chronological approach, perhaps outlining how scientific and artistic
     developments evolved in response to certain pressures at certain times. Alternatively, candidates
     may, for example, suggest that scientific and artistic developments were intertwined, noting the
     celestial alignment of some structures, such as the Mayan pyramids, which indicate the interplay
     between architecture and astronomy. Candidates may, if they wish, deal with scientific and artistic
     developments separately. A range of approaches is permissible.
                                                  –8–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2       European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Evaluate the factors that led to the conquest of the Aztecs in 1521.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the factors that led to the fall of the Aztec Empire in 1521. A
     variety of factors may be considered including aspects of Spanish military power, Spanish ambition
     for gold, power and glory, Cortez’s previous experiences in negotiating with and fighting native
     people, as well as rivalries between Aztecs and other communities that allied with the Spanish. It
     may also be argued that both the siege of Tenochtitlan and the smallpox epidemic weakened the
     Aztecs. Candidates may discuss the importance of Aztec myths and legends that announced the
     arrival of gods as a factor that weakened resistance since the Aztecs thought resistance could
     bring punishment and natural disasters. While these and other factors may be addressed, the
     focus is on evaluation of the most significant causes for the decline and fall of the Aztec Empire.



4.   Discuss the consequences of the “Columbian Exchange” in the Americas.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the consequences produced by the
     Columbian Exchange. While both beneficial and detrimental effects are relevant, consequences
     should be limited to impact in the Americas. Transfer of disease was largely an asymmetrical
     exchange, leading to catastrophic mortality rates up to 90 per cent that weakened resistance to
     invasion and led to the introduction and growth of slave labour. Introduction of sugar cane and
     cotton also contributed to the growth of slavery and produced harmful ecological effects.
     Technological exchange included European weaponry that altered hunting and gathering
     techniques and changed conflict resolution methods for indigenous people. Cultural exchange
     included Spanish attempts to encourage and/or impose Catholicism which often produced conflict
     and the loss of cultural diversity. These and many other consequences are relevant.
                                                  –9–                 M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3        Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   With reference to either British or French North America in the period from 1500 to 1763, to what
     extent did the structure of colonial government address political and economic challenges?

     Candidates will consider how far the governmental structure of either British or French North
     America affected its ability to address political and economic challenges during the period
     indicated. In respect to French colonial government, candidates may address the difficulties they
     experienced establishing trade relations with indigenous peoples in their efforts to exploit fur-rich
     regions, the attempts to gain access for Jesuit missionaries to evangelize and encourage
     migration, the efforts to establish companies to develop the land and resources as well as the
     change from commercial to royal administration in response to imperial conflict with Britain. In
     respect to British North America, candidates may focus on the appointment of governors and
     councils to deal with commercial problems, religious conflicts, raids by indigenous peoples and
     wars with France. Protection was typically left to colonial governments which struggled to raise or
     pay for frontier militias.



6.   Discuss the reasons for the introduction of the Pombaline reforms in Portuguese America.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the motives for the introduction of the
     Pombaline reforms by reference to the political, economic and social issues the reforms were
     intended to address in Portuguese America. Political reasons might include desire for
     centralization of power, need to reform the judicial system, difficulty in defence of the frontier and
     concerns with the influence of religious orders. Social issues might address efforts to populate
     unoccupied regions as well as the integration of the indigenous and the white population.
     Economic motives may include the concern over problems with contraband and declining tax
     revenues, the impact of trade restrictions between the colonies and Portugal and the need to
     address underdevelopment in some regions by replacing the economic structure of religious orders
     with state-chartered monopolies.
                                                 – 10 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4        Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   Discuss the economic and political organization of one religious order in Spanish America.

     Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the economic and political organization
     of any one religious order within Spanish America. While the Franciscan, Jesuit and Dominican
     orders are the most likely orders to be addressed, allow any relevant example, such as the
     Augustinians. For political organization, candidates may choose to focus on the hierarchical nature
     of the religious order, how far the order was autocratic or democratic and how far indigenous
     people were allowed positions of importance. For economic organization, candidates may choose
     to focus on the mendicant nature of the order, vows of poverty, transfer of rights of inheritance, the
     extent of economic self-sufficiency, the utilization of large estates, convents and monasteries as
     well as economic relationships with the indigenous population. Regardless of emphasis, both
     economic and political organization must be discussed.



8.   Evaluate the social and political impact of the Great Awakening c1720–1760.

     Candidates will make an appraisal of the Great Awakening by weighing up the strengths and
     limitations of its social and political impact in British North America. Social factors that may be
     addressed include the intensification of religious activity through an emotional conversion
     experience, religious schisms created by the movement, the increase of religious diversity and
     competition, the loss of prestige for older denominations and the emerging importance of new
     denominations, such as the Methodists and Baptists. Political effects might include the growth of a
     free press that contributed to the emergence of political dissent, the emphasis on equality that
     threatened to undermine slavery, and a growing sense of individual equality aiding democratization
     of society and contributing to a declining respect for British governance and deference to authority.
     While emphasis may vary, the evaluation will encompass both the social and political impact.
                                                   – 11 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5         Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Discuss the social impact of slavery on the New World.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact of slavery in the New
      World under one or more colonial power(s) during, although not necessarily spanning, the period of
      1500 to 1800. The most likely choices may be the Spanish and British colonies, but allow any
      other relevant examples, such as the French and Portuguese colonies. Social effects may include
      concepts of racial classification which differed greatly between colonial regions, policies in respect
      to racial assimilation, the birth of Afro-American cultures determined by regional slave-trade from
      Africa, social stratification resulting from the division of labour on larger plantations, decimation of
      slave and indigenous populations due to overcrowding and primitive sanitation and aspects of
      racial prejudice and conflict resulting from the racial classification system.



10.   Evaluate the effectiveness of early opposition to slavery and the slave trade in the New World.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of opposition to slavery and the slave trade
      by weighing up the strengths and limitations of the opposition efforts during the given period.
      While focus may be on the contribution of Quakers in North America, opposition to slavery in other
      parts of the region is also relevant and slave rebellions may be applied as “opposition”. Examples
      may include the opposition to indigenous enslavement by De Las Casas in Spanish colonies and
      the impact of the Great Awakening as a force against African American slavery in North America.
      In respect to Quaker opposition, the efforts of John Woolman in Pennsylvania may be cited along
      with the gradual prohibition of slavery instituted by the Quaker hierarchy. Revolts that might be
      applied include the 1739 Stono Revolt in the Carolinas and the 1791 Haitian rebellion.
                                                   – 12 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6         Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   “Economic factors played an important role in the rise of independence movements.” Discuss with
      reference to one country of the Americas between 1763 and 1830.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the suggestion that economic factors
      played an important role in the rise of independence movements by examining one country within
      the given timeframe. While other factors may be developed as having equal or greater impact, the
      suggestion that economic factors played a substantial role must be considered. Economic factors
      to be considered may include taxation and trade policies, restrictive land policies, concerns of
      wealthy colonial leaders regarding their political capacity to protect economic interests, tensions
      between rural and urban areas, and economic inequality between different social classes. Other
      factors might include European events such as the French Revolution, problems of military supply
      and reinforcement from Europe, as well as the role of colonial leaders, often influenced by
      Enlightenment ideals.



12.   Evaluate the political and military contributions of either Bolivar or San Martin to the process of
      independence.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the political and military roles of one of the two leaders by
      weighing up the strengths and limitations of their contributions to the independence of South
      America. For Bolivar, candidates may discuss the impact of his military campaigns in Nueva
      Granada, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru, his success in attracting support from the British as well
      as many caudillos, his support for Pan-Americanism and his tendency toward authoritarianism.
      For San Martin, focus may be given to his military leadership of the Army of the Andes along with
      the formation of the mounted grenadier army and his inclusion of gauchos in his army. An
      assessment of his role as “protector” of Peru may be discussed as well as the controversy of his
      short-lived time in office.
                                                   – 13 –               M17/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7         Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the Articles of Confederation.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effectiveness of the Articles of Confederation by
      evaluation of its strengths and limitations during the first constitutional period (1777-1789).
      Arguments for effectiveness may refer to the maintenance of independence from Britain, the
      settlement and eventual statehood of western territories and the passage of land ordinances that
      hastened settlement in the Northwest and limited the expansion of slavery. Arguments against
      effectiveness may mention the inability to enforce provisions of the Treaty of Paris allowing British
      occupation of some portions of the Northwest, incapacity to prevent indigenous tribes from
      attacking frontier settlements, inadequate powers of taxation, regulation of commerce or
      enforcement of foreign treaties and the inability to pay Revolutionary War debts. Candidates’
      evaluations will vary as to the extent of effectiveness of the Articles.



14.   “The British North America Act of 1867 was a failure.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that the British North
      America Act of 1867 was a failure. In order to address this issue, candidates may discuss features
      of the act which granted Canadian self-government for domestic issues, allowed the Canadian
      federal legislature to expand its authority during periods of “altered circumstances”, failed to
      address provincial equality in respect to land and mineral rights, deferred to the British Privy
      Council in ways that limited Canadian property and civil rights, lacked federal protection of
      individual civil liberties, and required approval of the British Parliament for amendments to the
      Canadian constitution and made Canadian foreign policy subservient to the British Parliament.

Section 8        United States Civil War: Causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   “The presidential election of 1860 demonstrated that neither the Democratic nor the Republican
      Party could unify the country.” Discuss.

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the stated theory by offering a considered and
      balanced review of the political parties, candidates and platforms of the 1860 election. Focus must
      be on how these elements of the 1860 election affected national unity, rather than on the broad
      background of Civil War causes. Issues that may be discussed are the sectional nature of the
      party platforms, the division of the Democratic Party, and the issue of slavery expansion in the
      western territories and Cuba as a divisive factor in the election. There may also be discussion of
      the impact of third party movements, the potential for electoral success by the Republican Party by
      appealing to the interests of the North and the West only, and the various, often faulty, public
      perceptions of the major candidates, especially Lincoln (note the threats of secession if Lincoln
      were elected).



16.   Evaluate the presidential and congressional plans for post-Civil War reconstruction.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the presidential and congressional plans for reconstruction of
      the post-Civil War South by weighing up their strengths and limitations. These may be considered
      separately or common plans and ideas may be dealt with thematically. In respect to
      reconstruction, candidates may discuss the conflicts represented by the plan of President Lincoln,
      the Wade-Davis Bill, the plan of President Johnson and, ultimately, “Radical Reconstruction” under
      the control of Congress. To evaluate the respective plans, candidates may assess the plan’s
      impact on the social, political and economic reconstruction of the South, the potential for conflict
      between the executive and legislative branches, how far the plans protected the civil liberties of
      freedmen, the likelihood for contributing to conflict and division between the former enemies, and
      the capacity of the plans for economic and political integration of freedmen.

Section 9        The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   “The positive effects of railroad construction outweighed the negative effects.” With reference to
      two countries of the Americas, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the positive effects of
      railroad construction outweighed the negative effects in any two countries of the Americas. While
      positions may vary, the focus should be on assessing and supporting the extent to which the
      suggested position is valid. Positive effects may be supported by discussion of increased trade,
      market access and employment, migration leading to economic opportunity, enhanced
      development of a unified national culture, modernization of industry, development of infrastructure,
      access to and development of natural resources and capacity to export surplus production.
      Harmful effects that may be addressed include overreliance on foreign capital (primarily in Latin
      America), intrusion into and destruction of indigenous peoples’ lands and cultures, destructive
      ecological consequences, exploitation of immigrant labour, and increased opportunities for corrupt
      business dealings and bribery of politicians.



18.   “Nationalism was the most important ideological trend in the Americas between 1865 and 1929.”
      Discuss with reference to two countries of the Americas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the suggestion that nationalism was the
      most important ideological trend of the given period. Discussion is required for two countries of the
      Americas. While ideological trends other than nationalism may be advanced as having substantial
      importance, the role of nationalism must be addressed. Nationalism as an important factor may be
      developed as a cause for entrance into wars (for example, the US in the Spanish American War
      and Canada in the First World War), and emerging national identity was a strong force in many
      nations. Besides nationalism, candidates may focus on various factors, including the role of Social
      Darwinism and Manifest Destiny (mostly in the US and Canada), liberalism in the form of the
      progressive movement, positivism as an effect on the cientificos in respect to Latin America, and
      indigenismo as a form of nationalism.

Section 10       Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   To what extent was US policy towards Latin America dominated by “Dollar Diplomacy” between
      1880 and 1929?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that Dollar Diplomacy was a
      dominant influence on US policy toward Latin America during the given period. While “Dollar
      Diplomacy” is most often associated with President Taft, the use of diplomacy and power to
      promote US commercial interests is associated with most administrations of this era, especially in
      respect to policy toward Latin America. Candidates may cite President Roosevelt’s “Big Stick”
      policies associated with the Panama Canal intervention and President Taft’s use of loans, bonds,
      banking and customhouses to expand commercial control in the Americas. While President Wilson
      asserted a less interventionist relationship based on moral principles, his administration also
      exhibited close ties to US industrialists and engaged in military interventions. Other
      administrations may provide relevant examples as well.



20.   Discuss the domestic impact of the First World War on two countries of the Americas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the domestic impact of the First World
      War on any two countries of the region. Focus may be placed on the duration of the war as well as
      the immediate aftermath. Political, social and economic effects may all be addressed. Issues that
      may be developed include the effects of industrial mobilization, methods of financing the war,
      government limitation of freedom for corporations and workers, impact on organized labour,
      restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of expression, impact on foreign investment
      (predominantly Latin America), gender changes in industrial labour roles, effects on social customs
      and class hierarchy, the use of rationing and effects of economic scarcity, controversies based on
      conscription and high mortality rates, treatment of minorities, and shifts in political power.

Section 11        The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   “In the period prior to the start of the Mexican Revolution, political factors contributed more than
      economic factors to the maintenance of power of Porfirio Diaz.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the role of political and economic factors
      in the maintenance of power of Porfirio Diaz. While candidate’s viewpoints may be varied as to the
      factors enabling Diaz to remain in power, the issue of the predominance of political factors must be
      addressed. For economic influences, candidates may develop aspects of Mexico’s natural
      resources and foreign investment, the expansion of banking and major industries such as railways,
      oil, steel and textiles, and the implementation of a balanced budget. However, it may be argued
      that the benefits were limited to the elite and the middle class. Political factors that may be
      discussed include the methods used by Diaz to divide and control his political opposition, political
      manipulation leading to Diaz’s indefinite re-election, and support for Diaz from the elites, the
      military and the police.



22.   “The Mexican state dealt successfully with post-revolutionary challenges between 1920 and 1940.”
      Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the post-revolutionary challenges faced
      by Mexico during the given period and consider if, or how far, the challenges were successfully
      addressed. Discussion of the problems facing Mexico, as well as the policies implemented to
      solve them, must be included. Challenges that may be discussed include the need for political
      stability which led to the creation of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), concerns over
      secularization of education and the resultant cristero rebellion, tense relations between Mexico and
      the US and the restoration of diplomatic relations, the need for economic modernization and
      concerns over the control of natural resources. The inequalities of the hacienda system, the need
      for agrarian reform and the extent of illiteracy, which led to Vasconcelos’s education programme,
      may also be discussed.

Section 12        The Great Depression and the Americas (mid-1920s–1939)

23.   “The New Deal had a greater impact on the political system than on the economic system in the
      United States.” Discuss.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review as to the political and economic impact of
      the New Deal in the US. Immediate, short- and long-term effects may be addressed as candidates
      consider the suggested theory. Economic effects may include increased governmental
      intervention in the economy through programmes such as the Social Security Act (SSA),
      government competition with private enterprise through programmes such as the Tennessee
      Valley Authority (TVA), and programmes of questionable constitutionality, such as the National
      Recovery Administration (NRA) or the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA). Political
      effects may include the creation of a new Democratic Party coalition that would dominate the
      executive and judicial branches for several decades, the transition of African-Americans from the
      Republican to the Democratic Party and vast expansion of the power of the executive branch and
      the federal bureaucracy.



24.   To what extent did the Great Depression contribute to political instability in one country in Latin
      America?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that the Great Depression
      contributed to political instability by assessing the effect in one country of Latin America. While
      other contributing factors may also be considered, the question requires candidates to focus on the
      relationship of the Great Depression to political instability. Factors related to the Great Depression
      may include the discrediting of the export-import model of development, restrictions to international
      credit creating economic hardship and unrest, resultant opposition to capitalism leading to the
      growth of socialism and communism and the subsequent repression of dissent leading to
      authoritarian and/or populist regimes. Some candidates may argue that political instability in Latin
      America preceded the Great Depression or that, while democracy suffered, some of the emerging
      regimes could establish political stability.

Section 13        The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   Evaluate the effects of Franklin D Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor Policy in the Americas.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of the effects of President Franklin Roosevelt’s Good Neighbor
      policy by weighing up its strengths and limitations. They may consider the effects on the US as
      well as other countries in the Americas. Issues that may be assessed include the repudiation of
      the right of intervention in Latin American internal affairs, the withdrawal of US military forces from
      Nicaragua and Haiti, and the implementation of reciprocal tariff agreements to achieve lower rates.
      Some candidates may argue that the response of countries to ally with the US in the Second World
      War is evidence of the policy’s success, but it may also be argued that the war, rather than the
      policy, increased trade with the US and brought a new wave of economic intervention.



26.   Discuss the treatment of people of Japanese origin in two countries of the Americas during the
      Second World War.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the treatment of people of Japanese
      origin in any two countries of the Americas during the Second World War. Focus is limited to the
      time span of the war. Issues that may be discussed include the relocation of people of Japanese
      origin away from the coastal areas, usually to labour or internment camps. People of Japanese
      origin were subject to surveillance and racial prejudice supported by government propaganda
      despite little evidence they posed any threat. Homes, land and businesses were often confiscated
      and civil rights denied, and some countries banned Japanese texts and language. Candidates
      may point out that some countries of the region, such as Mexico, Argentina and Brazil did not
      engage in overtly hostile actions toward their populations of Japanese descent, in part due to
      dependence on their labour.

Section 14        Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   Compare and contrast the treatment of opposition by two Latin American populist leaders between
      1945 and 1980.

      Candidates will give an account of the similarities and differences regarding the treatment of
      opposition between two Latin American populist leaders during the given timeframe, referring to
      both leaders throughout. Candidates may also give consideration as to the leader’s level of
      success in limiting opposition. Popular choices will be Fidel Castro and Juan Peron but allow any
      other relevant example. Issues that may be included are the levels of restriction that were imposed
      on freedom of speech, censorship of the media, the treatment of other political parties, controls
      placed over trade unions, the use of violence and repression, treatment of various social classes
      (either for support or to repress opposition), response to external opposition, and the use of
      charisma or other opportunistic measures to gain and maintain support.



28.   Evaluate the economic and social policies of one military dictatorship between 1945 and 1980.

      Candidates will make an appraisal of one military dictatorship by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations of its economic and social policies during the given period. Popular examples will be
      Chile and Argentina but allow any other relevant case study. Economic issues that may be
      addressed include the extent of state economic intervention, policies imposed to control inflation
      (for example, through wage and price controls), programmes to promote the development of
      national industries (for example, through import substitution) and policies aimed to limit or promote
      exports and imports. Social issues to be evaluated may include control of trade unions, policies
      towards indigenous peoples, along with censorship and control of the media and educational
      institutions. Other social effects may include the social impact of economic policies such as
      increases in poverty along with forced emigrations and repression of human rights.

Section 15        Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   To what extent were the social programmes of Kennedy’s New Frontier successful?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the social programmes of
      President Kennedy’s New Frontier were successful. Achievements that may be developed include
      the expansion of unemployment benefits, and increases in the minimum wage, social security and
      housing benefits. A pilot food stamp programme and aid to public school lunch programmes were
      initiated. An executive order to ban discrimination in federal housing, prohibition of discrimination
      in federal hiring of minorities and support of the Interstate Commerce Commission’s (ICC) effort to
      integrate public transportation was implemented. Limitations that may be cited include the failure
      to obtain Congressional support for preservation of wilderness land. Congress also blocked civil
      rights legislation against race-based voting restrictions as well as legislation to extend federal
      health care assistance for the aged and the indigent.



30.   To what extent was the power of the provincial government in Quebec increased as a result of the
      Quiet Revolution?

      Candidates will consider the merits or otherwise of the concept that the power of the provincial
      government in Quebec was increased by the Quiet Revolution. Other factors may be developed,
      but focus on the impact of the Quiet Revolution is required. Candidates may argue that
      nationalizing electrical production and other public companies controlling Quebec’s natural
      resources increased provincial power. However, this may be countered by the argument that
      unionization of the civil service and the right to strike was restrictive. In education, secular school
      boards took control from the Catholic Church and compulsory education expanded state power but
      also led to greater public control over education policy. Creation of a public hospital system and
      health insurance eroded the influence of the Catholic Church. Quebec nationalism increased but
      candidates may argue that the rise of nationalist groups led to terrorism and the October Crisis of
      1970, thus challenging the state.

Section 16       The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Discuss the impact of the Korean War on two countries of the Americas.

      Candidates will offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the Korean War on any
      two countries of the Americas. This may be achieved through a comparison of the chosen
      countries, by selecting a thematic approach or discussion of the countries separately. Factors that
      may be addressed include the massive increase in armaments spending, the emphasis of US
      policy that was placed on stopping communist expansion in Asia and Europe (rather than the
      Americas), increased fears of thermonuclear war, an increased emphasis on collective security
      through both the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an increased
      US emphasis on the policy of containment, US receipt of troop assistance from Canada and
      Colombia, and an increased demand for Latin American commodities benefitting several Latin
      American economies.



32.   Discuss the reaction of either Canada or Latin America towards US involvement in the Vietnam
      War.

      Candidates will provide a considered and balanced review of the reaction of either Canada or Latin
      America to US involvement in the Vietnam War and may consider both governmental policy and
      public reaction. Latin America may be considered in respect to either one or more countries or the
      collective whole. Canada may be addressed in respect to its formal neutrality (though serving as a
      testing area for US munitions), economic benefits from production of war materials, and providing
      up to 30,000 volunteers for the US military while also allowing refuge to thousands of US draft-
      dodgers and deserters. Latin American issues may include nominal economic assistance to the
      Republic of South Vietnam, Cuba’s supply of engineers and doctors to North Vietnam, student
      protests against the war and a more critical assessment of US foreign policy.

Section 17        Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   “While the US national government attempted to advance civil rights for African Americans, state
      and local governments resisted change.” Discuss.

      Candidates will provide a considered and balanced review which assesses the suggestion that
      state and local governments resisted civil rights’ initiatives supported by the US federal
      government. Consideration may be given to how governments aided and interfered with the
      progress of civil rights. For the federal government, issues may include Truman’s orders to
      integrate the armed forces and federal employment opportunities, the actions of Eisenhower to
      enforce the Brown decision, Kennedy’s support for the “Freedom Riders”, and Johnson’s support
      for the passage of the Civil Rights Act (1964), the Voting Rights Act (1965) and the Fair Housing
      Act (1968). For state and local government, candidates may address attempts to filibuster and
      delay civil rights legislation, the use of court injunctions and police actions against protests, and the
      failure to investigate or prosecute violent assaults on civil rights leaders.



34.   To what extent did Cesar Chavez advance the civil rights of Hispanic Americans in the United
      States after 1945?

      Candidates will assess the impact of Cesar Chavez on Hispanic Americans after 1945 by
      considering the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that he advanced Hispanic American civil
      rights. The assessment will consider Chavez’s leadership within the labour movement in respect
      to both contributions and limitations. Issues that may be addressed include Chavez’s contribution
      toward the creation of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union which became aligned with the
      American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the use of boycotts,
      marches and hunger strikes to advance labour issues, and the 1966 march from Delano to
      Sacramento, which achieved the first worker’s contract with growers. Candidates may also argue
      that the gains were limited by hostile responses from growers and by conflicts with competing
      unions. While the UFW had over 50,000 members in the 1970s, membership declined to 15,000
      by the mid-1980s.

Section 18        The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   To what extent did Chrétien (1993–2003) resolve Canada’s domestic problems during his
      premiership?

      Candidates will consider the role of Chrétien in respect to Canada’s domestic problems during his
      premiership and consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that he was able to resolve
      domestic problems. Depending on evidence applied, candidates may assert that the resolution
      was minimal, absolute or somewhere between. Successes may include Chrétien’s “Red Book”
      that helped establish his liberal party as the “party of ideas”, success in reducing the deficit and
      cutting taxes, the creation of the Child Benefit Program to assist low income families and the
      “Clarity Act” that required a provincial referendum in support of separation prior to a national vote.
      Limitations may include cancellation of the contract to privatize the Pearson airport, his inability to
      renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US, cuts weakening
      Canada’s military and implication in several scandals involving favours to personal friends.



36.   Examine the reasons for, and the impact of, economic cooperation in the Americas between 1980
      and 2005.

      Candidates will consider the concept of economic cooperation among the countries of the
      Americas during the given period and assess both the reasons for the cooperation as well as its
      impact. Candidates may choose to single out a range of countries or may approach the question
      topically by discussion of specific initiatives. Issues advancing cooperation may include the end of
      the Cold War and the emergence of new trading blocks that encouraged economic cooperation,
      implementation of preferential trade agreements and the elimination of trade barriers, the success
      of bilateral trade concessions (which were generally more successful than transnational
      agreements), integration in the labour markets and the development of regional parliaments and
      the integration of labour markets. Candidates may argue that limited advancement took place due
      to few successes in negotiating labour legislation or sustainability initiatives. Also, there was little
      achievement in advancing the free movement of capital.
