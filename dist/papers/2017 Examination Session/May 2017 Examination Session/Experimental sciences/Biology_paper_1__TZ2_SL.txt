                  [Source: W. E. Huckabee (1958) The Journal of Clinical Investigation, 37 (2), page 257.]

      What do these curves suggest?

      A.   Before the exercise, there was no pyruvate produced because there was no cell respiration.

      B.   During the exercise, there was not enough oxygen available for cell respiration, so the
           process was partly anaerobic.

      C.   During the exercise, the level of lactate increased due to aerobic respiration.

      D.   After the exercise, the level of lactate decreased because there was enough pyruvate to be
           used for anaerobic cell respiration.
