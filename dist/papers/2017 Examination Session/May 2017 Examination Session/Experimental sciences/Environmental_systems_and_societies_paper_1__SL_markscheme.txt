1.   Tropical Rainforest
     Cerrado / savanna / tropical savanna
     Caatinga / thorny shrub
     Pantanal / (periodically) wet land
     Atlantic Rainforest / tropical semi-deciduous forest
     Pampas / grassland                                                                            [1 max]

     Accept any two responses from above.
     Award [1] for two correct responses and [0] for one correct response.
     Do not accept only “rainforest”.



2.   (a)   climate differences in insolation/rainfall/temperature has led to greater biodiversity in
           Atlantic Rainforest;
           more diverse/complex habitats in Atlantic Rainforest than Cerrado / Atlantic
           Rainforest has more niches / Atlantic Rainforest also includes coastal habitats;
           Atlantic Rainforest may have greater variation in elevation resulting in a wider range
           of habitats;
           greater loss of biodiversity in Cerrado due to deforestation/logging/agriculture
           expansion/cattle ranching expansion/slash and burn clearance/urban
           expansion/mining activity/hunting/human impact;
           habitats in Cerrado less resilient to external factors eg climate change/pollution;
           habitats in Atlantic Rainforest may have been surveyed more fully than habitats in
           the Cerrado;                                                                              [2 max]

           Response must be clear which site has higher/lower biodiversity or where there is
           greater biodiversity loss to be credited. Response must state specific location.
           Do not accept the difference in biodiversity is due to the Atlantic Rainforest being
           further along the process of succession/near the coast/contains many rivers.



     (b)   high number of endemic/unique species;
           high number of species / species richness / high biodiversity / major portion of
           World’s biodiversity;
           under high threat from human activity/logging/over-hunting/habitat destruction;
           these regions contain multiple ecosystems;
           regions provide economic benefits/natural capital (eg tourism/education/food);
           regions provide ecological services (eg as a carbon sink/flood control/production
           of oxygen);
           these regions have intrinsic value/existence value;                                     [2 max]

           Do not accept “ethical reasons” as this is too vague.
           Do not accept “aesthetic value” without reference to its use eg tourism/recreation.
           Do not accept only “these areas contain species that are classified as
           endangered/threatened / cover a large area”.
                                                    –4–                  M17/4/ENVSO/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   reduction in population size;
     population size / numbers of mature individuals / number of individuals able to reproduce;
     geographical range / area of occupancy (ie where species are normally found) / extent of
     occurrence (boundary line that can be drawn around sites that the species occupies);
     reduction in number of locations (the species is found in);
     degree of fragmentation (eg via road or urban development);
     quality of habitat / loss of habitat / habitat degradation;
     probability/high risk of extinction;                                                       [2 max]

     Do not accept “availability of food/water/shelter”.
     Do not accept “deforestation/hunting/low reproductive potential/habitat threatened” unless
     a link is made to the IUCN factors, as listed above.



4.   an ideal flagship species (has a wide appeal to the public);
     conserving this species will (result in habitat protection that will) also protect other
     species;

     eg Golden tamarin:
     potential attraction for eco-tourism;
     as a primate it is closely related to humans/easy for humans to empathize with;
     it has a human-like face / it is cute/cuddly/aesthetically attractive;
     not found anywhere else / unique to Brazil (unlike other three species);
     highly suitable for publicity/fund raising (eg posters/soft toys);

     eg Brazilian merganser:
     is critically endangered (most under threat and therefore needs conservation measures more
     quickly than the other organisms);
     may attract many tourists/bird watchers/ornithologists;
     appearance may be considered aesthetically attractive;

     eg Broad-snouted caiman:
     potential attraction for eco-tourism;
     it is a predator and its loss could negatively impact other/keystone species;

     eg Giant metallic ceiba borer:
     may be a keystone species / its loss could impact on other species;
     IUCN Red List status has not been assessed and therefore we should be cautious and
     ensure that it is not lost;
     it is shiny which could be considered aesthetically attractive;                              [2 max]

     Award [0] if any plant species is used, or if an animal not listed above is used as an example.
     Accept any reasonable responses.

                                 (14.46 − 6.58)
5.   (a)   (natural increase =                  ) = 0.788% / 0.79% / 0.8% ;
                                       10
           7.88 per thousand;                                                                    [1 max]

           Correct units (% or per thousand) are required to be credited the mark.



     (b)   migration/emigration;                                                                     [1]



6.   initially the population will continue to grow rapidly;
     …because there are still a significant number entering child-bearing age;
     however, because the base of pyramid is decreasing/there are fewer children;
     …this suggests fewer will be entering fertile bracket in future;
     …lower birth rate;
     …which will lead to slower growth rate;
     …fertility rates may fall below replacement levels / reduction in fertility rates;
     increasing proportion of higher age / in future an aging population (over 65 years old);
     …the average age of the population will increase / higher median age of population;
     …will lead to a larger senior dependency ratio;
     a greater number of people in working age group (16–65 years old);
     …compared to children (0–16 years old) will improve dependency ratio;
     Brazil is at stage 3 and is moving to stage 4;
     …will lead to a more stable population / equal proportion in each age group / birth rates
     are equal to death rates;                                                                   [3 max]

     Accept any other reasonable suggestions.

7.   deforestation / habitat fragmentation / loss of terrestrial habitat / loss of habitat due to
     flooding / increase in aquatic habitat;
     change from a lotic/moving/river water ecosystems to a lentic/still/lake aquatic
     ecosystem;
     loss of species/biodiversity;
     change in habitat may favour different/invasive species;
     interference of natural flow of water/hydrological cycle /change of flow downstream
     which affects downstream species/communities/environment;
     loss of flow of sediments downstream affecting river/coastal erosion / makes
     downstream/coast more prone to soil erosion;
     loss of homes/displacement of communities when land is flooded;
     homes/communities/land downstream can be protected from flooding;
     loss of fish species due to interference with fish migratory route;
     stabilize local temperatures and increase precipitation/rainfall;
     reduction in use of fossil fuel (to generate electricity) resulting in reduction of GHG
     emissions / less dependency on non-renewable energy sources;
     water from dam may cause seismic movement/earthquakes;
     loss of carbon sink (as a result of deforestation) / potential release of
     methane/carbon dioxide (from decomposition of organic matter/trees within lake);               [2 max]

     Accept any other reasonable suggestions.
     Do not credit only “habitat loss” without reference to the cause (eg flooding / land
     clearance) or type of habitat lost (eg terrestrial/land/wetland/aquatic).
     Do not credit “some loss of river system” without reference to loss of
     habitat/ecosystem/biodiversity.
     Do not credit only “reduction of air pollution/pollution/emissions from combustion of
     fossil fuels / pollution from dam construction / impact on ecosystems”.



8.   (from figure 7(b) GDP increase of approximately 260 % (range 250–275 %) over 22 years,
                                          260%
     therefore average annual increase =         )
                                            22
     = 11.8 %;                                                                                          [1]

     Accept increase of GDP between 11–13 % annual.
     Correct units (%) are required to be credited the mark.
                                                   –7–                 M17/4/ENVSO/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.   (a)   the amount of grain production has significantly increased over time / the amount of
           grain produced has increased almost 4-fold / from about 50 million tonnes to about
           200 million tonnes over 24 years;
           whereas the amount of land used to grow grain has only increased slightly/from
           about 30 million hectares to about 50 million hectares;
           the increase in land used is not proportional to the increase in grain production /
           grain production is independent to harvested area / there is no relationship between
           grain production and land harvested / grain production has increased more rapidly
           than harvested area;
           there is a (slight/small) positive relationship/correlation between the amount of land
           used and amount of grain produced / crop production increases (to some extent)
           with the amount of land used;                                                          [2 max]

           If quantification is used the units should be correct, ie either in thousand
           thousand/million hectares/tonnes.



     (b)   intensification of farming methods/technological improvements that does not
           increase amount of land used to grow more crops / more efficient land use leads to
           increase in crop production;
           increase in use of fertilizers to increase crop production;
           increase in irrigation to increase crop production;
           use of pesticides to reduce crop losses to pests or reduce competition;
           growing pest resistant plants resulting in higher yields;
           use of crop varieties (genetically modified organisms GMOs) that produce high
           yields / high yielding varieties HYV;
           use of crops that grow more quickly allowing multiple harvests;
           increase in mechanization allowing greater speed of planting/harvesting crops
           reducing crop losses;
           increase in number of times crops are planted in a year;                              [2 max]

           Do not accept “more land available, the more grain can be produced” as it does
           not address the large increase in crop production.
           Method must relate to increase in crop production.
           Accept any other reasonable suggestions.

10.   (a)   biofuel crops can be used to absorb carbon dioxide;
            biofuels produce less greenhouse gases (when burnt) compared to fossil
            fuels/oil/petrol/gas;
            use of biofuels is carbon neutral / carbon dioxide released during combustion is
            equal to the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed during plant growth (stage of biofuel
            production);
            due to efficiency of biofuel production, further land clearance is not required,
            potentially protecting carbon sinks/forests;
            production of biofuels may release less emissions than extraction and production of
            fossil fuels;
            use of biofuels can reduce/replace use of fossil fuel (a non-renewable resource) /
            biofuels can replace use of fossil fuels in vehicles;
            it can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere from storage;     [4 max]



      (b)   producing biofuels can conflict with production of sufficient food supply (for growing
            population) / reduce land used for food production / can reduce food
            production/availability of food;
            …leading to more food being imported / this can elevate cost of food, (particularly
            impacting on the poor) / cause food shortages / it could lead to famine;
            production of biofuels can use limited resources eg water for irrigation;
            …this can result in water shortages/insufficient water for other uses;
            adoption of intensification of farming practices can lead to greater use of fertilizers
            and pesticide;
            …this can result in greater pollution of the environment eg nutrient run-off can cause
            eutrophication / use of pesticides can cause death of non-target species;
            increasing amounts of land are required for growing biofuel crops;
            …this can result in loss of habitats for native species/loss of biodiversity/land
            clearance can lead to soil degradation;
            biofuels can be expensive;
            …therefore less likely to be used;
            growing crops for biofuels usually involves monocultures that reduces diversity;
            …monoculture system is less resilient / high risk of crop failure;                      [2 max]

            Only one limitation should be credited.
            For [2] the limitation and its impact must be explained.
            Do not accept that burning biofuels still releases carbon dioxide as net increase
            compared to use of fossil fuel is still reduced.
            Accept any other reasonable suggestions.

11.   ecological footprint increasing over period suggests they are moving toward
      unsustainability;
      biocapacity decreasing over period suggests they are moving toward unsustainability /
      Brazil is living unsustainably (using resources at a rate that is not replenishable) resulting
      in a decline in the biocapacity / if the line for biocapacity and ecological footprint
      meet/crossover it suggests unsustainability;
      rate of decrease in biocapacity is falling/stabilizing toward end of period suggests they
      may remain/be moving towards being sustainable;
      the Brazilian population/government will need to reduce their ecological footprint to
      sustain biocapacity;
      ecological footprint being lower than biocapacity suggests population is sustainable;            [2 max]

      Do not accept only “current ecological footprint is unsustainable”.
      Do not accept “steady ecological footprint is sustainable”, as a stable ecological
      footprint is not necessarily a sign of sustainability.
      To be credited the mark the response must link to sustainability.

12.   Evidence [4 max]:
      the population is stabilizing which will benefit the environment;
      they are employing mitigation strategies that will address issue of global warming /
      climatic change;
      they are improving efficiency of food production limiting area of environment impacted /
      small increase in amount of arable/agricultural land;
      a high proportion of renewable energy/biofuel/hydropower is used that could reduce
      emissions of GHGs/global warming;
      a high proportion of renewable energy/biofuel/hydropower is used that could reduce
      use of fossil fuels/non-renewable resources/non-renewable natural capital / rapid
      increase in number of cars using flex fuel / reducing number of petrol/gasoline cars;
      Brazil has adopted energy efficiency methods/policies;
      compared to other countries, Brazil still has a relatively low proportion of
      developed/arable land;
      NGOs and other organizations are supporting conservation projects (restoring
      habitats / encouraging sustainable use of forest resources) in the Atlantic Rainforest;
      Brazil has maintained a relatively low/stable ecological footprint (despite increase in
      GDP);

      Limitations [4 max]:
      population is not yet stabilized so demands on environment still increasing/urban growth
      continues;
      there are still a significant number of threatened species / high biodiversity loss;
      there is still land clearance/deforestation for sugar cane/coffee/soy
      bean/biofuels/commercial logging/urban growth/urban development/infrastructure
      development/mining;
      the conversion of agricultural land to growing crops for biofuels is causing problems with
      sufficient production/availability of food;
      pollution from mining/manufacture of goods/oil production/commercial agriculture;
      high proportion of renewable energy still comes from hydropower that impacts
      environment;
      energy consumption continues to increase;
      decrease in biocapacity suggests unsustainable practices / degradation of natural resources
      / depletion rates are greater than rates of growth / increase in ecological footprint suggest
      greater use of resources/unsustainability;
      Brazil has large number of cattle that leads to high production of methane;
      there are still gasoline only cars in use / there has been a reduction in/there are no ethanol
      only vehicles;

Opinion/conclusion [1 max]:
there are clear indications in a number of areas that Brazilians are currently taking global
warming very seriously / valuing environment over development;
despite the results of this survey, there are clear indications that Brazilians are not taking
global warming seriously / there is clear evidence that Brazilians are not valuing the
environment over development;
                                                                                                 [6 max]

Award [5 max] if there is no opinion/conclusion.
Accept other reasonable responses supported by information in the resource booklet.
An isolated statement/opinion eg “Brazil is concerned about the environment” should not be
considered a valid opinion/conclusion without supporting evidence.
