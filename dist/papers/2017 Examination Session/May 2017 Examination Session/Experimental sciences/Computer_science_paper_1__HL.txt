                                                Section B

Answer all questions.

12.   A large company has taken over another business. This takeover has required various
      changes to be made. One of the changes requires data migration.

      (a)   (i)   Define the term data migration.                                                          [1]

		(ii)            Describe two problems, concerning data migration, which the company may have
                  to overcome.                                                                             [4]

      (b)   Other than data migration, describe two aspects of change management that may arise
            from this takeover.                                                                            [4]

      The company produces industrial chemicals. One of the chemical processes is represented
      by the following logic diagram.


      A
                                                    OR
                                                                          X

                      B                                                                AND             C

                                                                          Y
                                                  NAND


      (c)   (i)   Construct the truth table corresponding to this diagram.                                 [3]

		(ii)            Identify the single logic gate that is equivalent to this diagram.                       [1]

      (d)   Outline how truth tables can be used to test that any two logic diagrams are equivalent.       [2]




                                                                                               Turn over
                                                      –4–                     M17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

13.   (a)   By copying the table below, trace the following algorithm using the data in the
            collection DATA. Note: B and C are also collections and are initially empty.

		 DATA = {2,4,-1,3}
		 loop while DATA.hasNext()
			 A = DATA.getNext()
			 if A >= 0 then
				 if A mod 2 = 0 then
					B.addItem(A)
				else
					C.addItem(A)
				end if
			  end if
		end loop

                                                                              Contents      Contents
            DATA.hasNext() ?          A    A >= 0?       A mod 2 = 0?
                                                                                of B          of C




                                                                                                                [3]

      (b)   Outline the steps involved in performing a binary search on an array of ascending
            numbers. Note: you can assume that the search value is present in the array and that
            initially LOW is the index of the first value in the array and HI is the index of the last value.   [4]

      (c)   A collection called NUMBERS is to be searched to see if it contains a specified value.  
            Construct an algorithm in pseudocode to perform the following:
            yyinput the number, S, to be searched for
            yyread in the values from the NUMBERS collection into the array D. Note: you can
               assume that the array is large enough and that the collection is not empty
            yyperform a linear search for S on the array D
            yyoutput the message “found ” or “not found ” as appropriate.                                       [5]

      A binary search can be performed on the array D, if the values in D are in ascending order.
      As the values are being read from NUMBERS into D they are checked to see if they are in order.

      (d)   Without writing pseudocode, suggest how this check could be performed.                              [3]

14.   A laptop computer supplements its primary memory by making use of virtual memory.

      (a)   Outline the use of paging in relation to virtual memory.                                    [2]

      The laptop has 1GB of random access memory (RAM) and a single processor.
      The laptop is using one of the latest operating systems to run multimedia gaming programs.

      (b)   Explain the limitations and consequences of using the laptop for this purpose.              [3]

      One of the laptop’s game applications stores the data relating to the different actions of one
      of its characters in a stack.

      (c)   Suggest one reason why the character’s actions might be stored in a stack.                  [2]

      At specific moments during the game this data is read from the stack (S) into a queue (Q).

      (d)   Using appropriate access methods for stacks and queues, construct an algorithm that
            reads the data from the stack and enters it into the queue. You should assume that the
            queue structure exists and that both structures are of a fixed size.                        [6]

      (e)   Outline one advantage of making the queue dynamic.                                          [2]


15.   The collection WEATHER contains the temperatures that have been measured for one city
      over the course of one week, starting on Monday and ending on Sunday. Each day,
      24 readings were taken, one each hour, the first being at 00:00, the second at 01:00 and so
      on. The data is stored in chronological order with the data for Monday stored in the collection
      first, followed by Tuesday and so on.

      (a)   State the total number of readings that were taken during this week.                        [1]

      (b)   Construct the algorithm to read this data into a 2D array, A, that would allow the
            temperature on a specific day at a specific time to be accessed directly.                   [4]

      (c)   Construct the algorithm that will output the day, as a word (for example Tuesday), on
            which the highest temperature was recorded.                                                 [6]

      The process described at the start of question 15 is extended so that each week the value
      and date of the highest temperature recorded that week are stored chronologically in a
      collection, HIGHEST.

      At any point in time, the data from the HIGHEST collection can be read into a suitable
      data structure that will allow the details of the highest temperatures recorded to be
      output in descending order.  The structure is chosen in order to minimize processing.

      (d)   Explain how a suitable data structure can be constructed and used for this purpose.         [4]




                                                                                                 Turn over
                                                    –6–                M17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

16.   An embedded system is used to control the speed of an electric motor.

      (a)   With reference to the example, above, define an embedded system.                         [2]

      The diagram shows the main components in a typical negative feedback system.

             Input                                                                       Output
                                       Controller                  Process




                                                    Feedback



      The control system for the electric motor consists of a negative feedback loop.

      (b)   Outline the desired outcome of any feedback system.                                      [2]

      (c)   List the steps involved in the feedback system for the electric motor. You should make
            use of the appropriate technical terms of the control system process.                    [6]

      A more complex control system is used to monitor and control the functioning of a
      power station. This includes a dedicated operating system with sensors and output
      transducers (actuators) placed at various places around the power station.

      (d)   Explain the interaction between the components identified above, if interrupts are
            generated by the sensors.                                                                [5]
