Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer the
questions.

Search GPS from Rip Curl, is a GPS watch for surfing that communicates with an app* for analysing
performance and sharing experiences with fellow surfers. The watch, see Figure 10 below, comes in a
variety of colours and is worn during surfing.  It records data such as the number of waves surfed, the
surfer’s location and the time in the water.

As this is the first smart sports watch developed specifically for surfers, the designers have involved
members of the surfing community in the development of the product.  All functions of the watch are
controlled via three large buttons.

* app: application software, typically small, specialized programs downloaded onto
mobile devices; apps can also run on the internet, on a computer, or on a cell/mobile
phone or other electronic device
