             b. hemoglobin is split into heme group and globins 
                                                                                                                     3 max
             c. globins hydrolyzed to peptides/amino acids 

             d. heme group separated into iron and bilirubin 



22.          a. receptors are proteins 

                steroid hormones: [3 max]
             b. steroid hormones cross plasma membrane 
             c. bind to receptor «proteins» in the cytoplasm of the target cell 
             d. to form a receptor–hormone complex 
             e. «the receptor–hormone complex» promotes the transcription of specific genes                         6 max

                peptide hormones: [3 max]
             f. peptide hormones bind to receptors in the plasma membrane of the target cell 
             g. binding of hormones to «membrane» receptors activates a cascade of reactions 
             h. mediated by a second messenger inside the cell 
             i. such as cAmp or Ca2+ calmodulin 
