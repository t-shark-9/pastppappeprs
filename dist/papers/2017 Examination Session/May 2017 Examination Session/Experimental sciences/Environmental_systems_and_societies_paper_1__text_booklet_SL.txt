� Brazil is the largest country in South America, covering an area of over 8.5 million square kilometers.
� The country contains an exceptionally high number of species, many of which are endemic.
� Estimates of species numbers vary from 1.4 to 2.4 million, of which only a small fraction has
  been identified.
� Regions of high biodiversity include the Atlantic Rainforest (also known as the Mata Atlântica)
  and Cerrado (Savanna).
� The Atlantic Rainforest originally covered about 15 % of Brazil mainly along the Brazilian coast as well
  as extending into neighbouring countries of Paraguay and Argentina. The region comprises of various
  ecosystems including tropical and subtropical forests.
� The Cerrado region covers about 20 % of the land area in central Brazil and extends into the
  neighbouring countries of Paraguay and Bolivia. It comprises a range of ecosystems including
  grasslands, savanna regions and forests.

There have been a number of processes at work in Brazil that have caused significant losses in
biodiversity. Of the original Atlantic Rainforest only about 10 % remains, and of the original Cerrado
vegetation only around 20 % remains. These losses have occurred as a result of:
� Land clearance for crop production eg sugar cane, coffee, soy beans and biofuel crops. The amount
   of food and biofuel crops grown has increased significantly over the past 20 years.
� Land clearance for cattle ranching. Brazil has the largest number of cattle of any country in the world.
� Land clearance for forest plantations eg pine and eucalypt plantations
� Expansion and development of urban areas eg:
   – Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo in the Atlantic Rainforest region.
   – Brasilia the capital city in the Cerrado region.
� Infrastructure development eg road building schemes to support industrialization.
� Commercial logging.

Various businesses, non-governmental and governmental organizations actively support projects within
the Atlantic Rainforest that:
� Restore forest habitats.
� Encourage sustainable use of natural forest resources.

                Figure 7(a): Fact file on energy and economic development in Brazil

� Brazil has experienced fast economic growth and is one of the most influential nations in
  South America.
� Major industries include mining, agriculture and the manufacture of products ranging from motor
  vehicles and aircraft to computers.
� There has been significant growth in the service industries including the telecommunications, banking,
  commerce and computing sectors.
� Over 80 % of Brazil’s gross domestic product (GDP) is generated in the Atlantic Rainforest region.
� Brazil is a major producer of oil. However about 70 % of its electricity comes from hydroelectric power
  (HEP).
� Brazil is also the largest global producer of bioethanol, a biofuel produced from plants such as sugar
  cane. Over 40 % of petrol (gasoline) use has been replaced by bioethanol.
� Brazil’s energy policy has involved:
  – improving energy efficiency.
  – increasing energy production from renewable sources.
  – diversification of energy sources.
