General marking instructions

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check (✓) must be placed in the text at the precise point where it becomes
     clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases use
     RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
     helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional comments. It should
     be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part question,
     enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to a part question is
     worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question, enter an “NR” in the mark
     panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you stamp
     “SEEN” on any page that contains no other annotation.

8.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this
     effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Mark allocation

Section A:   Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B:   Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
             Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the following
points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that in the
   markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
   rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips. In this
   subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent parts. If
   an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used
   correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue              Guidance
  Answering     • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than       maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of responses    eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  prescribed in   descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  the questions • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations eg
                  “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
                  This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                  explanation etc.

     It is used to hold common/expected/frequently used data/operations;
     Closer to CPU than RAM/situated between RAM and CPU/on same board as CPU/ with faster
     read/write speed;
     Cache memory is static RAM and this memory doesn't need to be constantly refreshed;   [2]


5.   The OS allocates (and deallocates) specific sections of memory to each
     program/process/module;
     This ensures that the memory assigned to one program is not overwritten;
     Uses secondary/virtual memory to allow more processes to run simultaneously;
      (Note: Do not accept vague reasons).                                                      [2]

7.   Some compression methods (lossy) discard data;
     Decompression will not return the complete file/some detail will have been removed;
     Which in some cases e.g. audio/video may be unacceptable;
     If original not saved/lost there is no way to recover it;                                  [3]

      And placed in its correct position in the new list deleting original OR in the same list by swapping
      with the element that was there;
      This is repeated for all elements;                                                                 [3]

      Note: The sorted list may be constructed by swapping positions in the origin list or by
      putting in the element in the correct position in a separate list and deleting from the
      unsorted list.

      and [1] for developing that difference, up to [2 max].

              2.  If ARRAY[MID] is the search value, end, else

              Example answer 2:
                     Find/calculate the midpoint/median value between HI and LOW;
              If the array value at midpoint equals the search value; then the search value
              is found;
              If search value is greater than the array value at midpoint, set the midpoint as a new LOW
              and repeat the process - if search value is less than the array value at midpoint, set midpoint
              as a new HI;

      flag
      [1] mark for correct input of S and output message

      (b)          Award marks as follows:
                   [2] marks for a clear understanding of protocols and packet switching
                   [2] marks for explaining the importance of protocols in construction of packets/standard
                   packet format with examples of information included in each packet
                   [2] marks for a discussion of the role of protocols in the routing of packets to their
                   destination

                   For example:
                   Packet switching involves splitting data into packets to transmit to a specific
                   destination;
                   Protocols are rules/standards used to compile and transmit each packet in a standard
                   format;

                   Essential that all packets are constructed exactly the same;
                   So that the receiver knows automatically how to decode the contents/does not need
                   further instructions for decoding the packets;
                   Error checking methods included to verify that data arrives in same state as it was
                   sent;

                   Protocols include destination information that means that at each node the packet
                   passes through it is sent to the next node towards the correct destination;
                   Packet number essential to be included for reassembling at the other end as not all
                   packets will arrive in order;                                                       [6]

                   Note: Construction and transmission will not necessarily be separated but it should
                   be clear that protocols are used to construct packets for successful transmission.
                   Accept valid alternatives.
