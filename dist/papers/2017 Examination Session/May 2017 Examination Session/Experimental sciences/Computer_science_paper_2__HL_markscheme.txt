General marking instructions

1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-
      hand side of the screen.

3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark
      awarded.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases use RM™ Assessor annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write
      comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these
      additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.    Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
      question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to
      a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
      enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.    Please ensure you check all scanned pages. The candidate may have answered more than one
      option.

8.    If a candidate has attempted more than one Option within a paper, mark all the candidate’s
      work. RM™ Assessor will only award the marks for the higher scoring Option. Once all the work
      the candidate has attempted has been marked, please click “COMPLETE”; all the other questions
      from the other Options will auto complete to “NR” for “no response”.

9.    Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
      stamp “SEEN” on any page that contains no other annotation.

10.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
      this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

 Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

 An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

 Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

 If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

 Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

 Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

 Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering         In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity      In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed        In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

Option A — Databases

1.   (a)   Award up to [2 max].
           Note: Reasons must be primarily focused on data, on processing (querying), on
           communications or system design, not on storage.

           DBMS allows organisation of data / parents’ details in a way that supports
           efficient and secure access (to parents) / (hence) chances of data loss are
           relatively low;
           Enables specific operations/processing/querying of data (search/sort/analyse);
           Permits the production/printing of reports on searched information in specific
           formats;
           Supports the modular extension of system by adding new fields without need of
           redesigning the system;
           Supports the possibility of re-using the resources/tools/scheme for comparable
           activities (e.g. when the school open a secondary campus);
           Relies on widespread use of standards that ensures a smooth integration of
           systems / so that the school does not struggle with the upgrades of technology;
           Automatically supports the data validation/data verification when filling the
           database;


           Award [1 max] if the response only makes a direct comparison with a
           spreadsheet.
           Provides the ability to store a greater number of records than a spreadsheet;
           Provides more ability to customise the nature of the information output in records
           compared to a spreadsheet;
           Provides the ability to manipulate the data better than in a spreadsheet,
           especially on screen;
           It supports the operation of data mining, something that would not be possible in
           a spreadsheet;                                                                       [2]


     (b)   Award up to [1 max].
           Name (eg Chris Smith) / Address / Phone number;
           Note: Any item of data that can plausibly be stored in a school database
           and referring to the parents is acceptable.                                          [1]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           Award [1] for identifying the technique to reduce data input errors and [1] for a
           development/elaboration.

           Data validation;
           Checks that the input is well-formed/appropriately composed/suitable so to be
           valid for the program specification;
           For example, checking that a phone number that is input contains only numbers
           and asking to re-input it, should it contain other (non-valid) characters / type
           check (num or char) / range check (months with 30 or 31 days) / length check
           (prefixed length of some values);

           Data verification;
           Is the process that checks the accuracy of the data in the database/ checks that
           the software is correct given the specification / checks the integrity of the
           database in comparison to the data provided in input / checks in the database the
           presence of the record associated to the input;
                                                                                                [2]

(d)   Award up to [5 max].
      Note: The question asks for interactions between parent and DBMS while
      processing a payment: this should remain the focus during marking.

      Example 1:
      Award [3 max] if non-specific language is used
      Award [1] for each description

      Notification sent to parent:
      DBMS used to retrieve parent’s detail to enable mailing system to send out invoice;

      Authentication / Validation:
      Parents log in to DBMS with their credentials for authentication / validation of
      credentials by DBMS (the DBMS checks that data input are well-formed /
      appropriate);

      Verification:
      Data verification /The DBMS verifies that the parent’s details are stored, as this
      could be a new parent who was provided details to log in, but the DBMS has not
      been updated. NOTE accept any message on screen of the kind “contact the
      school manager”, if verification fails);

      Restricted Access granted:
      (Upon success of data verification) the DBMS provides access to reserved portion
      of data in database where parent can perform the operations (e.g. search the
      activity/period of time) / DBMS ensures access to the part of the Database storing
      child’s activities for payment;

      Preparation of payment:
      Parent provides detail that enable submitting a payment / system requires data
      from parent (new and from DB) to proceed with payment / system triggers the
      processing of payment using different part of the system, the DBMS, and data
      provided by parents about bank account;

      System update:
      DBMS is used to update accounting record system AND to produce the receipt
      to parents. Note: the second part of the sentence is needed to address the
      interaction) / DBMS is used to update accounting record system IF/WHEN the
      parent performs a top-up of their balance;

      Confirmation by email:
      (Credentials of) open session on DBMS are passed to mailing system to send out
      email to parents with notification of payment/receipt;

      Log-out /Close session/Time-out closure:
      Parent closes session on DBMS with the effect of closing access to dedicated
      portion of database (in search and/or reading) / if parent does not log out, DBMS
      automatically closes access after time-out;
                                            –8–                M17/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Example 2:

      Note: Example of answer worth [1] mark.
      It identifies the working of the payment system and it allows to detect some form
      of interaction.

      ●    Parent authenticated by the DBMS
      ●    Transaction is initiated
      ●    Payment details added / entered
      ●    If payment details and payment can be processed by DBMS then
            ○    transaction is completed by DBMS
            ○    Account is credited
            ○    Automatic e-mail notification of payment sent to parent
            Else
            ○    Transaction is rolled back
            ○    Notification of the failed transaction sent to the parent                 [5]

(e)   Award up to [3 max].
      Note: One of the marks should address the fact that the workspace is partitioned,
      so if this is not addressed, [2 max].

      Multiuser/concurrent access in reading/searching/querying of database;
      But records in database are partitioned, to ensure privacy in access / each parent
      can access only the part of the database relative to his family data / Database
      has a row-locking mechanism, so that access is restricted to individuals only in
      permitted areas / there is no conflict/competition in accessing the same area of
      database;
      (This/The partition/the row locking/the partial access) ensures isolation /
      separation of data (to present to transaction processing);
      Therefore, multiple transactions (from different parents) may safely occur
      simultaneously on non-overlapping portions of the database during payment;
      And this simplifies the management of system updates/recovery of (separated)
      transactions;
                                                                                           [3]

2.   (a)   Award up to [1 max].
           Collections of database tables that are linked via the fields / attributes / keys;
           A database structured in a way so that the data can be recognised / accessed /
           retrieved by using relations;                                                         [1]

     (b)   Award up to [4 max].
           Do not credit a description of what can be seen in an ERD, the command term is
           “explain”.

           The role of an ERD is to provide a compact view/graphical representation of
           entities/sets/actions/attributes/cardinality of entities/relations among entities;
           (So) it facilitates the planning/extension of a database because it provides a
           unique (and common) abstract representation of features independently from the
           actual implementation/nature of the database;
           (So) it informs the construction of the system at the logical level/represents the
           logical structure of the information system/DB;
           Enabling a structured and systematic development that can be better undertaken
           either by individuals or by teams of developers;
           And it informs over time how to model the data (in terms of its logical
           organisation) such as effect of system upgrades/ new formats needed to extend
           the old one);                                                                         [4]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           Award [1 max] for identifying an issue (I) and [1 max] for an expansion/example
           (consequence – C).

           NOTE: There must be reference to the given scenario. The wording also
           suggests also the “use” of the tables as they are (i.e. with no
           deletions/additions/updates).

           Award [1 max] for correct descriptions that lack reference to the given scenario,
           but still remain within the scope of “use”.

           Answers may include:

           I: Referential integrity is violated in TABLE_2 by the lowermost record, because
              there is no entry in TABLE_1 referring to Student_ID= 21;
           C: Therefore, any query built on a JOIN of the two tables, and referring to this
               value of Student_ID, cannot be answered;

           I: We want to use both tables to retrieve the email address in of the student
              whose ID is 21 in TABLE_2;
           C: But we cannot possibly do this, and the query cannot be answered, because
              the table will not be complete/will not be inhabited by the needed values,
              because referential integrity is broken on the value 12 of Student_ID in TABLE_2

           I: We want to use both tables to retrieve the email addresses of whomever is
              involved with the chess club;
           C: But we cannot possibly do this, and the query cannot be answered, because
              the table will not be complete/will not be inhabited by the needed values,
              because referential integrity is broken on the value 12 of Student_ID in
              TABLE_2
                                                                                                 [2]

(d)   (i)   Award up to [2 max].
            Award [1 max] for identifying an issue that could occur after the deletion
            and [1 max] for an expansion,
            Note: Do not credit generic or non-specific responses or the use of
            referential integrity with no development (i.e. just being mentioned).

            Example 1:
            We may not be able to find the email address of the Captain of the chess
            club;
            Because the deletion of the whole record in TABLE_1 does not allow us to
            search in TABLE_2 with the value Student_ID=12;

            Example 2:
            We lose the value 12 of the primary key in TABLE_1 (losing entity integrity);
            Therefore, a later successive insertion of a new record with primary key 12
            in TABLE_1 may link with that value for the foreign key in TABLE_2, yet the
            meaning of the relation might be compromised;

            Example 3:
            We lose the value 12 of the primary key in TABLE_1 (losing entity integrity);
            Therefore, the DBMS needs to have a method to decide what to do with the
            value 12 that appears in the foreign-key in TABLE_2;
                                                                                            [2]

           (ii)   Award up to [3 max].

                  Award [2 max] for evidence of understanding referential integrity.
                  Award [1] for an example, clearly referring to the primary and foreign keys
                  OR an expansion on how to limit the unwanted effects;
                  Do not credit the term referential integrity being used with no development
                  (i.e. just being mentioned).
                  NOTE: Be aware of possible repetitions with marks awarded in 2c(i).

                  Understanding:
                  Data (in the relational database) should satisfy the property of referential
                  integrity;

                  Which requires that each value of any field in some relation/table exists
                  also as value in some field of another relation/table
                  OR
                  That requires that the values of the foreign key in one table, completely
                  relates to all values of the primary key of another table;

                  Examples:
                  Student_ID is a primary key in TABLE_1 and foreign key in TABLE_2 and
                  deleting a value in the primary key will have an effect on the foreign key;

                  The system must have procedure to restrict the effects of the violation, e.g.
                  by setting the affected values in the foreign key to a default value “null” (so
                  Student_ID in TABLE_2 will get value “null”);
                  OR
                  by cascading (deleting) in all referencing foreign keys;
                  OR
                  by checking in advance whether a violation of referential integrity may
                  happen and not allow the deletion at the start;
                  OR
                  by recommending completion with null values and do normalisation, to reduce
                  incurring into violation of the property;                                         [3]

                  Note: The question explicitly asks to focus on the data structure as
                  displayed

                  Example 1:
                  The proposed data structure/sequence/list used to store SMS messages
                  has no determinate length/has unbounded length;
                  Therefore, we would have a table with an undefined number of columns
                  (and only the first two values are fixed in size for all subscribers);

                  Example 2:
                  The values in the two data structures show some repetitions /
                  redundancy (Note: do not accept duplication of data);
                  Not addressing this in an implementation of a sequence/list may eventually
                  generate tables that are bigger than necessary;
                                                                                                    [2]

      Award [1] for the identification an ethical issue, and up to [2 max] for
      discussion/elaboration.

      NOTE: The focus (conclusion) is usually on the trade-off between the rights of
      the individual to privacy/anonymity vs the needs for society to security / the
      greater good).

      Example:
      Personal information may be used by third party without the person knowing,
      therefore violating their privacy / anonymity;
      However, this violation may be justified by security reasons, for example national
      security / personal safety / monitoring of threats or hate speech;
      For example, from SMS one may extract information about locations/habits
      (gambling)/sensitive information (banks communications);

      This enables third parties to:
          build up a profile of the individual through data aggregation (e.g
             the individual is a game-addict, but they didn’t want to make this public);

            use for fraudulent actions over time (monitoring how often the bank
             transactions happen through a credit card, and generate
             hoax/impersonations/ further sell these data);

            use this data for marketing purposes (e.g. spamming messages);

            identify the location where an individual is, at particular times /
             surveillance / identify where and when an individual is not at home;

      Note: the response should highlight the steps that occur within the ELT process.
      Note: mentioning Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) alone is not sufficient and gets [0]

      Award [1] for each of the three phases described.
      Award [1] for any additional detail provided in any of the three phases.

      Extraction:
      The relevant data from each school/at the source should be identified and
      prepared in view of the transfer to the data warehouse using the principles of the
      ETL);
      The relevant data from the school database is chosen/selected, by using the
      methods, schemata, relations proper of the database that the school uses
      (source);
      And then,
      They are stored temporarily (locally);

      Transformation:
      The data are transformed in a format that is suitable for the use required (by the
      target applications) / the data are transformed following the schema that the
      target application requires for processing;

      For example:
      Data records and field structures cleaned and checked for errors/missing data
      OR
      The data type is changed (integer into double, double into currency);
      OR
      Raw data are given (without normalisation), as the target database may
      preferably need to have un-normalised data to run analytics, and can still better
      normalise all data from all schools together once available (global view);

      Loading:
      Data from each school transmitted/transferred to the data warehouse to be
      loaded by the target databases (that will operate on data using target
      applications);
      Moreover, the transfer may happen at scheduled times not to hinder other
      operations;
                                                                                             [4]

      Award [1] for demonstrating an understanding of cluster analysis.
      Award [1] for demonstrating an understanding of association analysis

      NOTE: This question requires a comparison that relates to the scenario,
      “understanding the distribution of scores in grade 6 reading tests over the past 10
      years”.

      Award an additional [2 max] for an in-depth comparison of the use of both
      techniques that explicitly relate to the scenario.

      Features of cluster analysis:
      Cluster analysis groups schools or pupils by score / according to different factors,
      such as region/location;
      Therefore, it enables comparison between groups;

      Features of association analysis:
      Association analysis breaks up data sets by variables / by variables, such as
      gender, location, age;
      Therefore, it enables the investigation of patterns;

      Example of a comparison related to the scenario:
      Since the age group is fixed (grade 6), cluster analysis will allow us to see the
      geographic distribution of scores, and to analyse trends over time, suggesting (for
      example) whether an improvement in some geographic areas/locations is
      observable;
      whereas
      Association analysis may be used (even after cluster analysis) to detect some
      patterns, for example whether, independently from the geographic region,
      females perform better than males in reading / whether wearing corrective
      glasses (from health insurance records) may affect the proficiency in reading
      (accept similar) / whether being a second-language speaker may affect the
      proficiency;

(f)   Award up to [4 max].
      Note: The question requires the negative effects of cluster analysis and
      association analysis to be addressed.

      Award [1] for identifying a negative social impact
      Negative social impacts may include:
      Type casting students / low morale / students or teachers losing faith in the
      assessment process;
      Note: Accept other negative social impacts.

      Award up to [3 max] for an elaboration that addresses both cluster analysis and
      association analysis
      Award up to [2 max] for an elaboration that addresses either cluster analysis or
      association analysis

      Negative effect of cluster analysis:
      Cluster analysis partitions the data into groups that exhibit similar characteristics /
      allows schools to be grouped based on performance;
      Which may indicate one region has performed poorly over time;
      If such information is used inappropriately it could have deleterious effects on
      students/schools;
      It may impact on the ability of teachers and headteachers to maintain the school
      appealing to future students and this impoverishes the neighbourhood;

      Negative effect of association analysis:
      Relationships found with association analysis may not necessarily causal / based
      on correlation rather than causation;
      Therefore, inferences made may not be correct / could be harmful if results are
      released/
      may not provide decision makers with appropriate data;
      And this over time may mean that decisions taken can implement procedures that
      do not allow alignment to desired targets;
      May polarise/orient some choices/perceptions across students (e.g. the
      perceptions that Engineering is not for girls, or nursing is mostly for girls);
                                                                                                [4]

           Add a team’s wins and losses;
           Subtract from 30 and insert in correct diagonal;
             ( eg A1 = 30 - (sum(A2;A3;A4) + sum(B1;C1;D1)))
              or even A1= 30 - A2 - A3 - A4 - B1 - C1 - D1
             … both examples cover the first two marking points)
           Repeat for other teams;

           Example 1 (based on candidates work):




           M1 = 30-(2+5)-(9+0)-(3+5) = 6
           M2 = 30-(2+5)-(1+8)-(5+5) = 4

(e)   Award [1] for each condition which increments the correct cell
      (accept the use of the macro in part (d)).

      For example:
      if m>n then
        PLAYED[i, j] = PLAYED[i, j] + 1
      else if n>m
        PLAYED[j, i] = PLAYED[j, i] + 1
      else {
             PLAYED [i, i] = PLAYED [i, i]+1
             PLAYED [j, j] = PLAYED [j, j]+1
           }
      end if

      Accept if … if … if.

      If the student has used the wrong parameters in a consistent manner, award [2]
      max on FT.
      If the student has not used the correct increment, award [1] max for a correct
      nested if...else structure or if … if … if.                                           [4]

(f)   A mathematical model reduces a situation to mathematical expressions and
      rules;
      In the example, the results of matches and points gained is expressed
      mathematically / table PROB;
      A simulation applies the model in order to investigate or measure the result;
      In this case the probabilities were applied to give expected season results / table
      PROB10;                                                                               [4]

(g)   If the results are very different;
      Something has changed from last year;
      Can investigate any change in players/trainer;
      Can check the calculations are correct;
      Can be used to identify improvements and unexpected failures from specific
      teams;
      Implies changing the probabilities for the following year;
      That takes this year’s results;
      And ignores the previous year;
      Or give up using past form as it is no indication for the following year;             [4]

6.   (a)   V  D or V D or V - D < 0                                                          [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each appropriate factor identified and [1] for a description up to
           [2 max] for each of the three variables.

           Mark as 2 and 2 and 2

           For Input (R)
           Measure river / rain fluctuation;
           Over a period of time to establish average values / the maximum and minimum
           expected values / outliers;

           For Output (T)
           Measure the amount used by the town;
           at different times (day/night, weekday/weekend, workday/holiday, summer/winter,
           etc);
           to establish average values / the maximum and minimum expected values /
           outliers;
           (Do not award this marking point if already awarded for R.)

           For overflows/outflows (E)
           Use the data gathered from the analysis of Input (R), Output (O);
           To plan for sufficient overflow capacity;

           NOTE: for T and E do not accept the size of the pipes or the outlets since the
           purpose of the simulation is to establish those. Also, the stem indicates that the
           pipe will be large enough to fulfil the water needs of the town.
           For R do not accept size of ‘inlets’ - there are no inlets.

           NOTE: establishing average values was originally not intended, but most
           students provide this and it is a reasonable factor to consider … however, do not
           award this marking point for both R and T. The average does not apply to E at all
           - since outlets are man-made and
           controlled.
                                                                                                [6]

(c)   Award marks as follows, up to [6 max].
      Award [3] for statements concerning the creation of the graphs;
      Award [3] for statements concerning the interpretation of the graphs;

      For example:
      Setting up a suitable relationship (like V = V + R -T -E);
                                              current   initial


      Graphing the values of V for fixed values of T and E, as R goes from minimum to
      maximum levels;
      Including a horizontal line for danger level (D);

      This should identify combinations of R, T and E that are problematic;
      By showing situations where the level of V exceeds D;
      Indicating the maximum required value of E;

      Note: Many alternative systems are possible, for example more complex ones
      that graph V over time for fixed / changing values of R and T, leading to required
      values of overflow (E). These should be credited if described / discussed well.
      A much simpler (alternative) system which checks that R = T + E and works on
      minimum and maximum values of R should be credited in the same way for SL.
                                                                                             [6]

(d)   Award marks that clearly indicate that the physical model will be designed to
      meet the needs identified in the previous simulation of water flow.

      For example:
      Knowing the maximum volumes of E that are needed;
      Will help with the planning of the overflow outlets;
      Overflow outlets can be placed at the appropriate water level to function in time;
      The simulation could include future developments (like growth of the town);
      In order to ensure that the reservoir design will not be outdated in the foreseeable
      future;


                                                                                             [4]

7.   (a)   Award [1] for a suitable application and [1] for an expansion, up to [2 max].

           For example, a map showing the journey from one point to another;
           When only the route needs to be shown on a phone or otherwise;
           As 3D version could take up too much space;
           If no internet connection would be too slow;

           Note: Accept situations that are 2D in nature, like graphing a v-t diagram.        [2]

     (b)   A series of sketches could show the design from a limited number of angles;
           Whereas the CAD system would allow an initial wire frame to be constructed
           which
           could be rotated;
           Changes could be (easily) made and the effect of the 3D shape from other angles
           seen immediately;
           Easy to undo a change to the model, rather than erase part of the sketch;
           Easy to scale the design;
           CAD files are less likely to get damaged than physical drawings;

           Note: Do not accept vague statements like “CAD is more precise”.                   [3]

     (c)   Rendering would take place;
           To apply light and texture to the model;
           Using such techniques as ray tracing;
           To the (wireframe) 2D representation;
           To produce a realistic view of the final product in the chosen material;           [4]

8.   (a)   Award up to [2 max] each, for two advantages.
           The quantity of material is too large;
           It would be impossible for any effective human analysis of all the words;

           Analysis is too complex;
           As there is likely too many groups/multiple group memberships;                         [4]

     (b)   Award up to [2 max].
           Mistyping/misspelling;
           Different use of words from different regions/countries;
           Different styles, for instance modern online SMS text language;
           Some of the posts may be written in different languages/need translating;
           Acronyms eg LOL.
           Note: Accept other reasonable answers.                                                 [2]

     (c)   Award up to [2 max].
           Manually analyse a small section/sample of the opinions;
           Decide or define the required outcomes eg frequency of specific technological
           words;
           Construct the fitness function from this data;                                         [2]

     (d)   Award up to [6 max].
           Diagram with input layer, minimum two hidden layers and an output layer;
           Similar number of nodes with weights;
           Application of nodes in hidden layers;
           Mention of repeated application;
           Until pattern fits fitness function within acceptable limits;
           Back propagation likely and shown;
           Genetic algorithms will take more time with more layers;                               [6]

     (e)   Award [2] for a clear understanding of supervised learning, with an example
           of when it is appropriate.
           Award [2] for a clear understanding of unsupervised learning, with an example
           of when it is appropriate.
           Award [2] for suggesting when in this situation unsupervised would be better.
           Note: Do not accept simplistic answers such as “because the answer is not
           known”.

           For example:
           Supervised learning implies that there is a desired result to be found;
           Such as categorizing the data into sets of identified technological advances;
           Unsupervised learning is used in a situation where no desired output is known;
           Such as the discovery of connections and patterns;
           In this case it could be that opinions on one technological advance were related
           to multiple specific factors/strengths of opinion that were not foreseen;
           With such a large data set it is unlikely that an appropriate fitness function could
           have been found;                                                                       [6]

(d)   (i)   Award up to [5 max].
            Award [1] for each of the processing steps indicated below.
            Required elements are underlined.

             Server uses process.php to process information input via the form;

             Server uses process.php to process item and size input via the
                submitted form;

             Size is checked for being a numeric value AND in the range [34,46]
                included;
                OR
                Size is tested for type-checking (well-formedness) AND range-check
                (legitimate values), i.e. number between 34 and 46, extremes included;

               Check fails: (appropriate) error messages are output / echoed /
                displayed back to user;

             Check ok: server performs a protected access to the internal database
              CatalogDB in localhost;
              OR
             Check ok: server performs an access, protected by username and pwd,
              to the internal database CatalogDB in localhost;

               Server performs a query on CatalogDB with the two parameters
                instantiated from the input form;
                OR
                Server performs a query on CatalogDB with the (actual) values of the
                parameters item and size from the input form;

             Nothing is found on CatalogDB matching the query: return/output/echo
                appropriate error message
                (Note: do not accept ‘the query fails’; the point is that the query
                succeeds but the selection is empty, accept words to that effect).

(ii)   Award up to [2 max].
       Award [1] for an example and [1] for an explanation (to address clients’
       side scripting)

       Example:
       add a script/Javascript (using <script> .. </script>) to the form to
       magnify text / to change background colour / to use specific fonts/
       to provide animation;

       Explanation:
       Features depending on user’s taste/needs are processed faster on clients’
       side and would heavily clog transmission/generate bottleneck if they were
       depending on the server;

       Note: Accept alternative examples.

10.   (a)   Award up to [4 max].
            Award up to [2] in relation to posting in blogs and forums
            Award up to [2] in relation to commenting in blogs and forum.

            Note: award max 2 marks for responses that lists evidence of
            understanding generic posting / commenting but with no explicit connection
            between the blog and the forum.

            Posting:
            In a blog only the owner can post an article / open a thread of discussion / start a
            theme;
            Whereas in a forum all registered participants can post an article / open a thread;

            Commenting:
            In a blog registered visitors may be allowed to comment but the blog owner may
            moderate
            Whereas in a forum all registered users are allowed to comment (without
            moderation);

            Example 1:
            A blog is associated to / led by one person (the blog owner/the journalist)
            who drives / leads / coordinates the discussion;

            Only the owner can post a new thread and the registered users may comment
            just to animate the debate, even they have different views/opinions;

            However, registered users may be subject to moderation by the blog owner,
            especially if this is the journalist publishing in a major newspaper, to the purpose
            of filtering out comments that are inappropriate / offensive / out of scope / non-
            suitable for the newspaper policies / ensuring quality of content / relevance of
            posting / quality of discussions;

            This is quite different from what happens in a discussion forum, where registered
            users are not subject to moderations and therefore can both open/post threads
            and comments in all threads;

            With the effect of delivering a sense of participation / enforce a spirit of
            community / aggregate people on general ideas;
                                                                                                   [4]

      (b)   Award up to [5 max].

            Tags are primarily important to help users navigate the blog site;
            By relating posts within the same category/tag/theme in the blog;
            Hence tags / they contribute links from web pages inside the blog;
            Tags are visible, so they can be easily accessed by web crawlers;
            That will be guided to discover the site content following the links;
            To avoid the risk of isolated pages in the blog that would not be indexed.             [5]

            It has not been accessed enough, yet (possibly because there aren’t many
            registered users, yet);

            It contains keywords that are out-of-fashion/in disuse that nobody
            currently uses for their searches;

            The whole site might be hosted by a company without a good
            reputation (and this penalizes ranking);

       Award [1] for identifying an object in which the technology is embedded.
       Award [1] for the use to which this is put.

       Answers may include:

       Obj - (Digital) control/transmitters that are embedded in domestic
             appliances such as fridges / cookers / microwave or doors etc /smart
             appliances;
       Use - So that the different objects can communicate among them to avoid a
             surcharge in power demand/avoid a power blackout;

       Obj - (semiautonomous) wheelchair with sensors/camera;
       Use - so to avoid specific obstacles when used in a closed environment /
             ‘knows’ the path to traverse a certain area of the flat/hall/living
             environment

       Obj - smart white stick (for sight-impaired people);
       Use - the tip of the stick has awareness of the environment and sends
             back, to the handle, impulses that code information to the user, for
             example it may signal a wet floor

       Obj - A (smart) biometric watch;
       Use - That routinely reports the vital parameters / elaborates statistics /
             checks the pulse;

       Obj - voice recognition systems integrated on appliances/doors;
       Use - for example a user with limited mobility may just say ‘open the door’
             to the main door, but the recognition must be calibrated so to
             recognise only the owner

       Obj - An app on a smartphone/computer/interactive screen;
       Use - that prompts the user to regularly make some movements for
             rehabilitative physiotherapy, at home, on their own (soft
             gym/physiotherapy)

       Obj - sensors in the floor/bathroom;
       Use - detect whether the person has fallen and this can be integrated with
             other services to alert the nurse;

       Obj - infrared camera
       Use - to detect movements/presence/whether the person is sleeping or
              not/ body temperature therefore signalling parameters for possible
              illnesses;

       Obj - weight sensor embedded in the bed
       Use - to determine changes in weight that can be transmitted to other
             services;
                                                                                     [4]

(b)   Award up to [5 max].
      Award up to [2 max] in relation to the public cloud.
      Award up to [2 max] in relation to the private cloud.
      Award [1 max] for a conclusion.

      Note: Do not accept “Access for doctors/nurses...” as it is included in the stem of
      the question.

      Example one:
      Public cloud could be accessed by many people;
      Although access is restricted to their authorized area;
      Private cloud provides dedicated infrastructure for one client;
      Which makes it more secure;
      Because resources are not shared;
      (A breach of security in a private cloud means less data loss than if it happened
      in a public cloud);
      (Conclusion) As this data is sensitive, it should therefore be stored in a private
      cloud (and encrypted);

      Example two:
      Public clouds are usually maintained by expert people;
      SW updates to prevent security risks are very sophisticated;
      Private clouds are usually maintained by people with less expertise;
      When updates are needed in a private cloud it is harder to ensure the
      same level of security (as in a public cloud) across the private clouds, making it
      more vulnerable;
      (Conclusion) This makes the private cloud not necessarily more secure,
      Therefore, encryption is needed to prevent eavesdropping;                             [5]

(c)   Award up to [2 max].
      Award [1] for identifying a risk and [1 max] for an expansion/description.

      Note: Do not accept “(Quality of) security of data storage”

      Risk: Malfunctioning / reliability of the device (reliability of Hardware);
            The device fails to communicate (to send the signal) and the supervisor
            might not intervene on time / user might be induced to think the situation is
            OK;

      Risk: Wearables could be lost / misplaced;
            Consequently, there is an interruption in monitoring some vital parameters;

      Risk: Compatibility among devices;
            The user might be provided cheaper equipment that is not conform to
            standards, raising problems of interoperability with existing equipment;

      Risk: Network may be down / stuttering / low bandwidth;
            The user might become isolated and unable to set it back up on their own
            (don’t know how to make a WiFi work);

      Risk: Privacy / protection and personal safety;
            The user’s habits at home could be determined by monitoring the vital
            parameters (sleep/awake or pulse) and this information may be used for
            unlawful / unethical
            purposes;                                                                        [2]

(e)   Award up to [5 max].
      Award up to [2 max] for describing the role of protocol and standards and
      up to [3 max] for an explanation (examples may be included).

      Protocols and standards provide tested and verified techniques and technologies;
      To support data protection/security/privacy;
      Protocols and standards are essential in a complex system that includes different
      subsystems/components that interact;

      Possible lines to develop an explanation:

         For example, in transmission (SSL/TLS):
          So that all information is encrypted/is protected for eavesdropping or
          man-in-the-middle attack/has Integrity and authenticity protection;
          For example, for the transmission of data/signals from wearables to the cloud;

         For example, in storage and access:
          In relation to Availability/Integrity/authenticity/Access control/logging;
          For example, to prevent risks for patients due to inappropriate data monitoring;

         For example, in relation to evolution of the system:
          In relation to the expansion of the system or changed architecture of
          the system;
          Which might include further/future devices/services involving the cloud /
          so that new devices are (backward) compatible with the existing ones;              [5]

            The essential features that distinguish the semantic web from the web are
            underlined here.

            The semantic web is an extension of the web;
            (Whereby) information is structured using a common format on resources (based
            on URI)/ by adhering to a standard set of rules/languages;

            Semantic web permits software to be used on the web for query / analysis /
            extraction / it allows to interpret data to get information, not just be browsed;

            So that information becomes automatically understandable by computer software
            (and therefore supports automatic knowledge discovery / machine learning / big
            data applications)

            Languages for the semantic web use annotations/relations on top of XML
            described resources/data of the web;

            Some possible responses include:
            The semantic web provides interchange of data/resources,
            whereas the web supports interchange of documents;

            On the semantic web, one can perform queries/analyses/information extraction
            (eg SPARQL/OWL based tools/GRDDL),
            whereas the web can just be browsed;

            Information is structured to a common format (based on URI) and specific
            languages (logic-based or rule-based) are used,
            whereas the data on the web are retrieved essentially by URL and by other
            standards for the language.

            The semantic web makes the resources available on the web to be
            automatically understood by software (Note: idea of
            accessibility/understandable by machine/ enabling big data
            application/knowledge discovery), providing meaning to those resources;
            whereas the web just retrieves data.

            Web pages are typically written in HTML,
            whereas for semantic purposes they should be at least with XML;
            So to enable further annotations (with RDF/OWL) that have the ability of defining
            and describing the relations among any two data (resources) on the web;              [3]

      Elements of focus to award marks:
      Award [1] for showing evidence of understanding that edges/links are directed;
      Award [1] for showing evidence of understanding that (sub)-graph is a
      mathematical object, and web-graph is the interpretation in terms of web
      terminology of a (bigger) mathematical object.
      Note: an example is required

      Example 1:
      Web-graph: interpretation in terms of URL/webpages and links of the elements
      (node and edges) of a directed graph
      OR
      a directed graph (set of nodes, set of directed edges), whose nodes are
      interpreted as resources/URL/web site and whose directed edges are interpreted
      as links between resources/URL/sites;

      Sub-graph (of any graph): subset of nodes and a subset of edges of a given
      graph, preserving direction of edges;
      Therefore, a web-graph may be the entire web, whereas a sub-graph of the
      directed graph can be the mathematical structure associated to a specific web
      site, for example the entire IB portal (all its nodes and its the links)


      Example 2:
      For example: Wikipedia
      All URLs are nodes of a graph, and all links among URLs are directed edges
      among the nodes: this determines a directed graph which is only part of the large
      structure that collects all the WWW, which is the whole web-graph. Therefore,
      being part of it, it is a sub-graph of it.

      Note: Accept drawings that shows, with a few nodes linked and some
      terminology, evidence of such understanding.

      Note: do not accept search of music that starts by giving text (the title of a song,
      for example) as input!

      The search engine accepts soundwaves (or MiDi);
      Search can be driven by melody / rhythm / beat / pitch / presence of specific
      scales or harmonics / sounds associated to specific instruments;
      Therefore, soundwaves are converted into formats so to extract data
      representing some characteristics that guide the search;

(e)   Award up to [5 max].
      Award [1] for the popularity of the movie.
      Award [1] for the cache in P2P.
      Award [1] for the possibility of parallelising download.
      Award [1] for why Zipf’s law matters/what it suggests.
      Award [1] for the search in servers as opposed to P2P.
      Award [1] for a well constructed argument.

      Note: Award [1 max] for responses that describe only what a power law
      is, without any relation to the context of the question.

      Example 1:
      If a movie is a “rare” / “niche” one, then it is unlikely that it is available by many
      nodes in the P2P network;
      Hence, it requires more time to be searched for;
      Because it has to searched elsewhere, in repository servers;
      Besides, once it is found, its downloading may involve just one server;
      Therefore, not only the search itself is slow, rather the downloading is from a
      single node, for an entire movie, the server may easily become congested,
      slowing down the overall process;
      However, popular movies are more likely available within the P2P network;
      And since P2P networks store entire movies/fragments in the cache;
      The downloading itself can be more parallelized by downloading the smaller
      fragments and recombining the fragments later on;
      Henceforth, overall downloading time of the movie decreases in a P2P
      network;

      Example 2:
      A power law applies (with some approximation) to the popularity of movies for
      downloading;
      If movies are ranked by popularity, with 1 being the most popular, then the movie
      with rank r has a number of downloads expected to be proportional to 1/r, for
      Zipf’s law;
      OR
      The most popular movie is downloaded at least twice as the second most popular
      movie, at least three times the third most popular movie, and so on, for Zipf’s law;
      OR
      In a large sample of movies, the frequency of movie in a P2P network (the
      likelhood to find it in the P2P net) is inversely proportional to the rank of the
      movie itself (in the frequency table).

      P2P networks have caches, where multiple copies of all or part of downloads are
      kept;
      Therefore, the more often a file is downloaded, the more likely it is that at any one
      time there will be multiple copies cached on different servers/members of the
      P2P network;
      Downloads will then be faster, because a closer server can be chosen, or
      different parts can be downloaded in parallel;
      The 100th most popular movie download, for example, will only be downloaded
      about 1/100th as often as the most popular one, if Zipf’s law applies;
      So it is much less likely to be cached, and will take longer to download;
                                                                                               [5]

      Note: Do not award marks for “Collective intelligence affects the online buying
      habits of the general public”: this is the repetition of the question itself!

      Note: Given the question, the response has to refer to the context of online
      buying habits. Do not accept examples that do not address the context.

      Collective intelligence [1 max]
      Collective intelligence is the intelligence that emerges from a group that shares
      knowledge, and emerges from the collaboration, competition and coordination of
      (many of) the individuals of the group;
      OR
      Collective intelligence includes intelligence of a group / shared knowledge /
      collective coordination;

      (Therefore,) the group acquires knowledge at a much faster rate than an
      individual, and this allows the group to make better decision, faster, for the
      interest of the group;

      Some ideas for contexts for the example (list not exhaustive)
       buying second-hand clothes /
       freecycles communities /
       vegetarian products / specific diets
       culture / publishing
       crowdsourcing / crowdfunding services;

      Stating a Possible Example [1 max]
      A group of people has an interest in minimizing food waste and organizes a
      network online to re-distribute their goods that are approaching the use-by date;

      People contributing the reviews to online vendors/marketplaces and possibly on
      web-sites that monitor people’s browsing activity/preferences;

      People regularly selling pre-owned goods on Ebay (online) / members of an
      online community of artists using a specific technique;

      Serious-gamers that use their experience in distributed game strategies to act
      collectively and influence the price/bids for some product that is available online,
      for example, tickets for concerts/sport events, for re-sale;

      Popular subscriptions to services like Netflix or to torrents for downloading, in
      comparison to purchasing DVD or going to cinemas/theatres/concerts, with an
      impact on the way artists may sell/market their products and protect their
      intellectual property;

      Crowdfunding the publication of a study on some not-well-known ceramic artist,
      with the effect of increasing the visibility of both the artist and the author of the
      essay as expert in the area, affecting the reputation of both;

Possible lines to develop an expansion: [2 max]
  Technical expansion
     Can include/address use of preferred links/folksonomies for an interest
     group;
     Can include use of P2P or dedicated networks;
     Can include crowdfunding and crowdsourcing;

    Sociological / economical / environmental expansion
     Groups sharing the same ethical principles can merge into a bigger
     network;
     This may have (sometimes) an impact on small communities by using only
     the products that are produced locally/ by recycling locally, therefore
     reducing carbon footprint;
     These small groups may create a burgeoning niche market for their
     products, and can lead to increased economies of scale and price
     reductions that may stimulate the interest in other buyers (outside the
     immediate group);

    Cognitive expansion
     Likes and dislikes for some products/use of reviews;
     Trends in the market can be predicted by observing the habits on the net;
     Possibly knowing these habits (sentiment analysis) may lead to changes in
     some policies (for example, pressure groups to obtain some life-saving
     vaccinations for free rather than buying them privately);
                                                                                 [4]

Option D — Object-oriented programming

13.   (a)   Award up to [3] marks.
            Note: An example is required with detailed explanation (up to [2 max];
            Award [1 max] if there is lack of detail).

            A class describes/provides the template for a particular object;
            Whereas an instantiation of a class actually creates an object for that class;
            For example:
            An employee class would contain characteristics/actions that describe
            an employee, and an instantiation would represent a particular employee;                [3]

      (b)   Award marks as follows up to [4 max]:
            Award up to [2 max] for each of the two required examples (award [1] mark for correct
            example but lack of terminology/detail/competence)
            Note: Examples should show competent use of terminology in describing the use of
            inheritance, to get full marks.

            The responses should focus on these aspects, with keywords underlined:
                   Several sub-classes can inherit characteristics from a superclass;
                   Whilst adding specific characteristics particular to themselves;

            Examples can then expand or be described to include the features above.

            For example:
            There could be a “GUI” superclass that contains the main elements for the UIs
            with the GUI for each screen inheriting from its parent;

            For example:
            An “Employee” superclass that allows the different types of employees to inherit
            standard characteristics;                                                               [4]

      (c)   Award up to [3 max]:

            Library programs are programs that have already been written;
            They are standard/frequently used programs;
            Development time will be saved if they can be incorporated into the design;
            They have been tested / Will be free of bugs;

            Note: Allow [1 mark] for responses that include examples that expand on any of the aspects
            listed above.                                                                          [3]

14.   (a)   Award [max 2 marks]:
            [1 mark] for each of the two correct assignments.

            {
              this.id = id;
              salesHistory = new Sales [100];
            }

            Note: Allow any reasonable value for the number of Sales objects.                       [2]

 (b)   Award up to [3 max].
       Note: Use of competent/detailed terminology (underlined) is required.

       As the variables are declared as private;
       They/their values cannot be accessed directly from outside this class;
       Therefore, public accessor methods are needed to permit access;                   [3]

       Note: Either accessor or access required.

 (c)   (i)    Award up to [4 max] as follows (there are 5 marking points):

       (ii)   Award up to [2 marks].

              Any change in the Sales class might require a rewriting of some
              SalesPerson methods/might not work;
              For example, the calcTotalSales() is dependent upon/uses data from
              the Sales
              class;                                                                     [2]

Example three:

Table constructed top down (implicitly it indicates the step);
It focusses on arguments for the recursive calls and the result of the tests;
the level of recursion is implicit;
It produces the correct output in correspondence of the correctly called arguments;
The sequence of outputs is the last columns read top-down;
Both arguments for the recursive call are displayed;

Example four:

This diagram allows only to retrieve 5 accesses to null ([1] mark); there is no way to reconstruct
the correct sequence in output.

 node.left node.right node.data + “ “

 12         50          null

 null       14          null

(c) Award [5] marks as follows, depending on a recursive or
    non-recursive answer:

  Example, non-recursive answer:

  Award marks as follows:
  [1] correct method signature
  [1] declaration/initialisation of current node
  [1] correct loop (with correct condition)
  [1] update current node with the node on the left
  [1] correct data returned (with use of dot notation)


  public int smallest(Node node)
  {
    Node current = node;
    while (current.left != null)
    {
      current = current.left;
    }
    return(current.data);
  }

  Example, recursive answer:
  Award marks as follows:
  [1] correct method signature
  [1] correct condition for checking node on the left (conditional statement)
  [1] update of node with the node on the left (see NOTE below)
  [1] recursive call on smallest
  (Note: The recursive call may incorporate the call to the left node)
  [1] correct data returned (with use of dot notation)

     public int smallest(Node node)
     {
       if (node.left == null)
       {
         return node.data;
       }
       node=node.left;
       return smallest(node);
     }

  Example where Note needs to be applied

  public int smallest(Node node)
  {
    if (node.left == null)
    {
      return node.data;
    }
    return smallest(node.left);
  }

                                                                                [5]
