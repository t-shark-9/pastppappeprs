                                                Section A
1.   (a)   State the main source of energy for the food chain in Figure 1.                              [1]

           Sun/sunlight/insolation/solar energy;

     (b)   State the trophic level labelled X in Figure 1.                                              [1]

           (primary) producer / autotrophs / phototrophs / phytoplankton / green plants;

           The command term “State” requires a “specific name” so do not credit
           “trophic level 1”.

     (c)   Identify one use of DDT leading to its presence in the environment.                          [1]

           insecticide/pesticide / kill pests/insects / control malarial mosquitoes / plague /
           OWTTE;

     (d)   With reference to the concepts of bioaccumulation and biomagnification, outline how
           the concentration of DDT has changed along the food chain.                                   [2]

           bioaccumulation: DDT absorbed by a given trophic level is not broken
           down/excreted / is non-biodegradable so accumulates in tissues;                              [1]

           biomagnification: the concentration of DDT will increase as it’s passed along/up food
           chain (because other biomass is lost);                                                       [1]

           Do not allow simply “organisms at higher levels eat/consume more”. Higher trophic
           levels do not consume more biomass in a given time than lower trophic levels.

     (e)   (i)    State the relationship between large and small fish in Figure 1.                      [1]

                  predator-prey / carnivory / predation / OWTTE;

                  Do not credit “small fish are eaten/consumed by large fish”.

           (ii)   Outline how this relationship may be of benefit to the populations of both
                  species.                                                                              [2]

                  the predator benefits by gaining food from prey / its population is
                  limited/stabilized by amount of prey available;                                       [1]
                  they prey benefits by predators limiting/stabilizing its population / selecting out
                  weaker/diseased individuals / maintaining healthy gene pool in prey / reducing
                  competition in prey for available food/resources;                                     [1]

                  Award full marks is response describes negative feedback between both
                  populations, or indicates that each group regulates population of the other.
                                                  –4–                 M17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   State the crop which is under the greatest water stress.                               [1]

           cotton;

     (b)   Identify two strategies that could be used to grow crops in water stressed areas.      [2]

           improved irrigation efficiency eg drip irrigation;
           use crop cultivars that require less water (eg drought resistant seeds/GMOs) /
           replace high stress crops (eg cotton) with low stress (eg oats);
           improve water catchment/storage with dams; reservoirs;
           install desalinization plants in coastal areas;
           plant cover crops/use terracing (to reduce evaporation/run-off losses);
           use salt-tolerant crops to exploit available sea-water/saline soils;

           Do not credit simply “irrigation”. Too vague.

     (c)   Identify three factors that may lead to an increase in water stress for a given
           agricultural area.                                                                     [3]

           increased demand through increased population / domestic/agricultural/industrial
           use;
           increased water consumption through more affluent lifestyles / shift to meat-rich
           diets;
           move towards more intensive agriculture/irrigation / unsustainable abstraction of
           water;
           movement of water out of drainage basin eg aqueducts / upstream use by other
           countries;
           growing of inappropriate/heavily water-dependent crops;
           deforestation in drainage basin / pollution/contamination of water sources;
           drought/reduction of rainfall (due to global warming/El Niño);

           Award [1] for each correct factor identified, up to [3 max].
           For last MP, do not accept simply a description of a regular climate eg low
           rainfall/dry season. The question asks for what will increase stress, so there needs
           to be a suggestion of change.
           Marking points above may be stated as given or explicitly demonstrated through
           reference to examples/case studies (eg cotton around Aral Sea absorbs excessive
           water from an environment at risk).
                                                  –5–                 M17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   Calculate the projected percentage increase from 2007 to 2030 in CO2 emissions
           for Russia.                                                                            [1]

           ⎛ 4 × 100 ⎞ 34 % increase (allow 32–36 %);
           ⎜ 11.7 = ⎟
           ⎝         ⎠

     (b)   Outline how CO2 emissions can cause a change in the global climate.                    [2]

           emissions (lead to higher concentration) of CO2 which is a greenhouse gas;
           …causing greater absorption of infra-red/heat radiation and rise in global
           temperature;
           …leading to increased evaporation/changing winds/shifting patterns of
           precipitation/droughts/extreme weather events/storms/hurricanes/El Niño;

     (c)   Identify two possible reasons for the projected change in CO2 emissions for China.     [2]

           growing number of fossil-fuelled vehicles/transport;
           rapidly advancing economy/standard of living;
           increase in fossil-fuelled power plants / increased industrialization;
           increase in intensive/mechanized farming systems (in place of traditional);
           burning of forests to clear land for agriculture;

           Accept any other reasonable suggestions.
           Award [1] for each correct reason identified, up to [2 max].

     (d)   Identify one reduction strategy that the United States may use to achieve its
           projected change in CO2 emissions.                                                     [1]

           reduction of energy consumption/CO2 production through laws/taxes/education;
           use of alternatives to fossil fuels;
           CO2 removal though CCS;
           afforestation / reducing rates of deforestation;

           Accept any other reasonable suggestions, but they must be explicitly linked to
           reduction in C emissions ie not simply “improve public transport” or “recycling”.

     (e)   Identify one adaptation strategy that could be used to reduce the impacts of climate
           change.                                                                                [1]

           flood defences (ie levees/dikes);
           desalinization plants to replace freshwater losses;
           planting of crops in previously unsuitable areas;
           water conservation (eg restrictions on use of irrigation/sprinklers);
           exploiting areas that have become more productive for crops through climate
change;
           developing (eg drought-resistant) crops better adapted to areas impacted by
           climate change;
           green roof system that cools the building through evapotranspiration/reflection;

           Accept any other reasonable suggestions.
           Some strategies can be acknowledged as both adaptive and mitigating eg a “green
           roof” both reduces impact of climate change by cooling the building (adaptation) and
           reduces cause of climate change by reducing C emission (mitigation). Such
           suggestions should not be credited unless the link to reducing impact is made clear,
           as in the last MP above.
                                             –6–                M17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(f)   Explain how the ability to implement mitigation and adaptation strategies may vary
      from one country to another.                                                             [4]

      political will/pressure for change may differ due to some countries being more/less
      committed to their industrial lifestyles/economic growth / inhibited through political
      corruption;
      finance/economics may/may not allow some countries to fund new
      technologies/infrastructures;
      some countries may depend upon others for knowledge transfer/technological
      assistance to implement resolutions;
      religious/political/cultural norms/education in some countries may promote/limit their
      perception of environmental threats/approach to management;
      geographical location of some countries may place them at greater/more immediate
      risk from impacts of climate change (eg low-lying islands/tropical storm-prone
      nations) / or offer them greater opportunities for mitigation (eg available sources of
      alternative energy);
      some countries may perceive greater immediate priorities eg war in Syria/poverty in
      Somalia;

      Award [1] for each correct explanation, up to [4 max].
      Accept other valid explanations of equivalent validity.
      Do not accept eg “Economics” alone without an explanatory note as in MPs above.

                                             Section B
Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 18 with the
guidance given below for each question.

4.   (a)   Identify four ways in which solar energy reaching vegetation may be lost from an
           ecosystem before it contributes to the biomass of herbivores.                           [4]

           reflected from the leaf surface;
           absorbed by non-photosynthetic surface;
           heat/some wavelengths are absorbed by leaf but not used in photosynthesis/not
           converted into chemical energy;
           (chemical energy/GPP) respired by vegetation;
           (chemical energy/GPP) not eaten/harvested by consumer / dead material consumed
           by decomposers;
           eaten but not absorbed by herbivore / lost in faeces;
           absorbed by herbivore, but lost through respiration;

           Award [1] for each correct way identified, up to [4 max].

     (b)   Suggest a series of procedures that could be used to estimate the net productivity of
           an insect population in kg m–2 yr–1.                                                    [7]

           measure change in population size over year;
           using Lincoln Index/mark-release-recapture;
           set traps/capture a sample, mark and release them;
           re-set traps for a second capture and calculate the proportion marked and
           unmarked;
           use the equation: N = n1 × n2 ;
                                    n3
           weigh a sample of insects to find (wet) weight;
           use a conversion factor to calculate dry weight from (wet) weight;
           calculate mean dry weight/biomass per individual;
           from mean dry weights and population sizes calculate total weight change
           over year;
           estimate area occupied by population using measuring tapes/scale maps;
           divide total change in dry mass by area in m2;

           Award [1] for each correct suggestion, up to [7 max].
           Credit any alternative sequence of procedures that is equally appropriate to finding
           net secondary productivity eg using lab population and weighing dry weight of food,
           faeces, respiration rates, etc, awarding marks similarly to scheme above.
                                             –8–                 M17/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   To what extent are the concepts of net productivity and natural income useful in
      managing the sustainable harvesting of named resources from natural ecosystems?           [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with “Understanding
      concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for
      when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

      • understanding concepts and terminology of natural income, net productivity,
        natural capital, stock sustainability, replenishment, maximum sustainable yield,
        rates of harvest, renewable/non-renewable, goods/services, etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking net productivity and natural income with
        sustainable harvesting, maximum sustainable yield, impacts of
        extraction/transport/processing, management of resources, remaining
        stock/capital, their applicability to abiotic/biotic resources, renewable/non-
        renewable resources, goods/services, etc
      • examples of net productivity/natural income of named resources eg timber,
        freshwater, fish populations, river processing organic waste, fossil fuels, impacts
        of unsustainable extraction eg bycatch, access roads/infrastructure in forests, etc
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which net productivity and natural income are
        applicable and sufficient concepts for ensuring sustainable use of a range of
        resources
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
        examples given eg “Both concepts can be very useful in assessing the
        sustainability of harvesting but net productivity is more limited in its applications
        since it can only be applied to biotic resources and neither of the concepts take
        into account any unsustainable damage that may occur through the actual
        extraction of a resource.”

5.   (a)   Identify four characteristics of ecosystems that contribute to their resilience.           [4]

           biodiversity (genetic/species/habitat diversity);
           diversity/complexity of interactions/linkages between components/developed food
           webs/nutrient cycling/establishment of keystone species;
           size of storages/population sizes / abundance of resources;
           presence of negative feedback mechanisms;
           position of tipping points/thresholds of change;
           maturity/later stage of succession/climax community;
           balance of inputs and outputs / steady state equilibrium;

           Award [1] for each correct characteristic identified, up to [4 max].
           Do not accept responses that simply state “storages” or “tipping points”, all systems
           have these. It is the size or position of the storage or tipping point respectively that
           determines its resilience. Simply stating “biodiversity”, however, is acceptable
           because it is inherently quantitative.
           Do not accept responses referring to low human interference, etc. Reduced
           disturbance may lead to more stable ecosystems, but it does not influence their
           resilience as such (ie their inherent ability to resist disturbance).

(b)   Explain how positive feedback mechanisms may influence the equilibrium of an
      aquatic ecosystem during the process of eutrophication.                                [7]

      in eutrophication, positive feedback amplifies changes in the system and drives it
      toward a tipping point;
      …when a new equilibrium is adopted with low diversity/loss of species/dominance of
      algae;




      Award [5 max] for marking points given above (including each of those in a box on
      the diagram) or up to [7 max] if the processes identified complete a genuine loop of
      positive feedback ie where a given change promotes further change of same
      process.

(c)   Pollution management strategies may be aimed at either preventing the production
      of pollutants or limiting their release into ecosystems.

      With reference to either acid deposition or eutrophication, evaluate the relative
      efficiency of these two approaches to management.                                       [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with “Understanding
      concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for
      when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

      For Eutrophication:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of eutrophication, distinction
        between prevention and limiting management strategies, inorganic nutrients,
        phosphate-free detergents, organic vs inorganic fertilizers, organic farming,
        domestic and agricultural waste, sewage treatment, N/P stripping, buffer zones,
        point vs non-point sources, etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking a range of strategies with their effectiveness
        in reducing impacts of pollutants, from different sources, on different ecosystems,
        and their relevance and validity for different societies, etc
      • examples of prevention strategies (changing human activity) eg alternative
        fertilisers, P-free detergents, and limiting strategies eg N/P stripping phase in
        water treatment, use of buffer zones, in named case studies/societies, etc
      • balanced analysis of the relative efficiency of the two approaches in reducing
        impacts on ecosystems; meeting needs of societies, cost and ease of application,
        etc
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
        examples given eg generally, prevention strategies are more efficient because
        they are directed at the root of the problem, but limiting strategies may be seen
        as more appropriate from an anthropocentric/technocentric perspective as they
        will be of less hindrance to productivity

      For Acid Deposition:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of acid deposition, distinction
        between prevention and limiting management strategies, NOx and SOx,
        atmospheric emissions, fossil fuels, biodiesel, alternative energy, cement/pulp
        and paper industries, etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking a range of strategies with their effectiveness
        in reducing impacts of pollutants, from different sources, on different ecosystems,
        and their relevance & validity for different societies, etc
      • examples of prevention strategies (changing human activity) eg using alternative
        energy sources, eg solar, hydro, wind, etc, energy saving technology, transport
        bans/public transport, paper recycling, and limiting strategies eg scrubbers,
        catalytic converters, etc
      • balanced analysis of the relative efficiency of the two approaches in reducing
        impacts on ecosystems, meeting needs of societies, cost and ease of application,
        etc

• a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by analysis and
  examples given eg “Generally, prevention strategies are more efficient because
  reducing the use of fossil fuels will simultaneously resolve many other
  environmental impacts of using this resource which ultimately will become
  unavailable.”

If response addresses both acid rain and eutrophication, only award marks for the

                  necessary for full credit.
                  Award [1] for each correct input identified, up to [2 max].
                  Do not credit flows that are transfers or transformations within the soil eg
                  ammonification / nitrification / capillary movement, etc.
                  Do not accept “pesticides” (these do not provide inorganic nutrients).

           (ii)   Identify two outputs from these storages.                                      [2]

(b)   Solid domestic waste may contain non-biodegradable material and toxins that have
      the potential to reduce the fertility of soils.

      Explain how strategies for the management of this waste may help to preserve
      soil fertility.                                                                        [7]

      recycling/re-use helps by preventing the release of non-biodegradable
      material/toxins into the soil;
      reduction helps by reducing the quantity of non-biodegradable material/toxins
      produced/manufactured;
      promoting selective consumerism to avoid toxic products prevents them being
      present in domestic waste;
      education/laws/fines that promote disposal of hazardous domestic waste in
      appropriate collecting facility will reduce their impact on soil fertility;
      incineration may be helpful in breaking down non-biodegradable substances/organic
      toxins;
      …and the remaining mineral content can be used to enhance soil fertility;
      landfills can limit the release of non-biodegradable material/toxins into soil with
      effective lining;
      sorting of waste before entry to landfill can remove many toxic substances eg
      batteries/fluorescent lamps/tyres/spray cans reducing risk to soil fertility through
      leakage;
      deep well injection of hazardous wastes will prevent soil toxification;
      all strategies that prevent release of toxins will preserve the soil fauna that
      contribute to fertility;
      composting (although it does not breakdown non-biodegradable material/toxins) can
      compensate to some extent by providing soil nutrients that improve soil fertility;

      Award [1] for each correct explanation, up to [7 max].

(c)   The provision of food resources and assimilation of wastes are two key factors of
      the environment that determine its carrying capacity for a given species.

      To what extent does the human production of food and waste each influence the
      carrying capacity for human populations?                                                 [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may be
      offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each of
      the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with “Understanding
      concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions and should not be
      seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of elements to look for
      when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

      • understanding concepts and terminology of carrying capacity, ecological
        footprint, waste assimilation, recycling/re-use/reduction strategies, BOD, toxicity,
        greenhouse gases, global warming/climate change, selective breeding/genetic
        engineering, commercial vs artisanal farming, mono-cropping, soil quality,
        desertification, Malthus/Boserup theories, etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking a range of ways in which different sources of
        waste eg agricultural, domestic, industrial, transport etc and food production
        systems eg commercial, polyculture, artisanal, etc impact/deplete available
        resources thus influencing carrying capacity for humans, etc
      • examples of how carrying capacity may be influenced through wastes eg toxicity
        to natural populations, increasing BOD in aquatic systems, greenhouse gases
        leading to global warming/climate change reducing (or possibly increasing?)
        productivity, and through food production eg use of pesticides reducing natural
        populations, reducing soil quality through overharvesting/compaction/irrigation,
        habitat destruction, etc and examples of how these influences may be reduced
        through waste management strategies eg recycling, etc, alternative energy, and
        alternative agricultural practices eg polyculture, crop rotation, more efficient
        crops/GMOs, etc
      • balanced analysis of the net impact of waste and food production on the
        carrying capacity for humans etc
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
        examples given eg “Although there are many mitigating strategies that can
        reduce the influence of waste and food production on carrying capacity, overall,
        an increasing per capita footprint of humans will inevitably result in a reduced
        carrying capacity.”

7.   (a)   Identify four reasons why the genetic diversity of a population may change
           over time.                                                                                   [4]

           mutation may lead to new genotypes/increased diversity;
           natural selection/survival of fittest may eliminate some genotypes/reduce diversity;
           (human activities) eg pollution/hunting/habitat destruction/alien species may reduce
           population/diversity / lead to a bottleneck effect;
           migration causing mixing of populations/subjection to new selective pressures;
           climate change may eliminate certain genotypes/reduce diversity;
           …or lead to evolution of new genotypes/increase diversity;
           (tectonic activity may create) natural barriers leading to divergent
           evolution/speciation/greater diversity;
           genetic drift/random loss of genes;
           mixing of GMOs/selectively bred/farmed escapees introduces new genes to wild
           populations;

           Accept any other reasonable suggestions.
           Responses that identify relevant factors eg “mutation”, but do not identify why/how
           this influences diversity should not gain full credit.
           Award [1 max] for responses that list three valid factors without identifying how they
           influence diversity.
           Award [2 max] for responses that identify four such factors.
           Award [1] for each correct reason identified, up to [4 max].

     (b)   Explain how changes in the concentration of stratospheric and tropospheric
           ozone in the atmosphere can affect global biodiversity.                                      [7]

           Award [1] for the following point:

           stratospheric ozone has decreased and (production of) tropospheric ozone has
           increased;

           Award [1] for each part of the explanation given below, up to [6 max].

           change in stratospheric ozone allows more UV radiation to reach earth;
           …which causes mutations/damage to DNA/cancers;
           …(possibly) resulting in death of organisms/reduction in biodiversity;
           …also reduces plant growth/NPP/especially phytoplankton / damages chlorophyll;
           …affecting populations all along food chain/reducing diversity of food web;              [4 max]

           change in tropospheric ozone in urban areas gives rise to photochemical smog;
           …that is toxic (to humans/other species);
           …damages plant leaves reducing NPP of ecosystems/food chains;
           …tropospheric ozone is a greenhouse gas contributing to global warming/climate
           change;
           …resulting in population declines/death/reduction in biodiversity;                       [4 max]

           Do not credit the common misconception that ozone depletion/UV radiation leads to
           global warming (its connection, if any, is negligible).

(c)   Environmental value systems differ in how they view the importance of biodiversity
      and this could influence their approach to conservation.

      Discuss how these different perspectives, including your own, may influence
      approaches to conservation.                                                             [9]

      when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific mark within that band.

      Answers may include:

      • understanding concepts and terminology of environmental value systems,
        biodiversity, habitat/species/genetic diversity,
        ecocentric/anthropocentric/technocentric, bio-rights, intrinsic value, stewardship,
        conservation areas/national parks, in-situ/ex-situ conservation, species vs habitat
        approach, ecotourism; gene banks, plantations, in vitro development, etc
      • breadth in addressing and linking differences in the importance attached to
        biodiversity by different value systems and associated strategies for conservation
        eg ecocentrics will attach particular importance to intrinsic value of biodiversity
        and the rights of all species, their focus will be on minimising any human
        intervention, conserving habitat diversity and pristine ecosystems, in-situ
        conservation areas/national parks, technocentrics may attach particular
        importance to the potential resources that biodiversity provides for human
        population, they may focus more readily on species more useful to humans and
        the potential of genes in providing resources, the use of gene banks and
        technology for in vitro development/ex-situ breeding programmes of “useful”
        species, anthropocentrics will attach particular importance to the ability of
        biodiversity in stabilising ecosystems so they can be managed for human benefit,
        through ecotourism, sustainable harvesting, conservation efforts will depend
        heavily on social engagement/legislation, etc
      • examples of environmental value systems eg deep ecologists, ecocentric,
        anthropocentric, environmental managers, technocentric, cornucopian, and
        approaches to conservation eg habitat/in-situ conservation, ex-situ zoos/breeding
        programmes, ecotourism, gene banks/genetic engineering/in vitro development,
        flagship species
      • balanced analysis of how different perspectives on biodiversity adopted in
        different value systems can influence the emphasis and selection of conservation
        strategies
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
        examples given eg “My own perspective is rather on the borderline of ecocentric
        and anthropocentric viewpoints because, unlike the more extreme ecocentrics, I
        do believe humans have a unique responsibility in the natural world. And yet, the
        anthropocentric view of biodiversity as a pragmatic means to an end lacks some
        of the mystery and spirituality I associate with nature that is more evident in the
        ecocentric’s perspective.”
