Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may
be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Answers must be written within
the answer boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by
suitable working, for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of
your answer.

2.   All the children in a summer camp play at least one sport, from a choice of football (F ) or
     basketball (B). 15 children play both sports.

     The number of children who play only football is double the number of children who play
     only basketball.

     Let x be the number of children who play only football.

     (a)   Write down an expression, in terms of x , for the number of children who play only
           basketball.                                                                                                         [1]

3.   A lampshade, in the shape of a cone, has a wireframe consisting of a circular ring and four
     straight pieces of equal length, attached to the ring at points A, B, C and D.

     The ring has its centre at point O and its radius is 20 centimetres. The straight pieces
     meet at point V, which is vertically above O, and the angle they make with the base of the
     lampshade is 60°.

     This information is shown in the following diagram.

     the leaves, in cm, she produced the following cumulative frequency graph.

     (b)   Write down the number of leaves with a length less than or equal to 8 cm.                               [1]

     The researcher finds that 10 % of the leaves have a length greater than k cm.

     (c)   (i)    Use the graph to find the value of k .

           (ii)   Before measuring, the researcher estimated k to be approximately 9.5 cm. Find

14.   Jashanti is saving money to buy a car. The price of the car, in US Dollars (USD), can be
      modelled by the equation

                                          P = 8500 (0.95)t .

      Jashanti’s savings, in USD, can be modelled by the equation

                                          S = 400t + 2000 .

      In both equations t is the time in months since Jashanti started saving for the car.

      (a)   Write down the amount of money Jashanti saves per month.                                                                [1]

      (b)   Use your graphic display calculator to find how long it will take for Jashanti to have
            saved enough money to buy the car.                                                                                      [2]

      Jashanti does not want to wait too long and wants to buy the car two months after she
      started saving. She decides to ask her parents for the extra money that she needs.

      (c)   Calculate how much extra money Jashanti needs.                                                                          [3]

(Question 15 continued)

     The equation of each of the quadratic functions can be written in the form y = ax2 + bx + c ,
     where a ≠ 0 .

     Each of the sets of conditions for the constants a , b and c , in the table below, corresponds
     to one of the graphs on the opposite page.

     Write down the number of the corresponding graph next to each set of conditions.                 [6]


                             Conditions                        Graph number

                          a > 0, b < 0, c > 0
                          a < 0, b = 0, c > 0
                          a < 0, b > 0, c < 0
                          a > 0, b = 0, c = 0
                          a > 0, b > 0, c < 0
                          a < 0, b < 0, c = 0
