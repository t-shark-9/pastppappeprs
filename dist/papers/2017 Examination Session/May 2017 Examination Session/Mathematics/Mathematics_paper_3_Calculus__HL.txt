Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     Use l’Hôpital’s rule to determine the value of
                                                         sin 2 x

     Let the Maclaurin series for tan x be

                                     tan x = a1 x + a3 x3 + a5 x5 + …

     where a1 , a3 and a5 are constants.

     (a)   Find series for sec2 x , in terms of a1 , a3 and a5 , up to and including the x4 term

		         (i)    by differentiating the above series for tan x ;

		         (ii)   by using the relationship sec2 x = 1 + tan2 x .                                   [3]

     (b)   Hence, by comparing your two series, determine the values of a1 , a3 and a5 .            [3]
