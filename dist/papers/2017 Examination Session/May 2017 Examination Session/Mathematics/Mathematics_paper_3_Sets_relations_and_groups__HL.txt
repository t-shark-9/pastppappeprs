Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     The set A contains all positive integers less than 20 that are congruent to 3 modulo 4.
     The set B contains all the prime numbers less than 20.

     (a)   (i)    Write down all the elements of A and all the elements of B .

		         (ii)   Determine the symmetric difference, A∆B , of the sets A and B .                      [4]

     (b)   The set C is defined as C = {7 , 9 , 13 , 19} .

		         (i)    Write down all the elements of A ∩ B , A ∩ C and B ∪ C .

		         (ii)   Hence by considering A ∩ (B ∪ C) , verify that in this case the operation ∩ is
                  distributive over the operation ∪ .                                                  [6]
