Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display
calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution,
you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be
given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to
show all working.

     The mean weight of a certain breed of bird is claimed to be 5.5 kg . In order to test this claim,
     a random sample of 10 birds of the breed was obtained and weighed, with the following
     results in kg .

     You may assume that the weights of this breed of bird are normally distributed.

      (a)       (i)    State the distribution of

      (b)       A mathematics teacher, wishing to apply the above result, generates some artificial
                data, assumes a value for the variance and calculates the following 95 % confidence
                interval for µ ,

                                                    [3.12 , 3.25].

                The teacher asks Alun to interpret this result. Alun makes the following statement.
                “The value of µ lies in the interval [3.12 , 3.25] with probability 0.95.”

		              (i)    Explain briefly why this is an incorrect statement.

		              (ii)   Give a correct interpretation.                                                   [2]

      (a)       By writing 10 = 11 - 1 , use the binomial theorem to show that

                                         10n ≡ (-1)n (mod 11) for n ∈  .                               [3]

      A number is called palindromic if it reads the same backwards as forwards, for example
      524425.

      (b)       (i)    Show that all palindromic numbers to base 10 with an even number of digits are
                       divisible by 11.

		              (ii)   By finding a suitable example, show that this is not necessarily true for
                       palindromic numbers to base 10 with an odd number of digits.                     [6]

                   independent.
