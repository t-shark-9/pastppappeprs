Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if
graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer
is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     (a)   Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 264 and 1365.         [5]

     (b)   (i)    Hence, or otherwise, find the general solution of the Diophantine equation

                                         264x - 1365y = 3 .

		         (ii)   Hence find the general solution of the Diophantine equation

                                         264x - 1365y = 6 .                                         [8]

     (c)   By expressing each of 264 and 1365 as a product of its prime factors, determine the
           lowest common multiple of 264 and 1365.                                                  [3]

     (a)   Starting at A , use the nearest neighbour algorithm to find an upper bound for the
           travelling salesman problem for G .                                                      [5]

     (b)   By first deleting vertex A , use the deleted vertex algorithm together with Kruskal’s
           algorithm to find a lower bound for the travelling salesman problem for G .              [7]

     (a)   In the context of graph theory, explain briefly what is meant by

		(i)             a circuit;

		         (ii)   an Eulerian circuit.                                                              [2]

     (b)   The graph G has six vertices and an Eulerian circuit. Determine whether or not its
           complement G' can have an Eulerian circuit.                                              [3]

     (c)   Find an example of a graph H , with five vertices, such that H and its complement H'
           both have an Eulerian trail but neither has an Eulerian circuit. Draw H and H' as your
           solution.                                                                                [4]

     Consider the recurrence relation aun + 2 + bun + 1 + cun = 0 , n ∈  where a , b and c are
     constants. Let α and β denote the roots of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 .

     (a)   Verify that the recurrence relation is satisfied by

                                                    un = Aαn + Bβ n ,

           where A and B are arbitrary constants.                                                   [4]

     (b)   Solve the recurrence relation

           un + 2 – 2un + 1 + 5un = 0 given that u0 = 0 and u1 = 4 .                                [9]
