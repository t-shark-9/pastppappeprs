You must make sure you have looked at all pages. Please put the            annotation on any blank
page, to indicate that you have seen it.

When using the On Page Comments annotation, please keep the following in mind:
  Avoid covering the candidate’s own writing. This can be done by writing your comments in
    the margins then running the arrow attached to the ‘on-page comment’ annotation to the
    appropriate place.
  Provide all comments in the target language.

The translation is assessed in its basic units of clause and sentence. To this end, the original text is
chunked in a fixed number of sections (or “sense units”), 15 at SL and 30 at HL. Every section is
awarded two separate marks according to the two descriptors outlined below.

Each section is awarded 0 to 3 marks for descriptor A (Meaning) and 0 to 3 marks for descriptor B
(Vocabulary & Grammar).

The range of marks for each section is therefore 0 to 6, while the maximum number of marks for the
whole text is 90 at SL (15 sections  6 marks).

Criterion A (Meaning) assesses how well the meaning of each sense unit has been communicated.

Criterion B (Vocabulary & Grammar) assesses how correctly vocabulary and grammar have been
rendered in relation to each sense unit. The term “grammar” here includes syntax and accidence.

As a guideline, criterion A tends to look at the translation as a whole (eg stylistic, literal and idiomatic
meanings conveyed), while criterion B tends to assess the conformity of the single section with the
original text (eg grammatical accuracy of translation, apparent understanding of source language syntax
and vocabulary).

While it may not always be possible to give the full range of marks for a single sense unit, the range of
marks necessary for differentiation is present over the whole exam.

By way of example, the marking of different translations of the sense unit οὐ θαυμάζω ὅτι μὲν ὀργίζεσθε,
ὦ ἄνδρες στρατιῶται found in a Xenophon passage (SL specimen papers), would be as follows:
 “I am not surprised that you are angry, o soldiers”: A=3, B=3.
 “I am not surprised there is anger, o citizen men”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially
   communicated; errors impair the translation), B=3.
 “We are not surprised that you would become angry, o soldiers”: A=3, B=2 (some vocabulary and
   grammar are rendered appropriately).
 “Anger is among you, soldiers, and I would be unsurprised”: A=2 (the meaning has been partially
   communicated), B=1 (limited grammar is rendered accurately).
 “We do not understand why you are so sad, o citizens”: A=1 (the translation conveys some meaning),
   B=1 (limited grammar is rendered accurately).

Square brackets [ ] indicate that the words in the sense unit have been inserted out of the order of the
text.

                                   sense unit?
