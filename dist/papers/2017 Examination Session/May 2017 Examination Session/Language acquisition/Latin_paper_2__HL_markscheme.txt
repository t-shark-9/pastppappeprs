Option A: Vergil

Extract 1      Vergil, Georgics 4.315–332

1.   (a)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not
            been communicated adequately, and vocabulary and grammar are not rendered adequately.
            Award [0] if the work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     (b)    Mark only for length of syllables. Allow any quantity (anceps, macron or breve) for the final
            syllable of the line. Award [1] per line if all correct; [0] otherwise.

     (c)    Thymbraeus is derived from Thymbra (accept recognisable misspellings but not Thymbrus or
            the like) [1]; award [1] for a further specific reference, eg a town in the Troas; where a
            temple/oracle of Apollo stands; Achilles was wounded there, etc.

     (d)    Award [1] each up to [3] for any point, with quotation from the extract, such as:
            • the new practice of bugonia evokes the theme of rebirth (of the bees and of the
              beekeeper’s fortunes (hanc artem, nova experientia)
            • the death of the bees is parallel to the “death” of Aristaeus and of Orpheus/Aristaeus’
              bees have died (amissis … apibus/morboque fameque)
            • the idea of apotheosis (caelum sperare)
            • Aristaeus demands destruction of fruitful trees (felices erue silvas,)
            • Aristaeus demands destruction of specified farm goods or animal farming (fer stabulis
              ignem).
            • Aristaeus demands destruction of specified vegetable crops (interfice messes/ure sata/in
              vites molire bipennem). (These three examples are alternatives and count as a single
              point. The element specified must match the quoted Latin.)
            • work is the counterpart for the death/loss fated for mortal creatures (vitae mortalis
              honorem)
            • other answers on their merits.

                                                                                                 Total: [10]
                                                    –5–                   M17/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Option A: Vergil

Extract 2      Vergil, Aeneid 1.234–249

2.   (a)    contraria fata refers to the fall of Troy or the future/rise of Rome [1]; eadem fortuna refers to
            the misfortune (or similar, but must have a negative connotation) of the Trojan
            survivors/Aeneas (and his companions), etc [1]. A gross error invalidates the point, eg Troy
            has fallen, contrary to the fates (contraria fata)

     (b)    Award [1] for a correct location of the Timavus river such as: it flows into the Adriatic/gulf of
            Trieste/Venice; in Illyricum/Illyria/Histria; between Italy and Slovenia (accept Croatia);
            northern Italy. Do not accept the Mediterranean Sea or references to regna Liburnorum.
            Award [1] for the correct explanation of montis as: this is an underground river and thus it
            flows from a rock/mountains (into the sea) or the river emerges from the rocks/cliffs or
            similar. The river(s) must be understood to emerge from (proruptum) and not merely to flow
            down the side of the mons.

     (c)    Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
            argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the
            following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3-4 developed points; [1] if the argument
            is supported by 1-2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points
            or if no details from the text are given.

            Points may include:

            • emphatic positioning of certe and pollicitus to reflect feeling of betrayal
            • anaphora/repetition in initial question: hinc … hinc to reflect emotional
              shouting/haranguing
            • anaphora/repetition of qui mare, qui terras or contrast of mare and terras to reflect the
              universal extent of what was promised but is now apparently denied
            • anastrophe in quae te … sententia vertit? to reflect a distraught state of mind
            • Repeated/accusatory questioning (quae … vertit? quem … laborum?) to reflect angry
              insistence on a justification for Jupiter’s conduct (Do not accept rhetorical questions.)
            • words denoting Jupiter’s fatherhood/authority (genitor, rex magne) to draw attention to the
              perfidy of his betrayal
            • synonymy of occasum … ruinas to reflect the extent of her suffering
            • contrast of this with hoc (pronominal in emphatic position) to reflect how she has been
              cheated of her only consolation
            • solabar (enjambed, before caesura, imperfect tense) to reflect that she has lost her only
              consolation
            • polyptoton of fatis and fata to reflect a fair deal faithlessly violated
            • the metaphor of rependens also reflects a fair deal faithlessly violated
            • comparison/paradigma of Antenor (with supporting Latin) surviving the war and his new
              life: any instance of Antenor’s adventures mentioned here compared or contrasted with
              specific adventures of Aeneas, whether taken from the prescribed Latin text or elsewhere
              in the Aeneid
            • alliteration of /p/ in proruptum et pelago premit to reflect spluttering and envious rage
            • polysyndeton/enjambment in locavit … et … dedit … armaque fixit Teucrorum to reflect
              the contrast of Antenor’s success with Aeneas’s tribulation
            • alliteration of /p/ and /k/ in placida compostus pace quiescit to reflect either Antenor’s
              peace or Venus’s resentment of it or pleonasm of placida pace
            • vivid description of places: Illyricos … sinus; intima … regna Liburnorum; the entire
              description of Timavus.

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

Option B: History

Extract 3      Suetonius, Tiberius 34–35

3.   (a)    Award [1] for a relevant analysis, such as Tiberius sought to return to more old fashioned
            public moral behaviours; and [1] up to [2] for each example with quotation of the Latin text
            such as: Tiberius aimed to curb public demonstrations of affection or to avoid the spread of
            disease (cotidiana oscula prohibuit); Tiberius aimed to curb public demonstrations of
            affection (cotidiana oscula prohibuit); to discourage extravagant public giving (strenarum
            commercium); beyond the appropriate time (ne ultra Kal. Ian. exerceretur); to return moral
            control of publically disgraced women to their families (matronas prostratae pudicitiae…).
            Accept claims that Tiberius wished to curb public demonstrations of affection (cotidiana
            oscula prohibuit).

     (b)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not
            been communicated adequately, and vocabulary and grammar are not rendered adequately.
            Award [0] if the work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     (c)    Women gave up their rank and/or publicly declared status as prostitutes (to avoid
            punishment for adultery) [1]; men subjected themselves to some infamous sentence by their
            own initiative or managed to get degraded [1].

     (d)    “sortitio” is an appointment by lot [1]; in this context to determine the provincia or sphere of
            duty (it refers to a subsequent political appointment) [1].

                                                                                                   Total: [10]
                                                   –7–                  M17/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Option B: History

Extract 4      Tacitus, Annals 2.83

4.   (a)    Carmen Saliare was an archaic hymn; sung by the Salii/Salian priests; as they
            danced/capered/leapt; related to the cult of Mars/Quirinus [1] (not: praised certain members
            of the imperial family); the sacerdotes (or sodales) Augustales were an order of priests
            instituted to oversee the cult of Augustus or were priests of Augustus [1].

     (b)    The oak crown was traditionally awarded for saving the life of a Roman citizen [1]. The
            implication is that Germanicus had contributed to saving/the safety of the state/its citizens
            [1].

     (c)    Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
            argument. Alternatively, accept examples of the magnitude of an honour [1] contrasted with
            an example of honour diminished/forgotten [1]. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and
            clarity of the argument using the following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3-4
            developed points; [1] if the argument is supported by 1-2 developed points; [0] if the
            argument is supported by no developed points or if no details from the text are given.
            Points may include:
            • contrast (chiastic with variatio) of motivations for the honours: amore in Germanicum aut
                ingenio validus
            • old as well as new honours were decreed: reperti decretique (with further relevant
                examples)
            • three arches are listed with polysyndeton (arcus … Amano) to create an impression that
                the number was excessive
            • ambiguity about real background of Germanicus’s death: mortem ob rem publicam obisse
            • the hyperbole/litotes in haud facile quis numerum inierit is an implicit criticism of an
                excessive cult
            • Tiberius was less enthusiastic than some to honour Germanicus: he reduced the honour
                of the clipeus : (solitum / paremque ceteris dicaturum, or similar) and was firm in his
                insistence on restraint (anastrophe in adseveravit Tiberius)
            • Tiberius is portrayed as altogether stingy, wishing to allow no more than the minimum
                (satis inlustre)
            • even at the time some of the honours were either seen as excessive or not really heartfelt
                (statim omissa sunt) and their popularity/effectiveness was not longlasting (vetustas
                oblitteravit)

                                                                                                  Total: [10]
                                                    –8–                  M17/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Option C: Love poetry

Extract 5      Tibullus, Elegies 3.2.1–14

5.   (a)    Award [1] each up to [3] for relevant examples of the poet’s feelings with supporting
            quotation, such as: separating lovers is cruel (qui … fuit); the lover’s complaint of suffering
            from separation (durus … qui potuit / non ego firmus in hoc); the lover being heartbroken
            (frangit corda dolor); the lover’s loss of shame (nec mihi … pudor est); the lover’s fantasising
            about death (cum fuero mutatus in umbram / cum ossa favilla teget); and about others’ grief
            at his death (fleat ante meum Neaera rogum). Accept answers based on stylistic analysis if
            their content is relevant to the question, eg the graphic image of eripuit understood in its
            literal sense; repetition of dolor(em) represents the intense grief/pain felt by separated lovers.

     (b)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not
            been communicated adequately, and vocabulary and grammar are not rendered adequately.
            Award [0] if the work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     (c)    Mark only for length of syllables. Allow any quantity (anceps, macron or breve) for the final
            syllable of the line. Award [1] per line if all correct; [0] otherwise.

     (d)    Award [1] for a figure of speech (supported by a quote) and [1] for a valid analysis. Except
            in the case of an alliteration where the effect relies exclusively on the phonetic feature, some
            indication that the meaning of the quoted Latin has been understood is necessary before
            awarding the first mark. Points may include:
            • the repetition/parallel word order/enjambment in lines 1–2 to stress individual choice of life
            • the polyptoton of caram and carum to reflect the lovers’ close bond / equal affection
            • dissonance/repetition of d-/f- sounds in lines 2–3 to highlight the harshness of the man
                who would be an obstacle to love
            • the anaphora of non in line 5 to emphasise the strong denial of the lover’s strength/strong
                admission of his weakeness
            • juxtaposition of frangit fortia (corda dolor) in line 6 to highlight the surpassing power of
                pain (the whole clause could be a sententia but accept only if interpreted as a generalising
                statement, not as a report of the poet’s feelings in the circumstances)
            • the litotes of nec mihi … pudor est in line 7 to draw attention to the lover’s open admission
            • (diction) use of tenuis and favilla to stress the reduction in death
            • the chiasmus of meum maesta Neaera rogum in line 12 reflects the poet’s savouring of
                the pathetic scene that he imagines
            • alliteration of m- sounds in line 12 to stress the mournful scene
            • the anaphora/repetition of maereat in line 14 to express the contrast between the two
                different kinds of mourning or to highlight the sadness at his death
            • Accept the contrast/parallel word order of candidaque ossa and nigra favilla (but only if
                supported by a suitable analysis of the effect).

                                                                                                   Total: [10]
                                                   –9–                  M17/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Option C: Love poetry

Extract 6      Propertius, Elegies 2.17

6.   (a)    In the past she accepted and returned his love [1] but now spurns him [1]. Other answers
            may focus on stylistic aspects, such as the juxtaposition modo … nunc, or the contrast
            between the envy for his love and the misery of his current situation, and how she is
            accountable for this; or how he changes from self-pity/feeling sorry for himself as a result of
            his exclusion to annoyance at her attitude and a preference for suicide.

     (b)    Mark only for length of syllables. Allow any quantity (anceps, macron or breve) for the final
            syllable of the line. Award [1] per line if all correct; [0] otherwise.

     (c)    Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
            argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the
            following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3-4 developed points; [1] if the argument
            is supported by 1-2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points
            or if no details from the text are given.
            Points may include:

Extract 7      Catullus, Carmina 64.60–75

7.   (a)    This question seeks to assess knowledge of conventional poetic imagery and is not
            principally a style question. Award [1] up to [3] for each supported point such as: her eyes

            mitram); her clothing is ripped/dishevelled (non contecta … amictu); her breast is bare (non
            vincta papillas); she is unheeding of her clothing (omnia … adludebant); she is called misera,
            a term used typically of distressed lovers. Accept apostrophe to Theseus (Theseu) unless it
            is attributed to Ariadne.

     (b)    Mark only for length of syllables. Allow any quantity (anceps, macron or breve) for the final
            syllable of the line. Award [1] per line if all correct; [0] otherwise.

     (c)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not

            [1]. Or: it refers to Eryx, a place [1] associated with Venus [1]. It must be clear that Eryx is a
            place, not a person, and that there is a link between Venus and Eryx.

            Greece/between Greece and Italy/near Ithaca/Cephalonia [1]; other specific geographic
            references accepted on their merits. Accept the Adriatic but not the Mediterranean or Greece
            or near Dulichium/Samos or part of the kingdom of Ulysses. A gross contradiction invalidates
            the mark, eg ‘west of Greece, in the Aegean’.

            following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3-4 developed points; [1] if the argument
            is supported by 1-2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points
            or if no details from the text are given.
            Points may include:
             • she feels surrounded by suitors from everywhere (Dulichii, Samii, Zacynthos: triple list; in
                 me is surrounded by turba luxuriosa)
             • the suitors are too numerous: turba; Pisandrum…alios: list with polysyndeton)
             • contrast between the many suitors (with relevant Latin) and her (singular me)
             • she feels assailed (ruunt: hyperbole)
             • the suitors have as much power as kings (regnant)
             • the suitors are unchecked/out of control (nullis prohibentibus)

             • word choice (dilacerantur)
             • the household’s resources are depleted (a variety of quotations may be used)
             • the rhetorical question (quid…?) shows Penelope as feeling that trying to carry on is
                 pointless
             • enjambment (absens ipse) highlights her loneliness
             • her male help is too old or too young (senex … puer)
             • Number of suitors contrasted with the reduced number of the faithful (tres, emphasised by
                 its prominent position and its separation from numero)
             • the tricolon of uxor senex puer highlights the weakness of Penelope / the party loyal to
                 Odysseus
             • she cannot stop the plots against Telemachus (per insidias paene … ademptus)
             • Penelope is driven to invoke the gods for help (di, precor)
             • anaphora/repetition to stress Penelope’s invocation to the gods (ille.
             • Accept comments that the suitors are depraved (luxuriosa, avidas) as these qualities
                 would make Penelope feel more assailed.

Extract 9      Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 1.72–86

9.   (a)    Award [1] each up to [3] for different figures of speech (supported by a quote and with
            relevant analysis). Except in the case of an alliteration where the effect relies exclusively on
            the phonetic feature, some indication that the meaning of the quoted Latin has been
            understood is necessary before awarding the mark. Points may include:
            • alliteration of /v/ (vivida vis) stresses the power of the spirit
            • assonance/alliteration (flammantia moenia mundi) highlights the boundaries of the visible
               world
            • anaphora/polyptoton quid … qua emphasises the centrality of reason
            • the graphic image of pedibus opteritur show the complete defeat of religio
            • the chiastic arrangement of rationis inire elementa viamque indugredi sceleris acts as a
               heading to highlight the argument that he now intends to disprove
            • the metaphorical viam indugredi portrays philosophy as either a dangerous route or a
               gradual process
            • synonymy (mente animoque; scelerosa atque impia facta) stresses the opposition of ratio
               and religio
            • the enjambment of illa religio conveys the author’s sarcastic deference towards religio
            • virginis is contrasted with turparunt foede: purity and innocence versus wicked superstition
            • alliteration of /d/ in ductores Danaum: confident fanatics
            • Accept also the enjambment of aram Iphianassai if its effect is sufficiently explained.

     (b)    Mark only for length of syllables. Allow any quantity (anceps, macron or breve) for the final
            syllable of the line. Award [1] per line if all correct; [0] otherwise.

     (c)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are

Extract 10      Seneca, Epistulae Morales 16.3–4

10.   (a)    artificium may simply refer to dialectic [1] and ostentatio to rhetoric [1], but accept any
             explanation that sets the terms populare, artificium and ostentationi in an appropriate
             philosophical, historical or cultural context, eg with a reference to Cynicism, “popular”
             Stoicism, scholastic dialectic or display oratory, philosophy as entertainment for the dilettanti,
             social posing as philosophers (eg with Greek pallia and beards…).

      (b)    (Pre)determined events cannot be changed [1]; chance events cannot be foreseen/there can
             be no preparation against chance events [1]. Also accept more or less literal translations of
             the last sentence (“God decides for me”; “chance does not allow me to take any decision”),
             but not generic references to the existence of fate or the rule of god or chance.

      (c)    Accept a range of substantiated answers that help stress Seneca’s points about the nature,
             influence and necessity of philosophy, but also the fictitious opponent’s arguments, awarding
             [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence
             and clarity of the argument using the following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3-4
             developed points; [1] if the argument is supported by 1-2 developed points; [0] if the
             argument is supported by no developed points or if no details from the text are given.
             Points may include:
              • epigrammatic/contrasting statements stress the points of the argument by focusing
                 attention on the second element (non in verbis sed in rebus est: the influence of
                 philosophy on conduct)
              • asyndeton/parallelism emphasizes the listing of evidence in support of statements (ut
                 consumatur dies, ut dematur nausia)
              • use of vocabulary related to forging and making to illustrate the concrete benefits of
                 philosophical studies (format, fabricat)
              • alliteration of /f/ and synonymy in format and fabricat draws attention to the influence of
                 philosophy on its students
              • personification/list of what philosophy does (format, fabricat, disponot, regit, demonstrat,
                 sedet) also shows philosophy’s influence on its students
              • seafaring metaphors: nausia (literally sea-sickness); sedet ad gubernaculum; per ancipitia
                 fluctuantium; derigit cursum.
              • anaphora/repetition of nemo shows the very necessity of philosophy
              • the creation of a fictitious opponent to test his argument (dicet aliquis)
              • use of rising tricolon with anaphora for questions emphasizes importance of the questions
                 raised or the accumulation of ‘facts’ adduced against philosophy (quid … quid…quid)
              • the chiasmus of certa …potest … possunt … incerta seeks to show that philosophy is
                 equally pointless in both circumstances
              • parallel word choice highlights the non-existence of free will (aut…aut…; meum
                 consilium/meo consilio)
              • word choice/diction stresses “uncertainty” of life as a critical concern (innumerabilia
                 accidunt; casus imperat; nihil praeparari adversus incerta).
              • Accept the use of gerundives (agenda, omittenda, petendum) to highlight the magisterial
                 tone of the passage.
