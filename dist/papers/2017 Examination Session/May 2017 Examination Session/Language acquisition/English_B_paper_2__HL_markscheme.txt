Criterion A: Language

• How effectively and accurately does the student use language?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           Command of the language is limited and generally ineffective.
   1–2     A limited range of vocabulary is used, with many basic errors.
           Simple sentence structures are sometimes clear.
           Command of the language is generally adequate, despite many inaccuracies.
   3–4     A fairly limited range of vocabulary is used, with many errors.
           Simple sentence structures are usually clear.
           Command of the language is effective, despite some inaccuracies.
   5–6     A range of vocabulary is used accurately, with some errors.
           Simple sentence structures are clear.
           Command of the language is good and effective.
   7–8     A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately, with few significant errors.
           Some complex sentence structures are clear and effective.
           Command of the language is very effective.
   9–10    A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and effectively, with very few errors.
           Complex sentence structures are clear and effective.


Clarification

Word count
At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in section A and 150 words in
section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in section A or 250 words in section B:
the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.

Clarification

Word count
At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in section A and 150 words in
section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in section A or 250 words in section B:
the whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.

6.      The more we connect through social media, the more we disconnect from each other.

           • addresses little or not at all the central issue of how social media affects our
             communication with each other
           • provides little or no explanation of what “communication” (ie ‘connecting /
             disconnecting’) is taken to mean. Related ideas, such as sharing news, going out
             together, enjoying other people’s company and the like, are not clearly connected to
     3–4     the main idea of ‘connecting / disconnecting’ through social media
           • presents an incoherent view of the statement: whether agreeing or disagreeing, or
             considering pros and cons of both sides
           • provides reasons for the viewpoint that are not explained or supported
           • links arguments poorly or not at all.
           • addresses vaguely the central issue of how social media affects our communication
             with each other
           • provides a limited or unclear explanation of what “communication” (ie ‘connecting /
             disconnecting’) is taken to mean. Related ideas, such as sharing news, going out
             together, enjoying other people’s company and the like, are not always connected to
     5–6     the main idea of ‘connecting / disconnecting’ through social media
           • presents a somewhat confused view of the statement: whether agreeing or
             disagreeing, or considering pros and cons of both sides
           • provides reasons for the viewpoint that are not very well explained or supported
           • links arguments at times, but not always clearly.
           • addresses to some extent the central issue of how social media affects our
             communication with each other
           • provides a fairly coherent explanation of what “communication” (ie ‘connecting /
             disconnecting’) is taken to mean. Related ideas, such as sharing news, going out
             together, enjoying other people’s company and the like, are connected loosely to the
     7–8     main idea of ‘connecting / disconnecting’ through social media
           • presents a fairly clear view of the statement: whether agreeing or disagreeing, or
             considering pros and cons of both sides
           • provides reasons for the viewpoint that are explained and supported to some extent
           • links arguments quite clearly.
          • addresses directly the central issue of how social media affects our communication
            with each other
          • provides a coherent explanation of what “communication” (ie ‘connecting /
            disconnecting’) is taken to mean. Related ideas, such as sharing news, going out
            together, enjoying other people’s company and the like, are explicitly connected to the
     9–10   main idea of ‘connecting / disconnecting’ through social media
          • presents a clear and coherent view of the statement: whether agreeing or disagreeing,
            or considering pros and cons of both sides
          • provides reasons for the viewpoint that are clearly explained and well-supported
          • links arguments clearly and effectively.
