         Using Poetry to Explore Family History
                                         Benjamin Gott, 2014


         As a sixth-grade teacher, I often find that my spring parent-teacher conferences
         begin with the same answer to my first question: “So: how does Kevin think things
         are going this term?” I will ask. “We don’t know,” Kevin’s parents will say. “He never
         talks to us anymore!”

 5       Anyone who interacts with middle school students on a regular basis knows the
         familiar answer to the question “How was your day?” is usually some combination
         of “Fine!” and “Whatever!” As these young men and women experiment with their
         desire for independence, they often create distance between themselves and their
         families—sometimes a crack, sometimes a chasm.

10       The weekend after my conferences ended, I puzzled over the ways in which I,
         an English teacher, could try to bridge this communication gap through a writing
         assignment. I realized that one of the benefits of conversations with our family
         members is that they allow us access to stories about our past. I later came to
         realize that the only way to pass on meaningful pieces of family history was through
15       conversations—the same conversations that my students’ parents said were lacking
         in their lives.

         A few weeks after our conferences, I introduced a new poetry assignment:
         the “family history” poem.

         The following week, the final versions of the poems began to roll in. I had no idea
20       what to expect although I had heard from several parents that the assignment had
         led to lively discussions and the sharing of stories that ranged from humorous to
         tragic. I was not prepared for the sheer power of the poetry I was about to read.
                                                 –7–                M17/2/ABENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T


          All of the family history
          poems were astonishing.            Family History Poem Assignment
25        Not only was each student
          able to explore a meaningful       •   Sometime over the next few days sit down

          devices so that the students will have more tools in their writers’ toolkits when they
          sit down to write their poems. It is my hope that this assignment gives my students
45        a deeper, more meaningful appreciation of the art of poetry while it illuminates the
          ways in which their families—and their families’ stories—can help them become the
          confident, capable, and connected young men and women they are striving to be.

         Educating across nations for a brighter future
         OUR MISSION
         Give Hope, Fight Poverty (GHFP) is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to
         foster philanthropy domestically by designing service-learning programs that engage
         US students and professionals with rural communities in Swaziland, Africa, and work
 5       together to educate, empower and lift orphaned and vulnerable children – particularly
         those living in child-headed households – out of poverty.

         OUR SERVICE-LEARNING IN SWAZILAND
         Whether you are a professional or a student, GHFP invites you to join a team on a
         journey to Swaziland in Africa to learn about unknown cultures, and dedicate your time,
10       skills, and labor to a community of orphaned children struggling with poverty,
         HIV/AIDS, and illiteracy. These trips are tailored to meet the needs of the local Africans
         while remaining mindful of your skills and expertise: education, engineering, healthcare,
         counseling, and art and design.

         This journey will offer:
15       –     immersion in rural villages ravaged by HIV/AIDS, poverty, and illiteracy.
         –     an opportunity to become engaged with a very different culture, thereby
               encouraging the development of cultural competence.
         –     interaction with children who are dealing with the grief of losing their parents
               while, oftentimes, also dealing with the burden of raising their younger brothers
20             and sisters.
         –     a means of experiencing the dramatic beauty of a country that has not been affected
               by pollution and industrialization.
         –     an opportunity to teach at rural, impoverished, and poorly resourced primary and
               secondary schools.
25       –     hands-on experiences at clinics, orphanages, and much more.

         UPCOMING EVENTS IN THE US… YOU’RE INVITED!
         –  November 6th: “Experience Hope” art and photo exhibition, at Athenaeum
            ArtSpace in Indianapolis from 6pm–9pm
         –  January 17th: HamBINGO at Hamburger Mary’s in Chicago from 8pm–9:30pm

30       OTHER WAYS TO GET INVOLVED DOMESTICALLY
         Invite GHFP to speak at your school or community event

         Help us spread the word!! Invite a GHFP staff member or volunteer to speak at your
         school, or community event. This event can be designed as an information booth/
         session or a structured lecture on global health and how you can get involved.
                                             – 11 –             M17/2/ABENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T


35   Host a “Painting for a Purpose” event

     A “Painting for a Purpose” party is a great way
     to help GHFP spread the word and have fun in
     the process! Art teachers will bring all of the
     supplies necessary for you and your friends to
40   paint “masterpieces” (no artistic skills required!).
     Each participant will paint either a canvas for an
     orphan or a piece of a mural that will be hung in
     our school classrooms in Swaziland! This event
     requires a donation of $25 per person and is
45   currently only available in some cities in the United States.

     Coordinate a donation drive

     Join efforts at school, or work to organize a donation drive for the orphans!
     Donations are always needed and will be collected prior to each international mission.
     On behalf of our orphans, GHFP would be thrilled to receive any school items, such as
50   backpacks and art supplies.
