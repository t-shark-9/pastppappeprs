Text A




                                           Three interlocking worlds.
                                      Ten characters looking for answers.
                                    But who controls the future – or the past?




             In the basement of a professor’s house in Oxford, fifteen-year-old Rosie goes in
      5      search of a missing cat – and instead finds herself in a different world.

             Anterwold is a sun-drenched land of storytellers, prophecies and rituals. But is this
             world real – and what happens if she decides to stay?

             Meanwhile, in a sterile laboratory, a rebellious scientist is trying to prove that time
             does not even exist – with potentially devastating consequences.

20                     Q&A WITH IAIN PEARS ABOUT ARCADIA
     Arcadia is being released simultaneously as an app, a hardback and an ebook.
     Can you describe what the differences will be for readers between the three
     formats?


     The main difference is between the app and the other versions. The app is considerably
25   longer as a large amount of text had to be cut out to create a linear narrative which made
     sense. The app offers the reader the chance to fashion the narrative according to taste; a
     reader can begin with any tale, read all or part of it before switching to another, and can
     leave out sections which do not appeal. The idea is that they can approach the story in the
     most comfortable way, rather than having a structure decided for them by the author. This
30   can’t be done in the novel version which is essentially one person’s choice (mine) of how
     to read it.

                  The Famous Five

                  The Famous Five are among Enid Blyton’s1
                  best-loved creations and countless children have
                  gone adventuring with them since the publication of
                  Five on a Treasure Island in 1942, the first of twenty-
             5    one full-length adventures and numerous short
                  stories.

                                          Armed with maps, torches, packets of sandwiches
                                          and a plentiful supply of ginger-beer, Julian, Dick,
                                          Anne, their tomboy cousin George (Georgina by
             10                           rights) and Timmy the dog like nothing better than to
                                          spend their holidays hiking and biking, camping and
                                          exploring by themselves, invariably falling
                                          into adventure.

                                          Friends like Jo the gypsy girl,
             15                           young Tinker Hayling, Sooty
                   Lenoir, and even George’s scientist father (Uncle
                  Quentin to the others), often get caught up in the
         2        strange goings-on too.

                And what thrilling places they visit and discover — Kirrin Island, Smuggler’s
             20 Top, Owl’s Dene, the lighthouse at Demon’s Rocks and farms, castles,
                caves and secret passages galore.

                  Whether they’re outwitting thieves, smugglers or kidnappers, seeking hidden
                  treasure or encountering spook trains, the Five’s courage and determination
                  always wins through!

             25                                 Enid Blyton’s original books were charmingly
                                                illustrated by Eileen Soper but there have been
                                                numerous interpretations and adaptations
                                                of the Famous Five over the years including
                                                continuation novels written by French author
             30                                 Claude Voilier, cinema films, stage plays, two
                                                television series and, more recently, a Disney
                                                cartoon series featuring the children of the
                                                Famous Five.

                              However, the twenty-one original
                        35    books have never been out of
                              print and remain popular with

            Happiest people in the world

            Japan may have a relatively high standard of living and the longest
            life expectancy in the world, but it does not have the happiest
            people. According to a new Gallup Poll of 148 countries, Japan
            ranks somewhere in the middle of world happiness levels.
      5     The recent poll showed just how little economic levels connect with
            life satisfaction.

            Latin American countries with relatively low levels of economic
            development dominated the top 10 happiest countries.
            In Asia, only Thailand and the Philippines, with economic levels
     10     significantly lower than Japan’s, broke into the top 10.
            Panama ranked No. 1 followed by, in order, Paraguay, El Salvador,
            Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand, Guatemala, the
            Philippines, Ecuador and Costa Rica.

            The worldwide poll found that happiness was only indirectly connected to material-centered
     15     lifestyles. Canada has the highest college graduation levels, Qatar the highest income,
            Germany and France relatively high income and long vacation time, but none of these countries
            made the top 10.

            In contrast, Italy and Greece, with their debt-ridden economies, were in the top 20.
            Guatemala’s civil war and gang violence did not keep it from reaching seventh place.

     20     These paradoxes of happiness certainly come in part from cultural factors such as the tendency
            of some cultures, Japan’s for example, to refrain from open expression of positive emotions.
            However, they also point toward a new view of economics.

            In a study by Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, slightly
            different criteria placed wealthier countries like Denmark, Finland and Norway in
     25     higher positions.

            Because of these discrepancies, happiness may appear to be a subjective, intangible quality
            that is hard to define and harder to measure. However, happiness remains one of the most
            meaningful and deeply felt life experiences and has become an important new way of finding
            economic priorities.
                                                 –7–                   M17/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

   30   The growing field of such studies has established happiness as a new measurement with
        important implications for individuals and policymakers alike. Japan’s newly elected leaders
        should take note that the past emphasis on economic growth and material gains is out of date.
        New measures of happiness, such as Bhutan’s well-known Gross National Happiness concept*,
        are growing in importance and need to be included in government initiatives.

   35   Like Singapore, last on the Gallup Poll, Japan’s relatively high economic level has been
        achieved through high pressure, tight schedules and a work-life balance tipped very far
        toward work.

        What most Latin American interviewees cited as the source of their daily happiness — taking
        pleasure in friends, family, nature and religion — have been neglected in many economically
   40   developed countries by striving for material comforts.

        As a new government ponders Japan’s future, it should be clear that higher income, without
        other types of nonmaterial gains, means very little.

        […]

        Decisions about economic policy and social change should incorporate the findings of the
        aforementioned studies and focus on nonmaterial improvements to Japanese life.

   45   Instead of continuing to focus on numerical economic growth by exploiting ever more resources,
        both human and natural, other issues should be given greater consideration.

        […]

        The government can also focus on the enrichment of community, family life, education and
        leisure pursuits. Those issues should no longer be considered exclusively as individual
        choices or consumer options, but an essential and basic part of what government supports for
   50   its citizens.

                                         From the Japan Times, 6 January 2013. Used with permission.



* Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness concept: The concept implies that
  sustainable development should take a holistic approach towards notions of
  progress and give equal importance to non-economic aspects of wellbeing.

          In the summer of 1902, the American author Jack London documented his first-hand experience
          of the life of the urban poor in London, England.

          My first impression of East London was naturally a general one. Later the details began to
          appear, and here and there in the chaos of misery I found little spots where a fair measure of
          happiness reigned – sometimes whole rows of houses in little out-of-the-way streets, where
          artisans1 dwell and where a rude sort of family life obtains. In the evenings the men can be
     5    seen at the doors, pipes in their mouths and children on their knees, wives gossiping, and
          laughter and fun going on. The content2 of these people is manifestly great, for, relative to the
          wretchedness that encompasses them, they are well off.

          But at the best, it is a dull, animal happiness, the content of the full belly. The dominant note of
          their lives is materialistic. They are stupid and heavy, without imagination. The Abyss3 seems
    10    to exude a stupefying atmosphere of torpor4, which wraps them about and deadens them.
          Religion passes them by. The Unseen holds for them neither terror nor delight. They are
          unaware of the Unseen; and the full belly and the evening pipe […] is all they demand, or dream
          of demanding, from existence.

          This would not be so bad if it were all; but it is not all. The satisfied torpor in which they are
    15    sunk is the deadly inertia that precedes dissolution. There is no progress, and with them not to
          progress is to fall back and into the Abyss. In their own lives they may only start to fall, leaving
          the fall to be completed by their children and their children’s children. Man always gets less
          than he demands from life; and so little do they demand, that the less than little they get cannot
          save them.

    20    At the best, city life is an unnatural life for the human; but the city life of London is so utterly
          unnatural that the average workman or workwoman cannot stand it. Mind and body are
          sapped5 by the undermining influences ceaselessly at work. Moral and physical stamina are
          broken, and the good workman, fresh from the soil, becomes in the first city generation a poor
          workman; and by the second city generation, devoid of push and go and initiative, and actually
    25    unable physically to perform the labour his father did, he is well on the way to the shambles at
          the bottom of the Abyss.
