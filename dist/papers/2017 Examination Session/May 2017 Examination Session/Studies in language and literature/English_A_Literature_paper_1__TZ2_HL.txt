Write a literary commentary on one of the following:

1.
          In Bermondsey the shop windows were dusty. When you put your face close and peered,
          you saw old flypapers, pale cuts of meat, powdery cakes, strings of onions flaking onto
          yellowing newsprint. In the Highway the shops were full of birds. Cage upon cage piled high,
          each full of clustering creatures like sparrows but bright as sweets, red and black, white and
      5   yellow, purple and green, and some as gently lavender as the veins on a baby’s head.  It took
          the breath away to see them so crowded, each wing crushed against its fellows on either side.
          In the Highway green parakeets perched upon lamp posts.  Cakes and tarts shone like jewels,
          tier on tier behind high glass windows.  A black man with gold teeth and white eyes carried a
          snake around his neck.
     10         How could I know what was possible and what was not?  And when the impossible in all its
          beauty came walking towards me down the very middle of Ratcliffe Highway, why would I know
          how to behave?
                Of course, I’d seen a cat before. You couldn’t sleep for them in Bermondsey, creeping
          about over the roofs and wailing like devils.  They lived in packs, spiky, wild-eyed, stalking the
     15   wooden walkways and bridges, fighting with the rats.  But this cat…
                The Sun himself came down and walked on earth.
                Just as the birds of Bermondsey were small and brown, and those of my new home were
          large and rainbow-hued, so it seemed the cats of Ratcliffe Highway must be an altogether
          superior breed to our scrawny south-of-the-river mogs*.  This cat was the size of a small horse,
     20   solid, massively chested, rippling powerfully about the shoulders. He was gold, and the
          pattern painted so carefully all over him, so utterly perfect, was the blackest black in the world.  
          His paws were the size of footstools, his chest snow white.
                I’d seen him somewhere, his picture in a poster in London Street, over the river.  He was
          jumping through a ring of fire and his mouth was open.  A mythical beast.
     25         I have no recall of one foot in front of the other, cobblestones under my feet. He drew me
          like honey draws a wasp.  I had no fear.  I came before the godly indifference of his face and
          looked into his clear yellow eyes.  His nose was a slope of downy gold, his nostrils pink and
          moist as a pup’s.  He raised his thick, white dotted lips and smiled, and his whiskers bloomed.
                I became aware of my heart somewhere too high up, beating as if it was a little fist trying
     30   to get out.
                Nothing in the world could have prevented me from lifting my hand and stroking the broad
          warm nap of his nose. Even now I feel how beautiful that touch was. Nothing had ever been
          so soft and clean. A ripple ran through his right shoulder as he raised his paw – bigger than my
          head – and lazily knocked me off my feet.  It was like being felled by a cushion.  I hit the ground
     35   but was not much hurt, only winded, and after that it was a dream.  There was, I remember,
          much screaming and shouting, but from a distance, as if I was sinking underwater.  The world
          turned upside down and went by me in a bright stream, the ground moved under me, my hair
          hung in my eyes.  There was a kind of joy in me, I do know that – and nothing that could go by
          the name of fear, only a wildness.  I was in his jaws.  His breath burned the back of my neck.  
     40   My bare toes trailed, hurting distantly. I could see his feet, tawny orange with white toes, pacing
          the ground away, gentle as feathers.

                                                     Blaze

                             The unfunny irony of it became a family joke:
                             how she’d stood gossiping at the door with
                             – of all people at that fatal moment –
                             the insurance man.

                         5   Beyond the Providential1 shoulder
                             half her attention’s on her white border:
                             cool blooms, shades of everything cold.
                             She waves to a neighbour sailing out with her pram.
                             Behind her, the dull safety of the house,
                       10    the half-known caverns of her children’s bedrooms.

                             She chats, smiles at nothing much,
                             until the mordant reek of smoke
                             from the kitchen reaches him, then her.
                             Next, the clutch of panic checking all responses.
                       15    She watches flames run lovingly over everything,
                             brightness, then black, patterning her eyes.

                             What to save for whom.
                             Photographs, toys or letters?
                             She scoops the cat and his one last little life
                       20    from the bathtub upstairs.

                             She tells of the heat, describes the hungry fire
                             to her stony-faced husband,
                             the raging beauty of it, the glorious energy –
                             You should have seen. It was like drowning in light!
                       25    but he finds no excuses for her.
                             Does her survival mean a thing to him?

                             Next day, her children laugh
                             at shapes of melted Tupperware2 and glass.
                             They eat cold meals from the garage freezer
                       30    and whisper their relief.
                             She’s still trembling.
                             Everything in the kitchen’s gone,
                             the treacherous toaster killed.
                             Time for a re-fit.
                       35    Time to re-think her life.
