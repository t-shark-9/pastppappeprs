                 In retrospect, I was fortunate not to be wearing my uniform, stained with Linh’s blood.
          I had shed it in favor of the madras shirt and chinos in my rucksack, but the General, having
          lost his luggage at the airport, still wore his stars on his collar. Outside our barracks and in the
          tent city, few knew who he was by face. What they saw was his uniform and rank, and when he
      5   said hello to the civilians and asked how they were faring, they met him with sullen silence. The
          slight crinkle between his eyes and his hesitant chuckling told me he was confused. My sense
          of unease increased with every step down the dirt lane between the tents, civilian eyes on us
          and the silence unbroken. We had barely walked a hundred meters into the tent city when the
          first assault came, a dainty slipper sailing from our flank and striking the General on his temple.
     10   He froze. I froze. An old woman’s voice croaked out, Look at the hero! We swiveled to the
          left and saw the one thing charging us that could not be defended against, an enraged elderly
          citizen we could neither beat down nor back away from. Where’s my husband? she screamed,
          barefoot, her other slipper in her hand. Why are you here when he’s not? Aren’t you supposed
          to be defending our country with your life like he is?
     15          She smacked the General across the chin with her slipper, and from behind her, from
          the other side, from behind us, the women, young and old, firm and infirm, came with their
          shoes and slippers, their umbrellas and canes, their sun hats and conical hats. Where’s my
          son? Where’s my father? Where’s my brother? The General ducked and flung his arms over
          his head as the furies beat him, tearing at his uniform and his flesh. I was hardly unscathed,
     20   suffering several blows from flying footwear and intercepting several strokes from canes and
          umbrellas. The ladies pressed around me to get at the General, who had sunk to his knees
          under their onslaught. They could hardly be blamed for their ill temper, since our vaunted
          premier had gone on the radio the day before to ask all soldiers and citizens to fight to the
          last man. It was pointless to point out that the premier, who was also the air marshal and who
     25   should not be confused with the president except in his venality* and vanity, had himself left on
          a helicopter shortly after broadcasting his heroic message. Nor would it have helped to explain
          that this general was not in charge of soldiers but the secret police, which would hardly have
          endeared him to civilians. In any case, the ladies were not listening, preferring to scream and
          curse. I pushed my way through the women who had come between the General and myself,
     30   shielding him with my body and absorbing many more whacks and globs of spit until I could
          drag him free. Go! I shouted in his ear, propelling him in the correct direction. For the second
          straight day we ran for our lives, but at least the rest of the people in the tent city left us alone,
          touching us with nothing except contemptuous gazes and catcalls. Good for nothings! Villains!
          Cowards! Bastards!
     35          While I was used to such slings and arrows, the General was not. When we finally
          stopped outside our barracks, the expression on his face was one of horror. He was
          disheveled, the stars torn from his collar, his sleeves ripped, half his buttons gone, and bleeding
          from scratches on his cheek and neck. I can’t go in there like this, he whispered. Wait in the
          showers, sir, I said. I’ll find you some new clothes. I requisitioned a spare shirt and pants from
     40   officers in the barracks, explaining my own bruised and tattered condition as being the result
          of a run-in with our ill-humored competitors in the Military Security Service. When I went to the
          showers, the General was standing at a sink, his face rinsed clean of everything except the
          shame.

                   General—
   45              Shut up! The only person he was looking at was himself in the mirror. We will never
              speak of this again.
                   And we never did.

                                        To my nine-year-old self

                          You must forgive me. Don’t look so surprised,
                          perplexed, and eager to be gone,
                          balancing on your hands or on the tightrope.
                          You would rather run than walk, rather climb than run
                      5   rather leap from a height than anything.

                          I have spoiled this body we once shared.
                          Look at the scars, and watch the way I move,
                          careful of a bad back or a bruised foot.
                          Do you remember how, three minutes after waking
                     10   we’d jump straight out of the ground floor window
                          into the summer morning?

                          That dream we had, no doubt it’s as fresh in your mind
                          as the white paper to write it on.
                          We made a start, but something else came up –
                     15   a baby vole, or a bag of sherbet lemons1 –
                          and besides, that summer of ambition
                          created an ice-lolly2 factory, a wasp trap
                          and a den by the cesspit.

                          I’d like to say that we could be friends
                     20   but the truth is we have nothing in common
                          beyond a few shared years. I won’t keep you then.
                          Time to pick rosehips for tuppence a pound,
                          time to hide down scared lanes
                          from men in cars after girl-children,

                     25   or to lunge out over the water
                          on a rope that swings from that tree
                          long buried in housing –
                          but no, I shan’t cloud your morning. God knows
                          I have fears enough for us both –

                     30   I leave you in an ecstasy of concentration
                          slowly peeling a ripe scab from your knee
                          to taste it on your tongue.
