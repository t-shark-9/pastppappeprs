Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the part 3 works you
have studied and compare and contrast these works in response to the question. Answers which are
not based on a discussion of at least two part 3 works will not score high marks.

Drama

1.   “It is primarily through speech that a dramatist reveals who his characters are.” Comparing at
     least two of the plays you have studied, consider how, and to what extent, dramatists use speech
     in this way.


2.   “It is not enough for a playwright to explode a loose series of brilliant fireworks: they must set
     each other off like a chain reaction.” Compare the way this series of events, each caused by the
     previous (or an earlier) one, is constructed in at least two of the plays that you have studied.


3.   Discuss and compare the ways in which at least two of the works that you have studied have been
     constructed to be entertaining or even amusing, regardless of the subject matter, and consider the
     effects created.



Poetry

4.   Someone once called poetry “the art of getting a lot said in a small space”. Referring closely to at
     least two poets you have studied, regardless of the length of the poems, explore and compare the
     means by which such economy of expression is created.


5.   Comparing the work of at least two poets that you have studied, to what extent is sight more
     important than sound to meaning and effect?


6.   “Nature is commonplace. Imitation is more interesting.” Comparing the work of at least two poets
     that you have studied, discuss the extent to which various ways of poetically “imitating” the natural
     world may add significance to it.



Prose: novel and short story

7.   Compare the presentation and function of villains or anti-heroes in at least two works of prose
     fiction that you have studied.


8.   In at least two works of prose fiction that you have studied, discuss the presentation of competing
     ideas, hopes or visions and consider the effects created.


9.   Compare the use and function of seemingly insignificant detail in at least two works of prose fiction
     that you have studied.

Prose other than fiction

10.   Authors of prose other than fiction often find themselves distant from their familiar worlds.  
      Compare how, in at least two works of prose other than fiction that you have studied, this sense of
      the foreign or unfamiliar is conveyed, and to what ends.


11.   Why and in what ways have the authors of at least two works of prose other than fiction that you
      have studied positioned themselves as witnesses to important events and made the significance of
      these events clear to the reader?


12.   Prose other than fiction often arises from an author’s passion for new ideas.  In at least two works
      of prose other than fiction that you have studied, compare the means by which authors seek to
      promote new ideas or ways of thinking.
