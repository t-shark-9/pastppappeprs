You must make sure you have looked at all pages. Please put the            annotation on any blank page,
to indicate that you have seen it.

When using the On Page Comments annotation, please keep the following in mind:
  • Avoid covering the candidate’s own writing. This can be done by writing your comments in the
    margins then running the arrow attached to the ‘on-page comment’ annotation to the appropriate
    place.
  • Provide all comments in the target language.
  • You may provide summative comments at the end of the script, but please do NOT record
    numerical marks on the scripts.

                                          Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so heavily penalized as to distort
appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show an adequate sense of
stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical analysis and pertinent detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the works, as well
as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

These apply to all answers below.

A maximum of [5 marks] may be awarded for each of the five criteria.

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both these
categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors increase.
What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged and individual
essays will usually make themselves clear by showing insight into the implications of the question and
the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.


Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to demonstrate
their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does not explicitly offer
such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly, to ensure that candidates are not
unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates to show, as appropriate to the
question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character, setting, structure, voice, etc are used
by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the question is phrased, candidates must also address
related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion. The mere
labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks. On the other hand,
the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a meaningful way, but who does
not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be awarded the higher achievement
levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character etc,
attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                    –5–                 M17/1/TEXTP/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be judged on
the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not exist by itself,
but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the question and by its
capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and coherent essay.

Reminder: in this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they are
incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.


Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a four, you should ensure that these are well founded before
awarding a three. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners reluctant
to award four.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation; therefore do
not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates have
scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.
                                                  –6–                 M17/1/TEXTP/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


1.   An adequate to good answer will take a position on the prompt and that angle can focus sharply on
     rich detail based on sensory perception or can accommodate the possibility that more abstract
     materials can also contribute usefully to poetry. In either case the candidate will need to provide
     examples of such materials and support the argumentative position taken. It is likely that the
     former will depend on such features as diction and imagery whereas the latter (abstract and
     general) will address themes. The examiner must be sure to honor both views as long as there is
     ample evidence and the argument is clearly stated. Students often misinterpret the term “abstract”
     and the examiner should require some precision about that.

     A very good to excellent answer will follow, roughly, the same course of action as what is
     demanded for an adequate response. However, it is also likely that the definition of what
     contributes to the ‘true value’ (and what true value is, perhaps) may be more subtle and the
     examples more compelling and developed.


2.   And adequate to good answer will find some good examples of patterns such as repeated words or
     images, refrains, anaphora, and the like, and show how they have been used by the poet. In
     addition, the candidate should be able to provide information about how such patterns contribute to
     some particular effects such as those mentioned in the question.

     A very good to excellent answer will be able to offer what is demanded of the adequate answer but
     there may well be an organization beyond a somewhat random sampling of patterns. Good to
     excellent responses may well show a strong persuasive structure here as well as some precision
     and persuasiveness about the effects that patterns produce. These may go beyond the effects
     cited in the question.


3.   An adequate to good answer to this topical question will, first, make clear the situations which
     provoke the feelings of isolation or loneliness. There should be at least some precision in defining
     the two conditions and then go on to describe the way they are expressed through particular
     choices of tone, setting, interaction, memory and the like.

     A very good to excellent answer will build on the demands for an adequate to good response,
     showing how poets deliver these, though possibly with greater precision about the condition itself.
     In addition, there may be much closer analysis of techniques and possibly some comparison of the
     way different poets approach these human experiences.


4.   An adequate to good answer will first identify some locations or spaces where the poems have
     been placed or even remembered. The candidate will need to convey some of the details of the
     chosen settings as to their restrictedness or expansion, and then to propose some effects
     connected to choices about setting.

     A very good to excellent answer may also decide to probe one particular setting in greater depth,
     connecting the overall effect to precise literary features and effect. Another strategy that might be
     explored is a comparative one where two different kinds of settings are both examined with some
     persuasive proposals about the particular effects achieved.


5.   An adequate to good answer will identify one or more ways in which questions or questioning.
     appear in poems candidates have studied. The candidates will need, in some cases, to distinguish
     the ways different forms of questions are employed and then go on to show how techniques such
     as repetition, placement of the questions, inclusions of the questions through diction and metaphor,
     e.g., have been used and possibly, how resolution or lack thereof have become an integral or
     important part of the poems. There are many available approaches to the raising of questions and
     examiners will need to allow for a variety of possible treatments adapted to the poems studied
                                                   –7–                  M17/1/TEXTP/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



     A very good to excellent answer will need to meet the demands of the adequate to good category,
     as above. Going further, candidates may examine more subtle or subtextual questioning as in self-
     examination, or include reflection on the very process of questioning or the difficulty of arriving at
     resolution.


6.   An adequate to good answer will first, provide a definition of ‘heroic’ or ‘heroism’ as it applies to
     poems they have studied. It will then be necessary to cite examples that align with such a
     definition, showing how they work in poems and to what effect.

     A very good to excellent answer will need to address the crux of the question in a similar manner
     as above, but perhaps with greater and more appropriate precision for the poetry the candidate
     has studied. These answers will resist the impulse to focus on content only and provide ample
     evidence of how the concept has been handled in an aesthetic manner in the poems.
