                                           Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

Criterion A                                                                                          [5 max]

The task is essentially focused on an analysis of a chosen passage from a prose text. Through this
analysis the level of understanding will be evaluated by the examiner. This “understanding” of the text
should include the relevance of the passage and its place in the context of the novel as a whole.
A synopsis of the plot of the text may be a first step towards demonstrating understanding but “good”
and “perceptive” understanding will evaluate style and theme as well as plot detail. The analysis and
understanding of these elements of the text will always be conducted with a view to the performance of
the chosen passage. The importance of support and validation of all ideas through reference to the text
is crucial. The text is fundamental and reference to it mandatory.


Criterion B                                                                                        [10 max]

The “ideas” for performance are generated from the text and should not be independent of it.
The textual “justification” required to support the “ideas for performance” in Criterion B will be drawn from
a thorough contextualization of the passage and a secure understanding of its relevance to whatever
issues the questions raise.

The association of “good” and “excellent” with the word “practical” attests to the value of ideas that can
be realized in a practical staging context. These are ideas for the stage or a staging area and
temptations to propose grandiose scenarios more applicable to “blockbuster” cinema than theatre should
be resisted.

The candidate may draw diagrams or make sketches if it is thought that these are necessary to
communicate the “ideas for performance” but such visual additions are not mandatory.


Criterion C                                                                                          [5 max]

This criterion evaluates the clarity and coherence of the language used in the essay and looks at the
appropriateness of the register, style and terminology which the candidate employs.

Clearly in an exercise which demands a facility in two disciplines, namely literature and performance, the
candidate will be expected to demonstrate a facility in the use of the terminology specific to each
discipline. As a writer of prose the candidate will be assessed on clarity, variety, precision and
concision. The clarity of a written communication depends on accuracy in grammar, spelling and
sentence construction. The effectiveness of a written communication will depend on the use of
vocabulary, a sense for precision or accuracy of expression and concision which argues for an economy
of expression. The persuasiveness of a piece of writing will depend on choice of idiom and style.
                                                   –5–                  M17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The following elements are particularly relevant to Criteria A, B and C:

1.    Credible to good candidates will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate to the question.
      They will attempt to contextualize it in order to establish its significance; this may involve a
      summary of the content of the passage and why the scene revelation is so important to the
      narrative. Attention will be paid to the staging choices the question encourages the candidate to
      make in order to convey this. The area of focus is the nature of a significant action and the acting
      and production effects which bring out its revelatory quality. The credible candidate may respond
      to this in quite general terms but the good candidate will already be narrowing perspective around
      the action, how it is staged and the acting that registers it dramatically for an audience. There may
      also be references to different production effects which may provide further ways of dramatizing
      the action.

      Credible to good responses will attempt to focus on the question but may not always succeed in
      doing so. They are likely to introduce references from the novel and be largely descriptive in their
      account, tending towards a narrative register. The candidates who achieve good responses will be
      establishing some analytical points. Specificity will distinguish the good from the credible
      candidate. Since the question specifies an action which one assumes should have a pivotal
      importance, how this action is staged for an audience is the crux of the question.

      Credible to good approaches to the movement from page to stage will vary from the candidate who
      may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, to the candidate will more liable to
      explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose description might be transformed into a
      dramatic scene which conveys the impact of the revelation. The presentation of action will be set
      up against a backdrop that is designed to project this to an audience in particular ways. The
      examiner might reasonably expect to see lighting and staging used in conjunction to enhance
      these representations for an audience. Staging effects like design, lighting and sound are likely to
      be broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in the quality of the response. The
      good candidates will be able to see how use of the stage setting either spatially or through design
      (or both) can be manipulated to shape communication for an audience and will not perceive
      representation in an exclusively literal manner. Attention to the role of sound, lighting, costume will
      contribute to staging and this attention will vary depending on choices the candidates make on
      where they choose to place their emphasis and on the quality of the work. It is likely that there will
      be a focus on the work of the actors on stage, the credible candidate will demonstrate this work in
      a general manner, the good candidate will be insightful enough to select particular features of the
      actor’s performance and connect them to the overall purpose of the scene.

      Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text. The
      overall concept for staging may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements, as this
      grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced the work begins to characterize that
      expected in a good candidate. The understanding of stage craft may well be a defining factor in
      responses to this question especially when candidates engage in production effects; these should
      be practical and feasible, not outlandish or cinematic. Particular design gambits and specific uses
      for production and design elements will serve as platforms for the delineation of the characters and
      the actions they perform. How they combine to affect the audience will be an important factor for
      the good candidate who will be aware of the audience’s response in a more detailed way than the
      credible candidate who is likely to make reference to the audience but in a less strategic manner.

      Credible to good writing will be legible and clear. The credible candidate will express ideas
      reasonably well, there may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary will be
      subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be appropriate but
      a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the written work of the
      good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure of the response.

      The excellent candidate will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a
      powerful understanding of why the revelation is important in a wider context of the novel and how
                                              –6–                 M17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


acting, staging and production effects combine to impact the audience. The candidate will
immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in the analysis of the literature,
focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question. Embedded quotation will be used
and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for illuminating reference. The tone,
mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the way the candidate addresses the
task of analyzing the passage in relation to the foci of the question. The essence of the work will
be captured in the quality of the writing as the challenge of staging it is taken up. Quotation may
also be used structurally in the response as a device which achieves transition between one idea
and another; it will be continually relevant to the question.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology, the candidate will make
staging and acting/action choices on the basis of conveying the range of meanings both explicit
and implicit to the passage in the chosen performance space for an audience. Communication for
an audience will be the agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding
of the genre and the possibilities inherent in the application of the production and design elements
to the staging concept. The candidate will be aware of the dramatic context and the resonance
and dramatic implications of the revelation. The chosen performance space will be a location
where action and movement will combine with carefully directed presentational strategies to
register meaning and significance to an audience. The aesthetics of performance will be keenly
felt and the encouragement this question gives to surprise, shock or a climactic sequence may be
registered. The use of lighting and sound may be enhancements to these effects as will an
appreciation of the effect of make-up and costume for the actor.

The excellent candidate will demonstrate an individual “style of writing”, sentences will vary in
length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and ensure that its presentation
is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic elements in the text and staging
elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will present work that, while concise,
nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the chosen passage.
                                                   –7–                  M17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Credible to good responses to this question will identify a concluding passage from the text that is
     appropriate to the question. They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the
     context of the novel; this may involve a summary of the details of the passage and their further
     relevance to the work as a whole with particular reference to the ending. Attention will be paid to
     the choices the question asks the candidate to make. The candidate will select the foci, namely
     the staging and acting of a passage for an audience, by identifying the intention of the author which
     may condition the dramatic approaches to the selected passage. The credible candidate may not
     immediately respond to this but the good candidate will already be narrowing his perspective
     around the consequences of a choice of passage that provides opportunities for an effective
     ending to the narrative.

     Credible to good responses will attempt to focus on the question but may not always succeed in
     doing so. They are likely to introduce references from the text. These will be general in character
     and may look closely at plot and events from the novel with a tendency to narrate these; the
     candidates who achieve “good” responses will be establishing some staging foci that are explicitly
     linked to the question. There will be quotations from the passage which will support rather than
     illuminate the argument and are likely to address general rather than specific issues; again
     specificity will distinguish the good from the credible candidate. Since the question specifies the
     “ending” as the focus the choice of performance space/s should be made with this in mind. The
     acting style/s chosen should be described and the design features which will facilitate the effects
     being aimed for.

     Credible to good candidates will differ in how they demonstrate the movement between genres; the
     former may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, while the latter will be more liable
     to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose description might be transformed by
     staging and a series of purposeful actions. The examiner might reasonably expect to see lighting
     and sound being used in conjunction with staging to enhance these representations for an
     audience. Staging effects like design, lighting and sound are likely to be broadly drawn with more
     detail again registering a difference in the quality of the response between the credible and the
     good candidate. The good candidate will be able to see how use of the stage space can be
     manipulated to shape communication for an audience and will not perceive representation in an
     exclusively literal manner. Attention to the role of sound, lighting, costume and movement to
     convey dramatic intention will vary between the credible and good candidate. The “ending” might
     be climactic or anti-climactic, open or closed. These matters will be actively considered by the
     good candidate perhaps the sense of an ending will be less carefully defined by the credible
     candidate.

     Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text. The
     overall concept for the staging’s may rely on a generalized grasp of the production elements, as
     this grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced the work begins to characterize
     that expected in a good candidate. The ability to distinguish design features for their effectiveness
     in directing the attention of the audience will probably be attainable by a credible candidate who
     will be able to “identify” a lighting or sound effect in a functional manner. The good candidate will
     be able to fit effects into aesthetic or dramatic purposes and make them work as part of subtle or
     forceful communications for the audience. The exploration of set design or the positioning of a set
     piece or the focus on movement on stage in the exploration of character in action may all typify
     ways “into” the question so how this might be achieved through dramatic means will also
     distinguish the credible from the good candidate. The credible candidate will recognize the
     importance of the choice of performance space, the design features and the acting style as aids to
     communication, while the good candidate will be capable of building these elements as dynamic
     elements working towards effective presentations of the chosen ending for an audience.

     Credible to good writing will be legible and clear with the credible candidate being able to express
     ideas reasonably well, there may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary will
     be subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be appropriate
                                             –8–                 M17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


but a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the written work of
the good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure of the response.

Excellent responses will choose a passage that is immediately suitable for two interpretations.
There will be a powerful understanding of why the selected passage is crucial to the ending of the
narrative. The candidate will immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in
the analysis of the literature, focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question.
Embedded quotation will be used and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for
illuminating reference. The tone, mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the
way the candidate addresses the task of analyzing the dynamic between the performance space,
the design features and the acting style. The communication of meanings through alternative
approaches to staging will capture the potential of the chosen passage. The essence of the work
will capture the quality of the writing as the challenge of staging it is taken up. Quotation may also
be used structurally in the response as a device which achieves transition between one idea and
another; it will be continually relevant to the question. The excellent candidate is likely to have a
very clear purpose for the passage and have selected the specific kind of ending to be dramatized.
The way staging effects, design and styles of acting combine to dramatize this for an audience will
be registered in concise language which reflects a dynamic approach to the task.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology, the candidate will make
staging and acting/action choices on the basis of conveying the intention of the author in the
chosen performance space for an audience. Therefore communication for an audience will be the
agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding of the genre and the
possibilities inherent in the application of the production and design elements to the staging
concept. The candidate will be aware of the text as a fluid entity and the performance space as a
location where action and movement will combine to register meaning and intention for the
audience. The aesthetics of performance will be keenly felt through the candidate examining two
approaches to designing the passage and the encouragement this question gives to the creation of
interesting performance spaces will not be neglected. The use of lighting and sound may be
enhancements to these effects as may an appreciation of the effect of make-up and costume for
the actors. There may well be a connection established between the performance space, the
acting style and the design features of the staging.

The excellent candidate will demonstrate an individual “style of writing”, sentences will vary in
length, and the structure of the response will support the argument and ensure that its presentation
is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic elements in the text and staging
elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will present work that, while concise,
nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the chosen passage.
                                                   –9–                 M17/1/TEXTP/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Credible to good responses to this question will identify a passage from the text that is appropriate
     to the question. They will indicate its relevance to the question by placing it into the context of the
     novel; this may involve a summary of the details of the passage and their further relevance to the
     work as a whole. Attention will be paid to the choice the question asks the candidate to make.
     The candidate will select the character or characters that are introduced and outline their
     importance to the context of the passage and the novel as a whole. The attention to detail and the
     specificity of their importance will be clear to the good candidate while the credible candidate will
     be aware of a general importance.

     Credible to good responses will vary on what aspects of staging, acting and design effects the
     candidate will focus on. This makes for an open-ended approach to these elements. The
     examiner may expect the candidate to designate a performance space and explore how design
     elements and acting skills might best convey the importance of the introduction. The credible
     candidate will tend to identify broader effects and possibilities while the good candidate will focus
     on specifics through analysis of the scene. The credible candidate may be detained longer than
     necessary on reflections on plot, whereas the good candidate will be more selective in the
     approach taken looking to respond more quickly to the question. There will be quotations from the
     passage which will support rather than illuminate the argument and are likely to address general
     rather than specific issues; specificity will distinguish the good from the credible candidate. There
     are many different ways of introducing a new character or characters on stage and good
     candidates will have a clear idea of dramatic intention in how they effect this introduction, credible
     candidates will tend to have a less focused approach to this though they will certainly demonstrate
     a sense of purpose in their staging.

     The credible candidate may effect a literal translation from one genre to the other, while the good
     candidate will be more liable to explore both text and stage for how the style of the prose
     description might be transformed into a stage language that reflects not only the introduction but
     will also go some way to capturing its dramatic significance through the design and performance
     choices made by the candidate. Staging effects like lighting and sound and use of space and
     acting are likely to be broadly drawn with more detail again registering a difference in the quality of
     the response from the credible to good candidate. Design elements will be distinguished using the
     same criterion. The good candidates will be able to see how use of the stage space can be
     manipulated by the actor to shape communication for an audience and will not perceive
     representation in an exclusively literal manner. They will also be able to move beyond simple
     identifications of acting style to how style may function in performance to communicate the
     importance of the dramatic event for an audience.

     Credible to good ideas for performance will be plausible and have a justification from the text. The
     overall concept for staging may rely on a generalized grasp of the production and design elements,
     as this grasp becomes steadier, more assured and more nuanced the work begins to characterize
     that expected in a good candidate. The ability to distinguish design effects for their value in
     demonstrating the dramatic nature of the performance for an audience will probably be attainable
     by a credible candidate who will be able to “identify” a lighting or sound effect in a functional
     manner. The ability to present a plan for the actor/s performance tied to entry and action will be
     within the range of an credible candidate who will identify some of the following: general moods,
     gestures, movement, blocking and voice for the actor, a more critical understanding of how these
     combine to communicate the meaning of action in explicit and perhaps implicit terms will move the
     candidate into the “good category”. The good candidate will be able to fit effects into an aesthetic
     or dramatic purpose and make them work as part of a subtle communication for the audience. The
     exploration of set design or make up or the focus on movement on stage in the entry of the
     character/s in action or indeed inaction may all typify ways “into” the question so how this might be
     achieved through dramatic means will also distinguish the credible from the good candidate, the
     former recognizing the importance of the production and design elements as aids to
     communication, with the latter being capable of building these elements as dynamic elements
     within the staging.

Credible to good writing will be legible and clear with the credible candidate being able to express
ideas reasonably well; there may be redundancy, and a lack of precision, technical vocabulary will
be subject to error as will the terminology particular to each genre. The register will be appropriate
but a greater “care” and a subsequent enhancement of accuracy will be noted in the written work of
the good candidate. Concept and execution will be clearly evident in the structure of the response.

Excellent responses will choose a passage that is immediately apposite. There will be a powerful
understanding of why the introduction of the character/s is important to the narrative and the
staging. The candidate will immediately focus on key detail and show an ability to be selective in
the analysis of the literature, focusing only on the material that is responsive to the question.
Embedded quotation will be used and this will allow both for a more concise writing style and for
illuminating reference. The tone, mood and indeed the vitality of the text will be captured by the
way the candidate addresses the task of dealing with the question. The essence of the work will
capture the quality of the writing as the challenge of staging, design and acting is taken up
through how these elements complement each other. Quotation may also be used structurally in
the response as a device which achieves transition between one idea and another; it will be
continually relevant to the question.

Excellent ideas for performance will be conveyed in precise terminology, to evoke mood and
atmosphere underlying entry and action, the candidate will make staging choices, beginning with
the stage design for which there will be justification. The communication for an audience will be
the agent of staging ideas and these will reflect a sophisticated understanding of the genre and the
possibilities inherent in the application of the performance and design elements to the staging
concept used for the dramatization of the chosen experiences. The candidate will be aware of the
text as a fluid entity and the stage as a location where entry, action and movement in space will
combine through the actor to register meaning for an audience. The aesthetics of performance will
be keenly felt and the encouragement this question gives to the creation of design effects will not
be neglected. The use of lighting and sound may be enhancements to these effects.

The excellent candidate will convey ideas and proposals in an individual “style of writing”,
sentences will vary in length; and the structure of the response will support the argument and
ensure that its presentation is clear and convincing. There will be a precise naming of stylistic
elements in the text and staging elements in the concept for performance. The candidate will
present work that, while concise, nevertheless evokes the quality and dramatic potential of the
chosen passage.
