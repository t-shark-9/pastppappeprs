Answer one question. Refer closely to the novel you have selected to study, a clean copy of which may
be brought into the examination.

1.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study which presents a revelation which alters
     the course of the narrative. By paying due attention to the context of the passage, outline how you
     would stage the action by focusing on how it might be effectively dramatized for an audience.


2.   Select a passage from the concluding chapter of a novel you have chosen to study and show how
     acting, staging effects and design can combine to make it an effective ending for an audience.


3.   Select a passage from a novel you have chosen to study which provides an effective introduction
     of an important character or characters. How would you use staging, design and acting to ensure
     that this introduction would have dramatic importance for the audience?
