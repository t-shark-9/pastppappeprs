Answer one question. Refer closely to the works of at least two poets you have studied.

1.   “The enjoyment of poetry lies in its particulars, in rich, sensuous detail, rather than in
     generalizations.” With close analysis of poems by at least two poets you have studied, show how
     far this view of poetry reflects what you have found exemplified in their poetry.


2.   Patterns of different kinds are used by poets for many purposes such as emphasis, coherence and
     rhythm, among others. Looking at the work of at least two poets you have studied, examine the
     ways the poets have used various kinds of patterns to good effect.


3.   “No one ever taught us to be islands” is a line from a poem about feeling isolated in the midst
     of a crowd. Explain how at least two poets in your study have effectively conveyed feelings of
     loneliness or isolation, or both, whether the speaker is alone or surrounded by others.


4.   The settings of poems can be both limited, even suffocating or they can turn outward into broad,
     expansive spaces. In the work of at least two poets you have studied, show how poets can
     achieve similar or different effects, or both, by the careful creation of settings for their poems.


5.   Questions of various kinds appear in poetry. These may take the form of implied or explicit
     questions, questions shaping the whole poem, rhetorical questions, or even self-examination. With
     at least two poets you have studied, explore the ways in which they have used questioning in the
     construction of their poems.


6.   Heroic words and acts, in both great and small circumstances, can sometimes form the material of
     poetry. Defining what you consider to be the meaning of “heroic”, examine how at least two poets
     in your study have effectively shaped such material into poetry.
