Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.


1.   (a)   Identify two ways in which this personal computer can communicate with
           other devices.                                                         [2 marks]

           •   USB/USB ports
           •   card reader
           •   Ethernet / network card
           •   wireless.

           Do not accept Bluetooth as it is not given in this computer’s specification.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             –4–            M10/3/ITGSX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(b)   A travelling businessman has decided to take a sub-notebook PC with
      him when he is away from the office, instead of a normal laptop.
      Describe two disadvantages of this decision.                        [4 marks]

      disadvantage
      • no CD drive
      reason
      • may need to read files supplied on CD.

      disadvantage
      • the RAM is small
      reason
      • may prevent the running of some programs.

      disadvantage
      • backing storage/flash memory is quite small
      reason
      • this may limit the storage of useful files.

      disadvantage
      • the keyboard is small
      reason
      • this makes typing difficult/slow.

      disadvantage
      • the battery life might be too limited
      reason
      • this reduces the useful time he can spend on it.

      disadvantage
      • the screen is small
      reason
      • this makes it difficult to read.

      disadvantage
      • this one runs open source software
      reason
      • this may not be compatible with other systems that he needs to connect with.

      Award [1 mark] for each disadvantage identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].
      Award an additional [1 mark] for the development of that disadvantage up to a
      maximum of [2 marks]. Mark the first two correct disadvantages identified.
                                              –5–                M10/3/ITGSX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(c)   Many consumers are now purchasing personal computers with open source
      software rather than commercial software installed. Explain reasons for
      this trend.                                                             [4 marks]

      • it is free
      • it is customisable/source code is accessible
      • it often occupies less memory/backing storage than similar commercial
        products
      • no need to register/keep track of licenses
      • functionality is the same as the more expensive software
      • updates and security more frequent
      • may run faster
      • better security
      • less prone to viruses.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A description, although the response may lack appropriate development at the
      bottom end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed explanation of the issue with reasons.
                                                    –6–               M10/3/ITGSX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


2.   (a)   Define the term bit-map image.                                                     [2 marks]

           •   a type of memory organization
           •   a means of storing pictures (images)
           •   image is made up of dots/pixels
           •   may require a lot of storage
           •   minimum of 1 bit per pixel
           •   often more bits used to store colour information
           •   resolution depends on the density of pixels
           •   image file format/can be opened with common image software.

           Do not accept digital as it is not specific to bit maps.

           Award [1 mark] for any of the above points in a definition up to a maximum
           of [2 marks]. For example, the response: “A bit-map image is a type of memory
           organization or means of storing digital images”, would be awarded [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe the steps that may be taken in authenticating an examiner when
           logging on to the examining organization’s IT system.                   [4 marks]

           •   check against list of examiners
           •   login details checked remotely
           •   does examiner ID exist?
           •   does examiner ID and password match the database?
           •   if yes, then access granted
           •   count the number of attempts
           •   lock account if more failed attempts than permitted.

           Only allow answers that refer to authentication actions taken by the system, not
           the initial actions of the user.

           Award [1 mark] for any four of the above points up to a maximum of [4 marks].
                                             –7–             M10/3/ITGSX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(c)   Examiners are trained in the use of the new software with an online
      training package. Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using
      online training for this purpose.                                     [4 marks]
