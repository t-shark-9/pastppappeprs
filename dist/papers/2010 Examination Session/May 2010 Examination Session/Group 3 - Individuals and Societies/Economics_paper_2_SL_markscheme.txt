           For drawing a correctly labelled demand/supply diagram, showing a shift
           to the right/increase in supply of wind-generated energy or explaining
           that a subsidy paid by the government will reduce the cost of producing
           wind energy and lead to an increase in supply, an increase in output and a
           lower price.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3-4

           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram showing a shift to the
           right (increase) in the AD curve or for explaining that I (private
           investment) and M (imports) are components of aggregate demand
            (C + Ι + G + X − M) and an increase in spending on I and a decrease in
           spending on M will increase AD. (1 component = [1 mark])

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or
      inflation. The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real
      national output, national income (Y), or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations,
      such as APL, CPI, RNO or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

  (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
        evaluate the decision to construct the world’s largest wind farm in Texas.     [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
        Possible advantages of wind-generated energy:
        • it is clean and efficient
        • it provides electricity to power one million homes (paragraph )
        • it can be used as a substitute for natural gas (paragraph )
        • it can reduce the dependency on oil (paragraph )
        • it can reduce the dependency on petrol (gasoline) to fuel cars
          (paragraph )
        • it creates employment (paragraph )
        • it creates new investment demand
        • it creates extra tax revenue to provide services (paragraph )
        • it reduces the need to import oil and may reduce the US current account
          deficit
        • forward and backward linkages deriving from investment in the wind farm.

        Possible disadvantages of wind-generated energy:
        • the wind farms are ugly (paragraph )
        • negative externalities such as the impact on wildlife (paragraph )
        • the noise caused by the wind turbines (paragraph )
        • the cost to taxpayers of the energy subsidy
        • the main motive of T Boone Pickens is to make a profit.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
        which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
        rewarded beyond level 2.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
        • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
        • examine the impact on different stakeholders
        • discuss advantages and disadvantages
        • prioritize the arguments.

           For explaining that a fall in economic growth from 5.8 % to 4.4 %
           should ease demand pressure on inflation or for explaining that an
           appreciation of the Pakistani rupee from 66 rupees to the US dollar to
           64 rupees to the US dollar will make imports cheaper and will reduce
           cost pressure on inflation.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                     3-4

           cost pressure on inflation.

      The exact mention of “demand pressure” and “cost pressure” is not required.

      Candidates may suggest that since the Real GDP growth is still positive,
      demand pressure on inflation will not really be eased. If so, this should be
      fully rewarded.

  (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
        evaluate the impact on the Pakistani economy of the decision to introduce
        tariffs (paragraph ).                                                            [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
        • a definition of tariffs
        • a tariff diagram
        • revenue from tariffs could help reduce the budget deficit (paragraph )
        • tariffs on imported goods will discourage their purchase and so less imports
          will reduce the current account deficit (paragraph )
        • tariffs will encourage production in domestic import-competing industries
        • tariffs can protect and encourage employment in domestic industries
        • tariffs contribute to a dead-weight loss of welfare (paragraph ), because
          of the loss of consumer surplus
        • tariffs lead to an inefficient allocation of resources (paragraph ), because
          goods are produced by relatively inefficient domestic farmers as opposed to
          more efficient foreign farmers
        • tariffs can have an inflationary impact in a country with an existing problem
          of high inflation (Table 1)
        • tariffs could encourage producers to diversify (paragraph ) and avoid the
          risk of over-specialization
        • the introduction of tariffs may result in retaliation which may affect export
          industries making it difficult to achieve export-led growth
        • the tariffs may go against WTO rules (Pakistan is a member)
        • a worsening of international political relations.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate whether demand-side policies or supply-side policies should be
      used to reduce the current level of unemployment in Ireland.                       [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      Evaluation of the demand-side policies:
      • a definition of demand-side policies
      • an AD/AS diagram showing a rightward shift of the AD function
      • a connection between the shape of the AS function and the likelihood that
        demand-side policies may or may not succeed (i.e. given the economic
        slowdown in Ireland it is likely that the AD function may intersect the AS
        function on a point close to its horizontal range so that an increase in AD
        may result in an increase in output with negligible inflationary costs.
        Otherwise, on a steeper range of AS, the demand-side policies may have a
        heavy inflationary cost)
      • the role of increased government spending which can create additional
        employment opportunities, for example, through infrastructural investment
        that would stimulate the economy (paragraph )
      • reduced indirect and direct taxation may successfully increase consumer
        expenditure and stimulate the economy
      • however, if not carefully targeted, increased government spending may leak
        from the circular flow of income through increased savings and/or import
        spending
      • the large budget deficit in Ireland may prevent further government
        borrowing and reduce the scope for aggregate demand stimulation
        (paragraph )
      • reduced interest rates may allow businesses to invest more and employ more
        people
      • reduced interest rates may not stimulate increased investment by businesses
        because of pessimistic expectations during a crisis.

      Evaluation of supply-side policies:
      • a definition of supply-side policies
      • an AD/AS diagram showing a rightward shift of the LRAS function
      • wage restraint through reduction of union power may add flexibility to the
        labour market (paragraph )
      • wage restraint may be conducive to social instability (industrial action) that
        may further worsen the economic slowdown
      • reducing unemployment benefits
      • social consequences of reducing benefits (poverty, inequality)
      • decrease in income tax may provide incentives for workers to work more
      • decrease in income tax has a limited effect on highly-paid workers as they
        opt for an increase in leisure
      • labour market flexibility will allow market forces to set wages and lower
        costs for businesses
      • deregulation may have severe safety or environmental consequences
      • interventionist policies, such as increased training/education, encouraging
        R+D, the provision of infrastructure, and improved information flows may
        be high cost and involve serious opportunity costs.

        Overall evaluation:
        • demand-side polices have a macroeconomic focus
        • demand-side policies may be more effective in times of cyclical downturns
        • demand-side policies are flexible in timing and focus
        • demand-side policies are difficult to implement with limited fiscal resources
        • supply-side policies have a microeconomic focus
        • time lags may reduce the impact of any supply-side policy in the short term
        • in the long run, supply-side policies may improve efficiency and assist
          international competitiveness.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
        which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        Effective evaluation may be to:

        • discuss advantages and disadvantages
        • prioritize the arguments.

           An explanation that YED for manufactured goods and services is higher
           than for agricultural products or for explaining that as income increases,
           there will be a relatively greater increase in demand for manufactures
           and services, as they become relatively more important to consumers,
           than agricultural products.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain the likely long-term impact of a
      rise in sea levels on the productive capacity of the Vietnamese economy
      (paragraph ).                                                                     [4 marks]

        1 Identification of appropriate theory                                               1-2
          For drawing a correctly labelled PPC diagram showing an inward shift in
          the PPC or an explanation that rising sea levels will reduce the amount of
          productive land and thus reduce the productive capacity of the
          Vietnamese economy.

        2 Correct application of appropriate theory                                          3-4
          For drawing a correctly labelled PPC diagram showing an inward shift in
          the PPC and an explanation that rising sea levels will reduce the amount
          of productive land and thus reduce the productive capacity of the
          Vietnamese economy.

      Candidates may draw a diagram showing a shift of the LRAS curve to the left.
      If correctly labelled and explained this can be fully rewarded. If the Keynesian
      model is used, the productive capacity must be indicated on the horizontal axis.
      If not indicated, only one mark may be awarded for the diagram.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can receive a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      For a PPC, the axes could be two alternative products, one on each axis, e.g.
      Good A and Good B: or two groups of products, e.g. consumer goods and
      capital goods. A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate diversification as a policy option for improving export
      performance in Vietnam.                                                          [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • explanations of diversification and specialization.

      Arguments in favour of diversification (and against specialization):
      • avoids long-term declines in commodity terms of trade
      • avoids extreme agricultural price fluctuations (paragraph )
      • avoids developed country barriers to trade (agricultural subsidies)
      • reduces vulnerability to “shocks” such as extreme weather conditions
        (paragraph )
      • takes advantage of possibilities offered by “craft industries” and tourism
        (paragraph )
      • diversification into manufacturing provides opportunities for increased
        employment, use of new technologies and development of skills
      • diversification allows countries to achieve economic transformation
        (paragraph )
      • over very long term must diversify into production that will not be affected
        by rising sea levels (paragraph )
      • by diversifying, countries may produce a good or service in which they
        might have a comparative advantage.

      Arguments against diversification (and in favour of specialization):
      • specialization according to comparative advantage increases productive
        efficiency and the quantity of output produced
      • specialization and trade according to comparative advantage allow countries
        to consume at a point outside their PPC
      • specialization according to comparative advantage improves the global
        allocation of resources
      • specialization allows countries to take advantage of economies of scale
      • specialization allows farmers to take advantage of increases in food prices
        (paragraph )
      • diversification implies structural change and so may lead to structural
        unemployment.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.
