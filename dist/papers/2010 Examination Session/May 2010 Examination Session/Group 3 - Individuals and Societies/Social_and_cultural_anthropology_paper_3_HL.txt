Answer one question. The answer must refer to theoretical perspectives in anthropology and their
application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations. Each question is worth [20 marks].


1.    Discuss a conflict-centred perspective in relation to one of the following:

      • cohesion-centred perspective
      • diachronic perspective
      • particularistic perspective.


2.    Discuss the tension between structure and agency in the work of one ethnographer.


3.    Compare and contrast two theoretical schools with reference to synchronic perspectives.


4.    Discuss how one of the following helps us to understand a contemporary social issue:

      • materialist perspective
      • universalistic perspective
      • conflict-centred perspective.


5.    Compare and contrast two theoretical schools in relation to idealist perspectives.
