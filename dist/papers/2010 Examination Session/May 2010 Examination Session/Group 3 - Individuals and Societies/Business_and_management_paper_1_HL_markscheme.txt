                                                   SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)   product life cycle (line 32)                                                  [2 marks]

                 Product life cycle refers to the fact that any new product, once
                 commercialized (i.e. first launched on the market) progresses through a
                 sequence of stages conventionally called “introduction”, “growth”,
                 “maturity” and “decline”. The product life cycle (often abbreviated as PLC)
                 is mainly associated with changes in marketing (as the marketing strategy
                 needs to adapt according to the stage).
                    Product sales




                                    Introduction   Growth    Maturity   Decline


                 Candidates may include a figure showing a product life cycle (with the
                 named stages); this can enable them to score [2 marks] but this is not
                 required.

                 Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                 Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                 understanding.

                 Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                 understanding similar to the answer above. Key concept: sequential stages.

                 For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award
                 [1 mark].

(ii)   brand loyalty (line 51).                                                            [2 marks]

       Brand loyalty refers to consumers’ commitment to purchase products from a
       particular brand (literally, it means “fidelity”, “allegiance”, “faithfulness” to
       one brand and not to its competitors). The central idea is that of
       repurchasing. Brand loyalty is often regarded as the ultimate goal of
       marketing.


       Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

       Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
       understanding.

       Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
       understanding similar to the answer above. Key concept: repurchasing.

(b)   With reference to N-Pharma and its new drug Pharmatics, distinguish
      between “above the line and below the line promotion” (line 45).    [4 marks]

      Above the line (ATL) promotion refers to advertising a brand (N-Pharma, in this
      case) through conventional forms of mass media such as television, radio and
      newspaper. To launch its new anti-aging drug Pharmatics, N-Pharma may have
      led a national campaign on television, with famous actresses praising the
      beneficial effects of Pharmatics to keep their skin smooth and youthful.

      Below the line (BTL) promotion refers to advertising through short-term, focused
      methods such as direct mail, public relations and sales promotions; for N-Pharma,
      it could include discount coupons, sponsorship of health-related events,
      point-of-sale displays (e.g. in drug stores) or giving away samples of Pharmatics
      through doctors. (Most of the pharmaceutical companies actually do BTL
      promotion through doctors, as for a patient, personal advice from a doctor may
      hold more value than commercial advertisements.)

      NB: “Direct to Consumer” (DTC) advertising is only permitted in some
      countries. Candidates should not be penalized if they do not discuss TV adverts.

      Accept any other relevant answer.


      [1 mark]
      The answer shows some confused or limited understanding of the difference
      between ATL and BTL promotion.

      [2 marks]
      The two concepts are understood, but they are not clearly defined or not applied
      to the case study.

      [3 marks]
      The two types of promotion are presented and the distinction is clear; one type of
      promotion (ATL or BTL) is well illustrated but the other is not.

      [4 marks]
      The two types of promotion are well presented and the distinction is clear;
      ATL and BTL are defined as two advertising strategies and the distinction
      between them is clearly illustrated.

(c)   Analyse the role of branding in the global market for N-Pharma’s drugs.              [7 marks]

      The global market for pharmaceutical products keeps expanding, as demand
      keeps growing, especially for drugs to treat cardiovascular diseases (line 39) and
      obesity (line 41). This is the case in both developed and developing countries.
      It is a very competitive environment (line 42) with, firstly, competition amongst
      branded drugs (such as N-Pharma and its portfolio: Pharmaflo, Pharmaslim etc.)
      and secondly, competition between branded drugs and generic drugs (line 54).
      Branding enables loyalty which is important as most people tend to keep buying
      the same pharmaceutical drugs, once they know it works for them.

      Within the Pacific Rim, N-Pharma is already in a good position as it has
      developed strong brand loyalty (line 51) – but “the demand for some of
      N-Pharma’s products is income elastic” (lines 54–55) so the directors do not take
      their marketing advantage for granted. Family branding plays a key role in
      attracting customers to new drugs: N-Pharma’s logo is well known within the
      Pacific Rim (lines 51–52) which makes it more cost-effective for N-Pharma to
      advertise its drugs, as any advert indirectly benefits the whole group.

      In other parts of the world, such as Europe (line 121), N-Pharma does not
      commercialize its products yet; as in Europe “customers have strong brand loyalty
      towards products they already know” (line 124), N-Pharma would need to invest
      a lot in communication, promotion and advertising.

      This shows that branding is advantageous for firms and products that are well
      known and well-established, but it makes it even more difficult to enter a new
      market, even for brands that are successful elsewhere in the world;
      put another way, branding is a barrier to entry.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

2.   (a)   “Since 1980, N-Pharma has been a public limited company with its shares
           traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange” (lines 83–84). Outline two key aspects
           of this form of ownership.                                                 [4 marks]

           The key aspects of this form of ownership include the following points:
             N-Pharma sells its shares to the general public, so anyone can be an investor
             and have part ownership of the company
             N-Pharma has access to capital markets and is thereby able to raise more funds
             (which was not so easy when it was a private company prior to 1980)
             N-Pharma’s accounts must be audited and released to the public (they are
             public information)
             N-Pharma may be vulnerable to takeover bids (line 117); its value may also be
             very dependent upon stock exchange fluctuations
             any other relevant aspect.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct key aspect identified, and [1 mark] for the
           development of each of these key aspects.

     (b)   Prepare a SWOT analysis showing only the opportunities and threats for
           N-Pharma.                                                              [4 marks]

           The case study refers to several opportunities and threats (see below) though
           candidates may be credited for others, if appropriate (for example about exchange
           rates between currencies):

           Opportunities include:
             illnesses and more health problems all around the world, resulting in an
             increasing demand for drugs (e.g. the more people at risk of heart attacks,
             the higher the demand for Pharmaflo) (lines 38–39)
             further trends for youth-obsessed looks, resulting in an increasing demand for
             anti-aging products such as Pharmatics (line 44)
             financial difficulties for competitors (especially small ones who could then be
             taken-over more easily) (lines 129–130)
             changes in the regulations on joint ventures at the European Union
             Commission (as it would enable the joint venture with R-Taylor)
             (lines 135–136).

           Threats include:
             economic recession, leading to customers buying cheaper generic drugs rather
             than N-Pharma branded products (lines 53–54)
             another financial crisis, leading to a drop in the price of shares as in 2008
             (lines 109–110)
             political tensions between China and Japan, creating problems with the
             development of the Beijing subsidiary (lines 146–147)
             more instances of PR problems e.g. another ethical scandal (lines 88–91).

           Accept any other relevant answer.

      In a SWOT analysis, opportunities and threats are external factors; consequently,
      an “internal threat” (such as industrial action in the Canadian subsidiary) and an
      “internal opportunity” (such as Susan James adopting a new leadership style) are
      not acceptable. They are misclassifications and the candidate cannot gain any
      marks for them.

      Candidates are not expected to explain nor develop the opportunities and threats
      they identify; a list is acceptable.

(c)   Analyse N-Pharma’s position using the information in the SWOT analysis
      (additional information, page 3) and your answer to part (b).          [7 marks]

      Analysing an organization’s market position using a SWOT analysis can be done
      in several ways, so this task may be addressed differently by candidates.
      For example:
         some candidates may develop a position map and answer in terms of marketing
         (with references to concepts such as positioning and USP)
         some candidates may decide to use Porter’s five forces model in their answer
         and to examine N-Pharma’s position towards its competitors
         (i.e. analysing N-Pharma’s competitive advantage)
         some candidates may structure their analysis by successively examining
         N-Pharma’s position in different national/continental markets
         some candidates may not use additional tools but can analyse the SWOT using
         the key points from the SWOT analysis (additional information and answer to
         part (b)).

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

           All these approaches are fine – what is assessed here is the candidate’s ability to
           analyse N-Pharma’s position by referring to the SWOT analysis. Just repeating
           key points from the SWOT analysis (additional information and answer to
           part (b)) should not be credited though: candidates must use these elements in
           their answer, and not just copy them.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.


3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)   profitability (line 64)                                                         [2 marks]

                 The ability of a business to generate consistent sales revenue to cover costs
                 over a period of time. It can be measured by using profit ratios such as
                 GPM, NPM or ROCE.


                 Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                 Do not award any extra mark for the formulae of the profitability ratios
                 (gross profit margin, net profit margin).

                 Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                 understanding.

      (ii)   liquidity (line 111).                                                                 [2 marks]

             The term “liquidity” is used in several cognate ways, which all relate to the
             availability of cash or the convertibility of assets into cash. The liquidity of
             an asset is its ability to be sold quickly and without any price discount – but
             a business itself could be described as having liquidity if it can easily meet
             its needs for cash (i.e. in simple terms, liquidity is the ability of a business to
             pay the bills). Two ratios can help calculate the liquidity of a business: the
             current ratio and the acid test (quick) ratio.


             Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

             Do not award any extra mark for the formulae of the profitability ratios
             (current ratio, acid test (quick) ratio).

(c)   Analyse two possible financial strategies to improve the values of the liquidity
      ratios in the USA subsidiary of N-Pharma.                                        [7 marks]

      Several strategies can help the USA subsidiary of N-Pharma improve the values
      of its liquidity ratios:
         delaying purchases (or getting longer payment terms from suppliers)
         reviewing credit policies with clients and customers (possibly adjusting them to
         minimize the time it takes to collect payment)
         reviewing expenses, especially overhead expenses (indirect operational
         expenses) as it might be possible to decrease them
         reviewing how assets are being used: it might be possible to sell some
         unproductive assets (such as buildings, equipment and vehicles) if they do not
         directly help generate revenue
         paying off their liabilities (would some more “internal” borrowing from
         N-Pharma’s global headquarters be useful in this respect?)
         factoring their debt, by substituting short-term loans with long-term loans
         reviewing the profitability of some of the N-Pharma drugs in the USA market
         (it might be possible to increase some prices to maintain or increase
         profitability though this has a rather indirect impact on liquidity)
         running down stock to turn into extra cash with the profits on the sales
         any other valid suggestion of a relevant strategy.


      Candidates are not expected to refer to all the strategies mentioned above,
      but they should analyse at least two possible financial strategies to achieve the
      top markband.

4.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    delegation (line 59)                                                         [2 marks]

                  Delegation (sometimes called “deputation”) refers to the transfer and
                  sharing of authority and control of tasks and duties to another person.
                  Typically, it allows a subordinate to make decisions and to feel empowered
                  at work. The overall responsibility remains with the manager.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above. Key concepts: transfer of

                  Performance-related pay (PRP) is a method of financial motivation whereby
                  employees earn according to how well (or how much) they work.
                  “Piece work” is the most common example of PRP, although many schemes
                  of commission are also based on the principle of PRP.

(b)   Explain the difference between crisis management (lines 111–112) and
      contingency planning for the USA subsidiary.                         [4 marks]

      Crisis management is reactive. A crisis is a major, unpredictable event that
      threatens to harm an organization and its stakeholders; in the case of the USA
      subsidiary’s liquidity problems, the crisis needs to be managed, for example the
      short-term capital from the Tsukuba headquarters. Suzuko Tanaka’s mission is to
      resolve the crisis (by identifying its causes and controlling its consequences).

      Contingency planning is proactive. Contingency plans should be prepared before
      crises occur, anticipating problems and identifying possible courses of actions.
      In the USA subsidiary, the manager failed to engage in contingency planning (to
      prevent their liquidity problems from getting worse). As part of her crisis
      management, Suzuko Tanaka may design contingency plans in case the business
      loses its liquidity again.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

(c)   Laura Davies anticipates “that the Australian employees of N-Pharma will
      respond positively to non-financial rewards” (lines 80–81). Explain how
      non-financial rewards might affect job satisfaction and productivity.                  [4 marks]

      Some employees (such as the Australian employees of N-Pharma) may prefer
      non-financial rewards (such as job enrichment, job enlargement, empowerment
      and teamwork) to financial rewards (unlike the Canadian employees who are more
      motivated by financial rewards). Different types of non-financial rewards can
      affect job satisfaction and productivity in slightly different ways:
         Job enrichment means giving employees more interesting, challenging and
         complex tasks. It gives them the chance to test themselves and to use their full
         range of skills and abilities, which may be very relevant for N-Pharma’s
         researchers and scientists. They can thereby obtain a greater sense of
         achievement and possibly more praise or recognition of their work. Besides,
         employees may respond better as their managers have shown trust in the fact
         that they possess the ability to handle the increasing complexity and pressures
         of their work.
         Job enlargement means giving employees more tasks to do of a similar nature
         or complexity. This will reduce the monotony or repetition involved in
         their work; job rotation is a part of this and involves having a wider variety of
         tasks to do, perhaps rotating jobs with other members in one’s team, but not
         increasing the challenge of the job. This might be more relevant for some of
         the lower skilled employees of N-Pharma.
         Empowerment means that power or authority is given to employees so they can
         make their own decisions regarding their working life. For instance employees
         may have control over how to use their time and decide which tasks could be
         done from home. According to the case study, the Australian employees are
         very keen on flexitime and teleworking, so empowerment could be a good
         strategy for Laura to change the employment patterns and practices at
         the Australian subsidiary so as to ensure higher productivity and stronger
         job satisfaction.
         Teamworking is where employees work in groups or teams. This can also
         meet an employee’s social needs, as a person can more easily build friendships
         and feel a sense of belonging to a unit or group and hopefully to the business as
         a whole. It is very likely that N-Pharma researchers and scientists already
         work in teams, as R&D is a collective process, but Laura could put other teams
         in place, for example quality circles and management teams.

      Accept any other relevant explanation as well as reference to methods such as
      flexi-working which arguably exemplifies non-financial rewards in practice.


      Candidates are likely to write about these four methods/rewards; some could
      equally decide to answer firstly about job satisfaction (what it means and how
      non-financial rewards affect it) and secondly about productivity (what it means
      and how non-financial rewards affect it).

      Award [1 mark] for each correct reward identified, and [1 mark] for the
      explanation of each of these rewards.

(d)   To what extent would a change in Susan James’ leadership style improve
      productivity and morale at the Canadian subsidiary of N-Pharma?        [8 marks]

      Susan’s authoritative leadership style contradicts with the Canadian employees’
      desire for more delegation and a wider span of control. Her inability to
      communicate and the tall organizational structure have only made the situation
      worse.

      On the one hand, changes in her leadership style could improve productivity
      and morale:
        Employees are dissatisfied and disillusioned, which explains why their
        productivity is lower than in other N-Pharma subsidiaries (resulting in the
        Canadian subsidiary trading at a loss). By listening to the employees and
        providing them with the delegation, empowerment and other non-financial
        rewards they want, Susan could boost their morale and enhance their
        productivity.
        By becoming more democratic, Susan could involve employees in the
        decision-making processes to help identify some of the problems at the
        subsidiary (for example there might be some issues about supply chain or
        organizational culture that she is not aware of). Once involved by a
        democratic leader, employees could help solve the problems and prevent the
        causes of low productivity.
        By becoming more democratic, Susan could develop good two-way
        communication with her staff; communication has clearly been a problem in
        the past, hence the escalation towards industrial action could be avoided
        through a different leadership style.

      On the other hand, further problems could arise from a (sudden) change in
      leadership style:
         Susan could lose the support from her management team and even from Yukio
         who sent her there because of her non-compromising attitude.
         Employees and negotiators may feel that she is malleable and threaten
         further action; to be successful, a democratic leader needs the support of the
         employees, but the situation may have been too conflictual to change.
         Susan herself could struggle psychologically as leadership styles are
         intrinsically linked to a person’s own values and belief system; although she
         could be trained and coached to change her leadership style, it would remain
         unnatural for her (not believing in it herself, would she be able to make her
         workforce believe she has changed?).

      Accept any other relevant answer.

           There could be a number of different possible responses including that Anigam:
             has experience in the animal welfare market
             is a world specialist in animal drugs
             is well established in the USA and Europe
             may be a suitable partner for a merger with N-Pharma
             any other relevant benefit.


           Award [1 mark] for each correct benefit identified, up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain the role of a “Kaizen approach to change the corporate culture and
           encourage ethical practices” (line 104) within N-Pharma.                   [7 marks]

           Kaizen, or continuous improvement, is part of a total quality management (TQM)
           approach to business. Kaizen involves small, gradual and continuous changes,
           which involve all members of the organization. Each change on its own may be
           of little importance, but the cumulative effect may be substantial.

           Staff will be encouraged by management to establish a positive corporate culture
           which prioritizes quality and ethical practices. Teamworking is vital to the
           process and performance targets may be set for individuals and teams. Adherence
           to the procedures set following the 2008 controversy will be vital. Individuals
           should be empowered to make decisions relating to quality and ethical practices,
           even to the point where there are official channels to report abuses without fear of
           punishment.

           Kaizen may lead to the following effects on corporate culture:
             encourages greater participation and collaboration
             empowers employees
             promotes self responsibility.

           In the case of N-Pharma, there are issues related to both the quality of drugs
           produced – and their safety – and to the issues of ethical practices in all
           departments. The brand name of N-Pharma is built on its reputation for quality
           and safety as shown in its market research. The weight of public opinion is also
           in favour of ethical approaches in the pharmaceutical industry, especially in areas
           of animal experimentation. This approach may be even more crucial if the merger
           with Anigam goes ahead.

           Kaizen may lead to the following effects on ethical practices:
             greater openness and transparency
             leaner production therefore less wastage
             improvements in quality will lead to less harm to animals.

           Answers may also refer to the use of quality control techniques, using approaches
           such as the “fishbone” diagram.

(c)   Examine how the use of Porter’s five forces model can help N-Pharma
      understand its competitive position before it enters the animal health market. [9 marks]

      Porter’s five forces model was developed to support strategic planning in a
      competitive environment. The model is used to evaluate the “attractiveness” of
      growth opportunities. The model identifies five forces:
         the bargaining power of suppliers
         the bargaining power of buyers/customers
         the threat of new entrants
         the threat of substitute products and technologies
         the intensity of competition in the industry.

      N-Pharma can use this model to make an informed assessment of its competitive
      position. The need to identify these forces will require N-Pharma to conduct
      extensive market research.

      For example, the data in the extension material (Item 4) suggests:
        that suppliers are able to charge premium prices and that some shortages have
        occurred, increasing the power of the suppliers
        conversely buyers have been able to negotiate lower prices as the recession has
        hit and substitute generic products have appeared in the market place, reducing
        profit margins
        that competition in the market place appears significant and that it is
        concentrated in the hands of a few very large pharmaceutical companies.
        Barriers to entry appear as a result to be high.

      However, Porter’s five forces model needs to be used in conjunction with other
      business tools, such as SWOT and PEST analysis, to underpin its strategy.
      In addition, N-Pharma will need to consider whether it is able to alter the
      strengths of any of the forces in the market place through actions such as mergers
      and joint ventures.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      To achieve [7 to 9 marks] candidates must apply Porter’s model, making explicit
      references to the intensity of competition in the pharmaceutical market,
      the bargaining power of suppliers and customers, the threat of new entrants and
      substitute products.

(d)   Using a decision-making framework and using information contained in the
      case study and Items 1 to 5, evaluate N-Pharma’s diversification into the
      animal health market and its possible merger with Anigam (Option 3).      [12 marks]

      It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers are likely to include
      a much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified below. There is no
      “correct” answer.

      Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesise and
      evaluate even if they do not examine all the stimulus materials.

      A decision-making framework could involve all, or most, of the following:
        the setting of objectives
        clarifying the present position of N-Pharma – strategic analysis
        gathering data and information about the animal health market
        planning future action and resource requirements
        controlling the process and reviewing performance.

      Alternatively in order to provide a suitable decision-making framework for their
      answer candidates may instead wish to make use of business tools such as:
         Porters generic strategies model
         Ishikawa fishbone diagram
         Lewin – force field analysis
         Ansoff matrix
         any other relevant tool.

In the case of the diversification into the overseas animal health market option:
   objectives may include market growth, product development, ethical
   objectives, brand development, profit
   information on the animal health market will be established through market
   research and through its links with Anigam
   planning future action and resource requirements will involve the setting of
   performance targets and budgets and marketing planning
   strategic implementation will occur when and if the diversification option is
   selected
   the control and review process will involve drawing up final accounts and
   comparing actual to planned performance.

The case study identifies opportunities in the “companion animal market”
(the pet market), but other objectives should be in place for growth into other
animal species sectors once the N-Pharma brand is established.

There are several factors given in support of the diversification.

Benefits:
  The global animal health industry is not just large – worth almost US$18
  billion in 2009 – but also has a high growth rate of 4.7 %. The “companion
  animal health market” has been growing even faster at 6.6 % per year and now
  represents a share of almost 42 % of global animal pharmaceutical sales.
  Item 1 identifies that North America and Western Europe, where Anigam is
  well-established, represents almost 66 % of the total value of the market.
  The companion animal market offers significant synergies for N-Pharma
  because it can modify and adapt its existing human drug portfolio, such as
  Pharmaflo and Pharmaslim, minimizing the time and cost of research and
  development.
  Item 3 suggests that the market is set to grow further because of increasing pet
  insurance and increasing ailments related to longer life spans and growing
  animal obesity.
  The potential merger with Anigam will offer N-Pharma the opportunity to tap
  into its experience in the USA and European markets and potential economies
  of scale.

However, the marketing manager knows that several of the directors remain
concerned about the risks of this diversification.

Risks:
   Anigam has a task-focused “corporate culture based on project teams and
   matrix structures” which does not fit well with N-Pharma’s more traditional
   organizational structure and leadership style.
   Like N-Pharma, Anigam has recently been accused of unethical animal
   experimentation. The organization may not wish to be subject to more
   negative media stories.
   Item 4 refers to structural issues in the animal drugs market. 8 of the 10 largest
   animal health companies in the world are subsidiaries of big pharmaceutical
   companies. The combined market share held by the three leading companies is
   in excess of one-third of total global sales. This will provide significant
   barriers to entry to N-Pharma.
   There are other significant barriers to entry to the market, both economic and
   legal and the global animal health products market will be adversely affected
   by the economic recession in the short run. This is shown by the decline in the
   sales in the global animal health market, from US$17.9 billion in 2009, to
   US$15.1 and US$16.2 billion respectively in 2010 and 2011. Profit margins
   are falling.
   A lack of knowledge and experience in the animal health market in the USA
   and European markets.
   Many firms are moving production away from Europe and the USA.

The evaluation should balance the benefits and risks. The effect of the present
recession, the lack of experience in these markets and the high barriers to entry
may lead candidates to conclude that the risks are simply too high for N-Pharma
at present. However, it would be equally valid to conclude that the potential
benefits are significant and the experience of Anigam should be sufficient to
justify this growth strategy, with or without a full merger.


To achieve [10 to 12 marks] candidates must make explicit use of a
decision-making framework.
