indicated. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.       With the aid of a diagram, explain why the price elasticity of supply is likely to change over time.

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of price elasticity of supply
           the formula for calculating the PES
           an explanation of why the PES can change over time:
           – how quickly the costs of using resources rise as output increases; if the cost of resource use increases
              quickly as production increases, producers are less likely to increase supply, resulting in an inelastic
              supply
           – time period:
              – the longer the time period considered, the more elastic supply will be (for example, difficulty in
                  expanding capital e.g. constructing another factory)
           – amount of excess capacity; the greater the excess capacity, the more elastic supply will be
           – availability of substitutes in production; the more the substitutes, the easier it is to switch production,
              and the more elastic supply will be
           – reference may be made to the market period, the short run and the long run
           a diagram showing supply curves with different values of PES
           examples, such as primary products (agriculture, minerals) which have a lower PES than manufactured
           products.

         Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate, should be
      rewarded.

2.       Explain why an airline would want to practice price discrimination. Under what conditions would the
         airline be able to do so?

         Candidates may include:
           a definition of price discrimination
           an explanation of why an airline would want to practice price discrimination
           – it can earn higher revenues and earn greater economic (supernormal) profits through the capture of
              consumer surplus
           – it can drive higher cost competitors out of the market by lowering prices for some consumer groups,
              and therefore it can increase its monopoly power
           an explanation of how an airline can practice price discrimination:
           – an airline can split the market and discriminate between different buyers: they can charge the elderly
              lower prices on certain days, give discounts for students’ weekend travel, offer lower fares to
              travellers who make advance bookings and charge higher fares to those making their travel plans
              closer to the day of travel
           conditions for price discrimination:
           – the producers have price setting ability because the market is imperfect, and can distinguish between
              separate groups of buyers on the basis of age, income etc.
           – consumers have different price elasticity of demand i.e. different demand curves for different
              consumers e.g. holidaymakers, business people and therefore some consumers are willing to pay
              higher prices than others
           – producers must be able to keep the markets separate.

         Candidates may illustrate how a monopolist can charge different prices in different markets using marginal
         revenue and marginal cost curves.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if appropriate, should be
      rewarded.

           the line of absolute equality

           a definition of a fixed exchange rate
           a definition of a floating (flexible) exchange rate.
           Explanation of the difference between a fixed exchange rate and a floating (flexible) exchange rate in
           terms of how they function:
           – explanation of how a fixed exchange rate is maintained at a fixed level: buying and selling by the
              government of a country of its domestic currency in the foreign exchange market
           – explanation of the factors causing variations of a floating (flexible) exchange rate: changes in the
              demand for and supply of a currency resulting from changes in trade flows, international interest rate
              differentials, international price level differentials and speculation.

         full marks.

           self-reliance
           an explanation that outward-oriented growth strategies are based on free trade whereas inward-oriented
           growth strategies are based on import substitution
           an explanation that outward-oriented growth strategies are based on market liberalization whereas
           inward-oriented growth strategies based on government intervention to regulate domestic industries and
           protect infant industries
           an explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of outward-oriented growth strategies and
