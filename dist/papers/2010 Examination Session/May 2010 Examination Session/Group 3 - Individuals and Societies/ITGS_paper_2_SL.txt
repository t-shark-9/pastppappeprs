1.    Visits to the bank are becoming less frequent as more customers use ATMs (automated teller machines)
      to carry out banking transactions such as withdrawal of funds or deposit of money. Some people,
      however, are concerned that their accounts may not be safe due to fraud involving ATM cards and
      ATM machines.

      Many banks also offer online services. These services include the ability to check your bank balance,
      transfer money, pay bills and receive alerts.

2.    Copacabana Academy is a school for the children of Navy personnel. When a Navy parent
      is moved to a different city or country, the whole family is relocated together. In the past,
      students were required to attend the local school.

      The recently introduced Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) at Copacabana Academy allows
      these students to remain enrolled and continue with their lessons and assessments remotely from
      their new location.




                            [Source: http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=34, 5 September 2008]


      This VLE consists of a password protected web site environment. Teachers upload different
      types of resources that will appear according to a calendar incorporated in the environment,
      schedule online meeting times and provide a forum for discussion. Students have access to the
      resources and may also be tested online.



                                                                (This question continues on the following page)

      (b)   Describe two ways in which teachers may solve students’ problems and
            provide feedback using this web site.                                             [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain how the VLE will allow each student access to the area of the web site
            which has the appropriate content of the subject they are requesting.             [4 marks]

      (d)   Evaluate the implications of the introduction of the VLE for the school and
            for the students.                                                                [10 marks]

3.    Soon, many television stations will change from broadcasting on analogue airwaves to begin
      broadcasting only in digital. Digital broadcasting will allow stations to offer high resolution
      pictures and better sound quality as well as additional channels.

      With digital TV, sounds and pictures from the broadcaster are converted into binary digits (bits) and
      sent through an aerial, satellite, telephone line or cable. This digital signal is then turned back into
      sounds and pictures by a digital box or a digital TV set.

      Some digital boxes have special access features such as subtitles, signing and audio description for
      people with hearing or sight problems.

      However, recent improvements in Internet bandwidth and the increased availability of video
      through web sites such as YouTube, have led to questions being raised about the need for additional
      digital channels.


      (a)   Define the term resolution.                                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Digital TV broadcasters are able to provide interactive services. Describe two
            interactive services that could be provided with digital TV.                           [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain two ways in which a domestic installation such as a digital TV can
            communicate with the digital provider.                                                 [4 marks]

      (d)   To what extent is the growth of video clips on the Internet overtaking the need
            for digital TV?                                                                       [10 marks]

4.    A biotechnology company has been commissioned to develop a database to store genetic data on
      all citizens in Iceland for the purpose of medical research. The country was chosen because of its
      isolation and small population resulting in a small gene pool1.

      Citizens are required to give a blood sample which is processed to provide a genetic profile2.
      This profile can then be matched with details such as age, weight, and medical history to predict
      potential future health issues that may be linked to the genetic backgrounds of individuals.

      Data is made anonymous by replacing personal details with an ID number.  This is used as a key field
      in the database. Some citizens have expressed concern about the collection of this data and have
      challenged its legality in court.

5.    With the potential increases in the cost of energy, many farmers in North America are concerned
      about the efficiency of their greenhouses.  One possible solution is to use a greenhouse simulator to
      experiment with the different designs and materials in the construction of their greenhouses.

      In a simulation, users can vary inputs and when the simulation is run the results are displayed
      (see Diagram).

      By using the results from a simulator to plan the building of greenhouses, farmers can produce crops
      more efficiently and reduce their energy bills.

      Many teachers find it useful to use simulations such as these in agricultural science classes.

6.    Some governments in the world are planning to legislate to prevent the intellectual property theft
      that sometimes occurs during the use of file sharing sites.   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have
      been asked by the government to send warning letters to customers who are suspected of sharing
      copyrighted material.

      This legislation will centre mainly on the use of peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, an application that
      allows Internet users to exchange files with each other directly or through a mediating server.
