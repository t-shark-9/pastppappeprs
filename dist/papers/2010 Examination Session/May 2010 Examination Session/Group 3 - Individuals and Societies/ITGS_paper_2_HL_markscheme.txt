Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

                              Area of impact: Business and employment

1.   (a)   Identify two output devices on an ATM.                                                [2 marks]

           •   speaker
           •   screen / monitor
           •   printer (for receipt)
           •   headphone jack and customer plugs in headphones
           •   cash dispenser / slot to dispense cash / tray to dispense money (N.B. where the
               cash comes out is not enough).

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each output device up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                           –4–             M10/3/ITGSX/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(b)   Describe one example of fraud involving an ATM card and one possible
      solution to this crime.                                              [4 marks]

      • fraud    – a card skimmer, hidden on the ATM machine, reads the ATM card
                   number and a camera captures the PIN when typed on the keypad
                   (need both for 2 marks).
        solution – biometrics is used to identify the customer / embedded security
                   microchip makes card harder to copy / banks educate customers to
                   look for unusual devices / to shield their hands when inputting
                   PIN / banks check ATMs regularly for scam devices / ATMs sound
                   an alarm if tampered with to alert police / ATM is set up inside
                   a store where it is in view of employees who can report any
                   suspicious behaviour.

      • fraud    – criminals access PIN numbers and encryption codes stored
                   on databases and create counterfeit cards.
        solution – safer encryption methods that store encryption codes separate
                   from PINs.

      • fraud    – criminals divert the ATM card when it is inserted, steal it,
                   then shoulder surf to see the PIN.
        solution – customer education to be aware of criminals near the machines /
                   immediate notification of card loss / banks make areas around
                   ATMs private so onlookers can't look over customer's shoulder.

      • fraud    – phishing scams collect ATM card numbers and PINs through
                   e-mail responses.
        solution – banks educate customers and publicize that they never send
                   e-mails / make phone calls requesting this data / a password in
                   addition to a PIN is required for online transactions.

      • fraud    – new cards and PIN are stolen when sent through the mail
                   to customers.
        solution – activation only occurs when customer contacts bank and provides
                   personal information if telephoning.

      • fraud    – ATM card and PIN stolen. Thief attacks user, steals card,
                   requests PIN.
        solution – biometrics is used to identify customer / install web cam to film
                   ATM, video feed sent to bank or security firm / notify bank of theft
                   and cancel card.

      • fraud    – criminals get card details and PIN – by installing malware on ATM
                   which records the data on the magnetic stripe plus the PIN.
        solution – regularly scan ATMs to check for malware / install ATM inside
                   a store so employees can see any suspicious activity.
                                      –5–             M10/3/ITGSX/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


• fraud    – a false ATM can collect the card and record the PIN number that
             the user typed in (the card is then taken from the dummy machine
             by the criminals and used in a real machine to withdraw cash).
  solution – biometrics as identification of the card holder.

• fraud    – a card skimmer is installed in the ATM machine and will go
             unnoticed by the bank customer and with a camera will record the
             details of the card and PIN.
  solution – “banks such as AVB and NBC have provided a green-lit slot
             protector fitted to the slot that reveals any third party reader that
             was placed in there”.

Award [1 mark] for identifying a fraud and [1 mark] for identifying a solution
up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award [1 mark] for each relevant description
up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain two validation processes that take place when you use the ATM to
      withdraw money from your bank account.                                   [4 marks]

      • ATM reads expiry date from the ATM card and the expiry date is checked
        against the current date – to verify the ATM card is valid
      • account details are sent to the bank’s central computer where they are matched
        in the customer database – to verify the account is valid
      • the PIN/password is entered – and sent to the bank’s central computer to verify
        it is valid for that account number
      • the withdrawal amount is sent to the bank’s central computer and the amount is
        compared with the balance – to ensure there are sufficient funds
      • the withdrawal amount is checked – to ensure it does not exceed a preset limit
      • the daily number of transactions is checked – to ensure it has not reached a
        preset limit
      • the number of PIN attempts is checked – to ensure it has not reached a
        preset limit
      • ATM checks correct cash is available – checks against list of accepted
        denominations – most ATMs only dispense $ 50 or $ 20 notes so a request for
        $ 105 would not be valid
      • account type is validated – e.g. user can choose Savings or Cheque and this
        must correspond to the user’s account at the bank
      • ATM checks that card is valid – card type is checked against a database of
        approved bank cards to be used in that ATM machine
      • ATM checks 16 digit serial number and description.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2 marks]
      Two processes identified or one process described.

      [3 marks]
      Two processes described with reasoning.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed explanation giving reasons.

      Answers must relate to validation.

(d)   To what extent does the improved customer service offered by online
      banking outweigh the possible disadvantages for customers?          [10 marks]

      Improved customer service
      • more convenient – customers can access banking details from any place they
        can use the Internet
      • time is saved – there is no need to travel to a bank/ATM or queue for bank teller
      • easy access – unlike a bank, access is available 24/7
      • cost saving – travel costs / fees are often cheaper than dealing with a bank teller
      • Internet banking offers more services than an ATM – e.g. bill payment/viewing
        statements online
      • customers may select language / several languages available – when going to a
        bank language will be limited to what the bank teller knows
      • online banking is more anonymous/private – customers do not need to
        discuss/disclose financial details to teller.

      Disadvantages for customers
      • sensitive information is being sent over the Internet / stored on bank server and
        could be accessed by hackers
      • if the web site is down accounts are not accessible
      • customers may not have Internet access or the IT skills to use Internet banking
      • customers are not able to make cash deposits/withdrawals
      • customers need to keep access codes safe and accessible
      • customers need to remain alert to potential scams – e.g. fake web sites posing
        as their bank / phishing scams asking for logons and passwords
      • may not get an immediate response to queries – may have to wait for an
        e-mail reply
      • less human interaction – some customers prefer talking to a bank teller
      • there may be a difficulty correcting errors in online transactions.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

     (b)   Describe two ways in which information can be sent to you on a regular basis
           from a political party using the Internet.                                   [4 marks]

           • newsletter via e-mail – voters can subscribe to a party’s newsletters / join their
             listserv and the latest newsletter will be sent to their inbox
           • news feeds/RSS – voters can subscribe to a news feed and receive automatic
             updates in a news reader
           • e-mail notification from wikis – voters can join a candidate’s wiki and request
             e-mail notification when pages are updated
           • e-mail notification of new posts on blogs – voters can join a candidate’s blog
             and receive e-mail notification of new posts
           • receive regular e-mail updates – voters subscribe for e-mail updates on web site
           • join the party’s social networking site / become a “friend” – voters receive
             updates in their inbox of the social networking site
           • join the party's social networking site and receive messages – party can send
             out mass messages to the group
           • subscribe to the party's podcasts – these can be downloaded automatically
             when you access iTunes
           • follow a candidate on Twitter – receive regular “tweets” with party information
           • register to be on a party's email list – receive regular emails e.g. details of
             party events
           • political party purchases email addresses / gets email addresses from
             government database – voters receive regular emails e.g. details of party events
           • subscribe to services on a candidate’s web site that sends text messages to the
             user's cell (mobile) phone.

           Note the key word is “sent”, it does not assume you log on and check the site
           each day.

(c)   Explain two reasons why party documents are stored on web sites in
      PDF format rather than as word processed documents.                [4 marks]

      • PDF files are smaller and faster for users to download – word processed files
        may become very large, especially if graphics are included in the file
      • PDF files are platform independent – word processed files may not open on
        different hardware platforms
      • fonts are embedded in PDF files – fonts may change when opened in the word
        processor if those fonts are not installed on the user’s computer
      • software to read PDF files is free – word processed files may not open if the
        user does not have the software or has an earlier version
      • the original format is retained for viewing and printing – formatting may be
        lost when files are opened in the word processor
      • PDF files cannot be edited so are more secure from tampering than word
        processed files
      • PDF files allow the addition of multimedia files e.g. video promoting the party
        – word processors are limited to graphics
      • PDF files are much easier to navigate than a word document. They often have
        tables of contents with hyperlinks leading to other parts of the document.
        Word processors are limited to searching for words in documents.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      [2 marks] for two reasons identified or one reason described. [3 marks] for two
      reasons described. The response may lack a comparison with word processed
      files at the bottom end of the band. Top end of the band may only have implicit
      comparison with word processed documents.

(d)   Evaluate the increasing use of the Internet in political campaigning
      by candidates.                                                       [10 marks]

      Advantages for candidates
      • e-mail is a cheap and efficient way to run a campaign
      • the Internet reaches a global audience
      • access to party information is available 24/7
      • web pages can incorporate images and multimedia which enhance the
        campaign and make it more personalized
      • blogs provide a medium for a more casual approach that may appeal to
        younger voters
      • forums provide candidates with an opportunity to respond directly to voters’
        questions
      • provide regular update of the campaign trail – uploaded to web pages / through
        RSS feeds / sent to smart phone
      • candidates can collect voter details through forms on their web page /
        subscriptions to newsletters etc.
      • web pages allow voters to donate online
      • YouTube provides a cheap and accessible way to provide promotional videos to
        a global audience without the expense of TV ads
      • social networking sites are free and appeal to the younger voters who may be
        able to leave comments
      • voters feel a more personal connection with the candidate – e.g. RSS feeds
        come to voter’s inbox
      • candidates have control over the information that relates to their campaign
      • social networking sites are simple to use – do not need to be an expert to
        manage the site
      • use of the Internet gives the candidate an edge over competitors who do not use
        the Internet
      • Internet tools make it easy to produce dynamic marketing campaigns which
        can be targeted to specific groups.

      Considerations
      • some of their potential voters may not have Internet access and IT skills
      • hackers can deface/change web pages negatively affecting a campaign
      • authenticity is a consideration – people can pretend to be the candidate and
        publish material on the Internet
      • it is easier for the community to react negatively e.g. posting comments on
        blog pages
      • costs for hosting/developing/updating Internet sites
      • web sites need to be kept up-to-date – voters will get a poor impression of
        outdated web pages
      • candidates must be cautious of what is written on their web sites as once data
        gets on the Internet it is easily shared and its effect can be irreversible.

Advantages for voters
• access to more information – via web site, blogs, wiki, etc. – is this too much
  information?
• can express opinions / join debates by leaving comments on the web site
• convenience – accessible anytime, videos can be replayed
• voting preferences are private and the Internet allows voters to be more
  anonymous (e.g. compared with going to a rally)
• voters out of the country can access documents and speeches, they have access
  to candidates' views
• easy to pass on information to others – e.g. can quickly forward links/emails to
  friends.

Considerations for voters
• may be exposed to misinformation
• assumes voters have Internet access.

In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
related to social and ethical impacts.

           software like that used in the Diagram on the previous page.                [4 marks]

           • gather a database of data – e.g. items in part (a) (i) such as types of glazing,
             ventilation / by researching and documenting real life processes
           • develop formulae / rules and relationships to calculate the expected output
             given different inputs (student may discuss programming the simulation and
             give details of formulae)
           • test the results / test for programming bugs by checking the results conform
             with real life information
           • design the user interface (e.g. layout, choice boxes/lists, buttons) to allow the
             user to choose different inputs and see the results
           • identify the output needed e.g. types of graphs, statistics, animation
           • design of the “Help” feature e.g. word processed document, video tutorial.

(c)   Explain two benefits of using this simulation in the agricultural
      science classroom.                                                [4 marks]

      • schools save money – simulation software is cheaper than setting up and
        maintaining a greenhouse/travelling to visit a greenhouse
      • schools save money as teaching costs can be reduced – simulation software
        allows larger class sizes – practical classes usually have upper limits
      • classes can have access from any network point and do not have to be
        scheduled for practical lessons – software can be distributed across the network
        and made available from any networked computer
      • students can easily revise a difficult concept – the simulation software allows
        them to repeat the experiment at any time
      • students can easily catch up on missed work – they are able to access the
        software from home
      • increased safety – no possibility of an accident involving broken glass
      • no risk of damaging plants/equipment in a real greenhouse
      • a wider range of results would be observed – not limited to scheduled class
        lessons
      • various inputs can be tested – this may not be possible with class time restraints
      • no need to wait for results – immediate feedback on input
      • a hands-on experience is more interesting/valuable than reading a text book –
        students are able to choose different inputs and check the results.

(d)   To what extent should a commercial farmer rely upon a computer simulation
      such as this when planning to build a greenhouse?                         [10 marks]

      • a simulation is a simplification of reality – a limited number of parameters
        (e.g. glazing / ventilation) and choices within a parameter (e.g. types of
        glazing) mean the results will only be an approximation of real life
      • reliability is an issue – if the database of “facts” is incorrect then results will be
        unreliable / if formulae are incorrect then calculations will be wrong
      • simulations need to be tested carefully before implementation – software is
        prone to bugs which can give incorrect results
      • simulations should be used in conjunction with expert advice – there is a
        tendency for people not to question results that are computer generated
      • data may become outdated – weather patterns are constantly changing
      • simulations do not take into account unexpected events – when a user makes
        a choice of parameters (e.g. season and location) the simulation retrieves
        data from the database. This data may not include unexpected events
        e.g. heat waves, floods
      • integrity of data could be an issue if data has been changed/altered from the
        original by another user.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

     (b)   Describe the process used to create a query which would produce an
           alphabetical list of all the citizens who have suffered from diabetes, were born
           after 1990 and do not smoke.                                                     [4 marks]

           • disease = diabetes / diabetes = yes / filter on field disease and type
             in “diabetes”
           • year of birth > 1990
           • smoker = no / filter on field smoker and type in “no”
           • sort by surname/name or select surname or name and choose A–Z.

(c)   Explain the difference between data matching and data mining with reference
      to the Icelandic database.                                                  [4 marks]

      Data matching
      • compares records in different databases to find individuals who appear in more
        than one database e.g. a person in the genetic profile database may also appear
        in a database of diseases
      • may link databases on key fields e.g. ID to build up information about a person
      • ID in the genetic database could be linked to other databases to identify
        the citizens.

      Data mining
      • looks for hidden relationships/patterns in data e.g. between genetic profile and
        various diseases
      • does not generally identify individuals rather identifies patterns in the data
        i.e. uses ID instead of citizen’s name
      • researchers are looking for relationships between genes and diseases.

(d)   To what extent do the advantages to medical research outweigh the concerns
      of some Icelandic citizens about storage of their genetic data?            [10 marks]

      Advantages to medical research
      • genes can be linked to diseases / predict health problems
      • drug companies can design drugs more effectively.

      Concerns of Icelandic citizens
      • genetic information about citizens could be given to drug companies – however
        participation in drug trials could be beneficial
      • people who are not ill but carry the genes may be discriminated against socially/
        in the workplace/when purchasing life insurance
      • data may not be reliable at the level of genetic testing or data entry
      • some citizens may not wish to know if they have a gene that could result in a
        disease later in life
      • DNA is a unique identifier and, once shared, it cannot be retrieved
      • in a small community it may be difficult to mask individual identity in
        the database
      • security of the data – how is it secured against unauthorized access? /
        could lead to identity theft
      • genetic information could result in unexpected revelations e.g. paternity.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.
