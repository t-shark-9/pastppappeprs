1.       (a)   “World food prices have increased sharply over the past five years.”
               With the aid of at least one diagram, explain how one possible demand
               factor and one possible supply factor may have caused this increase.            [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
               • a definition of demand; definition of supply
               • a demand and supply diagram, or diagrams, showing demand shifting to the
                 right and supply shifting to the left
               • an explanation of the adjustment process to a new, higher equilibrium price
               • an explanation of one possible demand factor, e.g. rising real disposable
                 incomes in countries such as China and India, changing tastes
               • an explanation of one possible supply-side factor, e.g. rising input costs,
                 the impact of competitive supply, e.g. more output devoted to bio-fuels and
                 less to food.

               Answers may include:
               • an explanation of any possible demand or supply factors that may also
                 contribute to an explanation of the rise in food prices.

               Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
               which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Consider the following two conflicting views:
      “Food prices are best left to market forces.”
      “Government should intervene to control rising food prices.”
      Evaluate whether rising food prices should be left to market forces or
      controlled by government.                                                       [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • an explanation of being “left to market forces”
      • types of government intervention, e.g. buffer stocks, price controls and
        subsidies
      • arguments for market forces in terms of:
        – the signalling, incentive and rationing functions of price
        – problems of buffer stocks, price controls and subsidies
        – general objections to government intervention such as market distortions,
           implications for the level of taxation and opportunity costs
      • arguments for government intervention in terms of:
        – advantages of the various types of government intervention, e.g. stable
           prices for consumers and producers
        – market failure arguments, e.g. adequate food supply needs to be available
           to the whole population
        – impact of adequate food supply on labour productivity and health
        – equity and equality arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

2.   (a)   Aggregate demand consists of consumption, investment, government
           spending and net exports (exports minus imports). Explain two factors
           that may influence investment and two factors that may influence
           net exports.                                                                       [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
           • a definition of investment
           • a definition of net exports
           • an explanation of any two factors which may influence investment such as
             the interest rate, business expectations, increased consumer demand,
             cost, economic stability and efficiency of capital equipment
           • an explanation of any two factors which may influence net exports such as
             increases in foreign incomes increases a country’s exports, increases in a
             country’s national income leads to an increase in imports, decreases in
             foreign incomes results in less exports from a country, decreases in a
             country’s national income results in a decrease in imports, a fall in relative
             prices (if a country’s goods and services fall in price relative to those of
             other countries) will result in a country selling more exports and buying less
             imports and improvements in the relative quality of a country’s goods in
             comparison to other countries will result in it selling more exports and
             buying less imports.

             when export prices rise as a result of domestic inflation, rising costs or
             greater inefficiency, or appreciation of the currency.

(b)   Evaluate the view that, in the long term, expenditure-switching policies
      (protectionism) are the most effective way to reduce a current account
      deficit.                                                                        [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • an explanation of expenditure-switching and different types of
        protectionism, e.g. tariffs and quotas
      • an explanation of how protectionism may be used to reduce a current
        account deficit
      • arguments against protectionism to reduce a current account deficit,
        e.g. retaliation, contravention of WTO rules, impact on resource allocation
        and efficiency, impact on consumer prices
      • consideration of expenditure reducing policies
      • consideration of exchange rate policies
      • consideration of supply-side policies to shift LRAS right and make exports
        more competitive in the long run
      • consideration of the effect on other government objectives
      • overall assessment.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

           development, and how each of these may be measured.                                 [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
           • a definition of economic growth
           • a definition of economic development
           • an explanation that economic growth is a quantitative concept whereas
             economic development is more qualitative
           • an explanation that economic growth is measured by the increase in real
             national income over a period of time, whereas economic development,
             in addition to the latter, could also include a whole variety of other measures
             such as schooling, life expectancy, provision of healthcare, income
             distribution, political freedoms etc. (just a few examples would suffice).

           Answers may include:
           • a production possibility diagram to illustrate the difference between
             economic growth and economic development

(b)   Evaluate the view that the best way that developed countries can help the
      growth and development process of very poor, highly indebted countries is
      through a general cancellation of debts.                                         [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • a definition of developing, highly indebted countries
      • examples of such countries
      • arguments for debt cancellation in terms of the problems of debt,
        e.g. the opportunity cost of debt repayments, the impact on development,
        the gearing of the economy towards exports, the potentially serious
        implications of the problem on absolute poverty
      • arguments against debt cancellation,. e.g. the danger of moral hazard,
        debt forgiveness and the creation of a dependency culture, the rewarding of
        irresponsible governments and penalizing of committed ones, debt as one
        of just many causes of poverty in developing countries
      • alternatives to debt cancellation such as aid or trade agreements
      • the role of the IMF and World Bank, e.g. through structural adjustment
        programmes
      • an overall assessment as to how the highly indebted countries can best be
        helped: debt write-offs versus effective aid and by industrialized countries
        lifting trade barriers.
