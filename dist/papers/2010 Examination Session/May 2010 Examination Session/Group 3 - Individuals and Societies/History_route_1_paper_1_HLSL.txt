Prescribed subject 1	The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

These sources and questions relate to the Rightly Guided Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (644–656).

Uthman, who succeeded Umar, was a Meccan aristocrat of the Umayyad clan. He reversed Umar’s policies
and favoured Umayyad and other Meccan interests at the expense of the companions of the Prophet and
the Medinans. He redistributed revenues in the interests of the newly migrant large clans. To accomplish
this redistribution of power, Uthman asserted an increased central control over provincial revenues and
required a closer accounting of the Sawafi lands. He also took initiatives in religious matters, including the
promulgation of a standard edition of the Qur’an. Uthman thus … claimed an enlarged authority for the
Caliph to effect social, economic and religious changes.


SOURCE B                Extract from A History of Medieval Islam, J J Saunders (1996). J J Saunders was
                        Lecturer of History at the at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.

... Since Umar had spent as he received, disdaining to accumulate a reserve lest so profane a measure
should cast doubt on the willingness of God to provide for his people; the State Exchequer under Uthman
found difficulty in maintaining the pension payments, and a growing army received diminishing stipends
[payments]. The circulation of money from the looted treasuries of the East far outstripped the production
of goods and services: prices rose, and popular discontent rose with them. Uthman had already excited
criticism by promoting his Umayyad relatives to high office and letting to them lucrative contracts …
Medina complained of the rapacity of the Meccans. The Bedouin tribesmen resented the centralized
control exerted over them in the camp-cities of Kufa, Basra and Fustat. Pious believers were scandalized
by Uthman’s attempt to provide a definitive text of the Qur’an and to destroy all non-authorized copies,
a sensible measure which was twisted into the accusation of tampering with the sacred book.

One can understand why Uthman was accused of nepotism but this is not the point in question. All these
men, with the exception of al-Walid who was dismissed, were very competent, and for the most part
experienced men. Uthman appointed them because of this and because he could trust them since his
position as clan leader now reinforced his relations with his governors. It was a calculated and shrewd
policy to strengthen the position of Amir al-Mu’minin (“commander of the faithful”) even if it was one
open to misinterpretation.

                       Soviet Islamist.

Uthman’s acquisitiveness and business talents gained full scope when he became Caliph. He built himself
a stone house in Medina with doors of precious wood and acquired much real estate in that city, including
gardens and water sources. He had a large income from his fruit plantations in Wadi-ul-Qura, Hunain and
other places, valued at 100 000 dinars, besides large herds of horses and camels on these estates.

Multiplying his riches at the expense of the Moslem [Muslim] treasury, Uthman also gave free use of
the latter to some of the closest companions of Muhammad, attempting to justify his illegal actions by
associating these most authoritative veteran Moslems with his own depredations. The “companions”
applauded the Caliph Uthman for his generosity and magnanimity, no doubt for solid reasons of
self-interest.

Prescribed subject 2		The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

These sources and questions relate to the foundation and early years of the kingdom of Sicily under Roger II
(1130–1154).

Sources in this booklet have been edited: word additions or explanations are shown in square brackets [ ];
substantive deletions of text are indicated by ellipses … ; minor changes are not indicated.

SOURCE A                Extract from The History of the Tyrants of Sicily, Hugo Falcandus. Hugo Falcandus
                        is believed to be an assumed name. This document is believed to have been written
                        in Sicily in the late twelfth century.

[King Roger II] had a keen intellect, never lacked confidence in himself … he was not embarrassed to call
his court together and the opinion of each person … he took enormous care both to sort out present problems
and to make careful provision for the future. […] After much effort, he brought peace to his kingdom
[…] but within a short time, all this tranquillity slipped away and suddenly disappeared, in such a way
that you will easily comprehend that the fortune and condition of kingdoms submits to the character of
their rulers. […] King William I (reigned 1151–1166), the heir to his father’s power and not to his character,
went wild with such a degree of lunacy that he ignored the decisions of his excellent father,
allowed the organization of the court to deteriorate and sent into exile his father’s advisors or locked
them up in prison.


SOURCE B                Extract from The Deeds of King Roger (1127–1136), Alexander of Telese.
                        Alexander was abbot of Telese, and is believed to have written his account at the
                        request of the King’s sister, Matilda, during Roger II’s lifetime.

[Roger] journeyed back to Salerno, and just outside it he met with some learned churchmen, as well
as certain princes, counts, barons and others whom he thought trustworthy to examine this secret and
unlooked for matter. Examining the issue carefully they unanimously decided and insisted with mighty
prayers that Duke Roger ought to be promoted at Palermo, the chief city of Sicily, to the royal dignity
since he held not only Sicily, his hereditary patrimony, but also Calabria, Apulia and other lands –
not just obtained by military prowess, but which had devolved to him by right of his close relationship to
the preceding dukes. For it was certain that kingship had once existed in that city, governing all Sicily;
it seemed to have been suspended for a long time, but now it was right and proper that the crown should
be placed on Roger’s head and that this kingdom should not only be restored but should be spread wide to
include those other regions where he was now recognized as ruler.

The Norman kingdom in Italy was apparently first conceived at a meeting between Pope Anacletus II
and Duke Roger in September 1130. The idea of creating a monarchy is often assumed to have come
from Roger, and he certainly showed consistent determination throughout his life to manoeuvre the
Papacy into a formal position of superiority. Anacletus’ written grant to Roger of a royal crown
can therefore be interpreted as a mere endorsement of Roger’s detailed proposals, rather than a
spontaneous gesture of his own. However, since Roger would never proceed on his own initiative
without papal “authority” to legitimize his actions, it is necessary to understand why papal consent
was forthcoming. Elected on the 14th, and consecrated on the 23rd February 1130 in bizarre circumstances,
Anacletus had faced from the beginning a rival candidate for the Papacy, assuming the title Innocent II.
That Anacletus was more desperate to secure Roger’s loyalty than Roger was to call himself King is most
surely indicated by the concessions Anacletus made to Roger.


SOURCE D                Extract from “Norman Sicily in the Twelfth Century”, in The New Cambridge
                        Medieval History, G A Loud (2004). G A Loud is Professor of Medieval History,
                        University of Leeds.

Roger was granted a royal crown as King of Sicily in a bull [order] of Anacletus II in 1130 – in return
(though this was not expressly stated), for his recognition of Anacletus as the rightful Pope and support for
his cause against his rival Innocent II … At the same time a carefully stage-managed assembly of lords and
churchmen at Salerno endorsed this proposal, on the ostensible (and historically erroneous) grounds that
Sicily had once been ruled by kings and should be so again. The coronation not only involved Roger in the
schism [conflict between the rival Popes] … but by infringing in the most provocative way the claims of the
Western [German] Emperor to rule, or at least to be the overlord, of southern Italy, he incurred the hostility
of the German Emperor Lothar III …

[Some years later] Lothar’s army marched down into Apulia as far as Bari, which was captured in
May 1137, and then into Lucania. For a time this invasion might have seemed to have doomed
King Roger’s mainland rule.
