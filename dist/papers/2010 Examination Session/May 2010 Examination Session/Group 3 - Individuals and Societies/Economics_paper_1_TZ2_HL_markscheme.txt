1.       (a)   Explain the importance of price elasticity of demand and cross-elasticity of
               demand for business decision-making.                                           [10 marks]

               Answers should include:
                 a definition of PED
                 a definition of XED
                 the link between PED, price changes and changes in total revenue
                 the importance of XED in terms of changes in price of substitutes
                 and complements
                 examples of PED and XED in real life (products with high/low elasticities;
                 products related are complements or substitutes).

               Answers may include:
                 an explanation that PED and XED are extremely difficult to accurately
                 measure in reality
                 use of diagrams to show the relationship between PED, price changes
                 and changes in total revenue
                 use of diagrams to illustrate the complement/substitute relationship.

(b)   Studies have shown that the demand for tobacco tends to be highly
      price inelastic. Evaluate the view that governments can best reduce
      smoking by substantially increasing taxes on cigarettes.                            [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        cigarettes as an example of market failure having the characteristics of
        demerit goods
        use of an MSC/MSB diagram to show the negative externalities associated
        with the consumption of cigarettes, candidates may use a simple supply and
        demand diagram
        an explanation of inelastic demand and the implications for a tax
        on cigarettes; low PED means a tax may not lead to a significant decrease in
        quantity of cigarettes demanded
        distinction between inelastic demand for tobacco in general and elastic
        demand for particular brands
        the incidence of taxation may be considered
        consideration of the extent of the tax increase; tax may have to increase a lot
        to have a major impact
        the problem of relating the tax to the value of the external costs
        the impact on government revenues and spending possibilities; revenue will
        increase a lot in view of the low PED
        an assessment of alternative policies such as negative/positive advertising
        and direct controls.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be awarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

2.   (a)   Explain why a country may wish to reduce its unemployment rate.                 [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
             an explanation of the unemployment rate
             an explanation of the types or components of unemployment
             an explanation for wishing to reduce unemployment in terms of the various
             costs of unemployment. This may include the impact on:
             – the unemployed themselves e.g. reduced income, stress levels,
                self-esteem
             – society e.g. poverty, crime, vandalism
             – economy as a whole e.g. actual output is less than potential output
                (to the left of the LRAS curve); or economy is at a point inside the PPC
             – opportunity cost of government spending on unemployment benefits,
                less tax revenues available for other purposes
             a government might wish to reduce unemployment in order to raise tax
             revenue.

(b)   Evaluate a country’s decision to join a free trade area (FTA).                   [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages:
        possibility of economies of scale
        larger export market
        increased competition leads to efficiency and lower prices in the long run
        productive and allocative efficiency
        possibility of increased foreign investment as a way to get inside market
        greater consumer choice of products
        transfer of labour and capital within the free trade area
        fosters political stability
        trade creation.

      Disadvantages:
        increased competition can force inefficient domestic producers out of
        the market
        domestic workers may be unemployed
        competition may only exist in the short run. In the long run, firms may
        merge to keep control of their markets and an oligopolistic or monopolistic
        market structure in the free trade area can result. Higher prices may be the

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

           development, and how each of these may be measured.                                 [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
             a definition of economic growth
             a definition of economic development
             an explanation that economic growth is a quantitative concept whereas
             economic development is more qualitative
             an explanation that economic growth is measured by the increase in real
             national income over a period of time, whereas economic development,
             in addition to the latter, could also include a whole variety of other measures
             such as schooling, life expectancy, provision of healthcare, income
             distribution, political freedoms etc. (just a few examples would suffice).

           Answers may include:
             a production possibility diagram to illustrate the difference between
             economic growth and economic development

(b)   Evaluate the view that the best way that developed countries can help the
      growth and development process of very poor, highly indebted countries is
      through a general cancellation of debts.                                         [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
        a definition of developing, highly indebted countries
        examples of such countries
        arguments for debt cancellation in terms of the problems of debt
        e.g. the opportunity cost of debt repayments, the impact on development,
        the gearing of the economy towards exports, the potentially serious
        implications of the problem on absolute poverty
        arguments against debt cancellation, e.g. the danger of moral hazard,
        debt forgiveness and the creation of a dependency culture, the rewarding of
        irresponsible governments and penalizing of committed ones, debt as one
        of just many causes of poverty in developing countries
        alternatives to debt cancellation such as aid or trade agreements
        the role of the IMF and World Bank, e.g. through structural adjustment
        programmes
        an overall assessment as to how the highly indebted countries can best be
        helped: debt write-offs versus effective aid and by industrialized countries
        lifting trade barriers.
