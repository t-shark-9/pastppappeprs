                                             SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    N-Pharma’s marketing manager recently returned from the USA where he met representatives of
      the animal drug company, Anigam. Following his visit, he prepared a report recommending that
      N-Pharma should diversify into the production and distribution of animal health products
      by subcontracting to Anigam before completing a full merger with the company (Option 3).
      He believes that N-Pharma should initially target the “companion animal market” (the pet market),
      but prepare for growth into other animal species sectors once the N-Pharma brand is established.

      The following are key findings of the marketing manager’s report:
      • In 2009, the global animal health industry was worth almost US$18 billion (Item 1) with a
        growth rate over the previous year of 4.7 %.
      • Since 1999, the “companion animal health market” has grown by 6.6 % per year. It now has a
        share of almost 42 % (Item 2) of global animal pharmaceutical sales.
      • Increasing numbers of pets are being treated for the same conditions that affect their owners,
        such as heart disease and obesity (Item 3). For example, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical
        company Pfizer sells Slentrol, the world’s first anti-obesity drug for dogs.
      • Pharmaceutical companies are creating a range of “crossover products”, adapting existing
        human drugs for animal markets. Selling animal health products would minimize the time and
        cost of research and development (R&D), as N-Pharma could simply adapt and develop its
        existing human drug portfolio, such as Pharmaflo and Pharmaslim.

      The marketing manager knows that several directors are concerned about the risks of this
      diversification as well as merging with Anigam, which has a corporate culture based on project
      teams and matrix structures. Like N-Pharma, Anigam has recently been accused of unethical
      animal experimentation.


      (a)   Identify two benefits for N-Pharma of subcontracting production to Anigam.        [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain the role of a “Kaizen approach to change the corporate culture and
            encourage ethical practices” (line 104) within N-Pharma.                          [7 marks]

      (c)   Examine how the use of Porter’s five forces model can help N-Pharma
            understand its competitive position before it enters the animal health market.    [9 marks]

      (d)   Using a decision-making framework and using information contained in
            the case study and Items 1 to 5, evaluate N-Pharma’s diversification into the
            animal health market and its possible merger with Anigam (Option 3).             [12 marks]

Item 3: Extract of a report from Pfizer about companion animal health
On average, USA pet owners spend US$500 every year for their dogs’ and cats’ healthcare. With the
growth of pet insurance this expenditure is forecasted to increase. The USA market for pet products
and services reached US$35.8 billion in 2008.

Companion animals are living longer and are considered part of the family. For animal health
companies, the opportunity to provide drugs for aging pets is an attractive one. As they age, animals
are being treated for the same conditions that affect their owners, such as heart disease and obesity.
A quarter of all pet dogs and cats in the Western world are obese, according to a recent study by the
USA National Academy of Sciences.

Item 4: Extract from a report about the animal drugs market in 2010
As a result of the world’s growing population and global meat eating habits, the overall market for
animal health products has increased, on average, by 3.6 % between 2005 and 2009.

Companion animals now account for almost 42 % of the world market for animal health products.
Sales of companion animals in the USA were US$4.5  billion in 2003 and forecasted to rise to
US$6.9 billion by the end of 2010. The high market growth rate allows the suppliers of animal health
products to charge premium prices. The demand is so high that there have even been some shortages
in supply.

However, 8 of the 10 largest animal health companies in the world are subsidiaries of big
pharmaceutical companies. The combined market share held by the three leading companies is in
excess of one-third of total global sales. There are significant barriers to entry to the market, both economic
and legal. The market is adversely affected by the economic recession in the short term.

Buyers of animal health products have been able to influence companies to lower prices as the
recession developed. More generic products are entering the market place. Subsequently profit margins
have begun to fall in recent years.

To cut costs, production is increasingly shifting to the regions of the world where labour and technology
is cheaper.
