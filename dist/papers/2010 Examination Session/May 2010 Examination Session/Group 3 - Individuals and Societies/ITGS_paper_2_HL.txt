Answer three questions.

1.    Visits to the bank are becoming less frequent as more customers use ATMs (automated teller machines)
      to carry out banking transactions such as withdrawal of funds or deposit of money. Some people,
      however, are concerned that their accounts may not be safe due to fraud involving ATM cards and
      ATM machines.

      Many banks also offer online services. These services include the ability to check your bank balance,
      transfer money, pay bills and receive alerts.

      (a)   Identify two output devices on an ATM.                                                         [2 marks]

      (b)   Describe one example of fraud involving an ATM card and one possible
            solution to this crime.                                                                        [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain two validation processes that take place when you use the ATM to
            withdraw money from your bank account.                                                         [4 marks]

            outweigh the possible disadvantages for customers?                                            [10 marks]

2.    The World Wide Web has created a new medium that presidential candidates use to campaign
      during elections. Before web technologies were available, candidates used broadcast media
      such as television, radio and newspapers to reach voters.

      Currently, documents from candidates and political parties can be downloaded from a web site in
      PDF format. In addition, many candidates also have a presence on social networking sites such as
      MySpace or Facebook.

3.    With the potential increases in the cost of energy, many farmers in North America are concerned
      about the efficiency of their greenhouses. One possible solution is to use a greenhouse simulator to
      experiment with the different designs and materials in the construction of their greenhouses.

      In a simulation, users can vary inputs and when the simulation is run the results are displayed
      (see Diagram).

      By using the results from a simulator to plan the building of greenhouses, farmers can produce crops
      more efficiently and reduce their energy bills.

      Many teachers find it useful to use simulations such as these in agricultural science classes.

4.    A biotechnology company has been commissioned to develop a database to store genetic data on
      all citizens in Iceland for the purpose of medical research. The country was chosen because of its
      isolation and small population resulting in a small gene pool1.

      Citizens are required to give a blood sample which is processed to provide a genetic profile2.
      This profile can then be matched with details such as age, weight, and medical history to predict
      potential future health issues that may be linked to the genetic backgrounds of individuals.

      Data is made anonymous by replacing personal details with an ID number. This is used as a key field
      in the database. Some citizens have expressed concern about the collection of this data and have
      challenged its legality in court.
