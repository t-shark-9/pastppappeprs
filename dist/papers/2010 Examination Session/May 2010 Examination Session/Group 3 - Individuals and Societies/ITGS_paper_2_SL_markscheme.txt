Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

“ITGS terminology refers to both the IT technical terminology and to the terminology related to social
and ethical impacts.”

                                              SECTION A

                              Area of impact: Business and employment

1.   (a)   Identify two output devices on an ATM.                                                [2 marks]

           •   speaker
           •   screen / monitor
           •   printer (for receipt)
           •   headphone jack and customer plugs in headphones
           •   cash dispenser / slot to dispense cash / tray to dispense money (N.B. where the
               cash comes out is not enough).

           Award [1 mark] for identifying each output device up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                           –4–              M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(b)   Describe one example of fraud involving an ATM card and one possible
      solution to this crime.                                              [4 marks]

      • fraud    – a card skimmer, hidden on the ATM machine, reads the ATM card
                   number and a camera captures the PIN when typed on the keypad
                   (need both for 2 marks).
        solution – biometrics is used to identify the customer / embedded security
                   microchip makes card harder to copy / banks educate customers to
                   look for unusual devices / to shield their hands when inputting
                   PIN / banks check ATMs regularly for scam devices / ATMs sound
                   an alarm if tampered with to alert police / ATM is set up inside
                   a store where it is in view of employees who can report any
                   suspicious behaviour.

      • fraud    – criminals access PIN numbers and encryption codes stored
                   on databases and create counterfeit cards.
        solution – safer encryption methods that store encryption codes separate
                   from PINs.

      • fraud    – criminals divert the ATM card when it is inserted, steal it,
                   then shoulder surf to see the PIN.
        solution – customer education to be aware of criminals near the machines /
                   immediate notification of card loss / banks make areas around
                   ATMs private so onlookers can't look over customer's shoulder.

      • fraud    – phishing scams collect ATM card numbers and PINs through
                   e-mail responses.
        solution – banks educate customers and publicize that they never send
                   e-mails / make phone calls requesting this data / a password in
                   addition to a PIN is required for online transactions.

      • fraud    – new cards and PIN are stolen when sent through the mail
                   to customers.
        solution – activation only occurs when customer contacts bank and provides
                   personal information if telephoning.

      • fraud    – ATM card and PIN stolen. Thief attacks user, steals card,
                   requests PIN.
        solution – biometrics is used to identify customer / install web cam to film
                   ATM, video feed sent to bank or security firm / notify bank of theft
                   and cancel card.

      • fraud    – criminals get card details and PIN – by installing malware on ATM
                   which records the data on the magnetic stripe plus the PIN.
        solution – regularly scan ATMs to check for malware / install ATM inside
                   a store so employees can see any suspicious activity.
                                      –5–             M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


• fraud    – a false ATM can collect the card and record the PIN number that
             the user typed in (the card is then taken from the dummy machine
             by the criminals and used in a real machine to withdraw cash).
  solution – biometrics as identification of the card holder.

• fraud    – a card skimmer is installed in the ATM machine and will go
             unnoticed by the bank customer and with a camera will record the
             details of the card and PIN.
  solution – “banks such as AVB and NBC have provided a green-lit slot
             protector fitted to the slot that reveals any third party reader that
             was placed in there”.

Award [1 mark] for identifying a fraud and [1 mark] for identifying a solution
up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award [1 mark] for each relevant description
up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                              –6–              M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(c)   Explain two validation processes that take place when you use the ATM to
      withdraw money from your bank account.                                   [4 marks]

      • ATM reads expiry date from the ATM card and the expiry date is checked
        against the current date – to verify the ATM card is valid
      • account details are sent to the bank’s central computer where they are matched
        in the customer database – to verify the account is valid
      • the PIN/password is entered – and sent to the bank’s central computer to verify
        it is valid for that account number
      • the withdrawal amount is sent to the bank’s central computer and the amount is
        compared with the balance – to ensure there are sufficient funds
      • the withdrawal amount is checked – to ensure it does not exceed a preset limit
      • the daily number of transactions is checked – to ensure it has not reached a
        preset limit
      • the number of PIN attempts is checked – to ensure it has not reached a
        preset limit
      • ATM checks correct cash is available – checks against list of accepted
        denominations – most ATMs only dispense $ 50 or $ 20 notes so a request for
        $ 105 would not be valid
      • account type is validated – e.g. user can choose Savings or Cheque and this
        must correspond to the user’s account at the bank
      • ATM checks that card is valid – card type is checked against a database of
        approved bank cards to be used in that ATM machine
      • ATM checks 16 digit serial number and description.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2 marks]
      Two processes identified or one process described.

      [3 marks]
      Two processes described with reasoning.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed explanation giving reasons.

      Answers must relate to validation.
                                             –7–               M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(d)   To what extent does the improved customer service offered by online
      banking outweigh the possible disadvantages for customers?          [10 marks]

      Improved customer service
      • more convenient – customers can access banking details from any place they
        can use the Internet
      • time is saved – there is no need to travel to a bank/ATM or queue for bank teller
      • easy access – unlike a bank, access is available 24/7
      • cost saving – travel costs / fees are often cheaper than dealing with a bank teller
      • Internet banking offers more services than an ATM – e.g. bill payment/viewing
        statements online
      • customers may select language / several languages available – when going to a
        bank language will be limited to what the bank teller knows
      • online banking is more anonymous/private – customers do not need to
        discuss/disclose financial details to teller.

      Disadvantages for customers
      • sensitive information is being sent over the Internet / stored on bank server and
        could be accessed by hackers
      • if the web site is down accounts are not accessible
      • customers may not have Internet access or the IT skills to use Internet banking
      • customers are not able to make cash deposits/withdrawals
      • customers need to keep access codes safe and accessible
      • customers need to remain alert to potential scams – e.g. fake web sites posing
        as their bank / phishing scams asking for logons and passwords
      • may not get an immediate response to queries – may have to wait for an
        e-mail reply
      • less human interaction – some customers prefer talking to a bank teller
      • there may be a difficulty correcting errors in online transactions.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

                                              SECTION B

                                      Area of impact: Education

2.   (a)   Identify two types of software, other than an Internet browser, that must be
           available on a student’s computer to make use of this learning environment.  [2 marks]

           •   word processor
           •   audio players
           •   video players
           •   spreadsheets
           •   picture viewers
           •   document viewers (flash documents, PDFs)
           •   decompression software to unzip files
           •   email software.

           Accept product names as Word or Excel.

           Award [1 mark] for any one of the above types of software identified up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe two ways in which teachers may solve students’ problems and
           provide feedback using this web site.                                [4 marks]

           • email – students can e-mail the teacher who will respond to the individual student
           • forum – students can post their questions in the forum where the teachers and
             others can participate and solve problems or doubts
           • online chat – the forum provides a chat area were students and teachers can
             meet (scheduled) and exchange messages to solve problems or doubts
           • uploading files – students may upload files with unfinished work, teachers may
             upload files with samples
           • workshops – use the workshop features to work in teams and where teachers
             can provide feedback
           • teachers can provide audio feedback by uploading an mp3 file – this can be
             downloaded by students and used even without an Internet connection.

                         http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cable-modem10.htm

           Award [1 mark] for each way identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award [1 mark] each for the relevant description up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                              –9–              M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(c)   Explain how the VLE will allow each student access to the area of the
      web site which has the appropriate content of the subject they are requesting. [4 marks]

      • use of logins and passwords grant access to a certain area
      • there is a database of students – the system checks against the database after
        login to assign the proper area/subject and show/allow access to the appropriate
        subject material
      • after login, the student may be presented with a list of subjects to select, with a
        click they reach the desired one
      • students have a different access login for the different subjects they are taking
      • the VLE has a database of participants in the environment with different access
        privileges, some are allowed to read all, others will only read certain areas,
        others will be allowed to add content
      • students may “enroll” in an appropriate course or area and then be part of the
        team/students with access to the materials and forums of the corresponding
        course.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of how the VLE recognizes/grants a student access
      although the answer may lack appropriate reasoning at the bottom end of
      the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed explanation giving reasons of how the VLE provides access to
      the appropriate content.
                                             – 10 –            M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


(d)   Evaluate the implications of the introduction of the VLE for the school and
      for the students.                                                           [10 marks]

      For the school
      • system needs to be implemented – maybe new hardware/software is needed,
        teachers trained, time given to plan new types of lessons and materials, time to
        be available for online students who may be in different time zones
      • it will have IT competent students
      • if students return to their own school they will be able to fit into classrooms and
        lessons with less difficulties
      • they would have to provide different type of assessment than the one used in
        the classroom
      • some teachers may find it difficult to adapt to the use of the new technology –
        even with training some may find the use of the features of the software daunting
      • initial costs may be high – increase of bandwidth, upgrading of file servers,
        teacher training may all have an initial cost for the school.

      For the students
      • they will need to have a computer with an appropriate Internet connection
      • they might miss social interaction in the new places they go to live
      • they might need private tutoring to keep up with the lessons – additional
        expense
      • they might be able to interact with former friends and still participate in
        group activities
      • system failure/electricity cuts could affect them keeping up with their work
      • students may be tempted to have others do the work for them – there is no
        supervision and another student could be providing the answers or the work
      • students may feel more comfortable asking questions to teachers without doing
        it in front of a whole group of classmates
      • students will need greater motivation to work regularly using the VLE –
        responsible attitude or control by parents
      • if meeting times are not arranged previously then students may lose time
        waiting for teachers to answer their questions.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

      Students need to refer to implications for the school and implications for the
      students – if only one is addressed then a max of [6 marks] can be awarded.

      Please see generic markband information sheet on page 21.
                                                   – 11 –            M10/3/ITGSX/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


                            Area of impact: Arts, entertainment and leisure

3.   (a)   Define the term resolution.                                                            [2 marks]

           •   resolution is the number of pixels on a display monitor
           •   the resolution of a digital image is defined as the number of pixels it contains
           •   ppi
           •   density of pixels / number of pixels
           •   dpi.

           Accept dpi as many sites mention this but this is not the expected response.

           Award [1 mark] for “number of pixels”.
           Award [1 mark] for mentioning “on a display monitor” or “contained in a
           digital image”.

     (b)   Digital TV broadcasters are able to provide interactive services.
           Describe two interactive services that could be provided with digital TV. [4 marks]

           • select different camera angles – allow viewer to change the angle to watch a
             football match
           • video on demand – allow viewer to request/select a film and begin watching it
             on demand
           • managing film watching – pause, review, fast forward, skipping commercials
           • some programs may receive text messages from viewers and content is changed
             according to key words in the message
           • viewer participation in games – answering questions broadcasted or guess the
             end of a film
           • surveys and polls
           • interactive program guides
           • providing deaf and hearing impaired people with a text version of dialogue
             (as long as there is evidence that the deaf person had to choose (interact) in
             order for a service to be provided)
           • interactive multiplayer games – (play classic games like UNO and Monopoly
             with friends and family. Try your hand at poker or blackjack. Test your wits
             with puzzle and word games. With an Unlimited Pass, you can play as
             many games as you want, 24/7. Whatever your game, you'll find it in
             GSN Game Lounge – http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/premiums/

           • interactive customer support – (provides complete end-to-end solutions that not
             only include the front-end software, enabling viewers to interact, but also all
             required back-end tools for updating, deploying and operating your interactive
             services – http://www.zappware.com/about/technology.html).

           Award [1 mark] for each interactive service identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain two ways in which a domestic installation such as a digital TV can
      communicate with the digital provider.                                     [4 marks]

      • telephone – satellite viewers return information to the broadcaster via their
        regular telephone lines. They are charged for this service on their regular
        telephone bill
      • ADSL – using the Internet connection users can communicate using a special
        control
      • digital TV cable and set box with return capabilities – and the TV remote
        control user can select choices from screen or text messages.

      (Do not accept: antenna (does not allow for user to send data back to
      broadcaster).)

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of how the domestic installation can communicate with
      the provider but the answer may lack appropriate reasoning at the bottom end of
      the band. [2 marks] for two ways identified or one described. [3 marks] for two
      ways described.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed explanation giving reasons of two ways how the domestic
      installation communicates with the provider.

(d)   To what extent is the growth of video clips on the Internet overtaking the
      need for digital TV?                                                       [10 marks]

      • quality of videos over digital TV is high while videos on the Internet tend to
        have lower resolution to allow for fast download
      • streaming of videos over the Internet may be slow while digital TV provides
        films without delay while broadcasting
      • downloading of videos may take several hours over the Internet – films on
        digital TV are there on demand
      • many Internet videos are there for free, user only pays Internet access –
        digital TV requires a monthly fee (which users pay as well as paying their
        Internet provider fee)
      • wider variety of films are available over the Internet – digital TV has a
        selection of films
      • Internet has been around longer – fewer changes in hardware are expected –
        cable set-top boxes with better interactive capabilities are being introduced
        forcing users to spend money to upgrade their digital TV capabilities
      • online video availability – will overtake digital TV
      • viewers may prefer larger screen TVs even though the same video may be
        obtained and seen in a laptop or computer monitor.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology

4.   (a)   Define the term key field.                                                            [2 marks]

           •   it is unique
           •   it identifies one record in the database / one person in the Icelandic database
           •   an example e.g. ID number of the person
           •   it is used to link tables in a relational database.

           Award [1 mark] for the above points up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe the process used to create a query which would produce an
           alphabetical list of all the citizens who have suffered from diabetes, were born
           after 1990 and do not smoke.                                                     [4 marks]

           • disease = diabetes / diabetes = yes / filter on field disease and type
             in “diabetes”
           • year of birth > 1990
           • smoker = no / filter on field smoker and type in “no”
           • sort by surname/name or select surname or name and choose A–Z.

           Award [1 mark] for each aspect of the query up to a maximum of [4 marks].

           Answers can be in sentence format.
            • search the field disease/sickness/suffering for the word diabetes
            • search the field year of birth for year greater than 1990
            • search the field smoker for values yes/true
            • list citizens that in field smoker have yes or true
            • sort the results by surname/name.

(c)   Explain the difference between data matching and data mining with reference
      to the Icelandic database.                                                  [4 marks]

      Data matching
      • compares records in different databases to find individuals who appear in more
        than one database e.g. a person in the genetic profile database may also appear
        in a database of diseases
      • may link databases on key fields e.g. ID to build up information about a person
      • ID in the genetic database could be linked to other databases to identify
        the citizens.

      Data mining
      • looks for hidden relationships/patterns in data e.g. between genetic profile and
        various diseases
      • does not generally identify individuals rather identifies patterns in the data
        i.e. uses ID instead of citizen’s name
      • researchers are looking for relationships between genes and diseases.

      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of data matching and data mining, although the answer
      may be unbalanced and may not relate to the Icelandic database at the bottom
      end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of the difference between data
      matching and data mining with reference to the Icelandic database.

(d)   To what extent do the advantages to medical research outweigh the concerns
      of some Icelandic citizens about storage of their genetic data?            [10 marks]

      Advantages to medical research
      • genes can be linked to diseases / predict health problems
      • drug companies can design drugs more effectively.

      Concerns of Icelandic citizens
      • genetic information about citizens could be given to drug companies – however
        participation in drug trials could be beneficial
      • people who are not ill but carry the genes may be discriminated against socially/
        in the workplace/when purchasing life insurance
      • data may not be reliable at the level of genetic testing or data entry
      • some citizens may not wish to know if they have a gene that could result in a
        disease later in life
      • DNA is a unique identifier and, once shared, it cannot be retrieved
      • in a small community it may be difficult to mask individual identity in
        the database
      • security of the data – how is it secured against unauthorized access? /
        could lead to identity theft
      • genetic information could result in unexpected revelations e.g. paternity.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the
      ITGS terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology
      related to social and ethical impacts.

           software like that used in the Diagram on the previous page.                [4 marks]

           • gather a database of data e.g. items in part (a) (i) such as types of glazing,
             ventilation
           • develop formulae to calculate the expected output given different inputs
           • test the results to check they conform with real life information
           • design the user interface (e.g. layout, choice boxes/lists, buttons) to allow the
             user to choose different inputs and see the results
           • identify the output needed e.g. types of graphs, statistics, animation

(c)   Explain two advantages of using simulations to design products such
      as greenhouses.                                                     [4 marks]

      • while designing the product the designers and/or final users can get a real
        feeling of the final look of the greenhouse, e.g. 3D views that allow for
        rotations and different views of the product
      • in simulation the parts used in the model such as equipment, furniture,
        hoses and fans may be added to the design and correct measurements to allow
        them to fit into the space available
      • when the simulation runs, values like temperature and humidity can be
        simulated and the efficiency of the model tested before being built, allowing
        for changes
      • simulation can be used several times making some changes to allow the model
        to be used for different users / different climatic environments
      • simulations allow for projects to be presented to a board of investors to show
        the efficiency of the model designed.

      and learning of a science subject?                                           [10 marks]

      • students may use the simulation to try different options (not always present in
        their location) such as temperature, humidity, and observe the results in the data
        provided by the simulation
      • extreme conditions may be simulated in the school lab without risk of damaging
        crops or spending money on plants or equipment
      • data provided by the simulation may be exported and used by students to
        analyse results
      • simulation provides immediate response to a change in the input data provided
        while a real situation would require waiting for days or weeks to see the results
      • simulation may assume certain situations that are not in the knowledge of the
        students and this may provide incorrect information for the students
      • simulations may not consider unexpected events like sudden weather changes
        or plagues for crops and results will not always be real
      • some of the difficulties present in the real world may not be present in the
        simulation and students may not be aware of their existence (time needed to
        plant crops or to harvest fruits).

           Answers may include:
           • the main role of an ISP (Internet Service Provider) is to provide Internet
             service to subscribers (access to web pages, e-mail accounts are part of the
             same service – Internet access)
           • an ISP has a gateway for subscribers to connect to and get access to the
             World Wide Web (WWW)
           • with a dial-up connection purchasing an account from an ISP would give you
             one or more local numbers to call to gain access
           • if you are a digital subscriber to an ISP providing broadband services you
             would pay for access to use their WWW gateway connecting directly through
             appropriate technology
           • ISPs may also provide e-mail accounts for subscribers
           • some ISPs also provide web page hosting with limited storage space
           • they may provide protection in the form of antivirus software and firewalls
           • maintenance and support are services provided by ISP providers
             (e.g. installation/provision of modem, set up of system, cabling etc.,
             problem solving if connection not working via phone or physical servicing /

      the use of file sharing services.                                       [4 marks]

      • slowing down – if computers are heavily involved in downloading/uploading
        files from the file sharing service, other users will have less bandwidth to work
        and access the Internet, making the service slower
      • downloading viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spyware, adware, browser hijackers
        – when sharing files users may download a file which is really a hidden malware
        and it may damage the computer or the network services
      • if the program is open and there is no user downloading, it can still be used by
        outsiders to upload.

      use of P2P sites for file sharing.                                            [10 marks]

      • users may stop downloading/sharing music from these sites and return to stores
        or sites where they have to pay for the music therefore providing them revenue
      • will provide users with Internet sites to buy music legally – need to be present
        in the environment users belong
      • musicians will receive payment when users download or buy their music
      • users may now tend to copy files from other users rather than download them
        and pay for them
      • music industry may be accused of promoting invasion of privacy by government
        as they need to look to be able to identify people who use P2P sites for
        file sharing
      • new musicians may complain as they are now not able to share their songs to
        become known as artists.
