 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
         are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth, historical
        knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in
        nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
        commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
        an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either
        chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
        present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
        contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
        well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   “American independence from Britain was not a revolution but an evolution.” To what
     extent do you agree with this view?

     This will probably be a popular question. Historians have long argued about this topic, thus
     candidates might use their knowledge about historiography where relevant. A possible approach to
     this question could be to define the term “revolution” and then present an argument for a
     “revolutionary movement” and the “evolutionary movement”, which will then allow them to arrive
     at their own conclusion. Either point of view might be accepted providing that the argument is
     supported by historical evidence.
     Some of the arguments might include emerging political philosophy, disputes between Great Britain
     and the colonies, and levels of violence associated with crisis events.

     Revolutionary movement
     A new nation was formed with a republican government based on federalism and the rights of the
     individual. Therefore the independence was social as well as political. The war is often referred to
     as the American Revolutionary War.

     Evolutionary movement
     The changes that are viewed as evolutionary include representative government, expansion of the
     right to vote and written constitution, which had all developed earlier, during the colonial period.
     What was significant about the break with Great Britain was the recognition of an American
     philosophy based on liberty and democracy that would guide the nation.


2.   To what extent were the wars of independence in Latin America due to the grievances of the
     Creoles against the peninsular Spaniards? Support your answer with reference to one
     independence movement.

     Answers could vary according to the selected movement. Candidates might agree or disagree with
     this view but should provide specific examples to support either position. “To what extent”
     indicates that other reasons or causes have to be taken into consideration.

     The wars of independence evolved from a number of internal and external causes, some related,
     some independent from each other. Besides the ideas of the Enlightenment, a number of economic,
     ethnic and nationalist circumstances added to the level of discontent among the Latin American
     population. But the antagonism and bitter feelings between Latin American Creoles and the
     Spaniards, who came to the areas either as government administrators or in private enterprise,
     helped ignite the revolutions.

     Other rebellions and revolutions in the Americas inspired the Creoles into action. The American
     Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789 encouraged Creoles to emulate their
     example. On the other hand, the train of events in Spain itself helped precipitate the independence
     movements. Napoleon’s invasion of 1807, the installation of his brother Joseph as king of Spain,
     the Spanish resistance, the rise of revolutionary juntas to resist Napoleon, and convocation of the
     liberal Cortes in Cadiz all inspired Creoles to take matters into their own hands.

     Do not expect all of the above, but reward analytical essays.

3.   Why did the United States go to war against British North America in 1812?

     From the point of view of the United States, the major causes of the war were: Britain’s seizure of
     American ships and impressments of American sailors; American resentment of Britain (dating
     back to Revolutionary days); the American belief that the British in Canada were arming the
     Indians and inciting them to raid American settlements; and the United States’ ambitions to annex
     Canada and Florida.

     From the point of view of Great Britain: the British feared that the United States would hinder its war
     effort against France, and thus could not permit trade between the two to occur. Also, Britain needed
     sailors for its all-out commercial war and feared United States expansionism.

     The question does not ask for the British motivations for the war, but if it is also included, accept it
     and reward the answer accordingly.

4.   Analyse the effects of the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) on the region.
     The question asks for the effects on the region, thus candidates need to address the impact on both the
     United States and Mexico. For the United States, the most immediate consequence of the war was
     enormous gain in territory. As a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the US gained the Mexican
     territories of Alta California and Santa Fé de Nuevo México, recognition of the US annexation of Texas,
     and set the Rio Grande as the boundary between Mexico and the United States. Also, as part of the
     treaty, the US paid $15 million to Mexico. For the US, the victory affirmed the country’s belief in
     “Manifest Destiny”, increased nationalism and spurred the settlement of California, especially after the
     discovery of gold. However, the new territory and the war itself reopened the expansion of slavery
     question. The Wilmot Proviso, which was approved by the House in 1847, sought to ban slavery in any
     land gained as a result of the war. Though the Proviso died due to Senate inaction, harsh feelings
     continued to exist. Candidates might also discuss the anti-war movement within the US and the training
     that many future military leaders in the American Civil War gained.

     For Mexico, the consequences were disastrous, losing over half its land. Coupled with the earlier loss of
     Texas after the Battle at San Jacinto, Mexico had lost slightly more than two-thirds of its original
     territory. The enormous loss of territory encouraged Mexico to enact policies to colonize its remaining
     northern territories as a hedge against further losses. Some Mexicans relocated further south in Mexico,
     but the vast majority remained in the United States. After losing the war, President Santa Ana resigned
     and went into exile.

     Do not expect all of the above, but reward analytical essays.
                                                   –6–             M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M+

5.   “The Kansas–Nebraska problem destroyed the power of the Southern pro-slavery group.”
     To what extent do you agree with this view?

     Candidates might agree or disagree with this statement. However, they should focus on the
     Kansas–Nebraska conflict and assess its impact on the pro-slavery group and not use this question
     for a rendition of the Civil War. Other factors that might be deemed necessary to support the
     answer and the decline of the Southern pro-slavery coalition could be debated.

     The Kansas–Nebraska problem arose as a result of Stephen Douglas’ proposal for popular sovereignty
     for these territories. Candidates could argue that the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854
     actually strengthened the Southern pro-slavery forces since it rescinded the Missouri-Compromise of
     1820. New territory was open to slavery and possible new slave states would increase the South’s
     political power. The Act angered Northern abolitionists who thought of the Compromise as permanent
     solution to the slavery expansion question and revered it nearly as much as the Constitution.

     Passage of the act turned Kansas into a battleground between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces, with
     both sides sending in hundreds of settlers to determine the outcome. Violence ruled the day. Bleeding
     Kansas, John Brown, the Border War, and the creation of two state governments could be discussed.
     Candidates might argue that the eventual outcome of Kansas becoming a free state actually weakened
     the Southern pro-slavery group.


6.   To what extent was the victory of the North in the United States Civil War due to its superior
     industrial resources and manpower?

     Candidates should recognize that the North’s overwhelming superiority in industrial resources,
     manpower and logistical capacity was a necessary condition for Northern victory. But that is not a
     sufficient explanation. Victory does not always go to the side that is stronger in numbers and
     resources, as Americans knew in 1861 when they looked at the history of their conflict with Britain.

     Candidates need to address the extent to which these factors, as opposed to others, were responsible for
     the Northern victory. Some of the other factors that could be discussed are Lincoln’s leadership, the
     effect of the Emancipation Proclamation, Grant and Sherman’s tactics of total war and the success of the
     Anaconda Plan. Candidates might also discuss reasons why the South lost, but they must focus on the
     initial premise of the question.

     Both aspects should be addressed but allow for some imbalance. If only one aspect is addressed,
     mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


7.   Compare and contrast the successes and failures of one United States leader and one
     Canadian leader between 1865 and 1929.

     There are several choices here – accept any providing that the selected leaders are within the dates
     stipulated in the question. Candidates should deal with both domestic and foreign policy issues.
     Popular choices may be J MacDonald or Wilfrid Laurier.

     If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                 –7–            M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M+

8.   Discuss the impact of the development of the modern state (1865–1929) on the Native
     American population in one country of the region.

     Answers to this question should focus on the given dates, therefore do not accept renditions of the
     European-indigenous relations during the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries. There are many
     possible choices for this topic, but the most popular will probably be the United States, Canada,
     Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Regardless of the selected country the answers have to be supported
     by specific evidence and examples.

     The impact of modernization on the indigenous people during this period was negative. Several
     forces were behind this situation: doctrines of Social Darwinism and Progressivism; the opening of
     new territories; the development of railroads and settlements and, in some areas, the need for
     labour. These developments brought displacement, starvation and, in some cases, annihilation of
     the Native American population. Governments used different means to achieve these goals, ranging
     from relocations and “unequal treaties” to warfare and extermination campaigns.

9.   Assess the role of Canada in the First World War.

     Canada’s role was a significant in Canada’s evolutionary path to full nationhood. In 1914 English
     Canadians answered Britain’s call, thousands volunteered. Canada’s small peace time army of 4,000
     grew to over 600 000 by war’s end (the nation’s population totaled 8 million). By 1917 the army had
     transformed from a militia rabble into an elite assault formation lead by Canadian General Arthur
     Currie; an outstanding soldier. Canadians fought at Ypres (1915), the Somme (1916) and
     Passchendaele (1917) and the 100 Days (1918). The “made in Canada” victory at Vimy Ridge
     (9 April 1917) is hailed by leading Canadian historians as Canada’s coming of age. Thereafter, Prime
     Minister Borden demanded Britain treat Canada as an equal resulting in Resolution IX in May 1917.
     French Canadians (30 % of the population) did not support “Britain’s war” and enlistment in Quebec
     and non-British immigrants, lagged behind English Canada. Heavy losses and dwindling volunteer
     enlistments pressured Borden to announce conscription in May 1917. English Canadians applauded,
     French Quebec did not. Borden called an election. The “Khaki election” of December 1917 tore the
     country apart. Borden prevailed, conscripted 125 000 men, 25 000 went overseas. The Canadian
     economy grew and prospered notably wheat sales and manufacture of artillery shell. The war’s cost was
     heavy. Over 60 000 killed, 154 000 wounded; the conscription crisis created a deep and lasting divide
     between English and French Canada. The Canadian Corps was a source of national pride and was
     considered the best formation on the Western Front by 1918. Canada earned a seat at the Versailles
     treaty, an unimaginable development in 1914, membership in the League of Nations and began pursuing
     an independent foreign policy. These changes were formalized by Britain in the Statute of Westminster
     (1931) which gave Canada control over its foreign policy.

     Do not expect all of the above and reward answers focused on Canadian impact.
                                                     –9–              M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M+

10.   Define the United States’ policy of Moral Diplomacy and discuss its impact on the region.

      Answers to this question should be focused on Latin America. Do not accept responses that discuss
      US entrance and participation in the First World War in Europe. Candidates would probably select
      the case of Mexico to illustrate the application and impact of the policy, however, the choice of
      other cases should also be accepted.

      “Moral Diplomacy” or “Missionary Diplomacy” is a descriptive label often applied to the policies
      and practices of the United States in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean during the
      presidency of Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921). He believed that governments in the area should be
      selected in a democratic manner. Countries that were democratic or appeared democratic would be
      supported; those that were not would face pressure from the United States. President Wilson changed to
      this because of his dissatisfaction with former President Taft’s Dollar Diplomacy. He first implemented
      Moral Diplomacy when he chose not to recognize President Huerta as the legitimate ruler of Mexico,
      making a distinction between “de jure” and “de facto” governments. Wilson believed it was the moral
      duty of the United States to show Latin American nations how to be democratic, even if it meant using
      military force or financial pressure.

      For Latin American nations, this meant American interference of one kind or another was not far away.
      Presidential elections and economic development in Nicaragua and in Haiti were strongly influenced by
      the presence of American troops. Cuba and Panama also experienced American intervention. Moral
      Diplomacy created seemingly permanent hostility between the United States and Latin America. This
      was especially true in the countries that experienced Wilsonian interventionism.

      Both aspects should be addressed but allow for some imbalance. If only one aspect is addressed,
      mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


11.   “Lázaro Cárdenas’ rule (1934–1940) renewed the ideals of the Mexican Revolution.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      This could be a popular question. The answers to “to what extent” will be, probably, “to a large
      extent”. But accept different views provided they are analytical and supported by relevant
      arguments. To some, Cardenas is seen as the embodiment of the ideals of the Revolution, but accept
      different views provided they are analytical and supported by relevant arguments.

      Cárdenas’ goals were to regain the revolutionary credibility that had stagnated. He is credited with
      giving definite shape to the political system that lasted in Mexico until the end of the 1980s.
      Candidates could argue that under his leadership, the ideals of the Constitution of 1917 came to fruition.
      The centerpiece of his domestic policy was the renewal of the agrarian reform, in which over 43 million
      acres of land were redistributed to peasant communities. Other parts of his Six Year Plan included
      increased unionization rights for industrial workers and higher wages, the building of modern schools,
      and nationalization of railroads and foreign oil companies. Relations with the Catholic Church were
      also healed during Cárdenas’ rule. On the other hand, candidates could argue that despite these reforms,
      Mexico was still controlled by an elite class.
                                                   – 10 –           M10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M+

12.   Analyse the influence of the Mexican Revolution on the arts.

      Candidates might analyse one or two of the famous muralists. That is a valid approach, providing that
      they address the revolutionary aspect. More recently, a painter, also related to the group, has been
      recognized: Frida Kahlo. She could also be a very good choice. Other arts such as literature, music and
      dance are also acceptable.

      Between 1920 and 1924, extensive campaigns in education and literacy were made in Mexico. As part
      of these campaigns, the government sponsored the development of the arts in order to increase Mexican
      pride in their cultural accomplishments. The muralist movement was also born in this period under the
      auspices of the state. The leading muralists, Diego Rivera, José Orozco and David Siqueiros, were hired
      to memorialize the Revolution with frescos on municipal buildings. The outpouring of images and
      pictorial themes which came from the muralist movement disseminated the notion of the legitimizing
      Revolution among the masses, and brought about an increased sense of nationalism.

      In addition to the above other arts such as literature, music and dance are acceptable.


13.   “The prosperity of the 1920s in the Americas was more apparent than real.” Using examples
      from two countries of the region, evaluate the validity of this statement.

      This question asks candidates to explore the real problems that were beneath the optimism of the
      1920s and that eventually resulted in the Great Depression of 1929. Candidates might take different
      approaches to answer it, but better answers will address the positive aspects of the period while
      indicating the limitations and latent dangers underneath them. A basic answer about the causes of
      the Depression should not be awarded more than [13 marks].

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   Why was there opposition to the New Deal policies of Franklin D Roosevelt?

      The New Deal attracted much opposition: from the political right and the political left. Candidates
      that choose to answer this question could focus on the groups (or individuals) and arguments of the
      opposition, or on the individual programs of the New Deal and opposition to them.

      Liberty Leaguers (Right)
      Many of the wealthy, who had supported Roosevelt in the darkest days of the Depression as the
      saviour of capitalism, turned against him when it seemed that capitalism was saved. This was in
      part because of the increase in taxes, which they opposed, and also what they perceived as too much
      continued government involvement in the Depression. The Liberty League was formed in 1934 to
      promote private property and private enterprise. Its members saw Roosevelt as a traitor to his class
      and some labelled him a communist.

      Other groups/persons
      End Poverty in California (Upton Sinclair), Share our Wealth (Huey Long), Old Age Revolving
      Pensions Inc. (Francis Townsend), National Union for Social Justice (Father Charles Coughlin),
      Thunder on the Left (a coalition of leftist groups). Each one of these individuals or groups had their
      own particular argument or agenda. However, a common theme was their desire to see more
      government intervention and greater distribution of wealth.

      Do not expect all of the above, but reward balanced and well-informed answers.


15.   Analyse the social and economic effects of the Second World War on one country of the region.

      Effects could be taken from both during and after the war.

      Social effects
      Changing status and attitudes toward social groups: women, African Americans, Native Americans,
      “enemy aliens”, demographic changes and new legislation that affected these groups.

      Economic effects
      Economic growth, end of Depression, Post-war economic problems, changes in the economy,
      patterns of trade, demobilizations and changes in employment and unemployment, labour
      migration.

      If only one type of effect is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks]. However, allow some
      imbalance in the answers.

16.   “The atomic bombs were necessary to end the Second World War.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      This is a highly debated topic which requires balanced judgements and historical evidence. It is not
      a question about the moral justification of dropping the bombs, but about the options that existed
      before the decision was made. Candidates might also argue Truman’s political motivations for
      doing it. Those can be accepted if answers are factual and analytical.

      There was considerable disagreement among United States’ officials about Japan’s capacity to
      continue the war. Many believed that a costly invasion of the home islands would be required
      before Japan surrendered. A repetition of the resistance shown during the islands fighting and of
      the kamikaze tactic was expected. Battles on Iwo Jima and Okinawa appeared to foreshadow the
      kind of defence the Japanese would make on their home islands; an invasion surely would take a
      large toll of both American and Japanese lives. Assuming that the alternatives were invasion or
      dropping the atomic bombs, American and Japanese casualties in the invasion would have far
      exceeded the losses at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.


17.   Assess the results of the Silent Revolution (Quiet Revolution) in Canada during the 1960s.

      Greatly influenced by post-war decolonization in Algeria and the US civil rights movement, the Quiet
      Revolution began in Quebec. Led by Jean Lesage’s Liberal government elected in 1960 behind the
      slogan “maitre chez nous” (masters in our house), the movement sought to end English Canada’s
      dominance and modernize Quebec’s institutions. Traditional Quebec had been rural and Catholic;
      during the revolution it became urban and secularized. The hydroelectric industry became a public
      utility and control of education was wrested from the Roman Catholic Church. Health care and social
      services were next. Of particular concern was protecting French language and culture surrounded by
      English North America and controlled economically by English Canadians. Culturally, the revolution
      produced a renaissance in Quebecois art and music. This fear was heightened by growing anxiety
      spawned by a decreasing birth rate. Lesage demanded and won concessions from the Federal
      government that Quebec deserved special recognition. Quebec would operate federally funded
      programs such as old age pensions. The result was that by 1970 Quebec had put in place mechanisms
      and programs to protect Quebec’s language and culture, control the economy through government
      intervention and had successfully negotiated de facto special status with the Federal government. An
      unintended outcome was the growth of a two-headed separatist movement. The Partis Quebecois, led
      by the charismatic Rene Levesque, popular with young Quebecois separatists, won the 1976 provincial
      election. The other, was the terrorist Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ) that bombed, kidnapped and
      murdered. The 1970 October crisis was the FLQ’s high point and final act. In sum, in less than a
      decade, The Quiet Revolution had succeeded in permanently changing Quebec and redefining
      federal-provincial relations in Canada.

18.   Compare and contrast the rise to power of two populist leaders in Latin America between
      1945 and 1979.

      Candidates will find many examples to answer this question. Almost all Latin American nations
      have experienced populism at one point, but the time frame excludes the first periods of Vargas
      (1930–1945), and Lázaro Cárdenas (1934–1940). Possible examples could be Perón in Argentina,
      Castro in Cuba, Kubitschek, Goulart and Quadros in Brazil, and Betancourt in Venezuela, Paz
      Estenssoro in Bolivia, Ibáñez in Chile and Velasco Ibarra in Ecuador, but accept any other relevant
      figure provided that the individual is a “populist leader” and fits into the period. Furthermore, valid
      examples are limited to those populist leaders who actually became rulers.

      A good strategy for this question is to begin with the definition of populism. Populism can be associated
      with a left-wing or right-wing ideology. More generally, however, populism defies any singular
      recognizable category.

      Some of the issues to be considered are: methods by which the leader came to power; groups that
      supported him and opposed him. Did ideology play a role in the rise to power? If yes, which was
      it; if not what appeal did he offer? What was the political, social or economic environment of the
      country which promoted his rise?

      If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


19.   Analyse the successes and failures of President Kennedy’s foreign policies towards Latin
      America between 1961 and 1963.

      Kennedy’s policies toward Latin America have to be understood within the context of the Cold
      War, the core of the United States’ policy until its end in 1991. While many candidates might focus
      on Cuba, the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, the question is broader than that. Besides these
      actions against Cuba, the US suspended economic and/or broke off diplomatic relations with several
      dictatorships between 1961 and 1963, including Argentina, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
      Guatemala, Honduras and Peru. Unlike Cuba, these suspensions were imposed only temporarily. A
      major part of Kennedy’s Latin America foreign policy was the Alliance for Progress. The program was
      signed at an inter-American conference at Punta del Este, Uruguay, in August 1961. It promised to
      spend $10 billion in the region, improve economic cooperation between nations and promote social and
      political reform within Latin American nations. To some the Alliance was a success, increasing
      economic growth in several countries and promoting democracy. Others might consider it a failure and
      cite increased debt of Latin American nations to the US, corruption and inefficiency, and the increasing
      number of military dictatorships.

      The question addresses Latin America. Narratives answers that address events without linking them
      to policies do not fully address the demands of the question.

      Do not expect all of the above, but reward balanced and well supported examples. If only successes
      or failures are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

20.   “During the Cold War, Canada and the United States had disagreements about policies.”
      To what extent do you agree with this view?

      Answers to this question will probably go to the middle ground and state “to some extent”.

      During the Cold War Canada and the U.S. remained close Allies, but at times relations became strained
      particularly during the 1960s and 1970s. The 1950s was a time of close cooperation militarily and
      diplomatically. Examples: 1949 NATO (Canada garrisoned 10 000 soldiers to Europe), the Korean
      War, NORAD (1957) and the DEW line. The first sign strain came with Cuba (1959) and Canada’s
      refusal to break off diplomatic relations or embargo Castro. Canada refused to join the OAS over US
      support of Latin American dictators. Canada also recognized the People’s Republic of China. Relations
      between PM Diefenbaker and President Kennedy were strained over the issue of missiles. Diefenbaker
      refused to arm the Bomarc anti-aircraft missiles with nuclear warheads, rendering them useless. During
      the Cuban missile crisis, Diefenbaker was upset when Kennedy had not immediately advised of the
      crisis and dragged his heels mobilizing Canada’s military which angered JFK. Pearson replaced
      Diefenbaker (1963) and installed the warheads. However, in 1965 Pearson, while visiting the US,
      criticized US bombing of North Vietnam. President Johnson was furious, confronted Pearson and
      relations remained strained thereafter. Canadian criticism of the war grew. Canadian chemical
      companies supplying the US with defoliants were scourged. Canada accepted thousands of draft
      dodgers. (Note: Over 30 000 Canadians volunteered with US forces and fought in Vietnam, over 100
      were killed in action). Trudeau replaced Pearson and initiated a “third way” foreign policy that cut
      Canada’s NATO contribution by half, reduced the military and appeared to some U.S. observers as
      steering Canada towards neutrality. Trudeau believed US policies had created/ responsible for much of
      the Cold War tension. Nixon did not trust Trudeau. Trudeau spent time with Castro and visited a
      number of communist countries. Relations became cordial in the 1980s with the close friendship of
      P.M. Mulroney and President Regan. Despite periodic criticism of US Cold War policies, economic ties
      increased and mutual defense of North America remained a cornerstone.


21.   With reference to two countries of the region, to what extent did the civil rights of Native
      Americans change from the 1960s to the 1980s?

      Answers will vary according to the selected countries.

      Some of the aspects that might be discussed are: greater equality; rights to vote; education and
      self-government; use of the legal system for protection; restitution of lands and compensations. “To
      what extent” also indicates consideration of some of the aspects that still remain unsolved.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

22.   Why was the African American Civil Rights Movement in the United States more effective in
      the years 1954 to 1964 than in the late 1960s?

      The question suggests an analysis of the main factors that contributed to the effectiveness of the
      movement between 1954 and 1964 and a consideration of those that made the later movement less
      so. A detailed account of the Civil Rights Movement is not to be expected.

      Some of the factors that contributed to the achievements in the first stage were: the aims and
      methods of the protesters in some areas of the United States; Martin Luther King’s leadership in the
      campaigns; the Federal system and its institutions; the role of the Supreme Court; the Civil Rights
      Acts (1957, 1960 and 1964); the sympathy and coverage of the media; the work of the National
      Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) and other civil rights associations;
      and to some extent the idealism of youth movement at the time. Some of the factors that made the
      late 1960s less effective were: racism; black rivalries and aggressive tactics; white backlash; loss of
      leadership and the impact of the Vietnam War.

      Do not expect all of the above, but reward well-selected and analysed factors.


23.   To what extent do you agree with the view that during the last decades of the twentieth
      century, access to new technology increased the gap between rich and poor nations?

      It is possible that answers to this question will agree with this view. However the topic is much
      debated, and opinions are highly divided about this issue. Nevertheless, reward well-argued and
      balanced answers supported by relevant examples.

      There is little doubt that in the past 20 years, in many parts of the region, in areas where computers have
      enjoyed their greatest use, the distribution of income has become increasingly unequal. This is certainly
      true among blue-collar workers earning less today than a generation ago, while earnings of professionals
      have surged. The ones that have more knowledge, and more access to technology, receive better paying
      jobs. The situation is even more severe in the developing world. There are many reasons for the gross
      disparity, including the facts that technology-led economic growth is faster in developed countries than
      in developing countries, while population growth is faster in the developing countries. The gap is not
      just in economic growth, but might also be seen in living conditions, education and health care.

      Examples could be taken from either one or more countries within the region.

24.   Analyse the foreign policy of President George H W Bush (1989–1993) towards two countries
      of the region.

      Candidates will probably select Panama, Canada and Mexico; the last two can be combined in
      North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

      Panama
      Candidates are likely to discuss President Bush’s actions in removing Manuel Noriega from power. In
      1989, Bush responded to Noriega’s nullifying the results of a presidential election, by sending additional
      troops to Panama. Bush may have hoped that this would convince Noriega to reverse his action, and
      allow the newly elected president Guillermo Endara to take office. It did not, and Bush increased the
      tensions diplomatically by removing the American ambassador and militarily by sending in more troops.
      Noriega tightened his control of the country. In December 1989, Bush decided to intervene after
      Panamanian forces killed an American serviceman. Additional US forces were sent in as part of
      Operation Just Cause, which resulted in Noriega’s capture and the installation of Endara as president.
      Candidates might see this action as another example of US interference to control Latin American
      nations, or as protecting a democratically elected leader from a military coup.

      Canada and Mexico/NAFTA
      Candidates are likely to choose one or both of these nations. In either case, the candidate will probably
      discuss the creation of NAFTA, which eliminated the majority of trade barriers among the three
      countries. In Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney teamed with Bush to negotiate an agreement
      acceptable to both sides. In Mexico, President Salinas worked with Bush to produce similar results.
      The agreement was signed by all three in 1992, and approved by Congress during the Clinton
      presidency in 1993. The treaty has had supporters and adversaries in all three countries.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
