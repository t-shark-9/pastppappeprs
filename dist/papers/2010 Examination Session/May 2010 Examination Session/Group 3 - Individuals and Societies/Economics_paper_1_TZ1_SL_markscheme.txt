1.   (a)   With the aid of at least one diagram, explain the difference between a
           movement along an existing demand curve for a good and a shift of the
           demand curve for a good.                                                              [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
           • a definition of demand
           • an explanation that a change in the price of the good itself leads to a
             movement along the existing demand curve as the price of the good is one
             of the axes
           • a reference to the ceteris paribus assumption
           • a correctly labelled diagram showing movement along the demand curve
             and the resultant change in price and quantity demanded
           • an explanation that a change in any of the non-price determinants of demand
             will lead to a shift of the demand curve to either the left or right e.g. income,
             tastes, price of other goods
           • a correctly labelled diagram showing a shift of the demand curve for a good.

           Answers may include:
           • examples of goods to illustrate such movements and shifts, particularly
             complements and substitutes
           • diagrams may or may not include a supply curve to illustrate the change in
             price and quantity.

           Both a movement and a shift in demand needed for full marks (one or two
           diagrams may be used).

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
           which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Evaluate the view that the market forces of demand and supply will
      always lead to the best allocation of resources.                                   [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • a definition of resource allocation, best allocation of resources
      • an explanation that “market forces of demand and supply” refers to a free
        market system in which demand and supply are left alone to set prices in the
        economy
      • an explanation of “invisible hand”
      • an explanation of how the price mechanism is signalled by changes in
        consumer demand and producer supply
      • an explanation of how price acts as an incentive to consumers to make
        decisions about how to get the best value for their money
      • an explanation of how price acts as an incentive to producers who decide
        how to best allocate their productive resources in order to make the most
        profit
      • an explanation that prices will rise or fall until a shortage or surplus is
        eliminated and there is an equilibrium price and quantity arrived at in the
        market
      • an explanation of how consumers acting in their own best interest and
        producers acting in their own best interest produce a situation in which there
        is no pressure in the market and resources are optimally allocated
      • an explanation that the free market rarely leads to the best allocation of
        resources because of market failures
      • reference to some market failures (lack of provision of public goods,
        overprovision of demerit goods, externalities
      • an explanation that government intervention is often necessary to assist in
        resource allocation and correct market failures.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

               • an explanation of any two factors which may influence government
                 spending such as the population structure (e.g. an aging population), the rate
                 of interest/cost of government borrowing, unexpected events, e.g. a credit
                 crunch, war, the economic cycle (government spending usually rises in the

        employment, price stability and the balance of payments

        and structural unemployment
      • the possibility of demand pull inflation, depending on where the economy is
        operating
      • the adverse impact on balance of payments if there is a large increase in
        demand for imports
      • consumption financed by credit, payments default and the credit crunch,

(b)   Evaluate the view that, in the long term, expenditure-switching policies
      (protectionism) are the most effective way to reduce a current account
      deficit.                                                                        [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • an explanation of expenditure-switching and different types of
        protectionism, e.g. tariffs and quotas
      • an explanation of how protectionism may be used to reduce a current
        account deficit
      • arguments against protectionism to reduce a current account deficit,
        e.g. retaliation, contravention of WTO rules, impact on resource allocation
        and efficiency, impact on consumer prices
      • consideration of expenditure reducing policies
      • consideration of exchange rate policies
      • consideration of supply-side policies to shift LRAS right and make exports
        more competitive in the long run
      • consideration of the effect on other government objectives
      • overall assessment.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

           development, and how each of these may be measured.                                 [10 marks]

           Answers should include:
           • a definition of economic growth
           • a definition of economic development
           • an explanation that economic growth is a quantitative concept whereas
             economic development is more qualitative
           • an explanation that economic growth is measured by the increase in real
             national income over a period of time, whereas economic development,
             in addition to the latter, could also include a whole variety of other measures
             such as schooling, life expectancy, provision of healthcare, income
             distribution, political freedoms etc. (just a few examples would suffice).

           Answers may include:
           • a production possibility diagram to illustrate the difference between
             economic growth and economic development

(b)   Evaluate the view that the best way that developed countries can help the
      growth and development process of very poor, highly indebted countries is
      through a general cancellation of debts.                                         [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • a definition of developing, highly indebted countries
      • examples of such countries
      • arguments for debt cancellation in terms of the problems of debt,
        e.g. the opportunity cost of debt repayments, the impact on development,
        the gearing of the economy towards exports, the potentially serious
        implications of the problem on absolute poverty
      • arguments against debt cancellation,. e.g. the danger of moral hazard,
        debt forgiveness and the creation of a dependency culture, the rewarding of
        irresponsible governments and penalizing of committed ones, debt as one
        of just many causes of poverty in developing countries
      • alternatives to debt cancellation such as aid or trade agreements
      • the role of the IMF and World Bank, e.g. through structural adjustment
        programmes
      • an overall assessment as to how the highly indebted countries can best be
        helped: debt write-offs versus effective aid and by industrialized countries
        lifting trade barriers.
