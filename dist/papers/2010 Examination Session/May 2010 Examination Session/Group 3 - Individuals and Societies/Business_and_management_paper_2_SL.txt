Answer one question from this section.

1.      Natura Cosméticos

        Natura Cosméticos is a Brazilian company that manufactures and sells a range of cosmetic products
        including shampoo, soap, make-up and creams that protect against the sun. Natura Cosméticos has
        ethical objectives and has built its success on the high quality of its products and on the company’s
        commitment to sustainable development1. Natura Cosméticos’ mission statement states that it is:

                          “committed to building a better world through sustainable development”.

        Natura Cosméticos uses natural ingredients from the Amazon rainforest. The company supports
        local villagers in planting their crops using traditional sustainable techniques.

        Excerpt from the profit and loss accounts for Natura Cosméticos for the years ended
        31 May 2006 and 2007
                                            2006 2007
         Sales revenue                      2800 3123
         Cost of goods sold                  891    X
         Gross profit                          X 2131
         Expenses                              X 1453
         Net profit before interest and tax  644    X
         Interest                             34   90
         Tax                                 149  156

        Natura Cosméticos sells its products in recyclable packaging through a direct sales distribution
        network of more than 60 000 self-employed2 “partners” in Brazil. These “partners” are mostly
        women working part-time on profit-related pay. This approach works well because employment
        opportunities in Brazil are limited, wages are low, and it allows flexible working. Consumers also
        like direct distribution because of the personal service and close interaction with the “partners”.

        Natura Cosméticos has experienced an average annual growth in revenue of 25 % between 1995
        and 2003. In 2006, the company built a new manufacturing plant to accommodate future growth.
        This was financed by a new long-term loan.

2.    Aravind Eye Care

      Aravind Eye Care is the world’s largest provider of eye surgery. Founded in 1976 in India by
      Dr Govindappa Venkataswamy, the non-profit organization can perform 250 000 operations
      per year. At Aravind Eye Care, only 40 % of the patients pay for the operation, which costs
      them US$60. The other 60 % of the patients, who would otherwise not be able to afford the
      operation, do not pay.

      Aravind Eye Care has transformed the process of eye surgery in developing economies.
      Expensive medical equipment has been purchased but is used 24 hours a day in order to lower
      the average cost for each operation. In Aravind Eye Care hospitals, surgeons perform only
      the eye operation itself whereas in other hospitals, doctors also provide care before and after
      the operation. At the Aravind Eye Care hospitals, each doctor can perform 4000 eye operations
      per year, whereas other eye surgeons in India average 400.

      With these economies of scale, in 2007 Aravind Eye Care performed 100 000 operations for
      fee-paying patients. For these patients:
      • the price charged per operation was US$60
      • the variable cost per operation was US$20
      • fixed costs including overheads were US$3 000 000.

      In recognition of their extraordinary efforts to improve health in developing countries,
      Aravind Eye Care received the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation award in 2007.

Answer two questions from this section.

3.       Ecosoluciones

         Ecosoluciones is a non-profit research organization located in Madrid, Spain. One of their
         objectives is to try to introduce non-polluting sources of electricity in developing countries.
         One successful application of their research was the Alumbre Project. This provided electricity
         created by wind generators to the remote village of Alumbre, Peru, which previously had none.




               [Source: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?picture=wind-turbines&image=452, 17 December 2009]


         In Alumbre, wind generators were installed by Ecosoluciones to supply, for the first time,
         electricity to a textile factory, one of the few firms in the area operating in the secondary sector.
         Ecosoluciones also agreed to maintain and repair the generators. There was a complete
         transformation in the production process. The factory was able to buy new machinery. Productivity
         increased dramatically. New jobs were created.

         Ecosoluciones also promised, in partnership with Peru Telecom and the Peruvian government,
         to help fund the improvements in communication between Alumbre and the rest of Peru. This also
         allowed regional trade to develop. The entire community experienced significant improvements in
         their quality of life. The Peruvian government saw this as a practical solution to develop other
         depressed areas* of the country.

         Unfortunately in 2008 a severe financial crisis hit Europe and the Spanish government suspended
         part of its funding for research organizations such as Ecosoluciones. As a direct result, the
         management of Ecosoluciones felt it may no longer be able to maintain Alumbre’s wind generators.



* depressed area: a region or locality where business, employment, and stock-market values have declined severely or are at a
     very low level of activity

4.    Coca-Cola in Tajikistan

      Coca-Cola uses two types of distribution channels globally:
      • a short channel of delivering small orders to thousands of retail outlets directly
      • a long channel through intermediaries such as distribution centres.

      In 2009, Elena Rudaki started up her Coca-Cola distribution centre in a town in Tajikistan where
      the mountainous roads are in very poor condition. As a sole trader and franchisee she employs
      five people, who use carts pulled by horses to distribute bottles of Coca-Cola to nearby villages.
      Before she opened her distribution centre, Coca-Cola checked that she had access to appropriate
      sources of finance as well as a business plan. As part of the franchise contract, Elena and the other
      distribution centre owners do not pay a fee to Coca-Cola. However, in return Coca-Cola must be the
      only drink they buy and sell. Elena knows it is very restrictive.

      Coca-Cola believes that distribution centres are successful because they are owned and operated
      by local entrepreneurs who understand the local culture. For Coca-Cola, the distribution centre
      model has led to increased consumption of their products as well as improving local economies
      by encouraging business start-ups and creating jobs. Many distribution centre owners are women,
      like Elena, who used her profits to buy a new house and pay for her daughter’s education.

      Before entering the Tajikistan market, Coca-Cola had considered using a short distribution
      channel, from a central storage facility (depot) in the capital city, Dushanbe, direct to the retailers.
      However, they decided to implement a system of distribution centres for their distribution.

      (a)      Identify two features of a sole trader.                                                                [2 marks]

      (b)      Comment on two appropriate sources of finance which Elena Rudaki might
               have used to set up her distribution centre.                                                           [6 marks]

5.     Bajaj

       In India, the market leader in motorbike manufacturing is Bajaj, with a 34 % market share. There are
       many market segments for motorbikes. For some target markets, price is the most important factor.
       Other target markets are willing to pay more for extra features, such as better styling*. Bajaj is
       market orientated and offers 12 different models to satisfy the needs of various consumer profiles.

       Bajaj has an extensive distribution network even in remote areas. Twice a year, Bajaj carries out
       primary market research through surveys, focus groups and interviews with their customers about
       the quality, reliability and safety of the Bajaj motorbikes. This is particularly important in remote
       areas where there are few garages to either service or repair them.

       In the last 10 years the company has also gained a significant share of other markets, including
       the Philippines, Colombia and Tajikistan. This was done through strategic alliances. One of the
       company’s long-term objectives is this continued expansion in international markets.

       For its international markets as in India, Bajaj is determined to make sure that each model of
       motorbike satisfies local needs and preferences. One proposal is to use franchising to enter
       international markets.

       (a)     Outline briefly the difference between market orientation and product
               orientation.                                                                                          [2 marks]

       (b)     Comment on the appropriateness of “surveys, focus groups and interviews”
               as methods of primary market research for Bajaj.                                                      [6 marks]

       (c)     Analyse the usefulness of market segmentation and consumer profiles for
               Bajaj.                                                                                                [5 marks]

       (d)     Evaluate the use of franchising as a growth strategy for Bajaj.                                       [7 marks]
