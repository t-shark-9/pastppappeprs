                  A vision statement defines where an organization wishes to see itself in the
                  future sometimes optimistically.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award
                  [1 mark].

                  Public relations is a process of obtaining hopefully favourable
                  (occasionally free) publicity via the media in editorials in newspapers or
                  television for example.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

            [1 mark]
            The candidate conveys some understanding of what a cash-flow forecast is,
            but otherwise the forecast is largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

            [2 to 3 marks]
            A cash-flow forecast is drawn, but either it is not in a generally accepted
            format or it is untidy, and the forecast contains two or more errors.

            [4 to 5 marks]
            The cash-flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a
            generally accepted format. Award [5 marks] if there is one error, [4 marks]
            if there are two errors. If the candidate produces an accurate cash-flow
            forecast (that is, the final closing cash balance is correct and the means by
            which the candidate arrived at that figure is clear and logical) but does not
            use a generally accepted format, award [5 marks].

            [6 marks]
            The cash-flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally
            accepted format, and is error free.

            Do not penalize a response more than once for errors that are carried
            forward.

(ii)   Comment on your results from part (i).                                          [3 marks]

       (1)   The cash-flow forecast reveals a worrying deterioration in the
             cash-flow position of NPF. Although the organization was set up with
             a generous contribution we must assume that cash reserves must be
             running low.

       (2)   There are forecast to be very marginal improvements in August and
             October (the negatives are slightly smaller than the previous month)
             but the sponsorship of the concert in November will impose a
             significant drain on cash resourcing at a time of dwindling donations.


       Allow discretion when Own Figure Rule (OFR) applies to the comments.

       Award [1 mark] for overall deterioration: [1 mark] for marginal
       improvements in August and October. [1 mark] for November outflow.

       Award [1 mark] for each correct and appropriate comment based on the
       forecast, such as the breakdown above, up to a maximum of [3 marks].

(iii) Explain two possible solutions to the liquidity problems highlighted in
      parts (i) and (ii).                                                     [6 marks]

       They can either reduce the outflow or increase the inflow, or elements of
       both.

       NPF could:
         Try to secure a bank overdraft to increase cash inflow. It may be difficult
         to obtain this with no assets to be used as collateral but NPF has no debt
         in 2010.
         Seek a fresh injection of capital from the retired businessman or find
         another investor which holds a similar view and vision about educational
         opportunities for children in developing countries. The fresh injection
         will clearly increase cash inflow.
         Try to co-sponsor the concert with another charity through a joint venture
         or strategic alliance in order to reduce the cash outflow.
         Fundraise through e-commerce or other merchandising opportunities to
         increase the cash inflow.
         Negotiate lower fees for web design and maintenance or find more
         socially responsible providers – in order to reduce outflow.
         Any other relevant solution.


       Mark as 3+3.

       Award [1 mark] for a brief and general answer (possibly just a list) with no
       development/explanation.
                                             –8–             M10/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


            Award [2 marks] for an adequate explanation of the possible solution to the
            liquidity problems highlighted in parts (i) and (ii), though the response may
            be lacking in clarity or detail.

            Award [3 marks] for a clear and detailed explanation of the possible
            solution to the liquidity problems highlighted in parts (i) and (ii). Reference
            is made to the stimulus material.

(c)   Analyse the impact of two external threats on NPF’s decision to sponsor
      the concert.                                                            [6 marks]

      It is evident that there may be some technological problems/ threats in the external
      environment. While the slow/failed connections may frustrate the paid viewers,
      one may argue that the online broadcast fits well with NPF’s vision and the threat
      can somehow be reduce by the acceptance of the viewers. Moreover, the event
      can enhance NPF’s goodwill and provide a good opportunity for PR.

      The poor economic environment is also a threat. It is likely that perhaps not many
      people will donate online. Hence NPF will not be able to cover the sponsorship
      costs. Moreover, a social threat can be a public opinion that NPF should not
      really sponsor such an event given the opportunity costs – payment for
      educational opportunities for children. However, it is said that an online
      community of social networking web sites exists. Perhaps the threat is not a
      significant one as the members of these web sites are likely to donate money.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      Do not accept investors/online users, donators or volunteers as “external factors”.
      If pressure groups are covered it should be classified under social attitude
      acceptance.


      For one relevant issue that is one sided, award up to [3 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced analysis,
      award a maximum of [4 marks]. If the impact of only one external threat
      is analysed, award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a sole trader.                                  [2 marks]

                  These include but are not limited to:
                    unlimited liability – a firm’s finances are not separate from the owner’s
                    owned by one person but may have a number of employees
                    limited capital for expansion
                    any other relevant characteristic.


                  Award [1 mark] for each appropriate, correct characteristic identified, up to
                  a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Define the term cross-elasticity of demand.                                     [2 marks]

                  Cross-elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of demand for one
                  product, when the price of another product changes. The term is used to
                  help define substitutional and complementary relationships between
                  products.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  As the formula is given award [0 marks] if the candidate merely writes the
                  expression down.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

            Calculations:
                                                             12 000

       Award marks as follows:
       [1 mark] for appropriately labelled axes.
       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve. Own Figure
       Rule (OFR) applies.
       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn fixed costs and target profit curve.
       [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output (whatever the
       value) and [1 mark] for showing the correct value of the break-even level of
       output.
       [6 marks] in total.

       The margin of safety is not expected to be identified (despite the diagram).

       If the break-even chart is accurately drawn but not neatly, using a ruler or
       straight-edge, or out of proportion, award a maximum of [3 marks].

       If the candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0 marks].

(ii)   Calculate the total profit of The Berkeley if it shows “Film X” twice and
       comment on your results.                                                  [3 marks]

       Total profit for The Berkeley if both showings sell out
       TR = 2400 12 = 28 800
       TC = FC + VC
           = 12 000 + (6 2400)
           = 12 000 + 14 400
           = 26 400

       Total profit = 28 800 – 26 400 = US$2400


       [1 mark] only for correct answer.

       The break-even point is 1000 tickets sold for one showing with a margin of
       safety of 200 tickets. After satisfying the target profit of US$10 000, Ed will
       be left with a cash boost of US$2400.

       Award [1 mark] if comments only refer to the fact that Ed will be making a
       profit compared to the current loss making situation.

       Award [2 marks] for a further development of the magnitude of the profit.
       Also, possibly but not necessarily comments on the break-even point or on
       any other information in the stimulus material.

(iii) Using The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, explain two reasons
      for the manager of The Max’s decision to offer to takeover
      The Berkeley.                                                       [6 marks]

     The BCG matrix need not be written in full although a number of
     candidates will do so. The key is to be able to apply elements of the matrix
     to The Berkeley as being part of The Max’s portfolio. There is no correct
     classification here. Marks will be awarded for appropriate explanations
     relevant to the stimulus.

     Possible applications:
     If The Max sees itself as a cash cow with limited potential for growth
     given the technological/social external environment then The Berkeley could
     be perceived as:
        A problem child (question mark) with The Max seeing the potential to
        develop it further as it complements the mass market audience of
        The Max.
        As a dog blocking out potential competition – defensive reasons for
        acquisition.
        One could argue that the manager of The Max may regard The Berkeley
        as a potential star that can be moved into the cash cow position with a
        new marketing plan and appropriate financial investment. This can be
        seen as a defensive move of the proposed acquisition.
        Alternatively, The Max might see itself as a cash cow with limited
        potential growth, looking at a takeover as an extension strategy.

     There is no exact information in the stimulus material in order to identify
     the exact position of The Berkeley’s product therefore accept any reasonable
     explanation in context.

     Accept any other relevant explanation.


     Mark as 3+3.

     Award [1 mark] for a brief and general answer (possibly just a list) with no
     development/explanation.

     Award [2 marks] for an adequate explanation of the reasons for the manager
     of The Max’s decision to offer to takeover The Berkeley, though the
     response may be lacking in clarity or detail. For [2 marks] there should be
     some use of the BCG matrix.

     Award [3 marks] for a clear and detailed explanation of the reasons for the
     manager of The Max’s decision to offer to takeover The Berkeley.
     Reference is made to the stimulus material and accurate use is made of the
     BCG matrix.

(c)   Analyse the relative importance of driving and restraining forces on
      The Berkeley if Ed decides to show “Film X”.                         [6 marks]

      A full force field analysis is not required but some candidates may wish to
      highlight the key forces in a diagram. This would constitute part of the analysis as
      long as the relative importance of each constituent part is analysed afterwards as a
      separate section. If the candidate only provides a Lewin type analysis but no
      examination, then the candidate should not proceed to [3 to 4 marks].

      Key driving forces:
        Ed’s determination to achieve his ambition for his niche audience
        the ability to spread his passion for “world cinema” or “festival” movies
        a fear of consenting to the takeover bid by The Max as Ed, the sole trader,
        is facing difficulties
        the fragile state of the finances of The Berkeley with the majority of films
        shown not breaking even
        use of technology at home affecting the nature of demand for The Berkeley’s
        films
        Judd’s previous success and anticipated demand for the premiere of “Film X”.

      Key restraining forces:
        fear of irrevocably changing the perception of The Berkeley away from
        Ed’s ambition
        fear of imitation or me-too aspect with respect to The Max, which might
        damage The Berkeley as they do not have the economies of scale or financial
        muscle to compete with The Max
        fear of alienating existing customers.

      The key driver would seem to be finance and the change in home viewing habits
      situation. Most of the restraining forces will be weakened if The Berkeley is
      threatened with closure due to external factors. We do not know the extent of the
      financial position but clearly with only 40 % of films returning a small profit,
      Ed must show “Film X” and generate a revenue boost to stave off extinction
      before he can think about satisfying his loyal customers and fulfilling his
      ambition.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      For one relevant issue that is one sided, award up to [3 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [4 marks]. If only the driving forces or the restraining forces are
      analysed, award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    innovation                                                                     [2 marks]

                  The process of innovation is defined as the successful commercial creation
                  of a new idea, which adds value to the market place. Innovation should try
                  to create or fulfil existing needs that are not currently being satisfied.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award
                  [1 mark].

           (ii)   distribution channels.                                                         [2 marks]

                  A distribution channel is a process or system, which a firm puts in place in
                  order to deliver the product to the end user or customer. Channels can be
                  long involving a number of intermediaries or short where the producer
                  delivers the good to the end user themselves.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and

(b)   Explain the role and importance of obtaining a patent (intellectual property
      rights) for the Hendriske brothers in producing the Q-Drum.                  [6 marks]

      The importance:
      With new innovations, which may add significant value to the market place but
      also involve personal sacrifice and risk on behalf of the innovator, the need for/
      the role of intellectual property right protection is crucial.

      The role:
      The main role of a patent is to give the Hendriske brothers the right to produce the
      product without competition for a number of years and thereby allowing the
      following important issues/factors:
         Reward for the risk taking – strong feature of an entrepreneurial economy.
         Recoup valuable funds from research and development spending, which could
         encourage the Hendriske brothers to develop future innovative ideas.
         Legal mechanisms will be automatically put in place if competitors who are too
         similar try to exploit the Q-Drum’s innovative approach. The USP of the
         organization will be protected for the duration of the patent – a marketing
         advantage. A brand image can be created. A market share can be captured/
         market dominance can be created.
         Adds a considerable intangible value to the company assets – a financial
         advantage.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      At least two issues must be covered for full marks.

      Award [1 to 2 marks] for a general or limited response and/or no reference to the
      stimulus material.

      Award [3 to 4 marks] for some explanation with reference to the stimulus
      material of the importance and role of obtaining a patent (intellectual property
      rights) for the Hendriske brothers, though the explanation may be lacking in
      clarity or detail. Either the role or the importance may be overlooked.

      Award [5 to 6 marks] for a thorough explanation of the importance and role of
      obtaining a patent (intellectual property rights) for the Hendriske brothers that
      includes meaningful reference to the stimulus material.

(c)   Analyse two reasons why “innovators and designers only research and
      develop products that target the needs of the planet’s richest 10 %”. [6 marks]

      With R&D costs being a drain on cash reserves for any entrepreneur with no
      guarantee of payback for ideas, which may not have a commercial value (even if
      they may be perceived as innovative!), innovators and designers may feel
      compelled to target customers who are keen and able to purchase at the early
      stages of the product’s life cycle of those innovative products because:
         early adopters may purchase and generate positive word of mouth
         (snowballing)
         early adopters may be used as target market participants to see if the product
         has the potential for mass market, minimizing risk and launch costs
         early adopters may be willing to pay higher prices and thus profit margins may
         be set somewhat higher than in mass markets
         targeting early adopters may reduce initial promotional and distribution costs
         any other relevant reason.

      However, by trying to accommodate the demands/needs of price inelastic
      customers / the early adopters, innovators and designers are clearly missing out on
      satisfying the needs of 90 % of the planet. The stimulus makes reference to US$2
      sunglasses, a US$10 solar light and a US$100 house that can be purchased by a
      billion customers. The option of global mass production can reduce the risk of
      failure and loss of R&D costs.
          through large scale production of these items, economies of scale could be
          earned allowing the potential for huge price reductions and significant market
          share
          innovators and designers are missing out on the possibility of becoming a
          global brand with significant opportunities for social marketing.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      The question was written to focus on early-adopter targeting but any other suitable
      targeting or high income segmentation should be rewarded. Model answers on
      early-adopters are not expected.

      The issue is that there is not much information in the stimulus material for the first
      part of the question “why innovators and designers only research and develop
      products”. Hence do not penalize a candidate who does not make a direct
      reference to the stimulus for the first part of their answer.

      To reach the top markband candidates should still make reference to the stimulus
      in their analysis, as indicated in the markscheme.

      For one relevant issue that is one sided, award up to [3 marks].

      For a one sided but relevant response, award up to [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss an appropriate marketing mix to increase sales of the Q-Drum.                  [9 marks]

      As this is a product and not a service it is expected that the 4P’s will be used.
      The following are merely suggestions. The key for higher order marks is that the
      mix is discussed and is in context, indicating good analysis and evaluation.

      Reference to all 4Ps is required to access the top markband.

      Price: Clearly needs to be lower than the current US$50, if the intended market is
      the developing world where access to water is limited and GDP per capita
      incomes are very low in comparison with the developed world. A lower price will
      be possible if the NGO will help with the market development as suggested in the
      stimuli. However, the brothers might be worried that lower price might be
      perceived as lower quality. Price discrimination can also be used provided that
      the re-sale of the product is not possible. However, those who might be charged
      higher prices might be upset and abandon the purchase.

      Product: The Q-Drum needs to be manufactured from cheaper materials to affect
      the above-mentioned lower price. Larger production runs will result in
      economies of scale, thus lowering unit costs with positive implications for pricing.
      However, the quality of Q-Drum and therefore the reputation of the brothers may
      be negatively affected

      Promotion: A new promotional effort is required to highlight the life-saving
      attributes of the Q-Drum. Perhaps using a quotation from Dr Paul Polak in the
      point-of-sale of material if above the line promotion is too expensive. However,
      is the message in the stimulus really relevant for the customers/those in need?
      Are they really looking for an innovative and revolutionary product? Explore the
      possibilities of viral marketing, which is cheaper than traditional methods.
      However, does the company have sufficient funds to launch a new promotional
      campaign? How effective would this be, given the target market?

      Place: Perhaps an alliance with the NGO would improve the distribution
      channels. The NGO should have close contact with the people on the ground that
      need the product. Moreover, the Q-Drum can be sold directly to the NGO.
      Issues of time, cost and control in setting up new distribution networks.
      There is not enough information on what the role of the NGO could be in
      in this process.

      Larger production runs and economies of scale will only achieve the reduction in
      price and cheaper manufacturing costs. Difficult to see in the short run given that
      only a few hundred have been sold.

      It is not expected that the candidate will produce one definite conclusion nor
      should they cover all of the above points. Clearly, the final decision regarding the
      adaptation of the marketing mix will depend among others on:
         How long has the patent left to run? Will there be imitators perhaps produced
         by multinational companies?
         Should the Q-Drum try to find a financial partner other than the NGO?

      Accept any other relevant discussion.

           Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows
           balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
           stimulus material but there is no judgement/conclusion.

           Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgement/conclusions
           that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

                  The objectives of a business can define both the purpose and aims of the

                  Revenue is the income generated from a firm trading in goods and services.
                  It is calculated by multiplying the volume of goods sold by the average price
                  or from break-even analysis: the quantity sold price.

(b)   For The Master Bean, explain the meaning and value of goodwill with
      internal and external stakeholders.                                 [6 marks]

      Goodwill can be explained in a number of ways. In the case of The Master Bean,
      Tom Cain’s decision to source his coffee beans under the Fair Trade Agreement
      and pay higher than perhaps market prices may generate positive stakeholder
      satisfaction raising the value of the business above that represented by the
      financial accounts. (In accounting terms, goodwill is only valued when a going
      concern is sold.)

      The value to The Master Bean can be expressed in a number of different ways but
      at the root is that the value of goodwill can act as a powerful differentiator:
          allows The Master Bean to position itself away from some of its other
          competitors
          may act as an incentive for recruitment and retention of key workers who have
          been with Tom since its inception
          goodwill is an intangible asset, in this case, Tom’s reputation with his
          suppliers.

      of goodwill with internal and external stakeholders that includes meaningful

(c)   Analyse two reasons why a firm such as The Master Bean may change its
      objectives over time.                                                 [6 marks]

      From the stimulus material, it appears that Tom Cain treated The Master Bean as
      a hobby/passion initially. His objectives were not profit maximization or revenue
      maximization. Survival or break-even were more important initially. These
      objectives are typical of new businesses when a lot of uncertainty is surrounding
      the new business. However, as the business became more established, 35
      employees were employed, the objectives changed into growth and ensuring a
      substantial market share.

      Increasing market share would have added financial security to the business and
      allowed bulk purchasing of beans albeit at above market prices, which began the
      source of his desire to introduce a strong ethical stance.

      The ethical stance may have also been important in determining the positioning of
      The Master Bean away from its competitors. Tom might have used this objective
      as a USP/differentiator to further improve his TR/profit.

      However, given the nature of the product and some of the external factors beyond
      Tom’s control presented in the stimulus – weather, crop harvests and political
      factors especially in primary product markets. It must be noted that the profit has
      fallen in the last four years and therefore objectives may have been changed
      possibly away from being ethical/socially responsible. We also need to consider
      what is meant by an acceptable or reasonable time frame to change objectives.
      For Tom it has been more than four years.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

(d)   Discuss the two strategic options available to The Master Bean.                        [9 marks]

      The dilemma highlighted in the title of the stimulus is whether Tom tries to
      protect his ethical stance at the risk of rising costs and losing some valued staff,
      or keeps The Master Bean as a going concern with a return to profitability but
      with his ethical credentials in jeopardy.

      Some of the arguments are:
      Option 1:
                         For                              Against
       No redundancies.                    Goodwill and ethical stance at risk.

      Option 2:

           Judgment may include the following issues:
              What is the strength of Tom’s ethical position?
              How poor is the financial position? Could Tom secure some local financing
              such as an extended overdraft to tie him over until the firm returns to
              profitability.
              If The Master Bean is important to Tom, he may have to relocate and risk
              losing key staff. As a member of the trading bloc he may be able to secure
              member grants and allowances. Like other trading blocs such as the EU, there
              will be other advantages to becoming a member, which the stimulus material
              has not articulated. We may need further information.

5.   (a)   (i)   Identify two characteristics of a laissez-faire leadership style.              [2 marks]

                 Characteristics:
                   a laissez-faire leadership style is effectively a paradox because strictly
                   speaking there is no formal leadership at all
                   a laissez-faire leader sets broad goals for subordinates and clear
                   parameters within which they work
                   workers may be given the freedom to work without supervision
                   informal groups may have disproportionately more power
                   individual goal setting may conflict with overall organizational
                   objectives if the management style is too informal
                   any other relevant characteristic.

                 At WJAZ Radio, the presenters enjoy the freedom to work on their
                 own terms. This may be typical of creative and media industries.


                 Award [1 mark] for each correct characteristic identified, up to a maximum
                 of [2 marks].
                                             – 23 –         M10/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M+


      (ii)   Define the term variance.                                                     [2 marks]

             A variance occurs when an actual figure, such as expenses, is much higher
             or lower than the figure forecasted or more likely budgeted.


             Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

             Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
             understanding.

             Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
             understanding similar to the answer above.

(b)   Explain two reasons why budgets are important for organizations such as
      WJAZ Radio.                                                             [6 marks]

      With WJAZ Radio spiralling out of control, the use of budgets would seem critical
      although there is evidence of them not being used effectively! Budgets can help
      departments set financial goals and act as important motivating and
      accountability mechanisms. For a company such as WJAZ Radio, with an
      informal management style, accountability for one’s actions has to be monitored
      otherwise every worker’s position is under threat if the station goes out
      of business.

      Setting budgets is important but variances allow firms to see if these budgets are
      being adhered to. They act as an additional control mechanism. Having a
      laissez-faire leadership with empowerment is sustainable only if budgets are
      agreed and adhered to. If budgets are ignored, then one has to question whether
      the appropriate leadership style is in place.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

(c)   Analyse two solutions to the communication failure present at WJAZ Radio.            [6 marks]

      The informal laissez-faire leadership style is leading to communication problems
      both internally and externally. We can speculate that communication failure may
      have arisen due to:
         Senior management not sending any communication regarding the problem.
         Too informal an environment for effective communication. Given the
         laissez-faire leadership style the communication channels are not established
         and therefore not clear. Perhaps there is also confusion as to the direction of
         communication between the senders and the receivers and the need for
         formality etc.
         Few meetings and an ineffective use of electronic communication such as
         e-mails and phones.
         Agents in the network adding another element in the communication channel.

      Given all of the above points the presenters are not fully aware or interested in
      WJAZ Radio’s problems financial or external.

      Solutions
        To call possible meetings/briefings for all presenters in order to outline the
        financial issues facing the station.
        Treat non-communicative workers as a contractual issue given the culture of
        the organization – instil formal written procedures.
        Set official procedures and methods.
        Use a variety of communication channels – electronic boards, general meeting,
        individual meetings, etc.
        Ensure that the message and the communication channels are clear.
        Establish clear lines of responsibility and official communication channels
        between the presenters, their agents and Elaine (perhaps a new organizational
        chart could be drawn).
        Perhaps reduce the electronic communication or supplement it with other
        methods, both verbal and written ones.
        Accept any other relevant solution.

      However,
        The above changes do not really fit the current laissez-faire leadership style
        used in WJAZ Radio. Changes in the organization structure and culture will
        have to supplement the changes in communication.
        These changes will take time and resources, especially drawing up roles and
        responsibilities where there previously had been none, but impatient advertisers
        may want to see quick results that audience reach of WJAZ Radio is at least
        stabilizing.
        Moreover, some presenters may quit and move to other stations as they are
        used to and appreciate the laissez-faire leadership style. Resistance to change
        may emerge.
        Elaine will face resistance and will have to draw up a contingency plan again,
        taking time and resources.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      For one relevant issue that is one sided, award up to [3 marks].

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [4 marks]. If only one solution is analysed, award a maximum
      of [4 marks]. Answers must focus on solutions and not just highlighting
      communication failure.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Evaluate the effectiveness of the laissez-faire leadership style present at
      WJAZ Radio.                                                                 [9 marks]

      The current situation is unsustainable for WJAZ Radio and the leadership style
      needs to change. The freedom, which the radio station has allowed the key
      presenters to enjoy, is now undermining the financial viability of the station.
      Keeping the status quo will only exacerbate the issues outlined in the stimulus.

      The dilemma facing Elaine is that she must change the culture of WJAZ Radio to
      ensure that the freedom the presenters currently enjoy is balanced by some degree
      of accountability, without resorting to a mass desertion of some of the station’s
      brightest presenters to rival radio station (although it is tempting to suggest that
      this may be a risky way of reducing the wage bill!).

      However, this will not be easy given that the prevailing laissez-faire leadership
      style allowing presenters to work outside of the station has generated substantial
      publicity and goodwill and, most importantly, advertising revenue.

      It must be acknowledged that the laissez-faire leadership has allowed WJAZ Radio
      to become a market leader and has been very successful in launching
      successful bands. It is also said that the presenters are motivated because of this
      leadership style. In a rapidly changing industry such as popular music, a rigid
      bureaucratic or autocratic leadership style may not be appropriate.

      Changing the leadership style may also raise short-term costs of transition and
      redesigning the organizational structure. Elaine has recently started at the station
      and thus changing the culture may be easier than she imagines, perhaps by
      allowing some autocratic measures to address the financial problems. She may be
      able to use the variances to introduce the changes that are clearly needed and
      communicate to the station as a whole that the issues facing the station are serious
      and should not be treated lightly.

Possible judgment:
With WJAZ Radio in serious financial trouble, some quick changes in leadership
are needed. At this current time, a laissez-faire leadership style may be
inappropriate. However, this does not rule out it being useful in the future,
once stability has been reached. Perhaps, Elaine should change to more of a
paternalistic/democratic leadership style rather than directly to autocratic.
Open discussion and honesty with her staff about the financial situation,
the reasons for the change needed, as well as participation and involvement of her
staff in the change management could somewhat reduce the fear of and the
resistance to change.

Accept any other relevant evaluation.
