                       An explanation that they are where a firm earns a level of revenue that
                       is greater than the total costs of production, including opportunity
                       costs (or where a firm earns a level of revenue that is greater than that

           oligopoly can earn abnormal profits (a monopoly diagram) or an
           explanation of how oligopolies can act together as a monopoly, charging
           a profit-maximising price that is higher than the costs of production and
           therefore earn abnormal profits.

            For drawing a correctly labelled diagram showing a fall in the LRAC or
            an explanation that economies of scale are achieved when the
            supermarkets’ costs per unit of output (or average costs) decrease as the
            level of output increases (a percentage increase in inputs results in a
            larger percentage increase in output) as a result of e.g. bulk buying
            (or any other economy of scale).

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate a decision by the Australian government to reduce the total
      market share of the three largest supermarket chains to 75 %.                     [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      Reasons in favour of such a decision:
        reduce market share for the three largest supermarket chains allowing for
        greater competition (paragraph ) with the benefits of competition such as
        lower prices, higher output and more choice
        less (productive and allocative) inefficiency in the allocation of resources
        less risk that the dominant firms will achieve dominance in other areas
        e.g. banking (paragraph )
        greater opportunity for smal independent food stores
        greater employment opportunities if overall output increases
        a possible slowdown in food price inflation.

      Reasons against such a decision:
        extended hours of service to the consumer may be reduced (paragraph )
        rental agreements may not be favourable for the large chains (paragraph )
        less employment and career opportunities in the large chains (paragraph )
        a reduction in the potential for economies of scale for the large chains
        (paragraph ) with higher prices as a result.

      Additional points:
        reducing the market share from 80 % to 75 % might make little difference to
        the market
        a better policy might be for the government to ensure that collusion does not
        take place.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

                         An explanation that an indirect tax is a tax on expenditure (or a tax
                         levied on goods and services).

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the role of fiscal policy in stimulating the USA economy.                 [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
        an explanation/definition of fiscal policy
        an AD/AS diagram showing a rightward shift of AD
        a reference to Keynesian policies.

      Positive role that fiscal policy may have:
        the effect direct investment may have on business investment
        (paragraph )
        the possible effect on consumer spending (paragraph )
        lower production costs as a result of tax cuts in indirect taxes
        (paragraph )
        direct tax cuts increase disposable income (paragraph )
        supply side benefits of increased government spending on infrastructure
        possible increase in business confidence (paragraph )
        multiplier and accelerator effects
        impact on employment.

      Negative role fiscal policy may have:
        inflationary pressures conflicting with growth and the desire to stimulate the
        economy (paragraph )
        is the package powerful enough to convince investors?
        inflexibility in that it cannot be changed easily and quickly
        time lags for policy measures to have an effect
        financing a budget deficit
        “crowding out” effect of increased borrowing
        could add to the trade deficit.

                revenue from tariffs could help reduce the budget deficit (paragraph )
                tariffs on imported goods will discourage their purchase and so less imports
                will reduce the current account deficit (paragraph )
                tariffs will encourage production in domestic import-competing industries
                tariffs can protect and encourage employment in domestic industries
                tariffs contribute to a dead-weight loss of welfare (paragraph ), because
                of the loss of consumer surplus
                tariffs lead to an inefficient allocation of resources (paragraph ), because
                goods are produced by relatively inefficient domestic farmers as opposed to
                more efficient foreign farmers
                tariffs can have an inflationary impact in a country with an existing problem
                of high inflation (Table 1)
                tariffs could encourage producers to diversify (paragraph ) and avoid the
                risk of over-specialization
                the introduction of tariffs may result in retaliation which may affect export
                industries making it difficult to achieve export-led growth
                the tariffs may go against WTO rules (Pakistan is a member)

      Responses may include:
        explanations of diversification and specialization.

      Arguments in favour of diversification (and against specialization):
        avoids long-term declines in commodity terms of trade
        avoids extreme agricultural price fluctuations (paragraph )
        avoids developed country barriers to trade (agricultural subsidies)
        reduces vulnerability to “shocks” such as extreme weather conditions
        (paragraph )
        takes advantage of possibilities offered by “craft industries” and tourism
        (paragraph )
        diversification into manufacturing provides opportunities for increased
        employment, use of new technologies and development of skills
        diversification allows countries to achieve economic transformation

        by rising sea levels (paragraph )
        by diversifying, countries may produce a good or service in which they
        might have a comparative advantage.

      Arguments against diversification (and in favour of specialization):
        specialization according to comparative advantage increases productive
        efficiency and the quantity of output produced
        specialization and trade according to comparative advantage allow countries
        to consume at a point outside their PPC
        specialization according to comparative advantage improves the global
        allocation of resources
        specialization allows countries to take advantage of economies of scale
        specialization allows farmers to take advantage of increases in food prices

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate fair trade as a means of improving the welfare of people in
      Malawi.                                                                              [8 marks]

      Note: To be eligible for Level 3. Candidates must relate the points in the
      answer to the concept of improved economic welfare (or development) as
      stated in the question.

      Responses may include:
        an evaluation that fair trade is an alternative to the world trading system as
        producers are seen to be poor and not receiving a fair price for their product
        an evaluation that fair trade enables the producer (farmer) to obtain a larger
        share of the final consumer price, and emphasizes environmental
        sustainability and labour rights.

      Reasons why fair trade may result in improved welfare:
        fair trade provides improved infrastructure and better educational
        opportunities (paragraph )
        allows farmers to achieve a greater degree of economic security and
        self-sufficiency (paragraph )
        provides higher prices for products and so a higher income for farmers
        famers can benefit from training and quality management
        fair trade is one of the fastest growing retail sectors in Great Britain and so
        farmers in Malawi that produce fair-trade certified products may enjoy
        greater demand
        the emphasis on sustainability may result in increased living standards for
        future generations of Malawians.

      Reasons why fair trade may not result in improved welfare/arguments against
      fair trade:
          Malawi is one of the world’s least developed countries (paragraph ) and
         will require more than fair trade to improve this situation
         Malawi will still be dependent on economic assistance from the IMF,
         World Bank and donor nations
         fair trade that includes a guaranteed price above equilibrium may result in
         surpluses and represent a misallocation of resources (paragraph )
         if demand for groundnuts is inelastic, then the increase in price may result in
         lower incomes if there is not sufficient demand for fair trade groundnuts
         fair trade may cause Malawi to be dependent on agriculture, rather than
         diversifying
         most of the benefits could go to large supermarkets rather than diversifying
         (paragraph )
         fairtrade products may be among the first to experience a decrease in
         demand in economic downturns in more developed countries, thus
         continuing to make the fair-trade farmers vulnerable to forces outside their
         control.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
        rewarded beyond level 2.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
           consider short-term versus long-term consequences
           examine the impact on different stakeholders
           discuss advantages and disadvantages
           prioritize the arguments.
