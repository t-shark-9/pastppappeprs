Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

worth [30 marks]. In your response include:

             There is a pleasure in philosophy, and the lure even in the mirages of metaphysics which every
       student feels until the coarse necessities of physical existence drag him from the heights of thought into
       the mainstream of economic life and gain. Most of us have known good times like this.

             There were happy days in life when philosophy was in fact what Plato calls “the dear delight”;
       when love of a modestly elusive truth seemed more glorious, incomparably, than the lust for the ways
       of the flesh and the dross of the world. And there is some wistful remnant in us of that early wooing
       of wisdom.

               So much of our lives is meaningless; we strive with the chaos about us within; but we would
       believe all the while that there is something vital and significant in us, were we able to decipher our
       own souls. We want to understand; we want to seize the value and perspective of passing things,
       and so to pull ourselves up out of the whirlwind of daily circumstances. We want to know that the
       little things are little and the big things big before it is too late; we want to see things now as they will
       seem forever. We want to learn to laugh in the face of the inevitable, to smile even at the looming
       of death. We want to be whole to coordinate our energies by criticizing and harmonizing our desires;
       for coordinated energy is the last word in ethics and politics and perhaps in logic and metaphysics too.
       “To be a philosopher”, said Thoreau, “is not merely to have subtle thoughts nor even to found a school,
       but so to love wisdom as to live, according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, generosity,
       and trust”. We may be sure that if we can find wisdom all other things will be added to us. Truth will
       not make us rich but it will make us free.

             Some will think philosophy is as useless as chess, as obscure as ignorance, stagnant because it
      makes no progress and is a waste of time. Doubtless some philosophers have had all sorts of wisdom
      except common sense; and many philosophic flights have been due to the elevated power of thin air.
      But is philosophy stagnant and a waste of time? Science seems always to advance while philosophy
      seems always to lose ground. Yet this is only because philosophy accepts the hard and difficult task
      of dealing with problems not yet open to methods of science, problems like good and evil, beauty and
      ugliness, order and freedom, life and death; so soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible
      of exact formulation, it is called science. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art;
      it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation of the
      unknown or of the inexactly known; it is the front trench of the siege of truth. Science is the captured
      territory and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge and art build our imperfect and
      marvellous world. Philosophy seems to stand still; but only because she leaves the fruits of victory
      (the results of her enquiries) to her daughters the sciences, while philosophy, herself, moves on to
      uncertainty and the unexplored. Science wishes to resolve the whole into parts, the organisms into
      organs, the obscure into the known. It does not inquire into values and ideal possibilities of things,
      nor into their total and final significance; it is content to show their present actuality and operations
      as they are. The scientist is impartial; he is as interested in the leg of a flea as in the creative throes
      of genius. But the philosopher is not content to describe the fact, he wishes to ascertain its relationship
      to experience in general, and thereby to get at its meaning and its worth; he combines things in an
      interpretative synthesis; he tries to put together better than before, that great universe-watch which the
      inquisitive scientist has taken apart. Science tells us how to heal and how to kill; it reduces the death
      rate in retail and then kills us wholesale in war; but only wisdom – desired coordination in the light of
      all experience – can tell us when to heal and when to kill. To observe processes and to construct means
      is science. To criticize and coordinate ends is philosophy. A fact is nothing except in relation to desire
      and ends; it is not complete except in relation to a purpose and a whole. Science without philosophy,
      facts without perspective and valuation cannot save us from havoc and despair. Science gives us
      knowledge but only philosophy gives us wisdom. The seeking of wisdom is true pleasure.
