Paper 1 section A markbands

In applying the markbands the concept of “best fit” should be used: a response that meets most of the
statements in a particular band, but not necessarily all, can still be awarded marks in the markband.
The markband that best fits the response should be determined first. Then, by reference to the markband
above and the markband below, the mark should be determined.

Markband

7 to 8     The demands of the question are addressed effectively within a logical structure. The
           argument is clearly supported by appropriate knowledge and understanding from the
           perspectives. The answer contains appropriate analysis but there may be minor omissions.
           At the top of this markband the demands of the question are addressed effectively, in a
           focused and logical structure. Arguments are supported by appropriate knowledge and
           understanding, and analysis.

5 to 6     At the bottom of this markband the question is addressed. The answer contains accurate
           knowledge and understanding but is mainly descriptive with some implicit analysis that is not
           sufficiently related to the question. There is a basic structure to the answer.
           At the top of this markband the demands of the question are addressed, mainly within a
           logical structure. The response is sufficiently accurate, relevant and adequate to support a
           sound answer. Analysis may not be well developed.

3 to 4     The question is partially addressed, with limited accurate, relevant and factual knowledge and
           understanding. There is an attempt to structure the answer but it is not sustained throughout
           the answer.

1 to 2     There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and understanding of the
           perspective is limited, often inaccurate and of marginal relevance to the question.

0          If the answer does not achieve the standard described in markband 1 to 2, a mark of 0 should
           be recorded.
                                                 –4–              M10/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Biological Perspective

1.   Explain why the reductionist approach, as adopted by many biological
     psychologists, may be regarded as controversial.                     [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when marking this question.

     It could be argued that much psychological research is reductionist since it aims to
     reduce data and simplify explanations so that we may attempt to better understand
     behaviour. The controversial nature of any explanation of behaviour may result from
     the fact that some aspects, influences or alternatives are often ignored when taking a
     reductionist approach. Additionally, generalizing results from research that is
     intentionally limited in nature can be controversial.

     While some may argue that a reductionist approach has a negative connotation, there are
     times where it can be appropriate. Generally, biological psychologists regard their work
     from a positivistic perspective associated with measurement, replicable experiments,
     science and predictability. These factors are more amenable to investigation using a
     reductionist approach rather than the holistic methods associated with other types of
     psychology. The downside of biological reductionism according to Tavris and Wade is
     in drawing premature conclusions, making unwarranted assumptions about cause and
     effect and exaggerating the power of genes.

     Award [7 to 8 marks] for responses that make clear the controversial nature of taking a
     reductionist approach within the biological perspective.

     Award [4 to 6 marks] where the reductionist approach is explained in relation to the
     biological perspective but the controversial issue is not explicitly addressed.

     Award [1 to 3 marks] for responses demonstrating a rudimentary understanding of
     reductionism without relation to the biological perspective. The issue of controversy is
     not addressed.

Cognitive Perspective

2.   Explain how one key concept from the cognitive perspective helps us understand
     behaviour.                                                                     [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when marking this question.

     A range of examples of key concepts may be appropriately chosen, such as
     reconstructive memory, language acquisition device, problem solving, schema,
     heuristics, attention. The explanation should make clear the link between the concept
     and understanding behaviour rather than a simple description of the concept itself. For
     example, a link may be made between reconstructive memory and eyewitness testimony
     or between schema and the development of stereotypes.

     Award [7 to 8 marks] for a response which offers accurate knowledge and understanding
     of a key concept related to the cognitive perspective and explicitly relates it to
     understanding behaviour.

     Award [4 to 6 marks] for a response where one relevant key concept is well described
     but there is only an implicit attempt to link the concept to understanding behaviour.

     Award [1 to 3 marks] for a response providing a limited description of one key concept
     with little or no attempt to link the concept to understanding behaviour.
                                                 –6–              M10/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Learning Perspective

3.   Explain one contribution of the learning perspective to the scientific study of
     behaviour.                                                                      [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when marking this question.

     Contributions should be related to the scientific study of behaviour within the learning
     perspective. Research studies may be used to illustrate the contributions, but they are
     not necessary.

     Contributions could include:

      reliance on empirical data to support/generate theories;
      focus on observable, recordable, data;
      typical use of quantitative data (but qualitative data are also used);
      control of variables in observational and experimental research (in experiments,
       manipulation of an independent variable);
      intention to generalize from studies to wide populations (including animal to human
       generalization).

     Award [7 to 8 marks] where a contribution, clearly related to the scientific study of
     behaviour, has been accurately explained, using appropriate technical language.

     Award [4 to 6 marks] where a contribution has been accurately explained but is not
     sufficiently related to the study of scientific behaviour.

     Award [1 to 3 marks] for responses that offer a contribution from the learning
     perspective unrelated to the scientific study of behavior, e.g. classical or operant
     conditioning.

A response that meets most of the statements in a particular band, but not necessarily all, can still be
awarded marks in the band.
The band that best fits the response should be determined first. Then, by reference to the band above and

17 to 20   The demands of the question are addressed effectively in a focused and logical structure.
           Arguments are supported by appropriate knowledge and understanding and in-depth analysis.
           Evaluation is balanced and well-developed. Cultural, ethical, gender or methodological
           considerations are an integral part of the response.
14 to 16   The demands of the question are addressed effectively within a structured framework. The
           argument is supported by appropriate knowledge and understanding from the perspectives.
           The answer contains appropriate analysis, but there may be minor omissions. Evaluation is
           clear and applied appropriately. Cultural, ethical, gender or methodological considerations
           are present and appropriate to the question.
11 to 13   The demands of the question are addressed mainly within a structured framework. The
           answer contains accurate knowledge and understanding. Some limited analysis is offered.
           Evaluation is limited or may not be well developed. Cultural, ethical, gender or
           methodological considerations are present and appropriate to the question.
8 to 10    There is a basic structure to the answer. The question is addressed. The answer contains
           accurate knowledge and understanding but is mainly descriptive. There may be minimal
           reference to cultural, ethical, gender or methodological considerations appropriate to the
           question.
6 to 7     There is an attempt to structure the answer but it is not sustained throughout the answer. The
           question is partially addressed, with limited accurate, relevant and factual knowledge and
           understanding. There may be minimal reference to cultural, ethical, gender or methodological
           considerations appropriate to the question.
4 to 5     There is little sense of structure in the answer. Although there is an attempt to answer the
           question, knowledge and understanding of the perspectives is limited, often inaccurate and of
           marginal relevance to the question. There is no reference to cultural, ethical, gender or
           methodological considerations.
1 to 3     There is almost no organizational structure. There is very little or no understanding of the
           question, nor evidence of knowledge of the perspectives. The answer consists of no more
           than a few relevant facts.
0          If the answer does not achieve the standard described in mark band 1 to 3, a mark of 0 should
           be recorded.

4.   Describe one study from the biological perspective and discuss how this study has
     contributed to our understanding of behaviour.                                    [20 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B markbands when awarding marks.

     The study should be clearly taken from the biological perspective. Answers should
     focus on the biological nature of the study. The range of studies could include research
     on genetics, neurotransmitters, bodily rhythms, non-human animals, brain injuries and
     diseases.

     Discussion should focus on how the findings of the study described affects our
     understanding of behaviour. It is probable that many answers may relate to brain
     injuries (Phineas Gage) or brain surgery (severing of the corpus callosum), but many
     other studies will also be acceptable. For example, candidates may discuss how
     findings from studies on serotonin and noradrenaline help understanding depressive
     behaviour or how twin studies help understanding how genetic factors influence
     behaviour such as intelligence.

     It is probable that several candidates will present mainly a description of either of these
     examples, but they are required to show HOW the study contributes to our
     understanding of behaviour.

     Award [14 to 20 marks] for a thorough description of a relevant study and an informed
     discussion on how the study has contributed to understanding of behaviour.

     Award [8 to 13 marks] for a description of a relevant study where the associated
     discussion is insufficiently developed to clearly explain the contribution made by the
     study to understanding behaviour.

     Award [1 to 7 marks] for a minimal description of a relevant study but where little or no
     explanation is offered for the contribution made by the study to understanding
     behaviour.

5.   Assess the extent to which one model of information processing has helped in
     understanding cognitive processes.                                           [20 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B markbands when awarding marks.

     The model must be shown to relate to the idea of information processing, including the
     processes of receiving, interpreting, storing and responding to information. The analogy
     of a computer is a very likely characterization of the information processing approach.

     Models may be related to any of the key concepts mentioned in the syllabus, for
     example: attention, perception, memory, language, schemas.

     Models such as working memory model and multi-store model of memory may be
     assessed.

     Award [14 to 20 marks] for responses where the requirement of the question to assess
     “to what extent” the model has helped understanding of cognitive processes is well
     developed. Both strengths and limitations of the model are addressed.

     Award [8 to 13 marks] where an appropriate information processing model is
     adequately described but there is only a limited discussion of how the model has helped
     understanding of cognitive processes. There is only a limited discussion of strengths
     and limitations of the model.

     Award [1 to 7 marks] where an appropriate model is superficially described. The
     assessment of the extent to which the model has added to understanding of cognitive
     processes is minimal or omitted.

6.   Using empirical studies explain two research methods (e.g. experiments,
     observations) employed by psychologists in the learning perspective.    [20 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B markbands when awarding marks.

     When conducting research, psychologists tend to employ research methods that align
     with their own approach, the topic being investigated, etc. Psychologists within the
     learning perspective have tended to prefer more rigorous, scientific research methods,
     such as experiments, rather than qualitative methods. However, as the learning
     perspective has evolved, the research methods used have changed accordingly. For
     example, the experimental method was highly regarded by the behaviourists who
     focused only on observable behaviour. More recent explanations, such as social
     learning theories, have taken into account mediating factors. Therefore alternative
     methodologies, such as observation or self-report, have been effectively employed.
     Triangulation is now accepted in this perspective in order to better understand the
     complexity of behaviour.

     Studies such as those devised by Pavlov, Skinner, Bandura or Lorenz may be presented
     as a support for the explanation.

     Award [14 to 20 marks] for responses that provide a well-developed explanation of the
     use of two relevant research methods. The explanation is appropriately supported by
     learning perspective studies.

     Award [8 to 13 marks] for responses that provide limited explanations yet competent
     description of two relevant research methods. The explanation is relevant to the
     learning perspective, although linked to learning perspective studies in a less effective
     manner.

     Award [1 to 7 marks] for responses that offer a superficial description of the research
     methods with little or no explanation. Answers that offer description of empirical
     studies unrelated to research methods should be awarded marks in this range.
