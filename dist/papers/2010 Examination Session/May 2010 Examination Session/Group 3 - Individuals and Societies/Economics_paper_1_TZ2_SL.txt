Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   “World food prices have increased sharply over the past five years.”  With the
            aid of at least one diagram, explain how one possible demand factor and one
            possible supply factor may have caused this increase.                               [10 marks]

      (b)   Consider the following two conflicting views:
            “Food prices are best left to market forces.”
            “Government should intervene to control rising food prices.”
		          Evaluate whether rising food prices should be left to market forces or controlled
            by government.                                                                      [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Aggregate demand consists of consumption, investment, government spending
            and net exports (exports minus imports).  Explain two factors that may influence
            investment and two factors that may influence net exports.                          [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the effectiveness of an increase in investment expenditure on the
            performance of an economy.                                                          [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the possible consequences of an improvement in a country’s terms of
            trade for a country with a current account deficit.                                 [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that, in the long term, expenditure-switching policies
            (protectionism) are the most effective way to reduce a current account deficit.     [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain the difference between economic growth and economic development,
            and how each of these may be measured.                                              [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the best way that developed countries can help the growth
            and development process of very poor, highly indebted countries is through
            a general cancellation of debts.                                                    [15 marks]
