SOURCE B               Extract from The Arab–Israeli Conflict by Kirsten E Schulze, 2008.

… While Zionist politicians did not like the status of Jerusalem, they accepted the UN plan as a first step
to statehood. The Arabs were outraged. They could not find any redeeming aspect in a plan that allotted
part of their territory to the Zionists … Immediately following the general assembly vote, both Arabs
and Jews started to arm themselves. What ensued was a civil war between Jews and Palestinian Arabs,
all within Palestine. The months before the end of the mandate were characterized by bitter fighting –
including the massacre at the Arab village of Deir Yassin by the Irgun and Lehi which killed 250, the Arab
ambush on a Jewish medical convoy killing 75, and the Arab siege of Jerusalem – ultimately resulting
in a mass exodus of Palestinian Arabs. By May 1948, when the British finally withdrew, over 300 000
Arabs had fled from what was to become the new Jewish state … Historians have argued about the causes
of this flight ever since.


SOURCE C               Extract from a report on the village of Deir Yassin by former Haganah officer,
                       Col. Meir Pa’el, released upon his retirement from the Israeli army in 1972.
                       This report was written in 1948.

In the exchange that followed four [Irgun] men were killed and a dozen were wounded … by noon the
battle was over and the shooting had ceased. Although there was calm, the village had not yet surrendered.
The Irgun and LEHI men came out of hiding and began to “clean” the houses. They shot whoever
they saw, women and children included; the commanders did not try to stop the massacre … I pleaded with
the commander to order his men to cease fire, but to no avail. In the meantime, 25 Arabs had been loaded
on a truck … and murdered in cold blood … The commanders also declined when asked to take their men
and bury the 254 Arab bodies. This unpleasant task was performed by two units brought from Jerusalem.


SOURCE D               Extract from The Revolt by Menachem Begin, 1977. Before the establishment of
                       Israel, Begin was the leader of the Irgun. He did not participate in the battle for the
                       village of Deir Yassin.

… The civilian population of Deir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began …
A substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt. Our men were
compelled to fight for every house … And the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered
inevitable casualties. Throughout the Arab world and the world at large, a wave of lying propaganda
was let loose about “Jewish atrocities” … the Arabs began to flee in terror, even before they clashed with
Jewish forces … This Arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were
seized with panic at the mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the
forces of Israel. The “Deir Yassin Massacre” lie is still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.

SOURCE E                Extract from Palestine and the Arab–Israeli Conflict by Charles D Smith, 2007.
                        Charles D Smith was a history teacher at the University of Arizona.

The significance of Deir Yassin went far beyond its immediate fate … it became central to Irgun and
Haganah propaganda proclaimed from mobile loudspeaker units that beamed their messages into the Arab
areas of major cities … Arab radio also publicized the incident. These broadcasts had a major impact on the
Arab will to resist, especially when the population found itself betrayed by its leaders. In Haifa, the Arab
military command and city officials left in the face of Irgun assaults and open threats of another Deir Yassin
… Israeli officials claimed that the Arabs were encouraged to leave by Arab propagandists who promised
them an easy return once their Armies defeated the Zionists. But Zionist actions reflected a definite desire
to oust as many Arabs as possible … The Zionists undertook a policy “promoting measures designed to
encourage the Arab flight” and forbidding the return of those who left … in addition to the psychological
warfare and threats. These threats meant more to the Arab civilians than did the pleas of some Jews for the
Arabs to remain … For the Zionists, the vacuum created by the fleeing Arabs meant that incoming Jews
could be moved into the vacant homes in towns and villages … In this manner, a much more cohesive
Jewish state with a much smaller Arab population could be achieved.
