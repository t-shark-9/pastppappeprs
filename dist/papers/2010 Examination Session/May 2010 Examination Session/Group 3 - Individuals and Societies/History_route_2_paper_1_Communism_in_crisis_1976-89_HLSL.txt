These sources and questions relate to China under Deng Xiaoping: political changes, and their limits,
culminating in Tiananmen Square (1989).

SOURCE A                Extract from a speech by Deng Xiaoping at the closing session of the Central
                        Working Conference of the Chinese Communist Party, December 1978. Used with
                        permission.

Seeking truth from facts is the basis of the proletarian world outlook as well as the ideological basis
of Marxism. Today we must rely on it in our effort to accomplish the four modernizations …

To make revolution and build socialism we need large numbers of path breakers who dare to think,
explore new ways and generate new ideas. Otherwise we won’t be able to rid our country of poverty and
backwardness or to catch up with – still less surpass – the advanced countries. We hope every party branch
will encourage people to think, explore new paths and put forward new ideas, and that they will urge the
masses to emancipate their minds and use their heads.

One important condition for getting people to emancipate their minds and use their heads is genuine
practice of the proletarian system of democratic centralism. We need unified and centralized leadership,
but centralism can be correct only when there is a full measure of democracy.

SOURCE C               Extract from The Oxford History of the Twentieth Century, edited by
                       Michael Howard and William Roger Louis, 1998. Michael Howard was
                       Professor of Modern History at Oxford University; William Roger Louis was

Deng Xiaoping returned to power, becoming by 1978 ruler of the country. Deng moved energetically
to foster ties with the United States, announcing a new era of “modernizations” for China in the fields
of industry, education, army and sciences. He ordered the rehabilitation of hundreds of thousands of
intellectuals who had lost their posts in the Hundred Flowers or the Cultural Revolution, and declared a
new era of openness in the general world of culture. But when this resulted once again in an outpouring
of Chinese emotion and criticism of the Communist system, most dramatically at the “Democracy Wall”
in Beijing during late 1978 and early 1979, Deng soon showed the limits of his tolerance.


SOURCE D               Extract from The Complete History of China by J A G Roberts, 2003.
                       J A G Roberts was Principal Lecturer in History at the University of Huddersfield,
                       UK.

In August 1977 the Party had committed itself to the Four Modernizations: agriculture, industry,
science and technology, and national defence – the intention being that China would be transformed into
a modern state by the year 2000. The political context in which economic developments would take
place was defined by Deng Xiaoping in March 1979 as the “four cardinal principles” the principles being:
the socialist road, democratic dictatorship of the people, leadership of the Communist Party, and adherence
to Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. … Deng Xiaoping’s political reputation will always
be clouded, but his achievement in transforming the Chinese economy will secure him a high position
among the creators of modern China.
