SOURCE A                Extract from the Covenant of the League of Nations, 1919.

Article 16 – Should any member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12,
13 or 15, it shall be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other members of the League, which
hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance [cutting off] of all trade or financial relations,
the prohibition of all exchange between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking state,
and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal business between the nationals of the
covenant-breaking state and the nationals of any other state, whether a member of the League or not.

It shall be the duty of the Council in such cases to recommend to the several governments concerned what
effective military, naval or air force the members of the League shall contribute to the armed forces to be
used to protect the covenants of the League.


SOURCE B                Statement about a meeting between British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin,
                        and a delegation of the League of Nations on 13 December 1935, marked
                        “strictly confidential”. www.nationalarchives.gov.uk

[The prime minister] assured us that he held faithfully to all his pledges with regard to the League and
suggested that the interview should be both frank and confidential. The prime minister said that the
League’s policy is still the policy of the [British] government and we were all in agreement in desiring that
the policy should be effective. Translating desire into action, however, raised extremely difficult questions.
He then explained the great gravity of the European situation, including the danger that Mussolini might
make a “mad dog” [irrational] attack on the British fleet. Though the results of such an attack must in
the long run be the defeat of Italy, the war might last some time and produce both losses and diplomatic
complications of a serious kind. Meantime we were bound to consider whether we could rely on effective
support from any other member of the League. No member except Great Britain had made any preparations
for meeting an attack. As to France, the whole French nation had a horror of war.

SOURCE D                Extract from Africa in War and Peace by Eric S Packham, 2004. The author,
                        who was in Africa at the time of the Abyssinian Crisis, served in the British Army in
                        the Gold Coast (Ghana) during the Second World War.

We all felt it was an ignominious [humiliating] ending to the high hopes which had been placed on
the League of Nations when the Assembly refused to take the one decisive measure which would have
halted the invasion – the prohibition of the exports of oil to Italy, without which Mussolini could not have
supplied his invading forces … In 1935 Laval’s main foreign policy aim was to maintain an alliance with
Italy, so it was more important to have Mussolini as an ally against Hitler than to defend Haile Selassie
against him. Also Hoare and Laval apparently believed that Mussolini might go to war against Britain
if Britain should impose an oil sanction against Italy or cut Italy’s communications with Abyssinia …
In 1935 Britain was the leading power in Europe and should have accepted responsibility for taking the
lead and dealing effectively with the Abyssinian situation. The other League members were not backward
in imposing sanctions against Italy, but unfortunately Britain failed to give an effective lead until it was
too late.

SOURCE E                Extract from a speech by Haile Selassie to the League of Nations, June 1936.

I, Haile Selassie Emperor of Abyssinia am here today to claim that justice which is due to my people and the
assistance promised to it eight months ago when fifty nations asserted that aggression had been committed
in violation of international treaties … What real assistance was given to Ethiopia by the fifty-two nations
who had declared the Rome Government guilty of a breach of the Covenant and had undertaken to prevent
the triumph of the aggressor? … I noted with grief, but without surprise that three powers considered their
undertakings under the Covenant as absolutely of no value. … What, then, in practice, is the meaning of
Article 16 of the Covenant and of collective security? … It is collective security: it is the very existence of
the League of Nations. It is the value of promises made to small states that their integrity and independence
be respected and ensured … it is the principle of the equality of states. … In a word, it is international
morality that is at stake.



1.    (a)   What, according to Source A, was the significance of Article 16 of the Covenant of
            the League of Nations?                                                             [3 marks]

      (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source C?                                               [2 marks]


2.    Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources B and D about British policy during
      the Abyssinian Crisis.                                                                  [6 marks]


3.    With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations of Source D
      and Source E for historians studying the Abyssinian Crisis.                              [6 marks]


4.    Using the sources and your own knowledge, assess the reasons why the League of Nations’
      policy of collective security was difficult to apply in the Abyssinian Crisis.          [8 marks]
