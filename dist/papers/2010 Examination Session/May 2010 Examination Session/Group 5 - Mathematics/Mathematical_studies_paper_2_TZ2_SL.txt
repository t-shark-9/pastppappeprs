      (a)   Phoebe chooses a biscuit from a blue tin on a shelf. The tin contains one chocolate
            biscuit and four plain biscuits. She eats the biscuit and chooses another one from
            the tin. The tree diagram below represents the situation with the four possible
            outcomes where A stands for chocolate biscuit and B for plain biscuit.
