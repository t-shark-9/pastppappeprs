                                        Instructions to Examiners

Abbreviations

M     Marks awarded for attempting to use a correct Method; working must be seen.

(M)   Marks awarded for Method; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

A     Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; often dependent on preceding M marks.

(A)   Marks awarded for an Answer or for Accuracy; may be implied by correct subsequent working.

R     Marks awarded for clear Reasoning.

N     Marks awarded for correct answers if no working shown.

AG    Answer given in the question and so no marks are awarded.


Using the markscheme

1     General

      Write the marks in red on candidates’ scripts, in the right hand margin.

         Show the breakdown of individual marks awarded using the abbreviations M1, A1, etc.
         Write down the total for each question (at the end of the question) and circle it.


2     Method and Answer/Accuracy marks

         Do not automatically award full marks for a correct answer; all working must be checked,
         and marks awarded according to the markscheme.
         It is generally not possible to award M0 followed by A1, as A mark(s) depend on the preceding
         M mark(s), if any. An exception to this rule is when work for M1 is missing, as opposed to
         incorrect (see point 4).
         Where M and A marks are noted on the same line, e.g. M1A1, this usually means M1 for an
         attempt to use an appropriate method (e.g. substitution into a formula) and A1 for using the
         correct values.
         Where there are two or more A marks on the same line, they may be awarded independently; so if
         the first value is incorrect, but the next two are correct, award A0A1A1.
         Where the markscheme specifies (M2), N3, etc., do not split the marks, unless there is a note.
         (Example 1)
         Once a correct answer to a question or part-question is seen, ignore further working.
                                                  –4–         M10/5/MATME/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M+


3   N marks

    If no working shown, award N marks for correct answers. In this case, ignore mark breakdown
    (M, A, R).

       Do not award a mixture of N and other marks.
       There may be fewer N marks available than the total of M, A and R marks; this is deliberate as it
       penalizes candidates for not following the instruction to show their working.
       There may not be a direct relationship between the N marks and the implied marks. There are
       times when all the marks are implied, but the N marks are not the full marks: this indicates that we
       want to see some of the working, without specifying what.
       For consistency within the markscheme, N marks are noted for every part, even when these match
       the mark breakdown.
       If a candidate has incorrect working, which somehow results in a correct answer, do not award the
       N marks for this correct answer. However, if the candidate has indicated (usually by crossing out)
       that the working is to be ignored, award the N marks for the correct answer.


4   Implied and must be seen marks

    Implied marks appear in brackets e.g. (M1).

       Implied marks can only be awarded if correct work is seen or if implied in subsequent working
       (a correct answer does not necessarily mean that the implied marks are all awarded).
       Normally the correct work is seen or implied in the next line.
       Where there is an (M1) followed by A1 for each correct answer, if no working shown, one correct
       answer is sufficient evidence to award the (M1). (Example 2)

    Must be seen marks appear without brackets e.g. M1.

       Must be seen marks can only be awarded if correct work is seen.
       If a must be seen mark is not awarded because work is missing (as opposed to M0 or A0 for
       incorrect work) all subsequent marks may be awarded if appropriate.


5   Follow through marks (only applied after an error is made)

    Follow through (FT) marks are awarded where an incorrect answer from one part of a question is
    used correctly in subsequent part(s) or subpart(s). To award FT marks, there must be working
    present and not just a final answer based on an incorrect answer to a previous part.

       Within a question part, once an error is made, no further A marks can be awarded for work which
       uses the error, but M marks may be awarded if appropriate. (However, as noted above, if an
       A mark is not awarded because work is missing, all subsequent marks may be awarded
       if appropriate).
       If the question becomes much simpler because of an error then use discretion to award fewer
       FT marks.
       If the error leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, use of r 1 for the sum
       of an infinite GP, sin     1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s)
       for the final answer(s).
       The markscheme may use the word “their” in a description, to indicate that candidates may be
       using an incorrect value. (Example 3)
       Exceptions to this rule will be explicitly noted on the markscheme.
       If a candidate makes an error in one part, but gets the correct answer(s) to subsequent part(s),
       award marks as appropriate, unless the question says hence. It is often possible to use a different
       approach in subsequent parts that does not depend on the answer to previous parts. (Example 3)
                                                 –5–          M10/5/MATME/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M+


6   Mis-read

    If a candidate incorrectly copies information from the question, this is a mis-read (MR). Apply a MR
    penalty of 1 mark to that question. Award the marks as usual and then write –1(MR) next to the total.
    Subtract 1 mark from the total for the question. A candidate should be penalized only once for a
    particular mis-read.

       If the question becomes much simpler because of the MR, then use discretion to award
       fewer marks.
       If the MR leads to an inappropriate value (e.g. probability greater than 1, use of r 1 for the sum
       of an infinite GP, sin   1.5 , non integer value where integer required), do not award the mark(s)
       for the final answer(s).
       Miscopying of candidates’ own work does not constitute a misread, it is an error.


7   Discretionary marks (d)

    An examiner uses discretion to award a mark on the rare occasions when the markscheme does not
    cover the work seen. The mark should be labelled (d) and a brief note written next to the mark
    explaining this decision.


8   Alternative methods

    Candidates will sometimes use methods other than those in the markscheme. Unless the question
    specifies a method, other correct methods should be marked in line with the markscheme. If in doubt,
    contact your team leader for advice.

       Alternative methods for complete questions are indicated by METHOD 1, METHOD 2, etc.
       Alternative solutions for part-questions are indicated by EITHER . . . OR.
       Where possible, alignment will also be used to assist examiners in identifying where these
       alternatives start and finish.


9   Alternative forms

    Unless the question specifies otherwise, accept equivalent forms.

       As this is an international examination, accept all alternative forms of notation.
       In the markscheme, equivalent numerical and algebraic forms will generally be written in
       brackets immediately following the answer.
       In the markscheme, simplified answers, (which candidates often do not write in examinations),
       will generally appear in brackets. Marks should be awarded for either the form preceding the
       bracket or the form in brackets (if it is seen). (Example 4)
                                                    –6–           M10/5/MATME/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M+


10   Accuracy of Answers

     If the level of accuracy is specified in the question, a mark will be allocated for giving the answer to
     the required accuracy.

        Rounding errors: only applies to final answers not to intermediate steps.
        Level of accuracy: when this is not specified in the question the general rule applies to final
        answers: unless otherwise stated in the question all numerical answers must be given exactly or
        correct to three significant figures.

     Candidates should be penalized once only IN THE PAPER for an accuracy error (AP). Award the
     marks as usual then write (AP) against the answer. On the front cover write –1(AP). Deduct 1 mark
     from the total for the paper, not the question.

        If a final correct answer is incorrectly rounded, apply the AP.
        If the level of accuracy is not specified in the question, apply the AP for correct final answers not
        given to three significant figures.
        Intermediate values are sometimes written as 3.24(741). This indicates that using 3.24 (or 3.25)
        is acceptable, but the more accurate value is 3.24741. The digits in brackets are not required for
        the marks. If candidates work with fewer than three significant figures, this could lead to an AP.
        Do not accept unfinished numerical answers such as 3/0.1 (unless otherwise stated). As a rule,
        numerical answers with more than one part (such as fractions) should be given using integers
        (e.g. 6/8).

     If there is no working shown, and answers are given to the correct two significant figures, apply the
     AP with the N marks for correct two significant figures answers. However, do not accept answers to
     one significant figure without working.


11   Crossed out work

     If a candidate has drawn a line through work on their examination script, or in some other way
     crossed out their work, do not award any marks for that work.


12   Calculators

     No calculator is allowed. The use of any calculator on paper 1 is malpractice, and will result in no
     grade awarded. If you see work that suggests a candidate has used any calculator, please follow the
     procedures for malpractice. Examples: finding an angle, given a trig ratio of 0.4235.

13   Style

     The markscheme aims to present answers using good communication, e.g. if the question asks to find
     the value of k, the markscheme will say k 3 , but the marks will be for the correct value 3 – there is
     usually no need for the “ k ”. In these cases, it is also usually acceptable to have another variable,
     as long as there is no ambiguity in the question, e.g. if the question asks to find the value of p and of q,
     then the student answer needs to be clear. Generally, the only situation where the full answer is
     required is in a question which asks for equations – in this case the markscheme will say “must be
     an equation”.

     The markscheme often uses words to describe what the marks are for, followed by examples, using the
     e.g. notation. These examples are not exhaustive, and examiners should check what candidates have
     written, to see if they satisfy the description. Where these marks are M marks, the examples may
     include ones using poor notation, to indicate what is acceptable. (Example 5)
