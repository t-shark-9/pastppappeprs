Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible. Where an
answer is wrong, some marks may be given for correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      data about the number of different plant species (y) that were growing at different
      distances (x) in metres from the lake shore.

      The diagram shows an office tower of total height 126 metres. It consists of a square
      based pyramid VABCD on top of a cuboid ABCDPQRS.

      V is directly above the centre of the base of the office tower.

      The length of the sloping edge VC is 22.5 metres and the angle that VC makes with the
      base ABCD (angle VCA) is 53.1 .

      Part A

      Daniel wants to invest $25 000 for a total of three years. There are three investment
      options.

      Option One             pays simple interest at an annual rate of interest of 6 %.

      Option Two             pays compound interest at a nominal annual rate of interest of
                             5 %, compounded annually.

      Option Three           pays compound interest at a nominal annual rate of interest of
                             4.8 %, compounded monthly.

      (a)   Calculate the value of his investment at the end of the third year for each
            investment option, correct to two decimal places.                                   [8 marks]
