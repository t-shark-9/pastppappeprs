Mark Allocation

Section A:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 30 marks.
Section B:    Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 40 marks.
              Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

     Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

      (d)   Award [2 marks] for a suitable suggestion elaboration.
            Example 1:

            change of prices between selecting an item and paying for it;
            Example 2:
            It would be a better use of system resources as the system would be busy when the

            is given and the student needs to delete unwanted files before able to save again.
            Log taken of print access and then analysed for amount used, once over limit
            printing is denied when the user attempts to print.
            Different types of users may have different storage needs which the server will
            meet by allocating different amounts of storage based on policies set by
            administrators.                                                                 [4 marks]

14.   (a)   Award [2 marks] for a suitable method elaborated.
            Example:
            Interviews with personnel;
            To see how the process works at the moment/analyse the essential parts of
            the system;

            Watch the process as it works at the moment;
            To see the strong and weak parts of the current system;

      (b)   Award [2 marks] for a suitable description.
            Example:
            More than one prototype allows the factory to choose one which is most suitable;
            Means that a selection could be made from more than one – giving more flexibility;
            Increased dialogue between user and computer company will improve final product; [2 marks]

      (c)   Award [1 mark] for each advantage up to [2 marks max]. To receive full marks,
            at least one of the advantages must be unique to the use of multiple (as opposed to
            single) prototypes.
            Example:
            Large system with a lot of coding;
            Makes the job quicker as more than one programmer can be used;
            Helps in debugging as separate parts can be independently tested;                   [2 marks]

      (d)   Award [2 marks] for each implication.
            Example:
            Employment – some people will lose their jobs;
            State of job will change and need new skills;

            There are many and mostly involve the well being of the people employed
            (changed conditions/new skills/redundancy) as opposed to increased efficiency
            and output for the factory.                                                   [4 marks]
