Subject Details:              Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  18 marks].
Maximum total = [36 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

           UV too low in winter in high latitudes;
           vitamin D stored in liver so can make enough to last several months/through
           winter;
           UV light can damage skin and cause skin cancer so exposure needs to be limited;
           use of sun-block will inhibit vitamin D production;

                  higher workloads (180 W+) seemed to show little or no difference/heart rate
                  the same;
                  training increases the maximum intensity at which exercise can be done;       [2 max]



B2. (a)    (i)    biceps and triceps correctly labelled; (biceps = muscle on right, triceps =

           ATP binding causes cross bridges to break/heads detach from binding site;
           ATP broken down/hydrolysed to ADP + Pi, causing myosin heads to change
           angle/become “cocked”;
           myosin heads attach to binding sites on actin filament further along sarcomere;
           ADP + Pi released and myosin heads push actin filament along/power stroke

     (b)   reduced ventilation / breathing rate at rest;
           maximum ventilation rate increases;
           vital capacity may increase;

           increased efficiency of gas exchange (in alveoli);
           strengthen muscles used for ventilation (diaphragm and intercostals);            [3 max]



B4. warm-up routines are series of exercises/stretches done before the main work out;
    cause muscle temperature to increase / stimulates blood flow;
    more oxygen supplied so increased respiration / more vigorous / rapid contractions;
    (thought to be) necessary to prevent damage to muscles/tendons;
    little or no scientific evidence to support belief in need to warm up;
    difficult to conduct controlled experiments without a placebo effect;

Option C — Cells and energy

C1. (a)    (i)     12:00 (Accept 12:00 to 13:00)                                                      [1]

           (ii)    photosynthesis in maize requires uptake of CO2 and light as energy source;
                   sunlight intensity strongest at midday therefore rate of photosynthesis is
                   highest at this time;
                   light is limiting factor for photosynthesis so increased intensity increases
                   photosynthesis;
                   high rate of photosynthesis means high exchange rate of CO2;                   [2 max]

     (b)   31 ºC                                                                                      [1]

     (c)   data does not support idea that rising CO2 levels will increase growth rates in
           maize;
           (at all temperatures) there appears to be no difference between exchange rate at
           current or elevated CO2 levels;
           temperature has larger effect on growth of maize;
           so if rising CO2 levels causes more of a greenhouse effect/larger temperature
           increase, this will affect growth of maize;                                            [2 max]

           hormonal communication – insulin/luteinizing hormone; MUST be proteinaceous
           food stores – casein in milk;
           pigments – opsin;                                                                      [2 max]
           Accept any other valid responses.

     (b)   polar amino acids have hydrophilic R groups, non-polar have hydrophobic
           R groups;
           non-polar amino acids in centre of water-soluble proteins stabilise their structure;
           non-polar amino acids cause proteins to remain embedded in membrane;
           polar amino acids on surface of proteins make them water-soluble;
           polar amino acids create hydrophilic channels/protein pores in membranes;
           enzyme active site specificity depends on amino acids present/polar and non-polar
           amino acids can play a role in substrate interactions at the active site;              [3 max]

C4. metabolic pathway is a series of reactions carried out in a particular sequence;
    products of one reaction become substrates for the next;
    each reaction is enzyme-catalyzed (and thus represents point of control);
    some enzymes are allosteric;
    allosteric control / end-product inhibition/negative feedback;
    end-product acts as inhibitor of enzyme at beginning of pathway;
    product binding changes the conformation of the active site so substrate of the pathway
    can no longer bind;                                                                       [3 max]

          (ii)   American species show less variation because they have had less time to
                 diverge / evolve;
                 size of American flies closer to that of flies recently introduced/founder
                 effect/European founder population from low latitudes;
                 American flies exposed to different selective pressures;                        [1 max]

    (c)   isolated populations diverge (genetically) / separation of gene pools;
          may become a new species / allopatric speciation;
          wing size will follow same trend as in Europe as population spreads to higher
          latitudes;
          because larger size favoured by higher latitudes;
          wing size may stay small due to smaller gene pool;                                     [2 max]

           14
              C steadily breaks down so amount decreases/ 12 C : 14 C increases with age / half-
           life (approx 5730 years) expresses rate of decay of 14 C ;
           the less 14 C in a sample the older the fossil / 14 C useful for dating samples

           Australopithecus at least partially bipedal;
           tooth structure changed as diet changed from soft fruits/leaves/seeds/nuts to
           omnivorous diet;
           large/primitive canines seen in Ardipithecus to smaller canines in
           Australopithecus;
           increasing height – Ardipithecus is smaller (the size of a chimpanzee);
           change in face from projecting to flat face / from tall to small lower jaw /

           (development of birdsong) is a form of motor learning/ability to learn is
           genetic/inherited;                                                                     [2 max]

    stimulation of postsynaptic neuron;
    dopamine builds up in the synapse contributing to euphoria/pleasurable effects;               [2 max]
