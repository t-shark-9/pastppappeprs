Subject Details:             Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the
      first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.

                                              Section B
Extended response questions – quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
           expression of relevant ideas with clarity
           structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
     The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
     answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
     The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts of the
     same question (e.g. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c etc. but not
     between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

      It is important to judge this on the overall answer, taking into account the answers to all parts of
       the question. Although, the part with the largest number of marks is likely to provide the most
       evidence.

      Candidates that score very highly on the content marks need not necessarily automatically gain
       the [2] marks for the quality of construction (and vice versa).

      The important point is to be consistent in the awarding of the quality points. For sample scripts
       for moderation the reason why quality marks have been awarded should be stated.

      Indicate the award of quality marks by writing Q2, Q1 or Q0 in red at the end of the answer.
