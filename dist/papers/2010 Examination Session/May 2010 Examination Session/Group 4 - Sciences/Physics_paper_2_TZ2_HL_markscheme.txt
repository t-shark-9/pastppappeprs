General Marking Instructions
Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [45 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  25 marks]. Maximum total = [95 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded.

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept

                                                  SECTION A

A1. (a)   two error bars in the correct position;
                                                (allow a square-length each side of the data
          two error bars of the correct length; points judge by eye and allow for the thickness
                                                of the line drawn)                                [2]

    (b)   suitable curve that goes through the two error bars;
          and through (0,0);                                                                      [2]

    (c)   a straight line cannot be drawn through the error bars and through the origin;
          so height is not directly proportional to the diameter;
          (and) height is proportional to energy;                                                 [3]

    (d)   the gradient of the line gives the value of the power coefficient/exponent/

          gradient of max and gradient of min 0.37 ( 0.02) and 0.29 ( 0.02) ;
          some conclusion as to why this supports theory 1 e.g. therefore the uncertainties
          do not allow for n 0.25 so data supports theory 1;                                      [4]

          Allow answer in joule, 1.38 10 12 J .

    (d)   energy is released in the decay of K-40 / energy released is the difference in
          binding energies / decay is spontaneous / A-40 is more stable than K-40;                [1]

A3. (a)   (i)    evaporation takes place at any temperature/involves a reduction in temperature
                 and boiling takes place at constant temperature;                                 [1]

          (ii)   evaporation takes place at the surface of the liquid/depends on surface area
                 of the liquid and boiling takes place throughout the liquid/is independent of
                 surface area;                                                                    [1]

    (c)   (thermal) energy/heat is lost to the surroundings / (thermal) energy is used to heat
          the calorimeter / some heat is given to the calorimeter;
          and so less (thermal) energy/heat is available to boil the liquid / less mass boils
          away / OWTTE;                                                                           [2]


A4. (a)   the current gives rise to a magnetic field/flux in the coil;
          from Faraday’s law a time changing field/flux induces an emf;
          Lenz’s law says that the direction of the induced emf is such as to oppose the
          growth of the current;                                                                  [3]

    (c)   wavelength of open pipe for fundamental is 2l / length of open pipe for
          fundamental is about 10 m;
          therefore closed pipe takes up much less space/height (accept this marking point in
          / length is now realistic / less material / OWTTE;    terms of open pipe)                 [2]



A6. (a)   in unpolarized light the electric field vector may vibrate in any plane (normal to
          the direction of propagation);
          in polarized light the vector/electric field vibrates in one plane only;                  [2]

    (a)   a conductor contains “free” electrons and insulators do not / OWTTE;                     [1]

    (b)   to have a current electrons must be accelerated/move along the wire;
          and so a (electric) force must act on them;
          this is provided by the electric field;                                                  [3]

Part 2       Radioactive decay

(a)   the different alpha particle energies represent decay of a nucleus to different
      energy states of a daughter nucleus;
      since the energies of the alpha are discreet it means that the energy levels of the
      daughter nucleus must be discrete / OWTTE;                                            [2]

(b)   the spectrum is continuous;
      with a maximum value of energy;
      the resulting energy difference between energy of any β and maximum β energy is
      accounted for by the energy of the neutrino / reference to energy difference
      between parent energy level and excited energy level of daughter;                     [3]

      internal energy is a function of T;                                                     [1]

(b)   (i)    (a change) in which there is no exchange of thermal energy/heat between

(d)   the second law states that the overall entropy of the universe is increasing;
      entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder of the system;
      degraded energy will increase the temperature of the surroundings thereby
      increasing the disorder of the surroundings/universe;                                   [3]

    (c)   (because of increased greenhouse gases) atmosphere absorbs more (IR) energy
          and heats up;
          atmosphere radiates in all directions;
          Earth’s surface absorbs some of this extra (IR) radiation hence temperature
          increases;                                                                              [3]

B4. Part 1       Momentum, energy and power

    (a)   when a force acts on a body an equal and opposite force acts on another body /
          in the interaction between two bodies A and B, the force that A exerts on B is equal
          and opposite to the force that B exerts on A;                                          [1]

    (b)   forces on Earth and book are equal and opposite / no external force acts on the
          system;
          changes in momentum of Earth and book are equal and opposite / net force on
          Earth-book system is zero;
          hence momentum of Earth-book system stays the same/is always zero and so is
          conserved;                                                                             [3]

      (ii)   the amount of charge/potential created in a pixel is proportional to the
             intensity of the incident light;
             the image is formed by registering the intensity of light in each pixel and the
             position of each pixel / OWTTE;                                                       [2]

             34 10 12

(c)   the retrieval speed is much faster;
      since each piece of data can be assigned an electronic address;
      data can be retrieved with less corruption / data less likely to be mis-read (on
      retrieval);
      some comparison with an analogue storage system e.g. book/library/video tape;            [3 max]
      To award [3 max] the first and the third marking point must be addressed.
