Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 x 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording
      can be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

Option A — Food science and technology

A1. (a)    Award [1] for a definition of unsaturated fatty acid to the effect of:
           one in which there are double bonds present between the carbons of the fatty
           acid chains;                                                                          [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the
           importance of unsaturated fats to health, [2 max].
           good for health;
           essential compounds/cannot be produced in body (cell membranes, etc.);                [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points of explanation of the importance of
           unsaturated fatty acids in the development of rancidity and the shelf life of
           cooking oils, [3 max].
           double bonds are susceptible to oxidation;
           this leads to oxidative rancidity;
           this reduces shelf life of product;
           off flavours are produced in oil;                                                     [3]



A2. (a)    Award [1] for a definition of food insecurity to the effect of:
           low levels of food intake which can be transitory (as a result of
           crisis)/seasonal/chronic (when it occurs on a continuing basis);                      [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct criteria relating to food security
           [2 max].
           sufficient food is available;
           supplies are relatively stable;
           those in need of food can obtain it;                                          [2 max]



A3. (a)    Award [1] for each of two functions of the packaging of Coca-Cola.
           maintaining carbonation/keeping drink fizzy;
           keeping the contents clean/fresh/safe;
           the packaging is labelled to provide information about contents;
           marketing/the package enables the promotion of other products;
           security/the packaging needs to ensure that the product is not tampered with;
           the packaging must be easily opened and resealed to avoid spillage;               [2 max]
                                                 –7–               M10/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


    (b)   Award [1] for identifying one way in which the packaging of Coca-Cola
          has contributed to the development of the Coca-Cola brand and [1] for a
          brief explanation, [2 max].
          the shape of the bottle same as original design/easily recognized;
          even when produced in plastic rather than glass/it has become synonymous with
          the product/what it stands for;

          the colour/lettering is consistent and is recognizable even when not on the bottle;
          this makes it useful for sponsorship, e.g. sports sponsorship;
          uses same packaging for family of products;
          increases sales/market;

          identifiable/recognizable;
          promotes consumer confidence/facilitates product launch for new products
          in family;                                                               [2 max]



A4. (a)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of the
          significance of the resistance of crops to the herbicide Roundup™.
          genetic modification of soybeans can make them resistant to the herbicide
          Roundup™ (which contains glyphosate);
          thus they are able to grow unaffected/not killed when treated with Roundup™;
          when soybean fields are treated with Roundup™ only the weeds die;            [3 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of one reason
          why manufacturers might not want to label genetically-modified crops or their
          products.
          in some countries consumers are nervous of GM crops/concerned about the effects
          of GM foods on humans;
          thus GM crops may be less acceptable than non-GM crops;
          they therefore might not command as high a price as non-GM crops/may be
          avoided by consumers;
          manufacturers may prefer to focus on positive aspects of product (nutritional
          information/taste characteristics, etc) and hide GM origins;                      [3 max]



A5. (a)   Award [1] for identifying each of the two main categories of bacterial food
          poisoning [2 max].
          infective bacterial food poisoning;
          toxin-type bacterial food poisoning;                                        [2 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of the
          temperature danger zone for bacterial growth, [2 max].
          above 10oC;
          below 63oC;                                                                           [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for identifying one way in which lifestyle factors contribute to the
           increased incidence of food poisoning and [1] for a brief explanation.
           more people eating away from home;
           commercial food production (where food may be kept warm for extended periods)
           is more risky than small-scale domestic food production (where food is often
           cooked fresh and eaten immediately);

           increased consumption of ready meals;
           problems with storage and reheating may lead to increased risk of food poisoning;

           increase in microwave cooking for quickness;
           consumers may not check that food is thoroughly cooked/ piping hot;

           supermarkets have food offers/bulk buys;
           consumers may store food too long;

           breakdown in tradition of family meals;
           decrease in cooking skills;                                                         [2 max]



A6. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of the influence
    of market pull and of technology push on the development of new food products,
    e.g. ready meals:
    market pull:
    there is increasing demand for lower cost foods;
    more people live alone and many people do not have cooking skills;
    ready meals can be more cost-effective for single people;

     there is an increasing demand for more and more convenience foods;
     working women for example may have less time for cooking/families may not want to
     sit to eat together;
     ready meals can be regenerated quickly using microwave/oven heating;

     technology push:
     freezers/blast chillers;
     aid in production of frozen/chilled ready meals;
     enhance shelf life of product;

     microwaves;
     make it easy to regenerate/heat food;
     have promoted the development of ready meals;

     packaging materials/vacuum packaging;
     enhanced properties;
     keep food safe/fresh in transit/storage;                                                  [6 max]

A7. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points of explanation of three ways in which
    on-farm processing can enhance farm sustainability [9 max].
    on-farm processing produces products of higher value than the raw materials from
    which they are made;
    thus a larger share of the food dollar stays in the control of the farmer;
    this enhances farm sustainability;

     on-farm processing creates more work in local communities;
     thus more people can stay and work in rural communities;
     jobs related to on-farm processing are more highly skilled and more interesting than
     traditional farm work;

     small-scale food processing can be more appropriate than mass-production;
     craft-produced foods/foods of known provenance command higher prices;
     on-farm processing of foods represents a very lucrative form of farm diversification;

     consumer attitudes;
     farm shops/farmers’ markets;
     have helped change purchasing habits/support for local farmers;

     reduced transport costs for farmer;
     raw materials do not need to be transported for processing;
     saves time/saves money/increases profit/sustainability;                                    [9 max]

B2. (a)   Award [1] for a definition of nanotechnology to the effect of:
          materials and devices that operate on the nanoscale, i.e. with dimensions
          measured in nanometres;
          the branch of engineering that deals with things smaller than 100 nanometers;          [1]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of two distinct correct points in a description of an application
          of nanotechnology similar to the examples below, [2 max]:
          silver nano-crystals have anti-bacterial properties;
          they can be used to coat medical equipment to reduce the risk of infection;

          zinc oxide crystals absorb ultraviolet light;
          they can be used as a sunscreen;

          zinc oxide crystals have antimicrobial properties;
          they can be used for bacteria-resistant fabrics and surfaces;

          silver nano-crystals have antimicrobial properties;
          they are used to produce bandages and to coat the surface of refrigerators,
          air conditioners and washing machines;

          plastic nano-composites are strong, light and rust-proof;
          they are used for car components, e.g. car bumpers;

          nano-crystalline calcium phosphate is used to produce artificial bone composites;
          they have similar compressive strength to stainless steel;                             [2]



B3. (a)   Award [1] for stating the resistance of thermistor X at 10oC, including units.

          approximately 10oC [3 max].
          above 10oC the value of X falls below 470 Ω;
          so the input to the logic gate rises above 2.5 V;
          the output switches to logic 0;                                                        [3]

B4. (a)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an explanation of how PICs are
          integrated into control circuits to implement the smart home concept.
          a range of input and output devices are used to implement the PIC with the
          real world;
          the PIC makes “intelligent” decisions based on pre-programmed protocols;
          it reacts to inputs producing outputs to maintain or change environments;               [3]

    (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an explanation of how a door can be
          locked and unlocked electronically using PIC technology.
          an electromagnet/solenoid can be used to move a bolt;
          current flowing through solenoid in one direction will open the bolt and when
          flowing in the opposite direction will close the bolt;
          an amplifier needed to operate solenoid as PIC outputs do not provide
          enough current;                                                                  [3 max]



B5. (a)   Award [1] for one implication of product stewardship for designers and [1] for a
          brief explanation.
          designing products that are more easily disassembled;
          this makes the components and materials in the product more easily
          reusable/recyclable;

          specifying less toxic materials;
          this reduces the environmental impact of the product on disposal;

          designing products to be more durable/ easily upgraded/repaired;
          increases product life cycle;                                                       [2 max]

    (b)   Award [1] for one way in which take-back legislation will impact on the cost of a
          product and [1] for a brief explanation.
          prices higher;
          to cover costs of take-back legislation;

          collection and disassembly for disposal/reuse/recycling;
          critical element of the product price;

          paid at the point of sale by consumers in purchase price;
          not at the point of disposal by ratepayers/manufacturers;                               [2]

    (c)   Award [1] for one way in which service costs contribute to the replacement of
          electronic products rather than their repair and [1] for a brief explanation.
          service costs include call-out charges/cost of parts/cost of time to undertake
          the repair;
          can be substantial;
          may be cheaper to replace products than to repair them;                                 [2]

B6. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how a digital
    hearing aid can be customised to meet the requirements of an individual user initially
    and through the product lifecycle.
    initially:
    audiogram analyses frequency response of an ear;
    hearing aid divides (filters) incoming sound into frequency bands;
    amplifies where appropriate;
    recombines the bands to compensate for hearing deficiencies;

     through the product lifecycle:
     hearing may deteriorate over time;
     a new audiogram can provide the information necessary to re-programme the PIC;
     this extends product life;                                                              [6 max]



B7. Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of each of three
    reasons why copper wires are being replaced by fibre optic cables in modern digital
    communication systems based on frequency division multiplexing, [9 max].
    frequency division multiplexing requires a certain bit rate and therefore bandwidth;
    recent applications require a lot more information and therefore bandwidth;
    copper cables have much lower bandwidth and hence capacity than fibre optic cables
    which have a huge bandwidth;

     fibre optic cables are based on light;
     less vulnerable to electromagnetic interference;
     more secure;
     many users share links simultaneously;

     fibre optic cables are more cost-effective;
     copper is expensive, sand is not (fibre optic cable core is made of glass);
     less power is needed to run a fibre optic link;
     repeaters can be spaced further apart;
     copper wires require more maintenance;                                                  [9 max]

          they are very suitable for use for flat-pack furniture;
          they can be put together easily;
          they use simple tools;
          they can be disassembled and reassembled in another location;
