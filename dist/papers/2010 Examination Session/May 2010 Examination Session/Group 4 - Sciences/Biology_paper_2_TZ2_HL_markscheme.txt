General Marking Instructions
Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 2 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [32 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [2  20 marks]. Maximum total = [72 marks]

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
     more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
     However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
     follow through marks should be awarded.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
     unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper.

1.   (a)   most: white-throated sparrow/WS
                                                  (both needed to award the mark)                         [1]
           least: American robin/AR

     (b)   5 % / 5.03 % / 5.3 % (unit required) (Accept answers in the range of 5 % and 5.3 %)            [1]
           No indication needed of whether percentage difference is an increase or decrease.

     (c)   both birds show an increase in mass at Site 1 and a decrease at Site 2;
           MW has a greater increase than HT at Site 1;       (do not accept larger/greater change)

           MW has a greater decrease than HT at Site 2;       (accept negative change)
           MW has larger mass change at both sites/Site 1 and Site 2;                                 [2 max]
           Do not accept answers quoting only numerical statements.

     (d)   HT data is reliable whereas AR data is unreliable / differences not significant /
           uncertainty higher with AR;
           (because) error bars/variation/range/standard deviation large for AR / larger for AR
           than for HT;
           (because) smaller sample of AR than of HT;                                                 [2 max]
           Do not accept comments about whether the data is accurate or not.

           Do not allow answers quoting only numerical statements.

     (f)   triglyceride higher at Site 1 because more fat deposition / HT eats more;
           butyrate higher at Site 2 because more fat/triglyceride utilized / HT fasts more;              [2]

     (g)   (data supports hypothesis) because mean mass at Site 1 is greater than at Site 2
           (for all birds);
           because mass gained at Site 1 but mass falls (mostly) at Site 2 (over 17 years);
           because triglyceride levels higher at Site 1 / butyrate levels higher at Site 2 / more
           fat deposited at Site 1 / more fat utilized at Site 2 / more fasting at Site 2;            [2 max]

     (h)   advantage:
           need to capture bird only once to get data / no need to mark and catch birds again;
           more informative data can be gathered; (do not accept unqualified “more precise”)

           disadvantage:
           removal of blood is more stressful/risky for the bird than weighing;
           danger of infection / spread of disease / harm to birds;
           extra time/money/laboratory equipment is needed to analyse results;
           could include fat/triglyceride/butyrate from previous/long-term feeding;
           nutrients from food eaten at these sites may not have been absorbed yet;                   [1 max]
           Award [1] for one advantage and one disadvantage that are not the converse of
           each other. Do not allow a second advantage or second disadvantage given in
           the answer.

           better-adapted individuals survive/more likely to survive;
           more reproduction/genes passed on by better adapted individuals;
           name of species; (accept even if remainder of answer is invalid)
           description of original/decreasing phenotype;
           type of environmental change that led to evolution;
           consequence of environmental change
           description of new/increasing phenotype;
           genetic basis of phenotypes;
           reason for new phenotype being better adapted;
           detail of reason for adaptedness of new phenotype;                                        [8 max]
           The following has been provided as an example answer.
           great tit;
           bird that lays its eggs in spring;
           global warming/climate change;
           more caterpillars (on trees) in early spring;
           laying eggs earlier in spring;
           time of egg laying is (partly) genetically controlled;
           eggs laid early hatch at start of period of greatest food abundance;
           more young can be fed/young grow faster/fewer deaths;
