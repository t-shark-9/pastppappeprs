General Marking Instructions
Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  18 marks].
Maximum total = [36 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
     award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being o f
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
     unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper.

     (c)   increased light penetration due to decrease in phytoplankton numbers/cloudiness;
           (as the summer season approached) the Sun would be directly overhead making
           deeper light penetration probable;                                                      [1 max]

          the most successful forms are naturally selected;
          those that survive reproduce more;
          more difficult for production of new T-cells/lymphocytes/reaction of immune
          system;                                                                               [2 max]



D2. (a)   varied members of a single species occupy a variety of niches / migration of a
          species to an area with a variety of niches;
          natural selection/selection pressure will be different in various niches causing
          adaptation of groups to the varied niches;
          results in many species from one ancestral species;
          reproductive isolation enhances adaptive radiation;
          adaptive radiation results in speciation;                                             [3 max]

    (b)   in gradualism evolution occurs at a constant pace;
          fossil records of gradual change with intermediate forms support this theory;
          evolution of modern horse/another suitable example seems to support this view;
          in punctuated equilibrium evolution proceeds rapidly for short periods of time
          intermittent with long periods of little change/stability;
          gaps in the fossil record/lack of intermediate forms support the idea of punctuated
          equilibrium;
          strata in the fossil record with appearance of many new species following a mass
          extinction supports the idea of punctuated equilibrium;                               [4 max]

    (b)   improved diet quality correlated (positively) with hominid skull development/size;
          improved diet quality provides energy to support a greater brain function;
          change of habitat (in Africa) 2.5 mya may have prompted emergence of Homo sp;
          change in diet to include meat increased brain size (of hominids);

F3.   (a)   somatic (gene therapy) involves changes to body cells whereas germ line
            (gene therapy) involves changes to egg cells/gametes;
            somatic cell changes are not passed on to offspring whereas germ line changes
            may be passed on to offspring;
            somatic cell genes affect only a small proportion of the total cells in a body whereas
            the changes to germ line cells will be passed on to all cells of the offspring (as it
            develops);                                                                               [2 max]

                  Do not accept answers containing only numerical statements.

     (b)   plants are purposely transported by people to new places for their use;
           the ecosystem is changing/warming so new kinds of plants are now able to
           survive/compete with native plants;
           only a few plants are aquatic so few would be expected in water;
           fungal spores/seeds can travel more easily in air;
           terrestrial ecosystems provide more suitable habitats;                                  [1 max]

     (c)   accidental transport of organisms (e.g. by vessels/boats);
           purposeful importation for commercial reasons;                                          [1 max]

     (d)   pros:
           may control a pest species (in an ecosystem);
           economic/social benefits e.g. reforestation to reduce soil erosion / other reasonable
           examples;
           cons:
           competition reduces survival of native species;
           upsets the balance between predators and prey;
           leads to extinction of native species / reduces biodiversity;                           [3 max]

    (b)   name of ecosystem:
          e.g. (tropical) rainforest;
          ethical reason:
          every species has a right to life, regardless of whether it is useful/non useful to
          humans;
          potential of undiscovered medicines;
          ecological reasons:
          better use of the rainforest may occur by respecting the existing balance in concert
          with the indigenous people;
          native species are adapted to local conditions whereas invasive species are less
          likely to be in balance;
          species in the rainforest are interdependent so loss of species threatens the rest of
          the community;
          deforestation of rainforests increases soil erosion/silting of rivers/flooding/CO2
          atmospheric levels;
          economic reasons:
          ecotourism is a potential source of income;
          aesthetic reasons:
          loss of beauty of the system;
          artists are inspired by the images/flowers/animals of rainforests;
          heritage/cultural reasons:
          maintenance of the rainforest preserves human cultural diversity;                       [5 max]
          Do not award more than [2 max] for each category of reasons e.g. not more than
