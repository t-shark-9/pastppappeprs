Subject Details:             Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the
      first point it occurs and U on the cover sheet.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                         e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                       2     reject
                                                     1.6     accept
                                                   1.63      accept
                                                  1.631      accept
                                                1.6314       reject

      Indicate the mark deduction by writing –1(SD) at the first point it occurs and SD on the cover sheet.

          Reference to “flat” model without definition does not gain mark.

    (b)   value of density determines whether or not universe will expand forever, or at
          some point, begin to contract;
          at density less than critical density, universe will expand forever;

            this causes bubbles to form on the ions;                                                  [3]

      (b)   faster data collection;
            data can be digitised (and hence analysed by computer);
            no dead time between photographs;                                                     [2 max]

      (c)   particles lose energy and hence speed as they pass through the chamber;
            therefore radius of orbit decreases;
                       qBr
            since v          or r proportional to v;                                                  [3]

J3.   (a)   mesons: quark and anti-quark;
            baryons: three quarks/anti-quarks;                                                        [2]

      (b)   mesons: colour cancels out anti-colour;
            baryons: red green blue combine to make colourless particle;                              [2]

      (c)   (i)    zero;                                                                              [1]

            (ii)   baryons have baryon number +1, mesons have baryon number 0;
                   by conservation of baryon number, 0 1 1 X, so X 0, so X is a meson;                [2]



J4.   (a)   minimum energy required is rest energy             of     positron   and   electron
              2 0.511 MeV 1.022 MeV;
            corresponding to a temperature of
                 2E
            T       ;

      (b)   temperature has cooled to a point at which spontaneous pair production has
            become impossible;
            pair annihilation is still possible;                                                      [2]
