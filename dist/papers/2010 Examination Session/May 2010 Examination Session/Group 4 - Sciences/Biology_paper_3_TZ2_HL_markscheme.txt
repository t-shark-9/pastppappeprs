General Marking Instructions
Subject Details: Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
     award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
     if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
     unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper.

          cowbird lays eggs in nests of other birds near edges of forests / fragmentation of
          forests increased cowbirds as more edges;
          habitat corridor:
          permit organisms to move between different parts of a fragmented habitat;
          example of habitat corridor:

Option H — Further human physiology

H1. (a)   (i)    15.2 mg 3hrs 1 (allow answers in the range of 15.0 to 15.4)                            [1]

          (ii)   1.93 NAG units 3hrs 1 (allow answers in the range of 1.92 to 1.95)                     [1]

    (b)   both have a positive relationship;
          values very scattered for both;
          more positive correlation/steeper gradient for men than for women;
          more scattered in women/greater range in hepatic activity / more scattered/ greater
          range in men in renal activity;                                                           [2 max]

    (c)   people with more renal damage have more cytochrome activity;
          positive correlation between both increased hepatic activity and renal damage so
          supports the hypothesis;
          greater hepatic effect in women than in men / greater renal effect in men than
          women / gender differences in effects;
          very wide range of data makes it very difficult to evaluate / possibly statistically
          invalid;
          from this data it is impossible to establish a causal relationship / no control group /
          other factors may be involved;                                                            [2 max]



H2. (a)   steroid hormones enter cell whereas protein hormones bind to receptors in
          membranes / steroid hormones can pass through cell membranes while protein
          hormones cannot;
          steroid hormones interact directly with genes/receptor proteins in cytoplasm
          whereas protein hormones cause release of secondary messenger in cell;
          steroid hormones control whether or not particular enzymes or proteins are
          synthesized whereas protein hormones change the cell’s activity usually by
          activating or inhibiting enzymes;                                                         [2 max]

    (b)   I: acinus cell/secretory cell/secretory vesicles;
          II: duct/lumen;                                                                               [2]

    (c)   sight/smell of food initiate release of gastric juice;
          before food reaches stomach, gastric juice already secreted by reflex action;
          chemoreceptors/stretch receptors detect food in stomach;
          impulses (from these receptors) are sent to brain, which sends impulses to release
          more gastric juice;
          impulses also sent to endocrine glands to release gastrin;
          gastrin stimulates stomach wall to increase secretions/release acid/gastric
          juices/pepsinogen;
          low pH of stomach (and hormones) inhibits gastrin;                                        [4 max]

H3. diagram with correct labels:
    partial pressure O2/percentage O2 saturation on x-axis and percentage saturation
    hemoglobin with O2 on y-axis;
    exponential shape curve at lower partial pressure/concentration of CO2;
    curve shifted to right (and lower) for higher partial pressure/concentration of CO2;

                        lower partial
                        pressure CO2



                                                 high partial

         % saturation
         hemoglobin
           with O2




                             partial pressure O 2

     hemoglobin carries (up to) four oxygen molecules;
     Bohr shift promotes the release of oxygen in respiring heart muscle;
     active respiration releases CO2;
     partial pressure of CO2 increases;
     increases acidity/lower pH/increase lactic acid;
     hydrogen ions bind to hemoglobin / which decreases hemoglobin’s affinity for O2;
     so O2 is released (from the oxyhemoglobin);
     allosteric effect / conformational change in hemoglobin which releases O2 more readily;   [6 max]
     Award [4 max] if no diagram provided.
