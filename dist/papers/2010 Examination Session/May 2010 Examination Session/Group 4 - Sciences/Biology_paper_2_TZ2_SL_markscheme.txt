General Marking Instructions
Subject Details: Biology SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = [50 marks].

1.   A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
     award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.   Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

4.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
     if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded.

9.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unit errors can only be penalized once in the paper.

5.   (a)   monosaccharides are single sugars and disaccharides are two sugars and
           polysaccharides are multiple sugars;
           hydrolysis is the addition of water to split a molecule into smaller fragments;
           –OH and –H are added to the fragments;
           disaccharides are split/digested into two single sugars;
           polysaccharides are broken/digested into smaller fragments (e.g. diasaccharides);
           process depends on enzyme control (in organisms);                                         [4 max]

     (b)   a particular yeast (growing in natural milk) contains lactase;
           biotechnology companies can grow/culture the yeast;
           lactase (an enzyme) is extracted from the yeast;
           natural milk contains lactose/milk sugar;
           when added directly to milk, lactase converts lactose into simpler forms;
           same effect when milk is passed past immobilized (on surface or beads) lactase;
           simpler forms of sugar (glucose and galactose) are easily absorbed (in the small
           intestine);
           a commercial market exists for lactose-free milk / lactose-free milk is example of
           biotechnology’s economic impact;
           some people are lactose intolerant/cannot digest lactose in milk/have lost lactase
           activity in intestinal cells;
           consuming lactose-free milk allows lactose intolerant people to be nourished by
           milk without discomfort (abdominal cramps and diarrhoea);
           many Asians are lactose intolerant whereas less common among other groups
           (northern Europeans and some Africans);
           biotechnology produced in one part of world is more useful in another;                    [6 max]

     (c)   food must be in a small enough form to leave the gut and enter the bloodstream;
           physical breakdown is not enough / chemical breakdown is necessary;
           enzymes are required for the chemical breakdown of food;
           enzymes increase the rate of digestion;
           enzymes are biological catalysts;

           high acidity;
           most enzymes work extracellularly / some enzymes work intracellularly;
           variations in pH throughout digestive tract promote the activity of different digestive
           enzymes / different enzymes have different optimal pHs;

6.   (a)    ecosystem is a community and its abiotic environment;
            solar energy collected by autotrophs/plants (via photosynthesis);
            moves through trophic levels via food;
            only 5 to 20 % transferred from one trophic level to next / never 100 % efficient;
            lost as metabolic heat/organic waste;
            energy flow can be illustrated by pyramid shape;
            organisms absorb nutrients from food/environment;
            nutrients occur as complex organic matter in living organisms;
            after death, saprotrophic bacteria and fungi (decomposers) breakdown complex
            organic matter;
            breakdown products are simpler substances;
            absorbed into plants for resynthesis into complex organic matter/recycled;              [6 max]

     (b)    offspring vary in traits;
            variation results from sexual reproduction;
            independent assortment of alleles (during meiosis of spermatogenesis/ oogenesis)
            contributes to variation;
            meiosis is the cellular process that produces gametes;
            crossing over (during meiosis) increases variation;
            fertilization (combination of different genomes) contributes to variation;
            more offspring may be produced than the environment can hold;
            struggle for existence can occur;
            offspring whose traits best adapt them to environment will survive/survival of
            fittest;
            change in environment will lead to survivors with new/different traits;
            correct use of term natural selection/selective pressure;
            variation is heritable / over time more offspring born with new trait;
            change in gene pool;
            when entire population (of a species) exhibits new trait, evolution has occurred;       [8 max]
