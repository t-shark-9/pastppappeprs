Subject Details Biology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

Option D — Evolution

D1. (a)   as latitude increases so does wing size / direct relationship / positive correlation

                 American species/largest wing sizes seen in European flies;

                 European species;

          wing size will follow same trend as in Europe as population spreads (to higher
          latitudes because larger size favored by higher latitudes/colder climate);
          wing size may stay small due to smaller gene pool/different climate;                   [2 max]

H3. SA node is located in the wall of right atrium of heart muscle;
    has characteristics of both nerve and muscle tissue;
    SA node initiates each impulse;
    acts as pacemaker of the heart;
    no nerve impulses needed for contraction / myogenic;
    connected to nerves which slow/accelerate heart rate;
    impulses spread out in all directions through walls of atria;
    stimulates atrial systole/contraction;
    fibres in walls of atria prevent impulses from reaching ventricles;
    impulses reach AV node (after atrial contraction);                                   [6 max]
