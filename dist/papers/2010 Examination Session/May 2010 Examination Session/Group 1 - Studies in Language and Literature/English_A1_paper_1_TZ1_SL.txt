1.

            IN THE MORNING the crow of the rooster intruded into my sleep, and along with it came the
            crooning cries from Mama: “Janna, come back. Come back to me.”
                  Her sobs pierced my slumber.  I dreamt that a rooster had flown away with Janna, and Mama
            was chasing after it, calling, “Come back, come back.” When I awoke, excited for our party,
      5     I was told there would be no celebration, Janna was dead. All of her blood had vanished,
            the leukemia had claimed her. She lay stretched out on her bed, next to the brown, rosy-cheeked
            doll she loved so much.
                  “My beautiful baby,” Mama sobbed.
                  I saw no beauty, only a gray version of myself.

     10     I CLUNG TO Papa’s legs, moving aside for Mama’s skirts as she paced the floor in a trance.  
            I trembled as the black of the padre’s mournful robes floated by in a swirl of smoke and
            funeral incense. The cloud of smoke was housed in a silver vessel, which he swung from a
            chain as he recited prayers that sounded more like incantations.
                   Janna and I had always been given matching dresses, matching shoes, and matching
     15     hairstyles; would it be the same with the sickness?
                   “Papa, am I sick, too?” I begged to be comforted.
                   “Shh, hija, it is time to be quiet.” Papa patted my head distractedly as he swept up pieces
            of a broken vase he had thrown in his sorrow.
                   “Mama, what happened?”  I tugged at her skirts, but I could have been a fly on her back.
     20             The padre pulled me aside. “Your mother is grieving, child, be still.”
                   “But what about me?”
                   No one answered; I had been forgotten. I should have been put to sleep each night like
            a treasure, with my favorite blanket tucked in on all sides. I should have been comforted and
            sung to sleep. Instead, I became a ghost child myself.
     25            Mama was inconsolable. Having twins had made her special. Without the set she was just
            a rice farmer’s wife with rotting teeth and clothes to stone clean in the river. She had nothing to
            separate her from the other women in our village of stilt houses along the Rio Grande.

            THE EVENING BEFORE my sister’s burial, we had the “viewing” in our salas. It was not much
            of a living room, but still we called it that.  Janna’s body was placed in a wooden coffin lined in
     30     pink satin. Chairs and mismatched boxes had been borrowed from the neighbors and arranged as
            seats in neat rows in front of the body. Even now I hate the feel and look of pink satin. I cannot
            even have a cup of coffee in my front parlor without the taste of death surrounding me. It curdles
            my skin.
                   During the rosary, in between the beads of Hail Mary and Holy Mary, Mother of God,
     35     I tried to avoid the coffin.   I could see the outline of Janna’s body with her hands folded atop
            her blue dress.  The only dress I would not have a matching set to.  Looking at that coffin was to
            see myself lying there. It is not true what they say about the dead, that they look as though they
            are asleep. She looked strange, far from sleep, a wooden carving of my sister, with waxen face
            and bright orange lipstick striped across her lips. Her mouth was a beacon in a sea of pink satin.
     40     I prayed that the lips not turn up in a smile.

                  In all the chaos there was no one to console me. Thankfully Ate Yu saw this and sat
            beside me. She was my mother’s only true friend. She lived with us, free of rent in exchange for
            her help around the house. She was full-blooded Chinese but had been raised in the Philippines.
            She spoke fluent Mandarin and Tagalog.  She held in her hand a statue of Kuan Yin, the Chinese
   45       goddess of mercy, carved in white jade, and on her neck she wore a crucifix.
                  “Why do you have both?” I asked.
                  “Ai-ya, don’t you know me by now, little pig? I wear both to cover double the prayers
            for your sister’s ascent into heaven,” she explained, brushing my bangs away from my brow.
            Her name, Yu, meant “jade,” and since her statue was made of it, I thought of her as the goddess
   50       Kuan Yin herself, or Sister Jade.
                  “You are ready now to say good-bye to your sister?” Ate Yu asked. “It is our turn before
            they close the box and lock her away forever.”

                                   The Gift

                 To pull the metal splinter from my palm
                 my father recited a story in a low voice.
                 I watched his lovely face and not the blade.
                 Before the story ended, he’d removed
             5   the iron sliver I thought I’d die from.

                 I can’t remember the tale,
                 but hear his voice still, a well
                 of dark water, a prayer.
                 And I recall his hands,
            10   two measures of tenderness
                 he laid against my face,
                 the flames of discipline
                 he raised above my head.

                 Had you entered that afternoon
            15   you would have thought you saw a man
                 planting something in a boy’s palm,
                 a silver tear, a tiny flame.
                 Had you followed that boy
                 you would have arrived here,
            20   where I bend over my wife’s right hand.

                 Look how I shave her thumbnail down
                 so carefully she feels no pain.
                 Watch as I lift the splinter out.
                 I was seven when my father
            25   took my hand like this,
                 and I did not hold that shard
                 between my fingers and think,
                 Metal that will bury me,
                 christen it Little Assassin,
            30   Ore Going Deep for My Heart.
                 And I did not lift up my wound and cry,
                 Death visited here!
                 I did what a child does
                 when he’s given something to keep.
            35   I kissed my father.
