Provisional marking

During the early period of your marking your team leader (or principal examiner in the case
of team leaders) will contact you to discuss the standard of marking and the interpretation of
the marking notes. Before this discussion, it is necessary to have provisionally marked
(in pencil) about ten scripts.

If your team leader has failed to make contact with you, please try to make contact with him
or her yourself, by phone or e-mail.


                                 ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

The passages for commentary offer candidates a variety of possibilities for analysis and
interpretation. The test of any interpretation is that it has to be tied carefully to the words, images
and relevant details of the text. Personal response, in the same way, must be tied to the passage.

In the descriptor for level 2, there may be other conditions under which a “2” may be awarded,
such as a limited use of evidence or a generally weak response. Substantiation of points may be
made but be very weak/superficial.

What is sought by “personal response” is an individual voice and engagement with how the
text works. Engaged and individual commentaries will usually make themselves clear by the depth
of insight into the text and the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character
etc., attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                 –4–            M10/1/A1ENG/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M



Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the commentary will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches, including the linear, (line by
line analysis) are acceptable and will be judged on the basis of their effectiveness.
Examiners should remember that structure does not exist by itself, but any structure must be
measured by appropriate reference to the passage or poem and by its capacity to integrate these
towards the development of an organized and coherent commentary.

Reminder: In this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a four, you should ensure that these are well founded
before awarding a three. The breadth of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners
reluctant to award four.

Use judgment when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation; therefore do not
unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only a part of this criterion.            Ensure that all the other elements
are considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on the other criteria, and vice versa.

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.
                                                  –5–            M10/1/A1ENG/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


The following elements are particularly relevant to criteria A, B and C:

Question 1. Prose

Satisfactory and good papers, three to four, on a spectrum of increasing precision and detail, may:

•   identify and comment on the situation in the passage, with some attention to the final paragraph
•   comment on the presentation and effect of setting
•   comment on diction, imagery and narrative perspective
•   identify and discuss links suggested among the physical, mental and supernatural worlds
•   identify and comment on aspects of structure.

Very good to excellent papers, four to five, on a spectrum of increasing sophistication and literary
sensibility, may also:

• explore the situation further and engage with the final paragraph in greater detail
• analyse presentation and effect of setting, showing awareness of contrasts (e.g. inside and
  outside, familiar and alien); explore tone
• comment further on diction and imagery, looking at patterns of these; comment further on
  narrative voice
• discuss further links suggested among the physical, mental and supernatural worlds
• explore aspects of structure (e.g. sentence/paragraph length, change in focus).


Question 2. Poem

Satisfactory and good papers, three to four, on a spectrum of increasing precision and detail, may:

• identify and comment on the use of the image of goldfish in a goldfish bowl as a way of
  presenting ideas on a relationship between humans
• comment on diction and imagery
• comment on formal elements (e.g. stanza length, number, enjambment, rhyme/absence of rhyme)
• comment on the use of parentheses and their relation to structure
• comment on perspective.

Very good to excellent papers, four to five, on a spectrum of increasing sophistication and literary
sensibility, may also:

•   explore further the effect of the presentation of the two situations
•   explore further the use of language and imagery
•   analyse formal elements and explore tone and shifts of mood
•   explore further effects of structure and the use of parentheses
•   explore further the contribution made by perspective.
