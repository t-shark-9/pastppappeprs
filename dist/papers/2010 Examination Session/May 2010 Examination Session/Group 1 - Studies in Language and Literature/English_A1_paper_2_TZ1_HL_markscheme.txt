Provisional marking

During the early period of your marking your team leader (or principal examiner in the case of
team leaders) will contact you to discuss the standard of marking and the interpretation of the
marking notes. Before this discussion, it is necessary to have provisionally marked (in pencil) about
ten scripts.

If your team leader has failed to make contact with you, please try to make contact with him or her
yourself, by phone or e-mail.

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors increase.
What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged and individual
essays will usually make themselves clear by insight into the implications of the question and the
quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to
demonstrate their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does not
explicitly offer such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly, to ensure that
candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates
to show, as appropriate to the question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character,
setting, structure, voice, etc. are used by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the
question is phrased, candidates must also address related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character
etc., attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                 –4–            M10/1/A1ENG/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate. Different
conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be judged on the
basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not exist by itself,
but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the question and by its
capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and coherent essay.

Reminder: In this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a four, you should ensure that these are well founded
before awarding a three. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners
reluctant to award four.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation;
therefore do not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a
supplement to the published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not
offered as an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must
rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded
as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested
here should not be so heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show an adequate
sense of stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical analysis and
pertinent detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the
works, as well as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to be
developed.

These apply to all answers below.
                                               –5–            M10/1/A1ENG/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M




All adequate to good answers must include some pertinent detail (described, paraphrased or
directly quoted) to support assertions and reveal knowledge of the texts studied.
Relevant discussion of literary features must appear in every response. Answers should
evince some discernible form of organization and demonstrate standard written English.

Good to excellent answers must be grounded in the features demanded for “adequate”
answers, and may go beyond that basis in the ways described below as well as in other,
somewhat unpredictable features which show individual thinking and an engaged, well-
supported address of the texts.

Drama

1.   Adequate to good answers will explore how ritual, in whatever sense in which the candidate
     has interpreted the term, is presented or used in at least two plays and look more closely at its
     function in the plays, with some pertinent supporting textual reference.

     Good to excellent answers will explore how ritual is presented or used and evaluate its
     dramatic significance, giving detailed and aptly-chosen textual reference in support of ideas.


2.   Adequate to good answers will describe some parts of plays in which
     silence/suggestion/subtext is important and explore some of the uses and effects of
     silence/suggestion/subtext in the plays, with some pertinent supporting textual reference.

     Good to excellent answers will show a sophisticated understanding of the dramatic
     significance of silence/suggestion/subtext, supported with detailed and aptly-chosen textual
     reference.
                                              –6–           M10/1/A1ENG/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


 Poetry

Poems should be taken from the works of at least two poets.

If a candidate fails to use at least two poets, mark down two levels in both criterion A,
Knowledge and Understanding of Works and criterion B, Response to the Question.

Contrary to previous instructions, answers must not be penalized for using two poems only,
providing each poem is by a different poet.

 3.   Adequate to good answers will talk about the use of the imagination in at least two poems by
      two different poets, explore its role with some insight and give some pertinent supporting
      textual reference.

      Good to excellent answers will show a sophisticated understanding of the way the imagination
      transforms elements of the “real world” and how this is represented in the language of the
      poems, making use of detailed and aptly-chosen textual reference.


 4.   Adequate to good answers will show understanding of what is meant by complexity in poetry,
      agree or disagree with the assertion and cite some pertinent supporting textual reference.

      Good to excellent answers will engage critically with the prompt and respond with detailed,
      aptly chosen references. An exploration of what is meant by “difficulty” in poetry will be
      evident.
                                               –7–           M10/1/A1ENG/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.   Adequate to good answers will discuss the presentation of the experiences and relationships
     that shape a character, and show some understanding of the ways in which they impact the
     individuality of a character, with some pertinent supporting textual reference.

     Good to excellent answers will show more sophisticated analysis of such experiences and
     relationships, and evaluate their significance in impacting the individuality of the character,
     using detailed and aptly-chosen supporting evidence. A closer exploration of what constitutes
     “individuality” is likely.


6.   Adequate to good answers will describe aspects of some works that are persuasive,
     manipulative or instructive and discuss the notion of competing voices (implied or spoken),
     making use of pertinent textual reference.

     Good to excellent answers will reveal more sophisticated understanding of the role of the
     author as intrusive, manipulative or combative, making use of detailed and aptly-chosen
     evidence.


Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.   Adequate to good answers will describe aspects of some works which reveal the author’s
     personality and, with some pertinent supporting textual evidence, discuss how far they
     agree/disagree with the assertion.

     Good to excellent answers will show a persuasive examination of the prompt and respond
     with detailed, aptly-chosen references, showing a more sophisticated evaluation of the way a
     writer’s personality emerges in works of non-fiction.


8.   Adequate to good answers will consider the “aim” of the chosen works and begin to explore
     some aspects of persuasive or creative writing in non-fiction texts that affirm or challenge
     this definition. They will discuss the extent to which they agree/disagree with the assertion in
     the prompt, giving some pertinent supporting textual evidence.

     Good to excellent answers will examine the texts in greater detail and show a more
     sophisticated ability to engage critically with the prompt, with detailed and aptly chosen
     supporting reference.
                                                –8–           M10/1/A1ENG/HP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


General Questions on Literature

9.    Adequate to good answers will identify age as an issue explored in their works and show
      some understanding of how it is presented and why it is significant, giving pertinent
      supporting textual reference.

      Good to excellent answers will show a sophisticated sense of the importance of age and offer
      a persuasive examination of its portrayal and importance, offering detailed and aptly-chosen
      textual evidence in support of ideas.


10.   Adequate to good answers will show an understanding of the difference between form
      and content, with consideration of the relationship between them, giving some pertinent
      supporting evidence.

      Good to excellent answers will demonstrate sophisticated understanding of the way form
      and content can achieve certain effects in their relationship with each other, for example
      by mirroring each other or operating in a state of tension, and will make use of detailed and
      aptly-chosen textual evidence.


11.   Adequate to good answers will identify what kinds of learning and/or education exist in the
      chosen works, paying some attention to their role and significance, and citing some pertinent
      supporting textual evidence.

      Good to excellent answers will show a greater awareness of a range of appropriate
      interpretations of learning and/or education literally and/or metaphorically. They will be able
      to evaluate the significance of such types of learning and/or education in the works they
      discuss with detailed and aptly-chosen textual evidence.


12.   Adequate to good answers will identify instances in which coincidence, chance or accident
      have played a part in their chosen works (they need not be handled thematically), offering
      some pertinent supporting textual evidence.

      Good to excellent answers will provide a more detailed and a more convincing exploration
      of how instances of coincidence, chance or accident are employed by writers, using detailed
      and aptly-chosen textual evidence in support of ideas.
