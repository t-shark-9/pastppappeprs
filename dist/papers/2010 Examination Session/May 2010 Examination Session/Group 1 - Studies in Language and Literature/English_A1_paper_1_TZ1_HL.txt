Write a commentary on one of the following:

1.

                   The birds chattered in the fir trees by the front corner of the house, dusting the yard with
            more snow. Maybe they made all that noise to comfort one another in the cold. She wished
            she could gather them all into her house. Why didn’t their little bodies freeze like ice-cubes?
            What kept them warm? Their little hearts beating fiercely like an old coal stove? How many
      5     shovels had she shucked into one of them?
                   She saw her neighbor pouring a bucket on his garden rows. Probably sheep manure.
            He was far away but he waved at her and the howl of his black dog broke the cold. Her cat
            looked up, alarmed.
                   On the edge of her garden she found a cob emptied of its corn. It sparkled on one end
     10     with frost. She looked at the muffin-tin shape. The honeycomb openings where the kernels
            had gone. She decided the spirits left it there. Everytime she moved they snipped another
            detail from the world. They had taken enough from her. Now she was getting parts of it back,
            sucking them deep within herself. She felt her bowels rumble. The thick branches of the bush
            stitched a net for her. The empty garden rows. All of them growing like frozen vines around her.
     15     Maybe she’d disappear into them someday.
                   Inside the house once more, she wiped a place to look through the window. Her cat would
            be scratching at the door soon. She lit the stove and boiled water for tea. She saw that the
            wet teabag looked like birdseed. She turned the furnace down even farther when it came on.
            She didn’t want to call the gas truck yet. She would wear her coat and scarf, her galoshes and
     20     gloves in the house.
                   Where was her needle? She needed to work her fingers. They felt blue and cold.
            She’d sew a bright pocket on the dress she was working on. A pocket to help her remember
            everything she saw. Things she noticed, thoughts she wanted to store in her head. The bush with
            the blue gas-flame of the blue jays’ heads. The pattern of frost growing on the windows. How it
     25     covered the glass like ancient cave markings or the scribblings of a child. No, it wasn’t the frost
            at all. It was the spirits that got loose when it was cold. The north wind opened up a highway
            and they slipped right down to the Great Lakes from the north. Hadn’t she seen them after her
            husband died last winter? Hadn’t she heard his ice-fishing decoys rattle one night? Weren’t the
            spirits a pale blue when she looked from the window, floating around the house like manta rays1?
     30     Their graceful edges undulating in the dim light from the window. Now they were wrapping her
            house in cellophane. She knew it as she stood at the sink looking out. Something scratched the
            door and it startled her, but she remembered it was the cat and she let him in.
                   She knew another secret. They had been in her house. They could walk across the floor
            without creaking. They could sit on her roof and she’d never know it. Stingrays with their
     35     blue-finger edges. Devilfish! She whacked the counter with her broom. The cat ran.

                   They were coming to take her too. She panicked at the sink. She saw her husband in
            his icehouse fishing in winter. She felt like she was walking barefoot across the ice to him.
            She fought to hold to the counter. But she was shuffling across the lake. The drift of cold fog
            across the ice was like a line of old people. Inside her head, birds flew from the wall.
    40      They banged at the windows to get out. Up the road, the church steeple hung like a telephone
            pole pulled crooked by its wires after an ice storm. How long had she been there? The room
            circled like the round hole in the ice. She felt the tight hole around her chest. There was
            something hurting her ankles. She was tangled in the fishing line that went down into the
            cold, dark hole below her. Now the sun shined its wicked and beautiful pattern on the
    45      kitchen window. The cold fog still shuffled across the lake. Something knocked the old cans
            and kettles from the counter to the floor. She was walking up the road now. Wasn’t the afternoon
            light through the window-frost like a church? How many years had she sung hymns up the road?
            The little tendrils of the ice like petroglyphs2? She heard her children drawing in the frost on the
            windows. She reached for the finger she saw at the glass. But the icehole burped like her old
    50      husband in his chair and the frigid water closed her up.

    manta rays: mantas are the largest of the ray family of fish. Rays are a type of flattened fish with pectoral fins like wings.
    The body is broad and flat; mantas are generally about 6 metres wide.

                   (love song, with two goldfish)

                 (He’s a drifter, always
                 floating around her, has
                 nowhere else to go. He wishes
                 she would sing, not much, just the scales;
             5   or take some notice,
                 give him the fish eye.)

                 (Bounded by round walls
                 she makes fish eyes
                 and kissy lips at him, darts
            10   behind pebbles, swallows
                 his charms hook, line and sinker)

                 (He’s bowled over. He would
                 take her to the ocean, they could
                 count the waves. There,
            15   in the submarine silence, they would share
                 their deepest secrets. Dive for pearls
                 like stars.)

                 (But her love’s since
                 gone belly-up. His heart sinks
            20   like a fish. He drinks
                 like a stone. Drowns those sorrows,
                 stares emptily through glass.)

                 (the reason, she said
                 she wanted)
            25   (and he could not give)
                 a life
                 beyond the
                 (bowl)

                                    Grace Chua, from QLRS Vol. 2 No. 2, January 2003
