                                       The Perfect CV
How can you get a prospective employer to spend more time looking at your CV? How can you improve
your chances of getting an interview? Careers expert Daniel Ough offers some invaluable tips.

Interviewer:   [–X–]

Daniel:        A curriculum vitae, or CV as it is commonly called, should be an advertising flyer for you and
your skills. We market ourselves through this document and our purpose is to catch an employer’s attention
and be invited for an interview.

Interviewer:   [–8–]

Daniel:        Over 90 % of job-seekers miss the importance of focusing on what they have achieved.  
For me, great CVs highlight all things you have done that were recognised by someone else.  So three or four
achievements stated simply and convincingly really catch my attention.

Interviewer:   [–9–]

Daniel:          Many job-seekers begin their CV by listing
their personal goals. In my experience, this does not add to a
CV’s effectiveness.  Your CV is about what you have done, not
what you want to do. Another common mistake that people
make is to launch straight into their educational background.
This is ineffective and wastes valuable space particularly if you
go all the way back to primary school.  Don’t get creative with
fancy borders or coloured paper.  Recruiters are not impressed
by this.  Using reduced fonts and margin size to cram as much
information in as possible is another no-no.  

Interviewer:   [ – 10 – ]

Daniel:         Recent research has shown that poor spelling and grammar anger 77 % of employers.  
So I’d say that it is extremely important.  I advise everyone to have someone proofread their CV before
sending it out.

Interviewer:   [ – 11 – ]

Daniel:          Over 75 % of employers believe that students with work experience will settle more easily
into a job, so relevant work experience tops the list of what employers think is important.  They also search
for candidates with a good work ethic as well as relevant degrees.  Many students believe that the class of
the degree they received and the reputation of the university where they received it is important; but studies
prove that recruiters aren’t interested in these two factors.
                                                                    Adapted from Friday magazine (December 2005) and

                               Ireland’s Blarney Stone
                                   may be baloney*
            Millions of tourists may have been romancing the wrong stone at a castle in southern Ireland in
            an eﬀort to get the “gift of the gab”, according to a recent study.

            The authenticity of the Blarney Stone, kissed by about 400 000 tourists a year, has been
            questioned by Mark Samuel, an archaeologist/architectural historian, and Kate Hamlyn in a
  5         new book.

            According to legend, kissing the stone at Blarney Castle, near Cork, gives the kisser the gift of
            the gab or great skill at speaking. But the authors say the present stone only came into use in
            1888. Up until then, those wishing to kiss the stone had to be dangled from the castle by two
            people holding their ankles. Today, those wishing to ensure that they will never be at a loss for
  10        words lie on their back and, holding on to an iron railing, lean backwards to kiss the stone.

            Blarney Castle dismisses the theory that the current stone is not the one with the claimed
            magical powers.        According to Marketing Manager John Fogarty, allegations by
            Samuel and Hamlyn are wrong. He claims that the Blarney Stone was given to an Irish king,
            Cormac McCarthy, by Scotland’s king, Robert the Bruce. It was a gift in appreciation for
  15        soldiers sent to aid Scotland at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314.

            Just how long this custom has been practiced or how it originated is not known. One local
            legend claims that McCarthy heard about the stone’s powers from a woman who was saved
            from drowning in the lake behind Blarney Castle. She told him he would get the gift of
            eloquence from kissing it.

  20        It is known, however, when and how the term entered
            the English language. During the era of Queen Elizabeth I,
            McCarthy was asked to surrender the castle to her as
            proof of his loyalty. He said he would be delighted to,
            but something always happened at the last moment
  25        to prevent it. His excuses became so convincing
            and plausible that once, when they were repeated to the
            Queen, she said “more Blarney talk!”


                                         Adapted from “Ireland’s Blarney Stone may be baloney” in AFP magazine
                                                                                                (February 2008)

  Exotic Pets
  Most of us used to be happy with a normal pet. Not
  anymore. Now more and more people want something
  different. This is especially true for the younger
  generation. “Anyone can have a cat or a dog, but having a
  boa constrictor separates you from the rest,” said teen
  snake owner Ray Patrick. Exotic pets are a real
  conversation piece and other people are generally
  interested in something unusual.

  The availability of many species has led to an increase in the number of exotic pets.
  Tarantulas, iguanas, salamanders and snakes are becoming more popular as pets.

  Despite their popularity, many pet owners do not follow common-sense guidelines when
  dealing with these animals. Consequently, pet rescue centers are kept quite busy. Most
  animals that come into these centers require a lot of attention. Many suffer from burns,
  missing limbs, malnutrition or neglect.

  Many exotic animal species have been declared illegal as pets, often due to the danger they
  may pose to people or because of the animal’s conservation status in the wild. You should
  find out about any pet laws, and whether or not you need a permit. Regulations on owning
  exotic pets have tightened recently. This means that more animals will be released into the wild
  causing potential danger to domestic pets and people. To give Miami residents an alternative
  to simply turning their pets loose, the Miami Zoo sponsored “Exotic Pet Amnesty Day”, where
  residents could surrender unwanted animals. Among the more bizarre pets that were handed
  in were a Rhino-iguana and a spotted African Serval cat.

  Representatives from Exotic Pets Unlimited advise that before you buy that cute-looking frog
  or that furry spider, it is important that you think carefully about your choice. You should
  consider how long it will live: unlike dogs and cats, some reptiles may outlive you,
  so adopting one is a very long commitment.

  Finding a veterinarian who has experience with exotic pets may be difficult in certain areas.
  Remember too, that exotic pets can have specific dietary requirements, and may need to be
  fed with foods that you feel uncomfortable handling, such as frozen mice or even live ones!

  According to exotic pet veterinarian, Thomas Goldman, “having an exotic pet can be fun but
  there are real dangers to be considered”.

                                                  Adapted from the City Times newspaper (February 2007)
