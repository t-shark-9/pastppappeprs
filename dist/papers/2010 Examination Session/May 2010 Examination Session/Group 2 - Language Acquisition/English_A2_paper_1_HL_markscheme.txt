Higher Level, paper 1

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from a novel and a biographical essay.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  note that both texts are about clockmakers
  call attention to the different genres
  call attention to one or two stylistic devices in each text: for example, simile, metaphor,
  alliteration in text 1; personification, quotation and numbers in text 2.


A better comparative commentary may:

  be more specific about the shared subject, noting the emphasis on craft, care and tradition in
  both texts
  note that in text 1 clockmaking is considered a trade (“just a few procedures to learn”) while in
  text 2 it is considered a vocation (“mission”)
  comment on the description of the clockmaker’s shop and its contents in text 2
  discuss key stylistic devices in more detail
  comment on the relationship between the narrator and his stepfather in text 1
  note that the narrator in text 1 is interested in “the performance of a craft” generally,
  while, in text 2, Ray Bates is presented as particularly interested in clock making.


The best comparative commentaries may:

  discuss the difference between the ideas of “humbleness” and trade “shaped discreetly” in
  text 1 and the emphasis on degrees and professional titles in text 2
  note that the clockmaker in text 1 might be like the “European masters” referred to in text 2
  note the irony of a clockmaker describing himself as being in a “time warp” in text 2
  note that both texts represent clocks as alive, e.g. “whir into life” in text 1 and “brethren” in
  text 2
  note that the relationship between the narrator and his stepfather in text 1 can be likened to that
  of an apprentice and master, as described in text 2.

                                           SECTION B

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

  call attention to the different genres: one an essay and the other a poem
  mention one or two stylistic features of each text: e.g. metaphor, simile, and personification in
  text 3; simile and alliteration in text 4
  note that both passages are about moose.


A better comparative commentary may:

  discuss key stylistic devices in more detail
  be more specific about the shared subject, noting that the moose is compared to other animals in
  both texts
  note the extent to which the moose is a figure of fun in both texts
  recognize that the moose in text 4 is accorded some dignity and is, for example, compared to a
  “scaffolded king”
  comment on the humorous elements in text 3 and the tragic elements in text 4
  note that both texts conclude by discussing the shooting of moose
  recognize that text 3 is about moose as a species, whilst text 4 is about an individual moose.


The best comparative commentaries may:

  discuss the use and effect of stylistic features in detail, perhaps noting how similes are used to
  create humour in text 3 and pathos in text 4
  discuss the way that each author presents the shooting of a moose or many moose, recognizing
  that text 3 explicitly represents it as “wrong” while text 4 suggests that it is wrong (by comparing
  the moose to a “scaffolded king” and by celebrating his last show of strength)
  note that text 3 represents the moose as “one of the longest-surviving creatures in
  North America” and emphasizes its persistence (“plodded on, untroubled by ice ages…”),
  while text 4 represents the moose as very tired and on the verge of death
  note that the presence of the moose in the pasture (text 4) might be seen as an index of the
  “robust and growing numbers” discussed in text 3
  consider the final stanza of text 4 in some detail, noting the change in tone.
