Write an essay on one of the following. You must base your answer on the cultural options or literary
options you have studied in class. References to other subjects or literary works are permissible but should
not form the main body of your answer.

Language and culture

1.    The Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong’o calls language the “collective memory bank” of a people.
      Consider this idea with reference to your study of this option.


2.    Some scholars argue that half of the world’s languages will be lost before 2100. With this in mind,
      consider the idea that fewer languages might lead to better communication among people.



Media and culture

3.    New technologies have changed what media can do and how. Discuss with reference to your study
      of this option.


4.    It has been said that the majority of advertising is nothing more than “the stimulation of greed
      and envy”. With this in mind, consider some ways in which advertising fulfills a legitimate or even
      important role in society.



Future issues

5.    “If we can change our priorities and achieve balance and understanding in our roles as human
      beings in a complex world, the coming era will be that of a richer civilization, not its end,”
      says Sigurd Olson. With reference to your study of this option, identify some strategies for making
      the future a “richer civilization”.



Global issues

6.    Identify one global problem for which successful actions have been taken in recent years.
      With reference to your study of this option, consider how some of those actions have helped or will
      help to alleviate the problem.



Social issues

7.    It’s hard to be young today. With reference to your study of this option, analyse one of the most
      important social problems affecting young people today and suggest ways to resolve it.
