These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.


1.    Travel can often have an impact on a young person’s life. In an article for a youth travel
      magazine, describe a trip you have taken and its effect on you.

      Explanation/Factual – semi-formal to informal – article

      A good answer
       will adopt a register in the range semi-formal to informal
       will utilize effective narrative techniques
       will cover both parts of the task (describing the trip and its effect on the writer)
       the article need not give equal importance/length to the two elements
       may include a clear introduction and conclusion (this should be rewarded).


2.    A friend in another school has a problem which is affecting his/her IB studies. Write a letter
      or email to him/her, offering advice on how to deal with the problem.

      Written interaction – informal – informal letter /email

      A good answer
       will include aspects such as date, greeting and closing for a letter and greeting and closing
        for an email
       may use a more formal register for the problem and the advice (this should be rewarded)
       will cover both aspects of the task (dealing with only the problem or only the advice would
        result in a mark no higher than 6 in Criterion C).
                                               –4–           M10/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Your school has decided to expand its range of student clubs. Write a proposal to the
     principal suggesting a new club. Describe what the club will involve and give your reasons
     why it would be beneficial.

     A good answer
      will adopt a formal register
      will describe clearly what the club will involve and provide credible reasons justifying it
      will adopt the format of a letter or some other appropriate format
      may include headings, subheadings, bullet points, etc. (this should be rewarded).


4.   You are participating in a class debate on the motion: “Fast food should be forbidden for
     young people under the age of 18”. Write the text of your speech, either agreeing or
     disagreeing with this motion.

     Argument/Controversial – semi-formal to formal – text of a speech/debate

     A good answer
      will make the writer’s viewpoint quite clear
      may devote some space to the opposing viewpoint for rebuttal purposes
      will focus mainly on either agreement or disagreement with the theme
      will provide support or the reasons for agreement/disagreement
      will adopt a fairly formal register, perhaps with flashes of informality
      will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech (this should be
       rewarded)
      will include appropriate opening and closing remarks.


5.   Can money buy happiness? Your teacher has set this as the topic of your next essay. Write
     the essay stating your opinions on this issue.

     Argument – formal – essay

     A good answer
      will include a title
      will address the importance of this issue
      will include formal aspects of an essay (introduction, body and conclusion with supporting
       details and examples)
      may personalize the topic somewhat (this should be rewarded)
      need not be a balanced review of arguments for and against but may also be a statement of
       opinion supporting one point of view.
                                                –5–           M10/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

     the novel or play, stating which character you dislike and why. Remember to mention the
     name of the work.

     Literary analysis and critique – formal – letter to an author

     A good answer
      will be addressed to the author of the work
      will clearly explain which character the candidate dislikes and the reasons for this dislike
      will not retell the story, but will illustrate through examples the reasons for disliking the
       character in the work
      will adopt a register and tone that is respectful but may be lightened by some informality
      may include humour (this should be rewarded)
      will not be based on a film version of the work (if it is based on a film version, the
       maximum mark for Criterion C should be 7).
