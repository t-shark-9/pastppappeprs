The answers given in this markscheme contain the essential information that candidates are expected to
provide in order to gain full marks for each question.
Where appropriate, the information may be expressed in phrases other than those indicated, but full
marks may only be awarded if all the necessary information is given.
Incomplete answers should be marked as directed.
Do not use half marks.
Unless otherwise indicated no marks are to be awarded or deducted for use of language: linguistic errors
should only be taken into account if communication is severely impaired and the answer is
incomprehensible to a normal speaker of the language.
Assistant Examiners are requested to wait until they are contacted by their team leader before
beginning the marking (see the examiners instructions for further details).




Les réponses données dans ce barème de notation contiennent l’essentiel de ce qu’on demande aux
candidats pour qu’ils puissent obtenir la note maximum pour chaque question.
Les réponses peuvent être formulées différemment mais la note maximum ne sera attribuée que si le
contenu de la réponse est exact.
Les réponses incomplètes seront notées selon les indications données.
En aucun cas, des demi-points ou des fractions ne doivent être attribués.
À moins d’une indication spécifique, aucun point ne sera ni ajouté ni ôté pour l’utilisation de la langue :
les erreurs linguistiques ne seront prises en considération que si elles nuisent sérieusement à la
communication et rendent ainsi la réponse incompréhensible.
Les examinateurs assistants sont priés d’attendre d’être contactés par leur chef d’équipe avant de
commencer leurs corrections (voir les instructions aux examinateurs pour de plus amples détails).




Las siguientes respuestas contienen la información esencial que los alumnos han de proporcionar para
conseguir la máxima puntuación en cada pregunta.
En ocasiones, esta información puede expresarse de manera distinta a la indicada, pero para conseguir
la máxima puntuación se han de mencionar todos los detalles requeridos.
Las respuestas incompletas deberán corregirse de la manera indicada en las instrucciones.
No utilice fracciones de puntos.
A menos que se indique lo contrario, no se deben añadir ni restar puntos por la calidad en el uso de la
lengua: los errores lingüísticos sólo se tomarán en cuenta si la comunicación queda seriamente
perjudicada o si la respuesta resulta incomprensible.
Se pide a los examinadores asistentes que esperen a ser contactados por su examinador líder de equipo
antes de iniciar la corrección (para más información, refiéranse a las instrucciones para los
examinadores).

     Cada pregunta vale un punto, a menos que se indique algo distinto.

                                              SECTION A

TEXT A — THE LAST LECTURE

1.      C, D, I, J                                                                         [4 marks]
        (Accept these in any order)


For questions 2 and 3, accept other wording which conveys the same meaning.

2.      upbeat / humorous / authentic
        Do not accept “simple” or “wise”, as these refer to content and not style.

3.      never give up on your dreams / find the best in others / have fun / go on and do
        great things


4.      G

5.      I

6.      F

7.      B



                                                                                TEXT A: [10 marks]

TEXT B — THE PERFECT CV

8.    I

9.    D

10.   A

11.   H


NOTE: For the justification in questions 12 to 15, allow only the quotation as given, possibly with a
      few additional words, provided that they do not materially alter the meaning (close
      paraphrases may be accepted). Both True/False and quotation response must be correct for
      the mark. Absence of quotation marks should not be penalized.

12.   True – careers expert Daniel Ough (offers some invaluable tips)

13.   False – (over 90 % of job seekers) miss the importance of focusing on what they
              have achieved / great CVs highlight all things you have done (that were
              recognized by someone else) / your CV is about what you have done, not
              what you want to do / (in my experience) this does not add to a CV’s
              effectiveness

14.   False – using reduced fonts and margin size (to cram as much information in as
              possible) is another no-no

15.   True – studies prove that recruiters aren’t interested (in these two factors)


16.   poor spelling / poor grammar (or both award [1 mark] only)

17.   (relevant) work experience



                                                                                TEXT B: [10 marks]

                                          SECTION B

TEXT D — EXOTIC PETS

Communicative Purpose:
Written interaction – communicate to a family member through an informal letter.

Register and Style:
The register should be informal.
Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
obscure meaning.

Message:
The aim is to write an informal letter to a family member about the disadvantages of keeping an
exotic pet. This letter will inform him/her about the disadvantages of keeping exotic pets. The
student’s feelings of negativity towards keeping exotic pets should be clearly conveyed.

The descriptors regarding copying from the text should be strictly adhered to. Verbatim copying of
details from the text is acceptable provided that the details are “used”, that is, sensibly incorporated
into the response. Copying details without so using them constitutes “undue copying”.

The candidate should include some of the following details from the text:

A.    Most exotic animals that come into pet rescue centers require a lot of attention.
B.    Many suffer from burns, missing limbs, malnutrition or neglect.
C.    Some exotic pets are dangerous to people.
D.    Regulations on owning exotic pets have tightened recently.
E.    Exotic animals are released into the wild by their owners and are dangerous to domestic pets
      and people.
F.    Some reptiles may outlive you. Adopting one is a very long commitment.
G.    Finding a vet who has experience with exotic pets may be difficult in certain areas.
H.    Exotic pets can have specific dietary requirements, and may need to be fed with foods that
      you feel uncomfortable handling.
I.    There are real dangers to be considered when having an exotic pet.


      To achieve level 5 (adequate understanding), at least four details should be included.
      To achieve level 9 (very good understanding), at least seven details should be included.

SL Paper 1, Section B: Written Response
Please note that at standard level the written response is assessed with only one criterion.

To what extent does the candidate understand the source text and respond appropriately to it?

       Has the candidate provided all the details from the source text that are relevant to the task?
       How appropriately have the details from the source text been used in the written response without
       undue copying of the source text?
       How appropriate is the use of register and style to both the type of text required and the audience?
   (Levels 5 to 10 may be awarded only if the candidate has an adequate understanding of the
   source text.)
   (Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
   obscure meaning.)

Achievement
Level
  0                 Level 1 is not achieved.
1–2                 The understanding of the source text is very limited.
                    • The details selected from the text are generally insufficient and/or irrelevant.
                    • Many parts of the source text have been copied because of lack of understanding.
                    • Language mistakes generally obscure meaning.
3–4                 The understanding of the source text is fairly limited.
                    • The details selected from the text may be partly insufficient and/or sometimes
                      irrelevant.
                    • Some parts of the source text have been copied because of limited understanding.
                    • Language mistakes often obscure meaning.
5–6                 The understanding of the source text is adequate but the response is not always
                    convincing.
                    • A few relevant details have been selected from the text.
                    • The details are not always used appropriately; there is some undue copying of the
                      source text.
                    • The choice of register and style is sometimes appropriate to the type of text required
                      or the audience; language mistakes obscure meaning at times.
7–8                 The understanding of the source text is competent and the response is mostly
                    convincing.
                    • Sufficient relevant details have been selected from the text.
                    • The details are used appropriately to some extent, without undue copying of the
                    source text.
                    • The choice of register and style tends to be appropriate to both the type of text
                      required and the audience; language mistakes rarely obscure meaning.
9–10                The understanding of the source text is very good and the response is convincing.
                    • Many relevant details have been selected from the text.
                    • The details are mostly used appropriately without undue copying of the source text.
                    • The choice of register and style is generally appropriate to both the type of text
                    required and the audience; language mistakes rarely obscure meaning.
