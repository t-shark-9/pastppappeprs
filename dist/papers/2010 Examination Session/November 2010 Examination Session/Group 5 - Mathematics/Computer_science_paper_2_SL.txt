Answer all the questions.

1.    A program has been written to process student data in a school.   For each student,
      the student’s name and date of birth are stored.  The following class  Student has
      been designed to hold these details.

      class Student
      {
        private String name;
        private int yearOfBirth; // Year in which student was born
        private int monthOfBirth; // 1–12 corresponds to Jan–Dec
        private int dayOfBirth;   // 1–31 day in birth month

            public Student()
            {
              // constructor
            }

            public String getName()
            {
              return name;
            }

            // other methods follow
            // ...
      }

      (a)     With reference to the  Student class, describe the differences between
              public and  private identifiers.                                                [4 marks]

      (b)     Construct a method  getYearOfBirth() that returns the year in which a
              student was born.                                                               [2 marks]




                                                         (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      The  Student  object only stores the date of birth of the student, therefore the age of
      the student must be calculated based upon the current date.

      (c)   (i)    Assuming that the current date is 17 November 2010, calculate the age,
                   in years, for each of the students in the following table.                     [2 marks]

                        Student         Year of birth     Month of birth      Day of birth
                       Student A           2000                08                 15
                       Student B           2000                11                 16
                       Student C           2000                11                 18



            (ii)   Explain how it can be determined if a student’s birthday in the current year
                   has passed.                                                                    [2 marks]

            (iii) The  int variables  currentYear,  currentMonth and  currentDay
                  hold the current year, month and day, respectively.  Using these variables,
                  construct the method  getAge() that returns the age of a student, in years.     [5 marks]

      (d)   The school’s student data is contained in a file.  The method  getNext() reads
            from the file, returning a  Student object each time it is called.  When the end
            of the file is reached,  getNext() returns a  Student object containing the
            name “XXX”.

            Construct a program fragment that will output a list of the names of all the
            students whose age is 12.  You should use the method  getAge().                       [5 marks]

                                                     –4–                N10/5/COMSC/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX

2.    A program contains a  String array of student names and a  float array of student
      grade averages.

      There are  int numStudents elements in each array.

      For example:

                                  0         1          2         3        4         ...
            studentNames        Mary      John       Paul      Luke     Trina

                                   0         1         2         3         4        ...
            gradeAverages         78        62        71        89        52


      The program needs to sort the students into order based on their grade averages.

      (a)     (i)    Outline the advantages of storing the student names and grade averages
                     in arrays.                                                                 [2 marks]

              (ii)   Construct the method  bestStudent(), started below, that returns the
                     name of the student with the highest grade average.

                     String bestStudent(String[] names, float[] averages, int numStudents)
                     {
                       // Insert code here
                     }                                                                     [4 marks]

      (b)     (i)    Explain why the  gradeAverages array should not be sorted into
                     descending order without also making changes to the  studentNames array.   [2 marks]

              (ii)   Construct the method  rankStudents(), started below, that uses
                     a bubble sort to sort the two arrays into descending order based on the
                     grade average.

                     void rankStudents(String[] names, float[] averages, int numStudents)
                     {
                       // Insert code here
                     }                                                                    [8 marks]

      (c)     Explain how the difficulty of keeping the corresponding elements of the two
              arrays aligned can be avoided by using  objects.                                  [4 marks]

3.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   Terminal 5 has a number of areas that require access to be authorized.  
            The management of the airport is considering introducing different methods of
            security across the airport.

            Smart cards,  magnetic strip cards and  bar codes can be used by airport staff as
            a means of gaining access to any secure area within the airport.  The smart cards
            do not contain biometric information.

            (i)    Outline why the use of smart cards is an effective security measure.         [2 marks]

            To enhance security the smart cards could be linked to biometric identification
            systems.

            (ii)   State two types of biometric identification systems.                         [2 marks]

            (iii) Describe how biometric identification systems work.                           [4 marks]

            (iv) Compare the different levels of security that could be applied to staff
                 and passengers.                                                                [4 marks]

      (b)   Operation of each of the airport computer systems is controlled by the
            operating system.  Operating systems can be either single or multi-user and
            are capable of allowing multi-tasking.

            (i)    Define the term  operating system.                                           [1 mark]

            (ii)   Define the term  multi-user.                                                 [1 mark]

            (iii) Define the term  multi-tasking.                                               [1 mark]

            (iv) Identify three reasons for multi-tasking in Air Traffic Control.               [3 marks]

            (v)    Explain how a multi-user system is used in the check-in system.              [2 marks]

      (c)   Outline the principle characteristics of the following modes of operation.

            (i)    batch processing                                                             [2 marks]

            (ii)   real-time processing                                                         [2 marks]

            (iii) online processing                                                             [2 marks]

      (d)   Computer systems at the modern airport are linked via a  network.  With reference
            to the airport systems, outline the meaning of the terms  client and  server .      [4 marks]
