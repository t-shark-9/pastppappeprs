Computer systems in airports

Introduction
Modern airports are now highly reliant on computerized systems that provide the facilities for safe and
efficient access to air travel, as well as making the airport a pleasant environment for passengers.  
This case study explores some of the areas that make use of such systems.


Networks
Integration
Computer systems have now been developed that integrate all areas of a modern airport.   These areas
(or modules) are linked via a network to powerful servers (see diagram below).

                                                               –4–      M&N10&11/5/COMSC/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

The complexity of the computer networks that manage modern airports can be seen by looking at some
of the technical details for London Heathrow’s Terminal 5 (T5), which opened at the beginning of 2008,
and which was designed to handle up to 30 million passengers each year.

The high bandwidth backbone of the terminal’s network contains over 2500 km of cable which connect two
central data centres and 66 secondary communication centres.  Over 9000 different devices are connected
to the network which uses internet protocol (IP) to carry voice and data systems.1

A new control centre for the whole airport is also based at T5.  This manages the movement of aircraft to
and from the airport, communications with the airplanes’ crews, and the movement of aircraft on the ground.  
The new control tower was planned to run in parallel with the old tower for three months before making
the final switchover.2

All systems were tested for the six months preceeding the opening of the terminal with 16 000 people
recruited to act as “passengers”.


Network security
Failure to secure the network from either accidental or deliberate errors could have a dramatic effect on the
functioning of the network.  If the different systems are integrated into one network, then care must be taken
that a failure in one section does not have similar effects in other parts of the network.

Parts of the system are safety-critical, such as Air Traffic Control (see page 8).  Even a failure in systems
that are not safety-critical, such as baggage handling, could bring the effective functioning of the airport to
a halt.

Airport networks must also be protected from potential dangers from the Internet, to which it will be
connected through a gateway.

Various back-up systems must be considered.  For example, some airports lay multiple fibre-optic links
between the server room and the control tower so that the controllers would stay connected even if one line
was cut.

Airport security
Airport security can be separated into three areas:

      • securing the perimeter of the airport
      • security for the airport itself
      • the security of each plane.

CCTV cameras are used extensively within airports, to monitor both the perimeter of the airport and the
airport itself. Images are monitored by security personnel, and they can be stored digitally, and played back
at any time. Some cameras can switch to infrared. Expert systems have been developed that attempt to
recognize “unusual behaviour” within the airport buildings.


Employees
Every person that works within an airport, whether they are airport staff, employed by one of the many
shops or restaurants, or airline staff, will require a security clearance to be able to enter any area within the
airport. Each area can be “isolated” from the rest, requiring some kind of ID to be able to pass from one
area to another. A device secured beside the access point or door will be able to verify the identity of an
employee in a system.

These IDs could take the form of smart cards linked to some type of biometric identification system, such as:

      •   iris identification
      •   digital fingerprints
      •   hand geometry
      •   voice recognition
      •   facial recognition
      •   retina eye patterns
      •   signature identification.

Each system works by digitizing certain characteristics of the feature used, and storing these as a record for
each individual on a computer system. Each security point in the airport will have a biometric device that
could be a stand-alone system that compares the biometric data of the person with the data on the smart card.
Alternatively, the device could be connected to a central database.

                                           Fingerprint technology has been used for a long time and is
                                           consequently quite sophisticated. There are, however, ways to
                                           circumvent this system. Iris identification could offer a more
                                           secure system in the future, as it is difficult to forge, and is
                                           regarded as one the most accurate of the biometric technologies.
                                           It works by dividing an image of the iris into sections and turning
                                           the various patterns into mathematical expressions.3

Passengers
Passengers are required to carry a form of identification (normally a passport) in order to board planes.
For the airline, this matches the traveller with a particular flight reservation.  For the security or immigration
services, this determines whether or not the person will be allowed to continue with their journey.  Modern
passports are able to be scanned, allowing the passport data to be matched with data on the central database.

Airports are considering adding another layer of security with regards to the passengers.   Consider the
following article taken from The Guardian newspaper.


        How tagging passengers could improve airport security
        Friday 13 October, 2006
        Alok Jha, science correspondent for The Guardian

        Air travellers could soon be electronically tagged inside airports in a bid to improve security.
        The technology would use wrist bands or boarding passes embedded with computer chips and allow
        authorities to track passenger movement around terminal buildings.

        Paul Brennan, an electronic engineer at University College London who is leading work on the
        EU-funded Optag system, said it would combine high resolution panoramic video imaging with
        radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to enhance airport security, safety and efficiency.
        “It would work if each passenger were issued with a tag, which could allow location to about
        one metre accuracy,” he said.   “The video and tag data can be merged to give a very powerful
        surveillance capability.”

        RFID tags work by emitting a short radio message when interrogated by an electronic tag reader.
        Dr Brennan said that Optag RFID chips would not store any personal details.

        “They emit a unique ID which is then cross-referenced to the passenger information already on the
        system – maybe the name and flight number of the passenger.  Perhaps in the future that would be
        extended to things like biometric data.”  The tags would be linked to a network of CCTV cameras,
        which could be used to monitor movement of people around terminal buildings.

        Dr Brennan said: “It can allow precise tracking of certain individuals if they seem to be a security
        risk of any sort.  It can help to evacuate the airport.  It can provide rapid location of lost children.”

        Optag could also ensure that passengers get to a gate on time to board aircraft.  Dr Brennan said that
        flight delays due to late-running passengers cost airlines €100m a year in Europe. 4

Check-in
Airlines are looking for ways of using computer systems to help speed up the check-in process.
Several airlines allow passengers to print their own boarding cards at home, allowing them to by-pass the
normal check-in process at the airport, if they only have carry-on luggage.

Others provide self-service check-in kiosks, offering a quick, easy and safe alternative to traditional
check-in desks.  These self-service desks are computer terminals that are linked to the airline’s computer
system.  They allow you to choose your seat and print your boarding card, or in some cases make changes
to your travel schedule.

Air traffic control
“Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based controllers who direct aircraft on the
ground and in the air.  A controller’s primary task is to separate certain aircraft – to prevent them from
coming too close to each other.  Secondary tasks include ensuring safe, orderly and expeditious flow of
traffic and providing information to pilots, such as weather and navigation information.” 5  

ATC will also update the flight details files in the main server, which will in turn update flight information
display systems around the airport, and possibly trigger passenger announcements.

ATC has also seen the widespread integration of computer systems, primarily to allow increased traffic flow,
whilst at the same time maintaining the same high levels of safety.  This process, however, has raised an
interesting question: can all (manual) systems be successfully computerized?

Air traffic controllers work in centres that control a certain area of air space.  They deal with aircraft that
enter that space by monitoring the position of the aircraft using radar, and maintaining contact with the
pilots by radio.  Whenever an aircraft enters their air space, a computer prints off a strip of paper which
contains details of that aircraft (type, departure/arrival airports, flight number, ID number, etc.) and their
flight plans (speed, course, altitude, etc.).

A controller, on hearing the printer, will take this strip and place it in front of him with other strips representing
the aircraft that are his responsibility.  As each aircraft passes through the sector, the controller will regularly
annotate each strip by hand, indicating, for example, changes of height, control passed to another centre, etc.
A strip will typically end up with many annotations, all made by hand.  He will also change the position of
the strips grouping together aircraft that are close to one another, or arranging them in groups depending
upon which sector they are in.  When aircraft pass out of their control (for example, when they have landed),
the relevant strip is removed.

An example of an annotated flight strip is shown below:




      [Source: http://perso.tls.cena.fr/chatty/biblio/CHI96/sc_txt.htm]

A great deal of money has been spent in developing software that would replace the paper strips, but many
controllers remain reluctant to change a system that has proven so reliable in such a safety-critical area as
flight control.  

“Air traffic controllers like paper flight strips.  The interface is familiar, easy-to-use, helps controllers instantly
 understand the current state of the traffic and lets them communicate without interrupting each other.” 6   

In particular, they are concerned that manipulating a computer-user interface will distract them from their
tasks, and that important data automatically updated on a computer screen will go unnoticed.

Baggage handling: Software design
The main function of a baggage handling system is to transport bags quickly from a baggage entry
point (e.g. a check-in desk) to a pre-determined output point (e.g. into a container for loading onto the
aircraft). Parts of the system life cycle for the design of the baggage system for London’s Heathrow Airport
(Terminal 5) are outlined below.

Requirements specifications
Specifications had to be agreed between the two major stakeholders, the company that runs the airport
(British Airports Authority), and the airline that would exclusively use the new terminal (British Airways).

Between the bag entering the system and arriving at its destination within the airport, several processes
could be applied to the bags. These include bags being:

      •   automatically identified by their bag label
      •   screened for explosives (by automatic in-line hold baggage screening machines)
      •   stored in an early bag store (if passengers are too early for their flight)
      •   manually encoded (for resolving problems with bag information)
      •   sorted to flight allocated loading positions (automated sorting)
      •   fast tracked (for late bags that require urgent processing)
      •   manually handled (for large bags; and loading and unloading systems)
      •   reconciled (checked to see if bags are authorised to load onto aircraft e.g. to avoid a bag
          travelling without its owner).7

Development problems
Potential problems involved:

      • the use of many different suppliers
      • the use of a completely new design
      • the length of the project, which had a life-cycle of 7 years, which meant that specifications
        could change.

Testing
As the system will be in operation for 24 hours a day,
it is essential that extensive testing takes place before
installation. This testing includes the use of 3D virtual
reality baggage handling simulators.

Reservation systems
When a customer makes a flight reservation a unique “passenger name record” (PNR) is created, which
contains flight information and personal details of the person flying.  If a car is hired or a hotel is booked at
the same time, this information will also be stored on the PNR.

Few airlines store these records on their own system, but instead subscribe to a “global distribution
system” (GDS), which is an organization that stores flight details and PNRs for several airlines on its databases.
At present, there are four major GDSs: Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Wordspan.   Travel agents are
connected to these GDSs through Wide Area Networks.

                                  Various sources contribute to a PNR record




                                                     Hotels

                             Car hire



                                            GDS #1            GDS #2            Governments




                             On-line booking                    Travel agents



These GDSs use a similar format for their records so that information can be passed between them.  
This allows computerized reservation systems to book flights using one or more airlines with minimal
delay.  In recent years, certain governments have requested that more detailed personal information is added
to a PNR.  Agreement has been reached, to the alarm of human rights organizations, that the information on
these records can be accessed by governments and used to fight certain serious crimes.

A PNR could, therefore, contain credit card details, addresses, phone numbers, emergency contacts,
information on people who travel together, personal preferences (such as meal choices), details of medical
conditions and so on.

of public announcements.

Each flight is automatically categorised as either arrival or departure, and included on the appropriate
set of pages with a choice of arrivals or departures on each individual public screen.  Displayed information
includes: flight number, airport name, scheduled time and expected time, and status (on-time, expected,
landed/departed).

Flight records are sorted according to the same criteria as the ATC displays (i.e. expected movement time)
and removed from the display a few minutes after the flight has been shown as “landed” or “departed”,
which occurs when ATC enter an actual movement time for the flight.


Announcements
Traditionally, airport announcements were made using recordings of actual voices.  This inevitably led to
awkward sounding messages, as different phrases were “patched” together.  Problems would occur if new
airlines or new destinations arose, as new recordings would have to be made (with, perhaps, different voices).
Over the past few years, companies have been developing new automated systems that do not rely on actual
voice recordings.  

The system developed for Heathrow Airport works by generating and storing the individual phonemes
(sounds) that make up a particular language.  The phonemes depend, not only on the arrangement of letters
within a syllable but also on the position of the words within a sentence, and the words appearing
immediately before and after it.  The word “passenger” for example, has 36 phonemes associated with it.8  
The system is being linked to the flight information display system at the airport, so that announcements can
be made dynamically in real time.  The system was introduced in two phases.  The first dealt with general
passenger announcements in the different terminals.   The second phase was introduced at the different
boarding gates, and allowed individual PCs to generate local announcements.

Wi-Fi
Most airports now provide Wi-Fi “hotspots” which allow users to connect their laptops to the Internet.  
In order to connect, users have to enter their username and password.  These are given once the service has
been paid for (using vouchers, credit cards, etc.).

Wi-Fi originally used “wired equivalent privacy” (WEP), which is encryption technology designed to
secure the data being transferred between the transmitter and the user’s laptop.  However, this technology
was shown to be easily broken.  One method was to “trick” the user’s laptop into thinking that it had logged
onto a secure network, when it had not.  It did this by exploiting the basic hand-shaking system.

An improved security system, “Wi-Fi protected access” (WPA2) is now available, which has shown itself to
be very secure.  However, it is still recommended that the service provider makes use of strong passwords.

Wi-Fi is a global set of standards that use a radio frequency of 2.4 GHz (the same as mobile phones) with a
range up to 100 metres.  Transfer rates, by 2008, had reached 11 Mbits/s.

Is there an overdependence on computer systems?
This case study has demonstrated how computer systems are now at the heart of all areas of a modern airport,
and are helping to make air travel safer, more efficient, and more pleasant for the thousands of passengers
who pass through these airports.

It is, perhaps, inevitable, that as technology develops, such systems become more and more complex, and it
is this very complexity which can, at times, cause problems.

In August 2007, the computer system used by the US Customs and Immigration Service malfunctioned at
Los Angeles International Airport.  This resulted in over 20 000 passengers being stranded at the airport for
several hours awaiting clearance to enter the country.9

In July 2008, a faulty network card caused the US$100 million radar system at Ireland’s Dublin airport
to malfunction, causing delays for several thousand passengers.10

We often hear of systems being affected by hackers or unhappy employees, but the culprits for the two
problems outlined above (and for many others) were the systems themselves.

The more complex a system is, the more ways there are for it to go wrong and the longer it will take to
be fixed.  As we become more and more dependent on computer systems, not just in airports but in all areas
of our lives, the consequences of failure become increasingly severe.
