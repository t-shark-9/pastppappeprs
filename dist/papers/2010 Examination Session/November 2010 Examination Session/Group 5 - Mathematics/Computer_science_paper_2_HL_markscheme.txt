General Marking Instructions

After marking a sufficient number of scripts to become familiar with the markscheme and
candidates’ responses to all or the majority of questions, Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be
contacted by their Team Leader (TL). The purpose of this contact is to discuss the standard
of marking, the interpretation of the markscheme and any difficulties with particular questions.
It may be necessary to review your initial marking after contacting your TL. DO NOT BEGIN
THE FINAL MARKING OF YOUR SCRIPTS IN RED INK UNTIL YOU RECEIVE
NOTIFICATION THAT THE MARKSCHEME IS FINALIZED. You will be informed by
e-mail, fax or post of modifications to the markscheme and should receive these about one week
after the date of the examination. If you have not received them within 10 days you should
contact your TL and IB Cardiff. Make an allowance for any difference in time zone before
calling. AEs WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY NOT BE
INVITED TO MARK IN FUTURE SESSIONS.


You should contact the TL whose name appears on your “Allocation of Schools listing” sheet.


Note:
Please use a personal courier service when sending sample materials to TLs unless postal services can
be guaranteed. Record the costs on your examiner claim form.

General Marking Instructions

1.    Once markscheme is received mark in pencil until final markscheme is received.


2.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.


3.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () should be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark.

4.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. Indeed,
      another examiner may have arrived at the opposite decision. In these cases write a brief annotation
      in the left hand margin to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking.


5.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.


6.    Record subtotals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer. Show a mark for each part question (a), (b), etc. Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total
      mark for the question in the right-hand margin opposite the last line of the answer.


7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin.


8.    Record the mark awarded for each of the four questions answered in the Examiner Column on the
      cover sheet. Add up the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
      Column on the cover sheet.


9.    After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition of all marks to ensure that you have
      not made an arithmetical error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the
      cover sheet. We have script checking and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback
      to all examiners.


10.   Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.


11.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Once again
      make a comment to this effect in the left hand margin.

Subject Details:             Computer Science HL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions [20 marks] for question 1, [20 marks] for question 2,
[20 marks] for question 3 and [40 marks] for question 4. Maximum total = [100 marks].

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

      Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
        semi-colon (;).

      An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can
        be accepted.

      Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

      If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the
        same as that in the markscheme then award the mark.

      Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have
        got correct, rather than penalising them for what they have not achieved or what they have got
        wrong.

      Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor
        linguistic slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical
        accuracy.

      Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
        subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if
        the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
        be awarded. Indicate this with “FT”.

Question 4 continued

     (e)   (i)    Answer should outline any example of airport systems and an
                  explanation (referring to that system).
                  Award [2 marks] for correct ([1 mark] for vague example), up to [4 marks max].
                  ‘Client’ refers to a computer (on which there is a software application)
                  that requests actions;
                  ‘Server’ means a computer that provides services for the clients that are
                  available via network;                                                         [4 marks]

           (ii)   Award [1 mark] for any device and [1 mark] for its function, up to [2 marks max].
                  Example answers:
                  Network card;
                  Allows a device to be connected to network;
                  Transmission media;
                  Data is transferred along cables (wireless tech do not require such a device);
                  Switch;
                  Connects different parts of network, passes data onto appropriate destination;
                  Router;
                  Directs data traffic from one to another part of a LAN;
                  Gateway;
                  Connects a LAN to another network which uses different protocols;                 [2 marks]

           (iii) Award up to [2 marks max].
                 There are many different computer systems at the airport;
                 For transmitting data between different devices/different systems;
                 A set of rules is needed (types of error checking, the way of indicating
                 begin and end of data, etc.);                                                      [2 marks]

     (f)   Award up to [4 marks max].
           A linked list would be appropriate because
           The number of data items on the list is not finite;
           It can hold a sequence of data items that are not necessarily held in contiguous
           data locations;
           Or in order in which they occur (in Air Traffic Control one piece of information
           could have higher priority than another);
           Each item in the list (node) contains an information field;
           That may consist of several subfields;
           And a link (address) to the next item on the list;
           The last data item on list indicates there are no further items (null pointer);
           External pointer variable points to the first item on the list;
           New data items can be easily inserted at proper place on the list;
           Data already processed by air traffic controller can be easily deleted;                  [4 marks]

                                                                                             Total: [40 marks]
