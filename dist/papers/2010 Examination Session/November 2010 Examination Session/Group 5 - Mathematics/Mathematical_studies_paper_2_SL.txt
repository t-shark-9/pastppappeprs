      Part A

      100 students are asked what they had for breakfast on a particular morning.
      There were three choices: cereal (X ) , bread (Y ) and fruit (Z ) . It is found that

                             10 students had all three
                             17 students had bread and fruit only
                             15 students had cereal and fruit only
                             12 students had cereal and bread only
                             13 students had only bread
                             8 students had only cereal
