The answers given in this markscheme contain the essential information that candidates are expected to
provide in order to gain full marks for each question.
Where appropriate, the information may be expressed in phrases other than those indicated, but full
marks may only be awarded if all the necessary information is given.
Incomplete answers should be marked as directed.
Do not use half marks.
Unless otherwise indicated no marks are to be awarded or deducted for use of language: linguistic errors
should only be taken into account if communication is severely impaired and the answer is
incomprehensible to a normal speaker of the language.
Assistant Examiners are requested to wait until they are contacted by their team leader before
beginning the marking (see the examiners instructions for further details).




Les réponses données dans ce barème de notation contiennent l’essentiel de ce qu’on demande aux
candidats pour qu’ils puissent obtenir la note maximum pour chaque question.
Les réponses peuvent être formulées différemment mais la note maximum ne sera attribuée que si le
contenu de la réponse est exact.
Les réponses incomplètes seront notées selon les indications données.
En aucun cas, des demi-points ou des fractions ne doivent être attribués.
À moins d’une indication spécifique, aucun point ne sera ni ajouté ni ôté pour l’utilisation de la langue :
les erreurs linguistiques ne seront prises en considération que si elles nuisent sérieusement à la
communication et rendent ainsi la réponse incompréhensible.
Les examinateurs assistants sont priés d’attendre d’être contactés par leur chef d’équipe avant de
commencer leurs corrections (voir les instructions aux examinateurs pour de plus amples détails).




Las siguientes respuestas contienen la información esencial que los alumnos han de proporcionar para
conseguir la máxima puntuación en cada pregunta.
En ocasiones, esta información puede expresarse de manera distinta a la indicada, pero para conseguir
la máxima puntuación se han de mencionar todos los detalles requeridos.
Las respuestas incompletas deberán corregirse de la manera indicada en las instrucciones.
No utilice fracciones de puntos.
A menos que se indique lo contrario, no se deben añadir ni restar puntos por la calidad en el uso de la
lengua: los errores lingüísticos sólo se tomarán en cuenta si la comunicación queda seriamente
perjudicada o si la respuesta resulta incomprensible.
Se pide a los examinadores asistentes que esperen a ser contactados por su examinador líder de equipo
antes de iniciar la corrección (para más información, refiéranse a las instrucciones para los
examinadores).

TEXT D — ARE YOU A RESPONSIBLE TRAVELLER?

Communicative Purpose:
Explanation – evocative – in form of guidelines

A. Cultural Interaction [10 marks]
The aim of this task is to communicate by means of a talk with a mixed audience of parents and
young adults. The register should be in the range formal to semi-formal and a serious tone should
be adopted. Occasional flashes of informality are acceptable. The audience should be
acknowledged by a greeting, by thanks and by the use of inclusive language. A brief introduction,
perhaps explaining the speaker’s interest in the subject, is acceptable and should be rewarded.
Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
obscure meaning.

B. Message [10 marks]
The aim of this task is to communicate useful advice on how to travel responsibly. Aspects of
travel that are not responsible should not be included unless only briefly in order to stress
positive aspects.

Irrelevant details which are selected should be considered under Criterion B and penalized
appropriately to the extent that they indicate poor understanding of the source and/or the task.
Similarly, details not found in the text should not be included.

The descriptors regarding copying from the text should be strictly adhered to. Verbatim copying of
details from the text is acceptable provided that the details are “used”, that is, sensibly incorporated
into the response. Copying details without so using them constitutes “undue copying”.

However competently the response may be written, marks depend on using details from the source
text.

The candidate should include some of the following details from the text (though not necessarily in
these words but in words that convey the same meaning).

A.   Effects on the environment and the locals should be considered.
B.   Some prior investigation (about tour companies) is advisable.
C.   Try to get away from your hotel to some extent.
D.   Accept/don’t complain about everyday aspects of the country visited (weather, insects, etc.).
E.   Leave the mobile and laptop at home.
F.   Interact with the local people as much as possible.
G.   Read about the culture of the country before the holiday.
H.   Learn at least a few words of the language.
I.   Be willing to learn from the locals.
J.   Keep an open mind about the country until you experience it.

Register and Style:
The register should be in the range of formal to semi-formal.

CRITERION B:


    To achieve level 5 (adequate understanding), at least five details should be included.
    To achieve level 9 (very good understanding), at least eight details should be included.

HL Paper 1, Section B: Written Response
Criterion A: Cultural Interaction
To what extent does the candidate select language appropriate to the audience and type of text?
    How appropriate and clear is the use of register and style to both the type of text required and the
     audience?
          (Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
          obscure meaning.)

Achievement
Level

0          Level 1 is not achieved.

1–2           The response is barely adequate.
               The use of register and style is rarely appropriate to both the type of text required and the
                audience; language mistakes generally obscure meaning.

3–4           The response is generally adequate but not always convincing.
               The use of register and style is sometimes appropriate to either the type of text required or
                the audience; language mistakes often obscure meaning.

5–6           The response is competent and mostly convincing.
               The use of register and style is generally appropriate to both the type of text required and the
                audience; language mistakes obscure meaning at times.

7–8           The response is convincing.
               The use of register and style is appropriate to both the type of text required and the audience;
                language mistakes rarely obscure meaning.

9–10          The response is convincing and shows some imagination.
               The use of register and style is highly appropriate to both the type of text required and the
                audience; language mistakes do not obscure meaning.
                                                     –9–             N10/2/ABENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate include all necessary information from the source text in the message?
    Does the candidate seem to have understood the source text thoroughly and perceptively?
    Has the candidate provided all the details from the source text that are relevant to the task?
    How appropriately have the details from the source text been used in the written response, without
     undue copying of the source text?

Achievement
Level

0             Level 1 is not achieved.

1–2           The understanding of the source text seems fairly limited.
               The details selected from the text are generally insufficient and/or irrelevant.
               Many parts of the source text have been copied because of limited understanding.

3–4           The understanding of the source text seems adequate.
               The details selected from the text may be partly insufficient and/or sometimes irrelevant.
               Some parts of the source text have been copied because of some difficulties with
                understanding.

5–6           The understanding of the source text seems competent.
               Sufficient relevant details have been selected from the text.
               The selected details are used appropriately to some extent, without undue copying of the
                source text.

7–8           The understanding of the source text seems very good.
               Many relevant details have been selected from the text.
               The selected details are mostly used appropriately without undue copying of the source text.

9–10          The understanding of the source text seems thorough and perceptive.
               Almost all relevant details have been selected from the text.
               The selected details are all used appropriately without undue copying of the source text.
