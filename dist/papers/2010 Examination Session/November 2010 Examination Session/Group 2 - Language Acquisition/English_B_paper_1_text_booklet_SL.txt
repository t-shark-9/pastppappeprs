TEXT A


                              Made to Measure!
        When one-time magician Francisco Guerra decided to float an idea he really pulled
        a rabbit out of the hat – a cloud-making machine.

        The clouds, or “Flogos” (flying + logos), come in any shape
        you want – from Mickey Mouse to the Olympic rings.
  5     They are made of soap and gases, such as helium, which
        allow them to fly off and retain their puffy texture.

        “They will fly for miles,” says Mr Guerra. “They are
        durable so they last a while.”

        Depending on the weather and the formula used, the Flogos can last from a few
 10     minutes to more than an hour. They can fly up to 48 km (30 miles) away and go as high
        as 6 km (4 miles) but normally the little clouds level out at about 150 m (500 ft).

        His machines can pump out your flying logo at a rate of one every 15 seconds. The
        clouds can be made in 60 cm (2 ft) or 90 cm (3 ft) sizes but a 1.8 m (6 ft) generator is
        in the pipeline.

 15                                Current designs are only available in white and Mr Guerra
                                   insists Flogos are environmentally friendly because the
                                   soaps that make up the foamy shapes are plant-based.

                                   “Eventually a Flogo just evaporates in the air. It does not
                                   pollute the skies,” he says.

 20     “They’re safer than mass balloon launches where the fragments pollute the
        environment and are dangerous to wildlife.”

        The proto-clouds have also been cleared by the authorities of being a hazard
        to aeroplanes.

                             THREE-DIMENSIONAL TELEVISION
                             COMING TO A SCREEN NEAR YOU!

   [–X–]

 Television has come a long way since the first fuzzy broadcast from Alexandra Palace more than
 70 years ago. With hundreds of channels now on offer and sales of high-definition set-top boxes topping
 600 000 in the past 18 months, the next step, the industry says, will be to take the picture into 3D.


    Possibilities to come

 Sky revealed yesterday that it has developed the technology and infrastructure to transmit 3D images,
 raising the prospect of sofa-bound sports fans being tricked into ducking as a football bounces out of
 the screen. This company, one of several global broadcasters testing 3DTV, will continue to develop the
 technology screens required to handle 3D television. It will, thus, become more readily available and
 affordable, and programme-makers and broadcasters will film more content in 3D.


     [ – 17 – ]

 “We’re just exploring right now,” Brian Lenz, the company’s head of product design and innovation, says.
 “The next step is going to be to find out whether 3DTV is something people are going to be interested in.”
 If there is public appetite for this new experience, Sky – which is partly owned by News Corporation, the
 parent company of The Times newspaper – will introduce the service over the next few years and is likely
 to be the first to offer channels with full 3D coverage.

     [ – 18 – ]

 3D film is produced using two cameras that film the action side by side. The new technology allows these
 two images to be merged and played out simultaneously on the same TV screen. Viewers, who with
 Sky’s version currently have to wear polarized glasses to view 3D, will see a different image with each eye,
 tricking the brain into believing that it is seeing a three-dimensional image.

    [ – 19 – ]

 Sky says that it will eventually be able to film and broadcast events live in 3D. It has already successfully
 run an internal test where a small audience watched a recent Ricky Hatton boxing match in 3D. In Japan,
 where 3D-capable TVs are already available, stations are showing 3D programmes every day.

     3DTV’s next stage

 Broadcasters are [ – X – ] that studios will start producing more films in 3D. The signs are encouraging.

 all [ – 26 – ] films will be made in 3D. This will be a great step forward for television; who knows what
 will come next?

TEXT D


                 “Cheap eats”: Students try
               one-dollar-a-day diet for charity
                   Seniors aim to raise money and awareness of global poverty

For LSA school seniors Alissa Renz and Clare Porter, Thanksgiving will be a scaled-down affair
this year.

The students are committed to spending just $ 1 a day on food each for the month of November
to draw attention to and raise funds for the fight against global poverty.

They are raising money to donate to Millennium Promise, a non-profit organization that works to
eradicate global poverty in the next few decades. The students decided not to buy in bulk at the
beginning of the month in order to better imitate actual conditions, Porter says. Their food staples
have been oatmeal, rice and lentils, plus bananas as a 16-cent “treat”, she says.

Renz says she’s learned how to add flavor to bland meals by adding taco seasoning to rice and
wrapping it in a tortilla: an extremely cheap yet filling recipe.

The diet’s lack of nutrition has had physical effects. “I suffered from headaches and fatigue,
especially during the first few days,” Renz states. “At the beginning, I wondered – I knew I’d
do it, but I wasn’t sure if my life would be a happy thing for a month,” Porter says. “The body can’t
digest stuff as easily, so a lot of times after eating I had to go straight to sleep.”

Professor George Thompson, of Duke University, stated that research shows that students, when
left on their own, choose the wrong kind of food to eat, like fast food. He adds that students
should consult a nutritionalist in order to have the right food balance.

Both students’ bodies have physically adjusted, and both said they feel less hungry in general.
They even lost a little weight and their skin cleared up. The most difficult thing, both agree, is the
psychological component.

“It’s difficult because food is used as comfort so often,” Porter says. “This really reinforces
for me that poverty and hunger are body, mind, spirit, everything. It’s a mental problem if
you’re hungry.”

“People say: ‘I’d eat all the food in the world’, but it’d be so sad if that’s what we came away with,”
Porter states. “I think I’m just going to really enjoy the flavors and the freshness.”

“I’ve come to realize I can sustain myself on this little,” she says. “It seems unnecessary for my
body and unnecessary for my wallet.”
