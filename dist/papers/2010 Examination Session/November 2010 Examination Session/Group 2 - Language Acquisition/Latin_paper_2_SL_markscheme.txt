Elegiac and Lyric poetry

1.   (a)   Hypallage occurs in line 1 [1 mark], chiasmus in line 2 [1 mark], a grammatical subordinate
           cum phrase for what is logically one of the three subjects in line 3 [1 mark], and interlocked
           word order in line 4 [1 mark].

     (b)   By such exploitation of rhetoric the poet forces the reader’s attention to a sharper scrutiny of
           what he is saying in this invitation to Maecenas [1 mark]. He particularly compels the reader
           to re-examine that opening line Tyrrhena regum progenies, which sounds like hyperbole
           [1 mark].

     (c)   The towns of the Sabine-hill country are evocative of pleasure and pride [1 mark], and they
           balance the high-flown address to Maecenas [1 mark].

     (d)   He is one who delays [1 mark], who gazes upon Tibur, Aefula and Tusculanum [1 mark],
           who lives in cloying luxury in a tower which climbs to the clouds [1 mark], and who marvels
           at the smoke, wealth and noise of Rome [1 mark].

     (e)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.
                                                                                          [15 marks]


2.   (a)   The old ship was the fastest of ships [1 mark], there was never any timber afloat whose speed
           she was not able to pass [1 mark], whether she would fly with oar blades or with
           canvas [1 mark].

     (b)   On Catullus’ return from Bithynia in 56BC to his dearly beloved home at Sirmio,
           he suspended, as a votive offering in a shrine on his own property, a model of the yacht that
           had brought him safely through his perils at sea, and this poem is the dedicatory inscription
           that was attached to it [3 marks].

     (c)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (d)   The mythological characters are Castor and Castor’s twin Pollux [2 marks]. They were the
           twin sons of Zeus [1 mark].

     (e)   Adriatic Sea, Cyclades, Rhodes, Propontis, Cytorus, Amastris. For two of the names give
           [2 marks]. In reflecting on this recent journey from Bithynia to Sirmio, Catullus
           imaginatively sees the ship in its early stages as a forest on the slopes of Mt. Cytorus near the
           city of Amastris, on the south coast of the Black Sea. The catalogue of names takes the
           journey back to its starting place [1 mark].
                                                                                                 [15 marks]
                                                    –4–                N10/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Epic

3.     (a)   Aeneas is at a cave by lake Avernus [1 mark] with the Sybil [1 mark]. Aeneas and the Sybil
             are about to perform a midnight sacrifice [1 mark] in preparation for the journey to the
             Underworld [1 mark].

       (b)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.

       (c)   The Sybil calls upon Hecate [1 mark] in both her spheres of power (she was Diana in heaven
             and Hecate in Hades) [1 mark]. According to the ritual in prayers, a divinity was addressed
             by his or her various titles to ensure the desired response to a proper and pleasing request
             [1 mark].

       (d)   voce vocans [1 mark]. Name of device [1 mark]. Used here to reinforce the idea i.e. that the
             Sybil is really trying to get an answer to her request to Hecate [1 mark].

       (e)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
             awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
             no mark should be awarded.
                                                                                            [15 marks]


4.     (a)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.

       (b)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
             (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
             awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
             no mark should be awarded.

       (c)   The Sybil tells Palinurus to hear and remember her words: people who live in the cities
             around the place where he died will be driven by signs of heaven and consecrate his bones
             [1 mark]; they will raise a burial mound [1 mark], to this burial mound they will pay their
             annual tribute [1 mark], and the place will bear the name of Palinurus in all time to come
             [1 mark].

       (d)   parumper [1 mark]. Palinurus begs Aeneas, by all that he holds dear to give him the rite
             of burial. Aeneas can do nothing to comfort him. With the words of the Sybil,
             parumper (“for a little while”), his grief is driven away from his anguished heart. The pathos
             is very moving: “just a moment of present happiness – and then, how long still must
             he wait?” [1 mark]. Other possible suggestions to be judged on merit.

       (e)   Judge on merits, rewarding quotations to support the argument made [4 marks].
                                                                                                 [15 marks]
                                                 –5–                N10/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Historiography

5.   (a)   Tarquinius called in workmen from every quarter of Etruria [1 mark], used the state fund
           [1 mark] and labourers drawn from the commons/plebeians [1 mark].

     (b)   Working on the construction of the temple was considered to be a big task, and so was
           added to their military service [1 mark]. The plebeians felt less abused at having to build
           the temple with their own hands [1 mark] than by performing other tasks which were yet
           more laborious [1 mark].

     (c)   The reference is to the fori (block of seats in the theatre) [1 mark] and to the cloaca (Great
           Sewer) [1 mark].

     (d)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (e)   The king intended to extend the frontiers of his dominions [1 mark]; he, therefore,
           sent colonists to Signia and Circei [1 mark], to safeguard the city [1 mark] by land and
           sea [1 mark].
                                                                                         [15 marks]


6.   (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   Carmenta’s prophecy foretold that Hercules should be added to the number of gods [1 mark],
           an altar should be dedicated to him in that place [1 mark] which the nation one day should
           call the Greatest Altar [1 mark] and should serve according to his rite [1 mark].

     (c)   Hercules offered his right hand to Evander [1 mark], and said he would fulfill the prophecy
           by establishing and dedicating an altar [1 mark].

     (d)   Men chose a victim from the herd [1 mark]. The Potitii and the Pinarii were employed to
           perform the ministry and banquet at the sacrifice [1 mark]. The Potitii and the Pinarii were
           two of the most distinguished families living in that region at the time [1 mark].

     (e)   Judge on merits of three quotations to support the argument made [3 marks].
                                                                                             [15 marks]
                                                 –6–               N10/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Letters

7.   (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   In order to relieve anxiety, Pliny the Elder kept saying that the terrified country people had
           left some fires alight [1 mark], and what they saw were only deserted villas on fire in the
           abandoned district [1 mark].

     (c)   Pliny the Elder’s rest was a most genuine sleep as proved by his breathing, which, as he was
           pretty fat, was somewhat heavy and sonorous [2 marks], and was heard by those who
           attended at his chamber door [1 mark].

     (d)   Pliny the Elder came out of his chamber, returned to Pomponianus and the other people
           who had sat up all night [1 mark]. They consulted together as to whether they should hold
           out in the house [1 mark], or wander about in the open [1 mark].

     (e)   Pliny the Elder reached a conclusion regarding staying inside the house or in the open air by
           balancing reason [1 mark] while Pomponianus and his companions were moved by fear
           [1 mark]. Pliny the Elder showed a composed manner in dealing with the serious situation
           and comforted people who were terrified by the fires [1 mark]; he calmly went to sleep while
           Pomponianus and others in fear and agitation stayed awake all night [1 mark].
                                                                                             [15 marks]
                                                  –7–                N10/2/LATIN/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Letters

8.   (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
           (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
           awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
           no mark should be awarded.

     (b)   Those who had ceased to be Christians showed Pliny they had abandoned their faith by
           worshiping Trajan’s statue [1 mark], revering the statues of Roman gods [1 mark] and
           cursing the name of Christ [1 mark].

     (c)   Pliny gives an account of the following three early Christian practices: the custom of
           antiphonal singing [1 mark], the sacramentum, which Pliny takes to mean just “an oath”
           [1 mark], and the communal meal, which is not Mass but simply a social gathering, which the
           Christians are willing to forgo to avoid breaking the law [1 mark].

     (d)   The word mandata refers to Trajan’s mandata. The mandata were the confidential
           instructions issued by the emperor to governors-elect of his own imperial provinces. Pliny in
           any case received mandata by virtue of being the emperor’s special appointee. Mandata seem
           to have consisted partly of instructions applicable to all (or many of) the provinces and partly
           of special rules applicable to a governor’s province. Trajan had included in his mandata to
           Pliny the instruction that hetaeriae be suppressed in Bithynia and Pontus [1 mark]. Hetaeria
           was a secret society or guild for whatever purpose which was looked on as dangerous
           [1 mark]. The Christians were not charged with forming a hetaeria [1 mark].

     (e)   Pliny thought it necessary to torture the two girls to investigate whether the Christians were
           violating his edict [1 mark]. The girls were called ministrae [1 mark]. Pliny thought the
           Christian religion to be a degenerated sort of cult and showed no interest in its religious
           motives [1 mark].
                                                                                              [15 marks]

Satire

9.    (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
            (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
            awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
            no mark should be awarded.

      (b)   The use of the word Quirites is especially appropriate here because it refers to the domestic
            name that Romans applied to one another – to foreigners they were Romani [1 mark].
            The domestic name of the Romans is used here pointedly in contrast with Graecam urbem.
            This contrast indicates Umbricius’ rejection of a Greek Rome [1 mark]. By using the
            word Quirites, Umbricius emphasizes the early origin of the Romans by using a name that
            was not related at all with foreignness [1 mark].

      (c)   Judge on merits [4 marks].

      (d)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.

      (e)   Judge on merits of three quotations to support the argument made [3 marks].
                                                                                                [15 marks]


10.   (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer, or for an answer with no more than one minor error
            (tense, number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
            awarded [2 marks]. With two major errors (or the equivalent) award [1 mark]. Otherwise,
            no mark should be awarded.

      (b)   Judge on merits of quotations to support the argument made [3 marks].

      (c)   This is an excellent example of satiric hyperbole [1 mark]. It is an exaggerated version of the
            cliché that in time of war ploughshares and other agricultural implements are melted down
            into swords, etc. [1 mark]. Umbricius claims that there are so many criminals that
            ploughshares, mattocks and hoes are melted down to make fetters and chains. Umbricius’
            exaggeration can be read as an indication of his obsession and pessimism [1 mark].
            Other suggestions to be judged on merit.

      (d)   Umbricius evokes a distant past [1 mark] which he portrays as virtually crime free – with the
            need of only one prison [1 mark]. The emotive felices proavorum atavos, felicia helps to
            characterize him as rooted (impossibly) in the past: he is an old-fashioned Roman who does
            not belong in modern Rome [2 marks].

      (e)   Mark only for length of syllables. [1 mark] per line if all correct, no mark otherwise.
                                                                                                 [15 marks]
