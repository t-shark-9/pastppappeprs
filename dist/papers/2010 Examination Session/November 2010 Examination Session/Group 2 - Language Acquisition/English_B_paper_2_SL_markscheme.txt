These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.


1.    You were recently present at an event that made you change your mind about the kind of
      career you hoped to follow later in life. Describe the event in a letter to a friend and discuss
      the kind of career you would like to have now.

      Written interaction – informal – letter

      A good answer
       will describe the event
       will explain why it changed the candidate’s career plans
       will adopt an informal register to suit the letter format
       will include a date and greeting as well as a closing phrase
       will include both parts of the task – description of the event and how it changed the career
        plans; if one part of the task has been largely or entirely ignored, no more than 6 marks
        may be awarded for Criterion C.


2.    Your grandmother has told you that she has great difficulty using the computer that your
      family gave to her for her last birthday. You decide to send her clear and simple instructions
      explaining how to send an email. Write the instructions.

      Factual description – fairly informal – set of instructions

      A good answer
       will provide clear and simple instructions, organized consecutively
       will have a fairly informal register, but will need to be more formal for the technical details
       will employ appropriate discourse markers
       may include the instructions in a sympathetic letter; this should be rewarded under
        Criterion C
       may employ a user-friendly format such as bullet points or numbering; this should be
        rewarded.

3.   As a member of your school’s Social Club, you have been asked to write an article for the
     school newspaper on an event which you recently attended – such as a concert, festival, play
     or sports event. Write the article describing this event.

     Analysis and critique – fairly formal – review of an event

     A good answer
      will state the type of event
      may show clearly the candidate’s feelings about the event – negative or positive
      may engage in some form of criticism or praise
      will not retell the event in every detail
      may include an evaluation with a recommendation (which may be implicit); this should be
       rewarded
      will adopt a fairly formal register
      may have a title and the name of the writer; this should be rewarded.


4.   It is your turn to give the weekly talk to your class and your teacher has given you the topic:
     “What we can do to make our school more environmentally friendly”. Write the text of
     your talk.

     Argument – fairly informal – text of a talk

     A good answer
      will deal with relevant and appropriate suggestions
      will have a fairly informal register
      will use inclusive language
      will have a sense of audience throughout, especially at the beginning and end
      will contain rhetorical devices (Criterion B)
      may include factual information which should be rewarded
      may be controversial.
