The answers given in this markscheme contain the essential information that candidates are expected to
provide in order to gain full marks for each question.
Where appropriate, the information may be expressed in phrases other than those indicated, but full
marks may only be awarded if all the necessary information is given.
Incomplete answers should be marked as directed.
Do not use half marks.
Unless otherwise indicated no marks are to be awarded or deducted for use of language: linguistic errors
should only be taken into account if communication is severely impaired and the answer is
incomprehensible to a normal speaker of the language.
Assistant Examiners are requested to wait until they are contacted by their team leader before
beginning the marking (see the examiners instructions for further details).




Les réponses données dans ce barème de notation contiennent l’essentiel de ce qu’on demande aux
candidats pour qu’ils puissent obtenir la note maximum pour chaque question.
Les réponses peuvent être formulées différemment mais la note maximum ne sera attribuée que si le
contenu de la réponse est exact.
Les réponses incomplètes seront notées selon les indications données.
En aucun cas, des demi-points ou des fractions ne doivent être attribués.
À moins d’une indication spécifique, aucun point ne sera ni ajouté ni ôté pour l’utilisation de la langue :
les erreurs linguistiques ne seront prises en considération que si elles nuisent sérieusement à la
communication et rendent ainsi la réponse incompréhensible.
Les examinateurs assistants sont priés d’attendre d’être contactés par leur chef d’équipe avant de
commencer leurs corrections (voir les instructions aux examinateurs pour de plus amples détails).




Las siguientes respuestas contienen la información esencial que los alumnos han de proporcionar para
conseguir la máxima puntuación en cada pregunta.
En ocasiones, esta información puede expresarse de manera distinta a la indicada, pero para conseguir
la máxima puntuación se han de mencionar todos los detalles requeridos.
Las respuestas incompletas deberán corregirse de la manera indicada en las instrucciones.
No utilice fracciones de puntos.
A menos que se indique lo contrario, no se deben añadir ni restar puntos por la calidad en el uso de la
lengua: los errores lingüísticos sólo se tomarán en cuenta si la comunicación queda seriamente
perjudicada o si la respuesta resulta incomprensible.
Se pide a los examinadores asistentes que esperen a ser contactados por su examinador líder de equipo
antes de iniciar la corrección (para más información, refiéranse a las instrucciones para los
examinadores).

TEXT D — CHEAP EATS: STUDENTS TRY ONE-DOLLAR-A-DAY DIET FOR CHARITY

Communicative Purpose:
Narrative – factual

Register and Style:
The register should be informal.

Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
obscure meaning.

Diary entries which have dates and avoid explanatory references, such as “Mary, my sister,” which
would not normally occur in a diary, should be rewarded.
N.B. If the response is not a diary entry, the maximum mark it will receive is 6.

Message:
The aim of this task is to explain what the one-dollar-a-day diet is and what the candidate
experienced during the week that s/he tried it. The candidate’s feelings about how the diet affected
him/her should be clear and an evident sense of what was happening should be felt. There may also
be references to what the friends felt or experienced during this week.

The descriptors regarding copying from the text should be strictly adhered to. Verbatim copying of
details from the text is acceptable provided that the details are “used”, that is, sensibly incorporated
into the response. Copying details without so using them constitutes “undue copying”.

However competently the response may be written, marks depend on using details from the source
text.

The candidate should include some of the following details from the text (though not necessarily in
these words but in words that convey the same meaning).

A.    A group of students decided to live on a poverty diet (in order to support a charity).
B.    They did not buy food in bulk.
C.    They chose (inexpensive) foods such as rice/oatmeal/lentils.
D.    S/he had a banana as a treat.
E.    Flavour can be added to bland food by adding seasoning e.g. taco to a tortilla filled with rice.
F.    S/he suffered from headaches and fatigue during the first days.
G     Following this diet meant that s/he would sleep after eating.
H.    S/he felt less hungry.
I.    S/he lost a little/some weight.
J.    His/her skin cleared up.
K.    Food provides comfort/affects your mental attitude to everything.
L.    You learn to sustain yourself on little.
M.    You realize that too much food is unnecessary and/or expensive.

To achieve level 5 (adequate understanding), at least five details should be included.
To achieve level 9 (very good understanding), at least nine details should be included.

SL Paper 1, Section B: Written Response
Please note that at standard level the written response is assessed with only one criterion.

To what extent does the candidate understand the source text and respond appropriately to it?

    Has the candidate provided all the details from the source text that are relevant to the task?
    How appropriately have the details from the source text been used in the written response without
     undue copying of the source text?
    How appropriate is the use of register and style to both the type of text required and the audience?
   (Levels 5 to 10 may be awarded only if the candidate has an adequate understanding of the
   source text.)
   (Language accuracy is not formally assessed here and should be considered only where mistakes
   obscure meaning.)

Achievement
Level
  0                Level 1 is not achieved.
1–2                The understanding of the source text is very limited.
                   • The details selected from the text are generally insufficient and/or irrelevant.
                   • Many parts of the source text have been copied because of lack of understanding.
                   • Language mistakes generally obscure meaning.
3–4                The understanding of the source text is fairly limited.
                   • The details selected from the text may be partly insufficient and/or sometimes
                     irrelevant.
                   • Some parts of the source text have been copied because of limited understanding.
                   • Language mistakes often obscure meaning.
5–6                The understanding of the source text is adequate but the response is not always
                   convincing.
                   • A few relevant details have been selected from the text.
                   • The details are not always used appropriately; there is some undue copying of the
                     source text.
                   • The choice of register and style is sometimes appropriate to the type of text required
                     or the audience; language mistakes obscure meaning at times.
7–8                The understanding of the source text is competent and the response is mostly
                   convincing.
                   • Sufficient relevant details have been selected from the text.
                   • The details are used appropriately to some extent, without undue copying of the
                   source text.
                   • The choice of register and style tends to be appropriate to both the type of text
                     required and the audience; language mistakes rarely obscure meaning.
9–10               The understanding of the source text is very good and the response is convincing.
                   • Many relevant details have been selected from the text.
                   • The details are mostly used appropriately without undue copying of the source text.
                   • The choice of register and style is generally appropriate to both the type of text
                   required and the audience; language mistakes rarely obscure meaning.
