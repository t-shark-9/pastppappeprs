These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites the candidate to consider two texts about The Kokoda Trail. Text 1 is an
advertisement promoting reasons to walk the Kokoda Trail, while text 2 is part of a magazine article
which describes the inherent dangers involved.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary will:

    note that both texts are about the Kokoda Trail but explored from different perspectives
    note the different genre
    comment on the different purpose and audience associated with each text
    mention at least one or two stylistic devices in each text.


A better comparative commentary may also:

    discuss key stylistic elements: for instance, imperatives; names; descriptions; exotic visual
    imagery, historical allusions found in text 1; hyperbole, imagery, capitalization, simile,
    statistics, enumeration and formal register found in text 2
    discuss and explain the upbeat/reassuring/comforting tone of text 1 as compared to the
    concerned somewhat alarmist tone evident in text 2
    comment in more detail on the language style apparent in both texts and relate this to purpose
    comment on how imagery is used to advance a reader’s interest in walking the Kokoda Trail in
    text 1, but used to the opposite effect in text 2
    comment on the function of the narrative viewpoints: the use of second person in text 1
    compared to third person in text 2.


The best comparative commentaries may also:

    more thoroughly explore the language style evident in both texts
    consider the titles of each text
    note that both texts are written in a persuasive manner but achieve different purposes
    examine the structure of text 1 and how this contributes to its persuasive purpose
    compare and contrast the didactic nature of texts 1 and 2
    comment in more detail on the tone of both texts and what effect this has on audience.

                                           SECTION B

This question invites candidates to compare an excerpt from an autobiographical memoir and a
poem, both of which are concerned with a child-father relationship.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary will:

   note the different genres: one is an autobiographical memoir, one a poem
   note that the narrator in both texts is referring to their father
   comment on the structure of each text
   mention at least one or two stylistic devices in each text e.g. anecdote and dialogue in text 3,
   simile and alliteration in text 4.


A better comparative commentary may also:

   discuss the language style evident in both texts. Text 3 is lively and more playful, while text 4
   is formal, almost ceremonial
   recognize that the narrator in text 3 is male and the narrator in text 4 is female and perhaps that
   the father in each text is a doctor
   comment in some detail on stylistic devices
   comment on point of view in each text and the effect this has on the reader
   comment on the nature of the relationship in text 3 as compared to text 4
   discuss the tone evident in each text e.g. admiring, witty or resigned in text 3; restrained,
   cautious, even respectfully solemn in text 4.


The best comparative commentaries may also:

   discuss in more detail the relationship between the narrator and their father: the hint of regret in
   text 4 (without much affection) as compared to deep affection and admiration in text 3
   comment in further detail on stylistic devices e.g. description, juxtaposition, irony in text 3;
   use of meter, rhyme scheme and the multiple meaning of “slipping” in text 4
   discuss the way wit and hyperbole is used to characterize the father in text 3 while respectful
   distance is used to characterize the father in text 4
   consider the relationship between tone and meaning in both texts
   note that text 3 describes the relationship (past tense) through recall, while text 4 describes the
   relationship (present tense) through the aging process.
