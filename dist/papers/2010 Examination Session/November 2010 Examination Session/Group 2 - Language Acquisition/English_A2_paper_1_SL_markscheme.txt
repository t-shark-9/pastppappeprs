These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites the candidate to consider two texts about diamonds. Text 1 is an excerpt from
Ian Fleming’s novel, Diamonds are Forever, while text 2 is a promotional article that honours the
fiftieth anniversary of a world famous advertising slogan: “A Diamond is Forever”.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary will:

  identify the common theme and show an awareness of purpose and audience
  note the different genres: text 1 is fiction and text 2 is promotional, non-fiction or “like an
  advertisement”
  note that both texts rely on different structure and language styles to achieve their purpose
  identify some stylistic features in both texts: (e.g. repetition of the slogan in text 2, imagery in
  text 1).


A better comparative commentary may also:

   explore in more detail the different language style used in each text
   comment on the evocative images used in text 1 and their effects
   comment in more detail on the different purpose of each text: (e.g. text 1 to entertain, introduce
   the protagonist (Bond) to the subject (diamonds), and 2 to promote, even to glorify the De Beers
   company)
   discuss the use and effect of the third-person narrative position in both texts
   comment on the historical explanation in text 2 and the purpose it serves.


The best comparative commentaries may also:

   consider how the value of diamonds is communicated differently in both texts (e.g. pure beauty
   versus commercial enterprise)
   comment in more detail on the stylistic elements of both texts (e.g. simile, sensory imagery,
   allusion)
   explore the tone of both texts (e.g. text 1 is appreciative/intimate/reflective while text 2 is
   commanding/persuasive/glorifying).

                                            SECTION B

This question invites the candidates to compare an extract from a non-fiction book with a
promotional website, both of which are concerned with bread making.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary will:

  call attention to the different genres: one a recipe book and the other a promotional website
  comment on the purpose of each text (noting that text 3 is to inform, enthuse and educate, while
  text 4 is to promote and encourage commercial interest)
  comment on the different language style apparent in each text
  identify one or two stylistic features of each text.


A better comparative commentary may also:

   comment in more detail on the different language style evident in each text
   consider how short statements are used in text 4 and how these work to engage the reader
   comment on point of view in each text
   note differences in tone: text 3 is firm and authoritative while text 4 is more self-promotional
   and enticing
   discuss stylistic devices in more detail including the use and effects of sensory imagery in
   both texts
   discuss what ideas are shared by both texts, but communicated differently.


The best comparative commentaries may also:

   comment on the persuasive quality evident in both texts
   note that text 3 presents both an historical and defining context to achieve credibility, while text
   4 appeals to our environmental consciousness
   comment on how both texts appeal to the senses and to what effect
   comment on the effect created by the references to Mother Earth found in text 4
   note that text 3 is a definition of artisan bread while text 4 is an illustration of this definition.
