Answers which are not based on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score high marks.

Drama

1.    The immediate setting of plays often has a larger historical or sociological context of which the
      audience is made aware. In what ways have playwrights in at least two works you have studied
      included or emphasized any of these settings and to what effect?


2.    “Plays have their fair share of inspiring trumpet calls, though what they inspire is often terror –
      the trumpet of doom.” To what extent and in what ways have at least two works you have studied
      inspired terror or feelings of impending doom?



Poetry

3.    One poet has defined poetry as that which “makes me want to do this or that or nothing”. In what
      ways and by what means have at least two poets in your study inspired you to act or think, or both?


4.    Poems are often focused on a single person or object. How have at least two of the poets in your
      study used this strategy to convey feelings or ideas?



Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.    In portraying characters and events, writers of novels and short stories often employ some
      elements of the satirical. In at least two works you have studied, discuss the nature and effects of
      such treatments.


6.    “In isolating circumstances people often discover the truth about themselves or their lives.”
      Considering at least two works you have studied, explore the presentation of such situations and
      what writers achieve by their inclusion.

Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.    Painful experiences, even horrific ones, are sometimes reviewed and purged through the act of
      writing in such forms as autobiographies, essays, letters and travel writing. In what ways do you see
      at least two writers in your study working though such experiences in their writing?


8.    Either subtly or explicitly, writers of autobiographies, essays, letters and travel writing are sometimes
      trying to make an argument or express a strong opinion about a subject. How have such writers
      used their works to do this and with what degree of success?



General Questions on Literature

9.    Economic circumstances can be critical elements of the way a writer presents the world through
      literary forms. In what way have economic factors been included in the works of at least two writers
      you have studied?


10.   “Literature sometimes takes readers on an imaginary journey into a past different to their own
      individual experience.” In what ways and how effectively have at least two writers in your study
      provided you with a view of times past?


11.   Separation and reunion are sometimes used by writers to create and maintain tension in a
      literary work. In at least two works you have studied, show how writers have made effective use
      of the artistic potential of one or both human experiences.


12.   “I always start with a visual image,” is the way one writer describes the beginning of his work.
      In at least two works you have studied, identify one of the earliest visual images you recall from the
      work and explain how the writer uses it to engage the reader in a part or the whole of the work.
