                                                 Bushed

                             He invented a rainbow but lightning struck it
                             shattered it into the lake-lap of a mountain
                             so big his mind slowed when he looked at it

                             Yet he built a shack on the shore
                         5   learned to roast porcupine1 belly and
                             wore the quills on his hatband

                             At first he was out with the dawn
                             whether it yellowed bright as wood-columbine
                             or was only a fuzzed moth in a flannel of storm
                        10   But he found the mountain was clearly alive
                             sent messages whizzing down every hot morning
                             boomed proclamations at noon and spread out
                             a white guard of goat
                             before falling asleep on its feet at sundown

                        15   When he tried his eyes on the lake ospreys2
                             would fall like valkyries3
                             choosing the cut-throat
                             He took then to waiting
                             till the night smoke rose from the boil of the sunset

                        20   But the moon carved unknown totems
                             out of the lakeshore
                             owls in the beardusky woods derided him
                             moosehorned cedars circled his swamps and tossed
                             their antlers up to the stars
                        25   then he knew though the mountain slept the winds
                             were shaping its peak to an arrowhead
                             poised

                             And now he could only
                             bar himself in and wait
                        30   for the great flint4 to come singing into his heart

                   It was obvious the moment I saw it. A dry stone wall was built into the face of the
            low cliff. It was such a considered, man-made feature in that otherwise entirely natural landscape
            that its presence was as startling, and as beautiful and mysterious in its way, as the ruins of an
            ancient temple. Seeing it there, it was possible to imagine strange gods. Dougald said nothing,
      5     but turned to me as I came up to him and put his arm around my shoulders. I was moved by this
            unaccustomed intimacy.
                   ‘I would never have come back here on my own,’ he said. He left his arm around
            my shoulders, and we stood together thus, looking at the stone wall in the deep quiet of
            that wilderness, the morning chorus of birds far below us in the valley. ‘My grandfather set up
     10     this wall to protect his father’s bones. The day he brought me here I saw it for the first time as
            you see it now. It is just as I have seen it in my memory since.’ He laughed softly, marvelling
            at the perfect register of his boyhood memory with the intact wall in front of us. ‘All my life,’
            he said with a kind of wonder, ‘I have been able to close my eyes and to count every one of
            those stones.’ He turned and examined me. ‘Me and Grandad looked into the cave, then we set
     15     each of them stones back in place before we left here fifty years ago.’
                   He continued to stand with me, looking at the wall. I had begun to think he intended to
            approach no closer, when he dropped his arm to his side and made his way forward the last
            few metres. When I hung back he turned and beckoned to me to join him. The stones were
            flat and long and had been carefully selected. He lifted the topmost of them from its place and
     20     handed it to me. ‘Set it on its base,’ he instructed me, and he watched while I carefully laid the
            stone on the ground at my feet before he turned and handed me the next. He might have been
            handing into my care not stones but the precious antique volumes of his library. I thought of
            the poet’s line, Stones on which there was nothing mortal. ‘They have to go back just the way
            Grandad set them.’ When we had removed three courses of stones down to a level with our
     25     chests he reached his arm around my shoulder and drew me towards him and we leaned
            together and looked into the cavity.
                   It was a rock shelter rather than a cave. The low ceiling sloped down and met the floor
            no more than three metres from the entrance. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust to the
            shadowed interior. The skull was the first thing I saw. A human skull is such a distinctive
     30     object that there is no mistaking it for something else. The bones were not so obvious at first.
            The skeleton was half-buried by an accumulation of debris that had evidently leached from
            the roof over the years. A tiny black bat, no larger than the final joint of my little finger, clung to
            the ceiling above the skull, its eyes the bright jewels of a funeral decoration. Its body trembled
            as if in anticipation of flight.
