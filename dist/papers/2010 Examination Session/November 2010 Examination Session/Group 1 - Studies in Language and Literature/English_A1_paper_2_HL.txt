Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you
have studied. You may include in your answer a discussion of a Part 2 work of the same genre if relevant.
Answers which are not based on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score high marks.

Drama

1.    “Plays often feature at least one ghost, either on stage or imagined in the form of haunting memories
      and burdens.” In the light of this statement, discuss the ways in which such “haunting” has been
      presented in at least two plays you have studied.


2.    Words that demand action are important in plays. Discuss the ways in which plans, requests, vows or
      commands function in at least two works you have studied.



Poetry

3.    “Science is for those who learn; poetry is for those who know.” How have at least two poets in
      your study been able to convey a particular kind of knowledge about the world through their poems
      and to what effect?


4.    “Poetry would be impossible if it were made to move in a straight line to a conclusion.” In your study
      of works by at least two poets, examine what other objectives poetry can achieve beyond logical
      argument, and discuss how the poets have done so.



Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.    Often in a fictional work the writer increases interest by accelerating the pace and intensity
      of events. How effectively has this or other aspects of the pace of a work been used by at least two
      writers you have studied?


6.    Being single or being married are conditions that have often played a role in shaping the lives of
      fictional characters. In at least two works you have studied, discuss the ways in which writers
      have used such material to develop their narratives.

Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.    “The place or places where a writer has lived or visited can be represented in many ways and with
      varying but significant attitudes.” Considering such settings in at least two works (autobiographies,
      essays, letters or travel writing) you have studied, discuss the role and effects of this address of place.


8.    A writer once noted that “It is not easy to get hold of facts outside the circle of one’s own experience,
      but with that limitation I have seen a great deal that is of immense interest to me”. How, in works
      such as autobiographies, essays, letters or travel writing, have at least two writers been able to make
      their own, sometimes narrow, experiences into something of “immense interest” to their readers?



General Questions on Literature

9.    “Irony cannot exist apart from duality.” Looking closely at either voices or situations in
      at least two works you have studied, examine how the writers of these works have created
      combinations that add an ironic dimension to their works.


10.   Voices in written works respond to great paintings, beautiful music, or life-changing literature in
      much the same way as people in everyday life. Explore the ways in which at least two writers
      you have studied have incorporated such responses to other works of art.


11.   Uncertainty in literary works can be produced in many ways: by forces confronting each other,
      by unresolved dilemmas or by withholding easy answers from the reader. Choosing these or
      other ways in which at least two writers in your study have produced uncertainty or irresolution,
      discuss the methods they have used and the likely effects on the works.


12.   “Writers choose sometimes to foreground characters or situations and to keep others in
      the background.” Discuss the effects of the foregrounding and backgrounding of certain elements in
      at least two works you have studied, making some judgments about these choices and their effects.
