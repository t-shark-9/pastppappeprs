Write a commentary on one of the following:

1.

                   The afternoon darkened early and he was working peeringly in the semi-dusk when
            someone coughed behind him. A man and a woman stood in the aisle, and when his eyes were used
            to the better light on the church floor he noticed the woman was Marjory. The man said heartily,
            “Hullo, Duncan,” and Marjory raised her hand and smiled. Thaw said “Hullo” and looked down
      5     on them, smiling slightly. The man said, “We were visiting friends in Lenzie and we thought, old
            times and so forth, why not run in and see Duncan? So here we are.”
            The man peered up through the ladders.
            “You must have cat’s eyes to work in this light.”
            “The switches are behind the door.”
     10     “No no. No no. I quite like it in this dimness, more mysterious, if you know what I mean …
            Very impressive. Very impressive.”
            Marjory said something he couldn’t hear. He said, “What?”
            “This isn’t your usual style of work, Duncan.”
            After a short silence Thaw said, “I’m trying to show more air and light.”
     15     The man said, “So you are. So you are.” He moved back into the body of the church, looking at
            the mural and quietly humming. He said, “You’re nearly finished.”
            “Far from it.”
            “It looks finished to my untutored eye.”
            Thaw indicated bits to be repainted.
     20     “How much longer will you be on it?”
            “A few weeks.”
            “Then what will you do. Teach?”
            “I don’t know.”
            He turned round and pretended to work. After a moment he heard the man cough and say,
     25     “Well, Marjory,” and, “I think we’ll be getting along now, Duncan.”
            Thaw looked round and said goodbye. The two people had moved back into the middle of the
            church. The man said, “By the way, did you know Marjory and I are thinking of getting married?”
            “No.”
            “Yes, we’re thinking about it.”
     30     “Good.”
            There was silence then the man said, “Well, goodbye, Duncan. When we’re married you must
            look in on us. We still think of you now and again.”
            Thaw shouted, “Good.”
            The syllable clattered upon the ceiling and walls. At the door he saw Marjory look back and
     35     raise her hand, but couldn’t see if she was smiling or not.
                   It was too dark to work now. He lay on the planks, his thoughts returning to Marjory in a
            puzzled way, like a tongue tip returning to a hole from which a tooth has been pulled. He was
            sure he had just seen a girl without special beauty or intelligence. He wondered why she had
            been all he wanted in a woman. She was as unlike Marjory as Mrs. Thaw’s corpse had been
     40     unlike his mother. He wished he had said something ironic and memorable but she had given
            him no chance. “This isn’t your usual style of work, Duncan.”

            He shivered and climbed slowly down. His body felt unusually heavy. He switched on the
            lights and stared at the mural. It looked horrible. He went up into the gallery where he kept a
            large mirror for such emergencies. Reflected in it, the left and right sides transposed, the mural
   45       sometimes looked new and exciting when he had been working too close to it for too long.
            Now it appeared even worse than his naked eyes had seen. He flung the mirror onto the pews
            beneath shouting, “Not beauty! Not beauty! Nothing but hunger!”

                       The Heaven of Animals

                 Here they are. The soft eyes open.
                 If they have lived in a wood
                 It is a wood.
                 If they have lived on plains
             5   It is grass rolling
                 Under their feet forever.

                 Having no souls, they have come,
                 Anyway, beyond their knowing.
                 Their instincts wholly bloom
            10   And they rise.
                 The soft eyes open.

                 To match them, the landscape flowers,
                 Outdoing, desperately
                 Outdoing what is required:
            15   The richest wood,
                 The deepest field.

                 For some of these,
                 It could not be the place
                 It is, without blood.
            20   These hunt, as they have done,
                 But with claws and teeth grown perfect,

                 More deadly than they can believe.
                 They stalk more silently,
                 And crouch on the limbs of trees,
            25   And their descent
                 Upon the bright backs of their prey

                 May take years
                 In a sovereign floating of joy.
                 And those that are hunted
            30   Know this as their life,
                 Their reward: to walk

                 Under such trees in full knowledge
                 Of what is in glory above them,
                 And to feel no fear,
            35   But acceptance, compliance.
                 Fulfilling themselves without pain

                 At the cycle’s center,
                 They tremble, they walk
                 Under the tree,
            40   They fall, they are torn,
                 They rise, they walk again.
