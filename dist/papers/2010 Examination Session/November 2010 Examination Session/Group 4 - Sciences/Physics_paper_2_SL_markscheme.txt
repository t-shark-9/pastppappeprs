1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking. Use a text box for these additional comments.
     It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

4.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the right hand window.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand window.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. Check every page carefully.

8.   A mark should not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to
     this effect using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details:             Physics SL Paper 2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and ONE question in
Section B [25 marks]. Maximum total=[50 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
      more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then
      follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unit errors can only be penalized once in the paper.
      Place ticks for all correct marking points and use the “U” stamp from the annotations at the
      appropriate place. The unit error (–1) mark then shows in the “whole paper” section of the
      right hand box and the mark is automatically deducted from the whole paper.

11.   Significant digits should only be considered in the final answer. Deduct 1 mark in the paper for
      an error of 2 or more digits unless directed otherwise in the markscheme.

                                        e.g. if the answer is 1.63:
                                                     2      reject
                                                   1.6      accept
                                                  1.63      accept
                                                 1.631      accept
                                               1.6314       reject

      Place ticks for all correct marking points and use the “SD” stamp at the appropriate place.
      The significant digit (–1) mark then shows in the “whole paper” section of the right hand box and
      the mark is automatically deducted from the whole paper.
