Questions 27–30 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Figure 1 shows the “buddi” a miniaturised GPS (global positioning system) tracking and GPS personal
locator suitable for locating people who are lost or stranded.  It costs GBP 299 plus GBP 240/year to be
connected to a 24/7 365 days a year customer response team.  The buddi works in two ways: one, the wearer
presses the emergency button and the response team will contact the wearer or alert the emergency services;
or two, the position of the wearer can be located on an online map so parents, for example, could locate a
lost child.  In case of an emergency the wearer can show the buddi to any person in authority who is then
able to contact the customer response team via the information printed on the device.  Another version of
the buddi has been produced called the “petbuddi” which is very small, lightweight, waterproof pet tracking
device so owners can locate their lost pet.
