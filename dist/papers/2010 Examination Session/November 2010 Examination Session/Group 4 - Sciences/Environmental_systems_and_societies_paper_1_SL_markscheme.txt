1.    Follow the markscheme provided, do not use decimals or fractions and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these cases
      write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments where it
      helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the script may
      be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations on their own are unacceptable.

5.    Record subtotals (where applicable) in the right-hand margin against the part of the answer to which
      they refer next to the mark allocation. Do not circle subtotals. Circle the total mark for the
      question in the right-hand margin at the end of the question.

6.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

7.    Add together the marks for each question and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the Examiner
      column on the front cover of the exam paper.

8.    After entering the marks on the front cover check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the front cover. All scripts
      are checked and a note of all clerical errors may be given in feedback to examiners.

9.    Every page and every question must have an indication that you have marked it. Do this by writing
      your initials on each page where you have made no other mark.

10.   A candidate can be penalized if he/she clearly contradicts him/herself within an answer. Make a
      comment to this effect in the left-hand margin.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme
General

A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not award
more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

         Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

         An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”. Either wording can
          be accepted.

         Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

         Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

         The order of points does not have to be as written (unless stated otherwise).

         If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same
          as that in the markscheme, then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be
          particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

         Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved, and for what they have got
          correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong.

         Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
          more important than grammatical accuracy.

         Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for
          subsequent parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the
          incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should
          be awarded. Indicate this with “ECF”, error carried forward.

         Units should always be given where appropriate. Omission of units should only be penalized
          once. Indicate this by “–1(U)” at the first point it occurs. Ignore this, if marks for units are
          already specified in the markscheme.

         Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in
          the markscheme.

(e)   positive feedback is feedback that amplifies/increases change/leads to exponential
      deviation away from an equilibrium;
      ozone depletion is an example of positive feedback because the ozone-depleting
      substances break apart ozone molecules to provide more oxygen atoms for
      chlorine bonding;
      and also bond with available oxygen, depleting the available oxygen atoms for O2
      to bond with to form new ozone;
      chlorine/bromine/halons catalyze the destruction of ozone;                           [3 max]

      Responses may either define positive feedback and show how ozone depletion is
      an example of this or they may provide a detailed explanation/diagram of
      ozone depletion in which an understanding of positive feedback is implicit.

      Note ECF – Award [3] to a candidate who has confused ozone with global
      warming earlier in the question, but positive feedback is accurately described for
      global warming.
