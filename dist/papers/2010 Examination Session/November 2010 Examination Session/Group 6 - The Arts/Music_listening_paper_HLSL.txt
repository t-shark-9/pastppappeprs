                                               SECTION A

This section is worth [40 marks].

                                         PRESCRIBED WORK

Questions 1 (a) and 1 (b) refer to the work Dido and Aeneas, by H Purcell. Answer both parts, questions 1(a)
and 1(b). In your answers be as specific as possible, not only describing the musical elements
but also giving their location in the score (including bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s), and
instrument(s) involved). Accurate location will be part of the assessment. Indicate clearly the edition of
the score that you are using.

1.    Dido and Aeneas by H Purcell

      (a)   [But, ere we this perform and In our deep vaulted cell]

            Analyse in detail the musical features found in this extract which place this work
            in the baroque period.  Support your arguments with clear reference to the score.  
            These arguments may include (but are not limited to) comments on structure,
            harmony, melody, rhythm and orchestration.                                          [20 marks]

      (b)   Many writers have commented upon Purcell’s use of chromaticism in
            Dido and Aeneas.  Choose two (or more) passages and demonstrate how Purcell’s
            use of chromaticism (melodic and/or harmonic) influences the dramatic aspect of
            the opera.   Support your answer with clear reference to the score.  In your answer
            to question 1 (b) do not refer to the extract from question 1 (a).                  [20 marks]
