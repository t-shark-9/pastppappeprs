Answer three questions. Each question is worth [10 marks].

1.    Using a diagram, explain why Giffen goods and Veblen goods represent exceptions to the law
      of demand.


2.    Using a diagram(s), explain how the characteristics/assumptions of the models of perfect competition
      and monopolistic competition result in different demand curves for individual firms.


3.    Using a diagram, and assuming a neo-classical aggregate demand/aggregate supply model,
      explain the short-term and long-term effects of a rise in aggregate demand when a country is at
      full employment.


4.    A government decides to increase its spending on new roads, recognizing that there will be
      a multiplier effect on national income. Using a numerical example, explain what may determine
      the size of the multiplier.


5.    Using real world examples, explain the factors that allow a country to have a comparative advantage
      in the production of a good or service.


6.    Using a production possibility curve (PPC) diagram, explain the importance of infrastructure and
      education for achieving economic growth.
