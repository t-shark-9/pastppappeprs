1.   (a)   Define the following terms indicated in bold in the text:

           (i)    demand (paragraph )                                                            [2 marks]

                       The idea that it is how much is bought of a good or service at a certain
                       price.

                       An explanation that it is a group of producers in an industry that join
                       together to regulate supply (or fix prices).

(b)   Using an appropriate diagram and evidence from the text, explain how
      “expectation of further price rises” has affected the price of rice
      (paragraph ).                                                                     [4 marks]

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                              1-2
           For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram for the rice
           industry, which shows a shift to the right of the demand curve and an
           increase in price or for providing an explanation that the expectation of
           higher rice prices in the future means people will buy more now and this
           will lead to an increase in the demand for rice, raising the price of rice.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                         3-4
           For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram for the rice
           industry, which shows a shift to the right of the demand curve and an
           increase in price and for providing an explanation that the expectation of
           higher rice prices in the future means people will buy more now and this
           will lead to an increase in the demand for rice, raising the price of rice.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

      Alternatively, students might explain the increase in price being the result of
      producers’ decisions to withhold supply in order to be able to sell at higher
      prices in the future. This would be supported by a diagram showing a fall in
      supply. If the diagram and explanation match, this approach may achieve full
      marks.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how rice producers could
      implement a “broad price band in the style of a buffer stock scheme”
      (paragraph ) to help stabilize prices.                                         [4 marks]

           industry, which shows a maximum price and a minimum price or for
           providing an explanation that if the equilibrium price were above the
           maximum price, the buffer stock scheme would sell stocks to lower the
           price and if the equilibrium price were below the minimum price,
           the buffer stock scheme would purchase the excess to raise the price.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the proposal to form a rice cartel.                                   [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      Arguments in favour of forming a rice cartel:
       ensure food stability and address food shortages (paragraph )
       greater bargaining power for producer countries (paragraph )
       could prevent possible future price wars (paragraph )
       could improve the exchange of information about food security
        (paragraph )
       reduces the danger of hoarding and panic buying (paragraph )
       benefits accrue to producers because they can access abnormal/economic
        profit
       market failure arguments, e.g. that affordable rice is a merit good.

      Arguments against forming a rice cartel:
       the cartel may raise prices, depriving people of basic food (paragraphs 
        and )
       a cartel is unlikely to be successful because they “cannot control world
        production” (paragraph ) and buyers could buy from non-cartel countries
       could cause damage to countries that “rely heavily on imported rice”
        (paragraph )
       market forces would lead to a more efficient allocation of resources
        (paragraph )
       market failure of monopoly power
       a cartel reduces incentives for improvements in productivity/efficiency.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

         “high supernormal (abnormal) profits” in the future (paragraph ).             [8 marks]

         Responses may include:
         Factors to support likelihood of maintaining high supernormal (abnormal)
         profits:
          profits are on an upward trend (paragraph )
          strong demand worldwide (paragraph )
          high innovation and low price (paragraph )
          market leader (paragraph )
          diverging to new market segments (paragraph )
          barriers to entry.

         Factors to support likelihood of not maintaining high supernormal (abnormal)
         profits:
          Nintendo predicting lower profits than those forecast by economists
            (paragraph )
          three-way battle – high competition (paragraph )
          soaring oil prices will increase costs of production (paragraph )
          eventual problems of economic slowdown, sluggish consumer spending
            (paragraph )
          the market could be contestable
          the risks associated with rapid technological change.

         Effective evaluation may be to:
          consider short-term versus long-term consequences
          examine the impact on different stakeholders
          discuss advantages and disadvantages

        evaluate the consequences for the UK economy if the Bank of England
        were to raise interest rates from 5 % as suggested in paragraph .             [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
        Negative consequences:
         may move to a recession (paragraph )
         consumer confidence will fall further (paragraph )
         C and I will fall, affecting AD (paragraph )
         unemployment will increase further (paragraph )
         household spending will fall as debt repayments increase
         the exchange rate may increase, harming export competitiveness
         rise in business costs, which may cause cost push inflation
         negative wealth effects.

        Positive consequences:
         inflation may fall
         an increase in the exchange rate may lead to cheaper imports of raw
          materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods, further reducing
          inflation
         savings may increase.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

           connected that will perpetuate poverty and for describing such a series of
           circumstances for Haitian households.

           more than just GDP per capita.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3-4
           For noting that Madagascar has a higher HDI and that the HDI includes
           more than just GDP per capita and for explaining that education and
           healthcare in Madagascar are presumably better than in Haiti,
           thus leading to a relatively higher HDI position, despite its lower GDP
           per capita.

  (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
        evaluate aid as a means of achieving economic development in Haiti.            [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
         a definition of economic development
         some types of aid.

        Factors relating to the aid include:
         food aid is essential in the short-run (paragraph )
         aid is of little use if it cannot be distributed (paragraph )
         rural areas suffer more than urban areas (paragraph )
         food aid is a temporary measure (paragraph )
         development aid is critical (paragraph )
         rebuilding roads and schools (paragraph )
         importance of aid to help education and health (Figure 1)
         aid is no use without infrastructure and solving corruption
         other factors – institutional
         alternative of trade
         criticism of aid schemes
         discussion of the difference between multilateral and bilateral aid in the
          Haitian context
         evaluation of long-term aid as opposed to food aid (paragraph ).

        Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
        which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
        rewarded beyond level 2.
