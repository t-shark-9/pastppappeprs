1.   (a)   What does Source A suggest about the problems facing Gorbachev in
           March 1989?                                                       [3 marks]

              Gorbachev cannot encourage reforms without detriment to the party;
              Any relaxation of the party’s hold could result in instability and/or rebellion;
              Any political or economic reform could result in widespread nationalism;
              Gorbachev cannot expect to make changes in the USSR without there being a
               knock-on effect in other soviet bloc countries.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                    [2 marks]

              It shows that the demonstration was popular/well-attended;
              It was peaceful (some of the demonstrators are holding banners);
              It shows that many Czechs were disatisfied with the government - protesting;
              Initially the outcome of both appeared to be successful.

     Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a final
mark out of [5 marks].


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about the
     methods and successes of the protesters.                                            [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources state that the movements started out peacefully;
      Both demonstrations involved thousands of people;
      Initially the outcome both appeared to be successful.

     For “contrast”
      Source C describes a demonstration; Source D a strike;
      In C the outcome is positive with the achievement of significant political change whereas
       in D initial success was swiftly followed by martial law and the outlawing of solidarity.
      D mentions a leading personality, Lech Walesa; C doesn’t.
      In C demonstrations started to demand democratic reforms while in D they started to
       protest about food prices.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are
     discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum
     of [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source D and Source E for historians studying Communism in crisis and
     the role of Solidarity in Poland.                                                   [6 marks]

     Source D
     Origin:      Taken from the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty website, 24 August 2005.

     Purpose:     To describe how Solidarity was formed and the reasons for its popularity;
                  promote democratic ideals

     Value:       It represents the views given by a non-communist media organization. It is
                  meant for public use and sufficient time has elapsed to verify its authenticity.

     Limitations: The name of the radio station, the style of reporting and the language used might
                  indicate that it is far from impartial.

     Source E
     Origin:      From Politics in Eastern Europe by George Schöpflin, Oxford, UK and
                  Cambridge, US, 1993.

     Purpose:     The book’s purpose is to inform the public about Eastern European politics.

     Value:        It is written by an academic with experience in Eastern Europe. There has been
                  ample opportunity to check sources, particularly since the opening of Soviet
                  archives.

     Limitations: The title implies that Poland will only form a part of the book and therefore this
                  subject may be lacking in detail.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance
     between the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2
     mark] split. If only one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks]
     candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the reasons for the
     collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe.                                           [8 marks]

     Source material
     Source A: Gorbachev’s policies contributed to the creation of an atmosphere leading to the
               collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.

     Source B: This source shows that the demonstrations in Czechoslovakia were extremely
               popular.

     Source C: The intervention of the riot police increased support for the demonstrators;
               workers’ unions joined the students.

     Source D: This source shows that there had been a peaceful build-up of opposition to the
               centralized Communist government over a number of years – at least from 1980.
               It mentions a rise in food prices and reveals the influence of economic problems.

     Source E: This source shows that there had been regular disputes between workers
               and police; that Jaruzelski was prepared to live with dissension behind closed
               doors and inside factories but would not tolerate demonstrations; that the
               Leninist system of organization was being eroded.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge may include Gorbachev’s implementation of Glasnost and Perestroika and
     made it clear that the Soviet Union would no longer use force to maintain neighbouring
     governments. As a consequence public discontent openly increased in East Germany,
     Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European states destabilising the one
     party states and contributing to the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. Credit further information,
     such things as the economic crises, the influence of Pope John Paul II from Poland and
     effective links between events and Dubcek and the Velvet Revolution and other relevant
     material specific to the different countries.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material
     or only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a
     maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
     as well as references to the sources used.
