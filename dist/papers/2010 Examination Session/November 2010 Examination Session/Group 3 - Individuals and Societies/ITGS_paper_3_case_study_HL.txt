           Overview

           This case study is set in the city of Oobunta, in an East African country.  Oobunta has a population
           of 100 000 and it is the provincial headquarters for the Western Province.  It serves as a focal point
           for the many surrounding villages.   Until recently the population in the province had suffered
           from a poor provision of healthcare with many people not living beyond their 50th birthday.  
      5    Recent developments in education, transport and IT have brought some improvements to the health
           of the people, but provincial leaders are aware that this is only the start.


           Dr* Mukami Ogola

           Dr Mukami Ogola, who was born in the Western Province, has been studying in Europe and
           working there in various major hospitals for the last 10 years.  He has now returned to the province
           where he has been appointed as Medical Officer of Health.  The leader of the province wants a
    10     major effort to be made to improve the health services in both the provincial headquarters and
           also the surrounding rural areas.   Dr Ogola, with his experience of healthcare systems in the
           developed world, has been identified as a key player in this vision.

           The major studies that Dr Ogola undertook overseas were in the area of information technology
           in medicine.   He realizes that the new technologies, in particular information technology,
    15     promise great benefits to the nation’s health services.  The rapid growth in the use of mobile phones
           and the Internet could revolutionize the way people receive treatment.  The success of this initiative
           depends on Oobunta Hospital becoming the focal point for the distribution and management of
           improved health services in the surrounding rural areas, especially in local health centres.

     IT systems

     Within the province, Oobunta is the only major centre with a hospital.  In some of the surrounding
20   villages there are clinics; elsewhere there are no healthcare facilities.

     The use of IT in healthcare within the province also varies greatly.  In Oobunta Hospital there is
     a network, but in the village clinics some have simple networks while others have no IT provision
     at all.

     The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the hospital and some of the outlying
25   villages possessing healthcare facilities.

     The following systems are currently in place:

     Oobunta Hospital

     The hospital has a local area network (LAN) that connects 20 desktop computers.  Also, there are
     diagnostic tools such as CT scanners and x-ray machines with embedded IT systems.

     All computers are running Windows XP and Microsoft Office 2007.  They have reliable access to
30   the Internet, e-mail and a private online medical expert system based in the nation’s capital.  

     A single server, running Microsoft Small Business Server 2003, stores all information for:
     • keeping patient’s records in a database that are accessible on their Intranet
     • managing financial information using simple accounting software
     • personnel management records in a different database.

35   It also supports e-mail, the hospital Intranet and access to the Internet through a local
     service provider.

     Currently, the information is periodically backed up to an external hard drive which is stored in
     the server room at the hospital.

     Village A

     In this village, a voluntary organization from Canada donated hardware to set up the following
40   IT facilities in the clinic:
     • Six desktop PCs running Windows 98 and Microsoft Office 97 which form a Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
        network.  These are used for patient and financial record keeping.
     • A cell (mobile) phone and a landline phone connection.

     The village has intermittent Internet access with a dialup, low bandwidth connection using
45   the landline.  In addition to record keeping, the IT facilities in the clinic are used for accessing
     Oobunta Hospital’s Intranet and the online medical expert system as well as for using e-mail.


     Village B

     This is a very small clinic, run by one health worker who has the following:
     • One computer running Windows XP and Microsoft Office 2003 which is used for patient
       record keeping.
50   • No Internet access.


     Village C

     The clinic has no IT facilities other than the use of a cell (mobile) phone.  The phone network has
     recently reached the area.  All records are handwritten on record cards.




                                                                                              Turn over

     Challenges faced

     Dr Ogola has commissioned research to provide information about the state of healthcare in
     the province.  In addition to the IT systems mentioned previously, he has found the following:

55   • If a case is too complicated or cannot be addressed in the local clinics, the patient is referred to
       the hospital.  This can involve substantial travel and accommodation costs which many patients
       are unable to afford.

     • Often, treatment in the province is delayed because of the time required to get the patients to
       Oobunta Hospital and also because of the lack of medical knowledge about unusual cases.  
60     In some instances this has led to the death of patients.

     • The hospital subscribes to an online medical expert system for use by its professional staff.  
       However, a number of doctors have started to use the Internet search engines in order to
       diagnose patients, which has raised some concerns.  

     • Most medical staff lack appropriate training on the existing IT systems.

65   • There are problems with connections between the IT systems in the hospital and the
       outlying villages.  

     • The hospital has a network administrator whereas the healthcare workers are responsible for the
       upkeep of the IT systems in Village A and Village B.

     • Some medical records, such as patient histories, x-rays and pathology results are on paper and
70     are therefore not accessible through the IT system.  Others are in separate databases.  There is
       no integrated electronic medical record (EMR) management system at present.

     • In 2007, there was a significant loss of data when the system crashed due to a power surge.
       An effective disaster recovery and backup plan was not in place and has still not
       been implemented.


     Strategic development of healthcare in the province

75   In 2008, Internet coverage was good in Oobunta and major provincial cities but poor or
     non-existent in rural areas.  The government has recently started improving Internet coverage,
     including WiFi and Broadband Wireless Access, as well as increasing the number of cell (mobile)
     phone providers licensed to operate in the country.

     Dr Ogola sees this as an opportunity to extend his planned upgrades to the hospital’s information
80   technology which will include telemedicine to enhance communications and health services in
     the villages. He investigated possible sources of finance for the hospital and clinics from the
     government and charitable foundations and was able to secure some funding.  Dr Ogola needs to
     prioritize how and where this money is spent.
                                                –7–          M&N10/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Dr Ogola wants the Western Province to be in the forefront of medical care in the future and to be
 85   an example for other provinces to follow.  The key to this transformation will be the development
      of an integrated IT system linking the hospital and the outlying clinics.  However, Dr Ogola has
      been informed that there are several issues that will need to be addressed:

      •    The purchase of an appropriate IT system that would allow:
           – data to be accessed and transferred between the hospital and the village clinics.

 90   •    The purchase of a pre-existing or custom-built EMR management system from a local or
           multinational company that would lead to improvements in the:
           – healthcare of patients
           – accuracy of record keeping
           – efficiency of the hospital and clinics.

 95   •    The investigation of other medical expert systems to determine a possible suitable
           replacement for the current system.

      •    The implementation of new IT systems based on the improving cell (mobile) phone
           technology to support medical practices in outlying rural areas by providing:
           – telemedicine outreach to village clinics in the province
100        – education and training to medical and paramedical staff
           – effective distribution of medical information.

      •    The formulation of an appropriate disaster recovery plan that covers issues such as:
           – policies to address backup issues such as: where, when, who, how, what
           – backup strategies
105        – failover systems
           – disaster and recovery procedures
           – responsibilities
           – data redundancy.

      •    The security of the equipment, the software, the information, the access to the information
110        and the communications between the hospital and the clinics is guaranteed.

      Other countries in Africa also want to increase the use of information technology in their
      health programs and will be watching the progress, the benefits and the problems encountered.  
      However, Dr Ogola is concerned that he may not get sufficient funding to complete
      all developments.
