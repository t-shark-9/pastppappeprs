Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail
         is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth, historical
        knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
        There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may
        be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications are considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4.
        Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present,
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is
        well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Assess the impact of two military campaigns on the outcome of the American Revolution
     (1776–1783).

     Any two military campaigns that fall within the dates are suitable. Likely battles and their possible
     impact could be: Trenton and Princeton in 1776, which gave a tremendous morale boost to the
     Americans; Saratoga in 1777, which brought much needed foreign aid, especially from the French;
     the Carolinas campaign in 1780–1781, which helped to wear down Cornwallis; Yorktown in 1781,
     which signalled the end of the war. Candidates should show knowledge of the campaigns and of
     their impact on the war. Early military actions such as Lexington and Concord or Bunker Hill
     predate the question and are inappropriate.

     If only one military campaign is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


2.   Analyse the similarities and differences between two independence movements in Latin
     America.

     Answers will vary according to the selected movements. In addressing the question, reasons for
     both causation and practice could be used when dealing with the similarities and differences of the
     two independence movements.            Enlightenment ideas, class upheaval (especially Creole
     dissatisfaction), trade and commerce issues (mercantilism) and the French invasion of the Iberian
     Peninsula are all issues that could be dealt with concerning causation, with specific reasons that are
     applicable to the two chosen countries. The method or practice of gaining the independence may
     also be discussed. The movements of San Martín, Bolivar, Hidalgo and L’Overture are examples
     that may be used to focus on issues such as leadership, strategy, makeup of armies and level of
     success.

     If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


3.   Compare the conditions that led to the rise of the caudillo rule in two countries of the region.

     Answers will vary depending on the countries and caudillos chosen. A definition of caudillo or
     caudillismo could be a good beginning. Possible choices could be: Rosas in Argentina; Artigas in
     Uruguay; Santa Anna in Mexico. The focus should be on the existing conditions that led to
     a caudillo. Common conditions were: political instability; increased foreign indebtedness;
     social differences; centralization disputes. In Argentina, Rivadavia’s attempt at centralization
     and liberalization created unrest and a conservative backlash in Buenos Aires, as well as the
     interior provinces. The loss of Uruguay to Brazil exacerbated the problem, as did weak
     democratic traditions. Each of these was helpful in Rosas’ rise to power. Artigas was a strong
     nationalist who fought against annexation by Brazil and Argentina. Artigas appealed to the lower
     classes who were oppressed and poverty-stricken. Santa Anna benefited from the conditions
     created by the liberal conservative political rivalry in Mexico. His early military successes
     increased nationalism while gaining him the support of the lower classes.

     If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

4.   Compare the causes for, and the effects of, the 1837 rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada.

     Causes that might be addressed include: the political and commercial control exercised by the
     Family Compact and the Château Clique; control of public funds; role of the legislative assemblies;
     land ownership/speculation; lack of response to reform movements.

     Effects could include: that both rebellions were successfully put down by the government;
     Lord Durham’s appointment as Governor General leading to the Durham Report; unification of
     the Canadas and restructuring of the government with more moderate politicians pushing
     responsible government.

     If only one rebellion is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


5.   “The origin of the United States Civil War is directly related to the economic differences
     between the North and the South.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     A variety of issues may be used in discussion of this question with many candidates initially
     comparing the economic needs of the industrial North with the agricultural South. Specific areas
     that may be dealt with include: protective tariffs; land policy; territorial expansion; slavery;
     expansion of slavery; general trade policy. Some answers may counter the premise of the question
     by looking at political or social issues as being more influential in the origin of the conflict.

     Answers will vary in their judgments: reward all well-supported analysis and do not expect all
     the above, but “to what extent” should be addressed.


6.   In what ways, and with what results, did slaves in the Southern United States resist slavery?

     Answers should focus on both the tactics and the impact of slave resistance. “In what ways”
     could include: simple forms of resistance such as working slow; feigning illness; breaking tools to
     more complex tactics such as running away; causing an uprising. The Underground Railroad and
     slave revolts led by Prosser, Vesey and Turner could be mentioned. Negative results could include:
     harsher treatment; enactment of fugitive slave laws; greater fear of slave revolts. More positive
     results could be: freedom in the North or Canada; the growth of the abolitionist movement in
     the North.

     If only ways or results are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                  –6–               N10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

7.   Discuss the impact of positivism on the policies of one Latin American nation between 1880
     and 1910.

     Answers will vary depending upon the country chosen. Definitions of positivism, for example
     humans basing their thinking and actions on empirical data from scientific observations, may be
     used to set a foundation for the answer. Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Chile are examples of
     nations that may be used to show the specific impact of the philosophy. Policies from the various
     nations that may be discussed include: immigration; scientific development and industrialization
     (railroads); separation of the Church and state; the secularization of education; restructuring of
     government; abolition of slavery (Brazil); the application of Darwin’s theories to society; the use of
     the “rule of order” to achieve “material progress”, as indicated by the slogan “Order and Progress”.
     Candidates should be mindful of the question’s time parameters.


8.   Evaluate the successes and failures of either Wilfrid Laurier of Canada or one Latin
     American leader between 1865 and 1929.

     Answers will vary according to the leader chosen, but all answers should deal with both the
     successes and failures, domestically and abroad and time framework. For Laurier, successes could
     include: increased prosperity; settlement of the West; railroad expansion; immigration; increased
     feelings of nationalism and autonomy. Failures could include: the formation of the Canadian Navy
     and reciprocal trade agreements with the US. Díaz of Mexico could be a popular Latin American
     choice. Successes could include: longevity; political stability; support for the Científicos; economic
     growth through foreign investment; conciliation with the Church. Failures could include: poverty
     of workers and peasants; appropriation of Indian and mestizo lands; elimination of democracy.
     Other possible Latin American leaders could be Juárez of Mexico or Sarmiento of Argentina,
     however, any Latin American leader during the time period is acceptable.


9.   Analyse the reasons for, and effects of, the United States’ declaration of war on Spain in 1898.

     Answers should be structured to answer both parts of the question.

     Reasons for the declaration of war may include: support for Cuban independence; reactions to the
     De Lôme letter and the sinking of the Maine; sensationalism of the “yellow press”; desire for
     territorial expansion; a growing belief in the need to implement economic and political hegemony
     over the Western hemisphere.

     US involvement and defeat of the Spanish, Cuban independence, development of Cuba as a virtual
     protectorate through the Platt Amendment, increase in territorial possessions of the United States,
     a more active role for the US in hemispheric and world affairs (Big Stick policy) and growth and
     development of US trade are all effects of the declaration of, and involvement in, the war against
     Spain in Cuba.

     Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant and accurate material.

     If only reasons or effects are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                   –7–               N10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

10.   For what reasons, and with what results, was Canada involved in the First World War?

      Answers should be structured to answer both parts of the question. Reasons could include: required
      to as a part of the Empire; a desire to help Britain, and to protect Canadian trade interests.
      Results could include: Canadian military contributions to the war, i.e. soldiers, weapons and
      particular battles; domestic, economic and political impact, such as, industrial and agricultural
      growth; conscription crisis and French–English division; increased feelings of nationalism and
      confidence; post-war international recognition at Versailles and in the League of Nations.

      Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant and accurate material.

      If only reasons or results are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


11.   Assess the impact of the United States’ involvement in the Mexican Revolution between 1910
      and 1920.

      Candidates should focus on the effects of US involvement with various groups in the Revolution.
      Initial backing of Madero, support of Huerta, military action at Tampico and Veracruz, guns to
      Villa, support of Carranza, and Pershing’s raid into Mexico are events that could be discussed.

      Do not expect all of the above and reward answers that are well-developed in assessing US
      involvement.


12.   Compare and contrast the major challenges faced by Álvaro Obregón and Plutarco Elías
      Calles in constructing a post-revolutionary state in Mexico during the 1920s.

      Examples of challenges that may be used for this answer include: economic development; land and
      labour reform; role of the Church; relationship with the United States; educational reform and
      indigenismo. Both similarities and differences should be addressed with clear direct linkage
      between the policies of the two leaders. The question addresses the 1920s and the answer should
      reflect this emphasis.

      If only one leader is mentioned, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


13.   Analyse the causes of the Great Depression in two countries of the region.

      Answers will vary depending on countries selected. The United States, Canada and Brazil will
      probably be popular choices, but any two countries are acceptable. Though causes will vary,
      they may include: overproduction; unequal distribution of income; high tariffs; decreased
      world trade; failure of the banking system; unemployment; collapse of the US stock market
      and its effect on the world economy.

      Do not expect all of the above, but candidates should deal in specifics for the countries chosen.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                   –8–               N10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

14.   Assess the degree to which R B Bennett’s policies successfully addressed the challenges
      presented by the Great Depression to the nation of Canada.

      Candidates should clearly state to what degree the policies were successful in their answer.
      Areas that could be dealt with include: Bennett’s initial conservative fiscal viewpoint; tariff and
      trade policy; the Unemployment Relief Act; labour camps; the Bank of Canada Act; Bennett’s New
      Deal programmes. In assessing success, answers may address provincial policies and alternative
      programmes that were created in response to federal policy. These could include: social credit; the
      Cooperative Commonwealth Federation; the Ecole sociale populaire.


15.   To what extent was cooperation between countries in the Americas successful between 1933
      and 1945?

      A good starting point would be for candidates to identify the aims of hemispheric cooperation in
      order to assess failures and successes. Candidates could point out increased hemispheric
      cooperation began as a result of the Good Neighbour policy. Some of the following could be
      addressed: Montevideo Conference Pact in 1933; Buenos Aires Conference in 1936; Lima
      Conference in 1938; Panama in 1939; Havana in 1940; Rio Conference in 1942; declarations of war
      by almost all Latin American countries; joining of United Nations. The focus of the question
      should be placed on the assessment of achievements.

      Do not expect all the above and reward candidates for good connection between European events
      and Americas cooperation.


16.   Analyse the economic effects of the Second World War on one country in the Americas.

      The economic effects will vary depending upon the country chosen. In the US wartime expansion
      and development led to complete recovery from the Depression, set the stage for the US as an
      economic world power, created economic opportunities for women which will be further developed
      in the post-war era and accelerated technological developments that would be incorporated into the
      domestic market. In Canada the war led to expansion and diversification of manufacturing,
      discovery and development of new resources and modernization of transportation systems.
      This also created more dependency on the US. In Latin America the war stimulated
      Import Substitution Industrialization (ISI) and economic nationalism, but the degree to which this
      was true varied depending upon the level of involvement of the specific country.


17.   Evaluate the effectiveness of Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” programmes.

      Johnson’s “Great Society” has often been called the New Deal of the 1960s. Candidates could
      address the two basic goals of eliminating poverty and discrimination in the US. Programmes such
      as Medicare and Medicaid, the Job Corps, public housing and urban renewal could be mentioned.
      The Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 might
      be discussed. Answers will vary in their judgments, but many candidates are likely to blame
      any failures of the Great Society on American participation in Vietnam.

      Do not expect all of the above and credit other relevant material and focused evaluation.
                                                    –9–               N10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M

18.   To what extent did the policies of one Latin American populist leader reflect the general
      characteristics of a populist regime?

      Answers should clearly set the characteristics for defining a populist leader and then examine the
      selected leader’s policies based on those characteristics. Examples of characteristics that may be
      used are: charismatic figure with superior oratorical skills; outsider to traditional political elites;
      nationalistic; advocates an interventionist role for the state in the national economy; labels elites as
      the “oligarchy” and condemns them for their selfishness; opposes imperialism in moralistic terms;
      has a paternalistic relationship with followers; often branded a “fascist” by opponents; economically
      often takes a middle position between capitalism and communism; urbanization and
      industrialization lead to increased population in the cities where working class voters outnumber
      rural voters; appeal to lower middle class; and lower class voters, appeals to these voters by offering
      a larger share of national income and jobs; believes that massive social change could occur through
      existing structures by peaceful reform; strength of personality is more important than party
      organization and pledges to end economic dependency. Typical leaders that may be included are
      Lazaro Cárdenas of Mexico, Getúlio Vargas of Brazil and Juan Perón of Argentina. It is not
      necessary for all of the above characteristics to be used or stated in the same way. Candidates
      should be given credit for linking the policies of the leader to the general ideas expressed in the
      characteristics.


19.   “The containment policy of the United States had a negative impact on Latin America.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Regardless of candidates’ positions, specific examples are necessary for a well-reasoned argument.
      Supporters could cite US overt or covert intervention in several Latin American countries to
      overthrow socialist leaders or to support anti-communist dictators. Those who challenge the quote
      might mention the Organization of American States (OAS), the Alliance for Progress and the Peace
      Corps as positive results of containment. While candidates might briefly discuss the success of
      containment in Europe and Asia, the focus of the question is Latin America.


20.   With reference to one Latin American country, assess the impact of the Cold War on the
      development and implementation of that nation’s foreign policy.

      Answers will vary depending upon the country chosen. Candidates will need to make sure that both
      the impact of the Cold War and the individual country’s foreign policy are linked and addressed.
      The question does not ask for a discussion of a superpower’s foreign policy toward the country
      but requires a discussion of policies devised by the country itself. For example Cuba may be a
      popular choice; if chosen the answer should set the historical context, addressing the impact
      of the Cold War with linkage to Cuban actions and decisions relating to foreign policy.
      Movement towards the Soviet Union, involvement in the Non-Aligned Movement and exportation
      of revolution are all examples of foreign policy issues that might be discussed. In order to achieve
      the higher marks it is necessary that an assessment of the impact be made and not simply a
      description of the policy decisions.

21.   Describe the origins and achievements of a Native American movement in one country of the
      region after 1945.

      Answers will vary depending on the movement and the country chosen. Possible choices could be:
      the American Indian Movement in the United States, in the 1960s–1970s, the First Nations
      movement in Canada; the Zapatista Army of National Liberation in Chiapas, Mexico in the 1990s.
      Origins will vary but many centre on the desire for equality and a correction of past injustices.
      Other civil rights movements also created an impetus for this movement.
      Answers should address both parts of the question.


22.   Contrast the roles and policies of Dr Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in the development
      of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.

      Answers should reflect the differences in roles and policies between Dr King and Malcolm X.
      The strongest answers will develop categories for contrast with clear, explicit linkage shown for
      each individual.

      Roles
      Dr King: a Baptist minister who helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
      (SCLC) as a base of organization in the fight for racial equality; led the black community to
      challenge segregation laws in the South through non-violent action, marches, demonstrations,
      boycotts, registration drives and freedom rides.

      Malcolm X: a Black Muslim organizer and minister who aided in the expansion of their influence
      and support in the community. He founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU)
      which was dedicated to the alliance of American blacks and other non-white peoples.

      Policies
      Dr King: pursued a non-violent, passive resistance, direct action philosophy in trying to achieve
      voting rights, integration of public facilities and housing and legislative remedies for discrimination
      (1964 Civil Rights Act, 1965 Voting Rights Act).

      Malcolm X: sought to instil pride in African heritage; to set high moral standards for blacks;
      he rejected integration and recognized the connection between the struggle for equality and
      economics. He supported black separatism but later revised his beliefs and became more willing to
      cooperate with whites working for civil rights.

      In addressing the differences candidates should place Dr King’s ideas and policies in the context of
      his Christianity and the South of the 1950s and 1960s, while they should explain Malcolm X’s ideas
      in the context of the different audience he was seeking to address and the changes evident after his
      journey to Mecca.

      If only roles or policies are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

23.   In what ways, and with what effects, did the foreign policy of President Bill Clinton
      (1992–2000) towards Latin America differ from the policies of President George H W Bush
      (1988–1992)?

      The question should address both of the leaders’ policies with attention to the degree of difference
      found between the policies and the effects of those differences. President Bush’s policies may
      include discussion of Panama, Colombia, Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador and the beginning of North
      American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). President Clinton’s policies could incorporate issues
      dealing with Cuba, Mexico, Haiti, Peru–Ecuador border, the passage of NAFTA and the Summit of
      America process. If candidates challenge the premise of the question with sound support,
      appropriate marks should be awarded.

      If only ways or effects are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


24.   Discuss the restoration of democracy in one Latin American country between 1980 and 2000.

      Answers will vary depending on the country chosen, but specific detail is important for a good
      answer. Possible examples could be Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Items that might be discussed
      are: creation of a constitution; restoration of personal freedoms; free elections; decreased power of
      the military; multiple parties; freedom of the press; foreign involvement.

      Do not expect all of the above and reward any other relevant material.
