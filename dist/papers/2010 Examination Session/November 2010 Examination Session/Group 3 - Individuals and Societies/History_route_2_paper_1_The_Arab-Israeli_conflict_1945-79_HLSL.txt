SOURCE A                An extract from a speech to members of the Egyptian National Assembly by Gamal
                        Abdul Nasser, Egyptian President, 29 May 1967.

We are now ready to deal with the entire Palestine question. The issue now at hand is not the
Gulf of Aqaba, the Straits of Tiran, or the withdrawal of the UNEF (United Nations Emergency Force),
but the rights of the Palestine people. It is the aggression which took place in Palestine in 1948 with
the collaboration of Britain and the United States. It is the expulsion of the Arabs from Palestine,
the denial of their rights, and the plunder [theft] of their property. It is the disavowal [ignoring] of all the
UN resolutions in favour of the Palestinian people. If the United States and Britain are partial to Israel,
we must say that our enemy is not only Israel but also the United States and Britain and treat them
as such.

SOURCE C               An extract from The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Wars, Ritchie Ovendale, London,
                       1984. Ovendale was a lecturer in the Department of International Politics at
                       University College, Aberystwyth, UK.

Abba Eban [Israeli Foreign Minister] returned to Tel Aviv on 23 May 1967 and attended a meeting at the
Ministry of Defence: it was reported that the Egyptians were not yet ready for a full offensive; Syria was
retreating; there was no movement in Jordan. Yitzhak Rabin [Chief of Staff of Israeli Defence Forces] had
told him that time was needed to reinforce the south: the diplomatic establishment could help with that.
Eban advised the gathering that Israel must think like a nation whose soil had already been invaded;
but Israel’s predicament [problem] was international not regional and it had to look to the United
States to neutralize the Russian menace. Johnson [US President] had asked to be consulted, and for
forty-eight hours’ respite. Most of those present agreed on the need for a political phase before a
military reaction. Moshe Dayan [Israeli Defence Minister], however, favoured military action against
Egypt after forty-eight hours on a battleground close to the Israeli border. It was agreed to mobilize
the reservists.


SOURCE D               An extract from The Palestine–Israel Conflict, Gregory Harms, London, 2005.
                       Harms is a freelance writer and researcher.

Reports began to come from Damascus that the Israelis were massing troops in heavy concentration along
the Syrian border, poised for imminent attack. Russia “confirmed” these reports, which escalated the tension
and placed Nasser on high alert; Egypt and Syria, at Russian request, signed a defense pact that would
help protect Soviet objectives in the region. The reports of massing Israeli troops, however, were false.
Later Syrian reconnaissance flights provided conclusive photos that revealed no such troop concentrations,
and UN observers, too, confirmed the falsity of the claim. Though reasoning behind Russian behavior
here is speculative, most assume that it feared an Israeli attack on Syria and thought a potential Egyptian
response might encourage Israeli hesitation. Whether Nasser knew of the intelligence being bogus
[false] or not, he began assembling troops in Sinai. Nasser’s response is also an occasion for speculation,
but the intent of polishing up his image probably was not far from his mind. And then he took it the
extra step. To the shock of just about everyone, Nasser requested the UNEF to withdraw from the
Egyptian border and Sinai, as was his legal right according to the agreement after the Suez Crisis.


SOURCE E               An extract from Palestine and the Arab–Israeli Conflict, Charles Smith,

A decisive factor was the news on June 2 that in response to American requests, Nasser had agreed to send
his vice president, Zakariya Mohieddine, to Washington on June 7 to discuss measures to defuse the potential
for confrontation over the Tiran blockade. This was totally unacceptable, even to Eban, who had resisted
the military option until June 1: it was probable that this initiative would aim at a face-saving compromise
and that the face to be saved would be Nasser’s not Israel’s … Egyptian occupation of Sharm al-Sheikh
and the blockade might be the reason to justify an attack, but Israel was also determined to deny Nasser his
political triumph in the Arab world. … With increased confidence in American acquiescence [acceptance],
determined to punish Nasser and thwart the intent of Mohieddine’s forthcoming visit to Washington,
the cabinet on June 4 approved Dayan’s plan to attack Egypt the next morning.
