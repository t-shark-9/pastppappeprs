                                                   World food prices

           Food prices have risen by 45 % since the end of 2006. Prices have risen due to a mix of
            long-term and temporary factors. Strong food demand from emerging economies, reflecting
            stronger per capita income growth, accounts for much of the increase. Rising biofuel
            production adds to the demand for corn, in particular, because corn is used in the production
            of biofuels. In addition, increased production of corn leads to falling production of
            other foods, raising their prices as well. At the same time, elasticity of supply of food remains
            low and inventory levels (stocks) in many food markets have declined to the lowest levels in
            years. Drought conditions in major wheat-producing countries (e.g. Australia and Ukraine),
            and higher input costs (animal feed, energy, and fertilizer) have also contributed to higher
            food prices.

           Table 1 outlines the policy responses to increasing food prices in some countries, some of which
            have made the problem worse.

            Table 1
                            Policy response to increasing food prices
            Argentina       Corn export taxes increased to 25 %, wheat export taxes increased to 28 %
            Azerbaijan      Eliminated indirect tax on grains
            Bangladesh      Reduced tariffs on rice and wheat imports by 5 %
            Ecuador         Maximum prices for bread
            Egypt           Raised food subsidies
            Honduras        Export ban on maize
            Mexico          Removed quotas on maize, milk and sugar

           Higher food prices affect socioeconomic groups and households within countries differently.
            Higher food prices hurt the urban poor because food accounts for a very large share of
            their expenditures. In many countries, food can account for 70 to 80 % of expenditures by the
            poorest quarter of the population. In such circumstances, food price increases can have a large
            negative impact on their purchasing power.

           Farmers in food exporting countries may benefit from higher prices assuming that food price
            increases “trickle down” to farmers. Since farming is the major source of income for a large
            part of the rural population in most developing countries, higher prices could help to reduce
            rural poverty. The size of the benefit will depend on whether farmers are able to respond to the
            higher prices through increased investment, which would allow them to increase supply.

                                     Pollution of Indonesia’s Cisadane River continues

            “I still remember when the water in the Cisadane River was very clean – I could clearly
             see fish swimming around,” said a 65-year-old resident, as he remembered his childhood.
             “Look at the river now – no one can see the bottom of it, despite being only about
             two metres deep. The water is dirty, smelly and heavily polluted,” he complained.

            Indonesia’s economic growth over the past three decades has meant that many industrial firms
             have been established along the riverbanks. It is said that these firms are the most serious
             polluters of the river and are suspected of continuously dumping their liquid waste directly into
             the water.

            Unfortunately, the polluted river is the main source of water for local water suppliers,
             who take and process the polluted water to serve the needs of their 500 000 customer.
             This doesn’t include thousands of locals living along the riverbanks who also use the
             river water for their daily needs – for washing, bathing and even cooking.

            A representative of one of the water suppliers told The Jakarta Post recently that the
             pollution in the river water had given rise to huge water processing costs to make the water
             safe for domestic use by customers. Although the water suppliers are able to pass on most of
             the increased costs to their consumers, this worsens the living standards of local households.
             According to the suppliers, the latest water sample indicated that the water contained chemical
             substances which greatly exceeded the limits set out in government regulations.

            The water suppliers blamed officials at the local environmental agencies for their failure to
             control the illegal dumping of liquid waste into the river. Along with the possible danger for
             people using the water, the pollution had also damaged the environment. This clearly represents
             a grave threat to sustainable development. One village leader complained, “the polluted
             river water has also killed fish in ponds, the area of which extends to around 200 hectares.
             The government is doing nothing. These companies should be fined”.

            However, environmental agency heads claim “we have regulations but it’s impossible for
             us to monitor hundreds of industrial firms that allegedly dump their liquid waste into the river
             at night. We do not have the necessary inspectors and equipment”.

                                                              Iceland

           Iceland’s per capita income has been growing at double the OECD* rate since the
            mid-1990s. It is now the fifth-highest among member countries and more than a quarter above
            the OECD average. This impressive performance is due to extensive structural reforms that
            deregulated and opened up the economy, thereby encouraging greater entrepreneurship.
            Strong economic growth has been accompanied, however, by mounting imbalances in
            the economy. Aggregate demand has increased beyond potential output. As a result,
            inflation and the current account deficit have become problems. Cuts in personal income taxes,
            intended as a supply-side policy to enhance efficiency, contributed to inflationary pressures.

           Inflation has exceeded the official target of 2.5 % since mid-2004. The Central Bank has
            been hesitant in raising interest rates in the past, and has only recently begun to tighten
            monetary policy by increasing interest rates. Monetary policy will need to remain tight until
            inflation expectations are consistent with the inflation target set by the Central Bank. This is
            crucial because of the effect that wage increases have in creating cost push inflation. It would
            also be helpful if members of the government respected the independence of the Central Bank,
            as this would reinforce the credibility and effectiveness of policy.

           There is much debate about the future of global trade. In the current economic slowdown it
            is likely that there will be a widespread increase in protectionist policies, such as tariffs and
            quotas. However, these restrictions can be destructive and further slow down an economy.

           There is also debate about the role of China in global trade. China’s rise as an economic
            power has made people worry that businesses and jobs are leaving their countries and moving
            to China. However, this is misleading since in reality trade with China is actually generating
            significant employment opportunities for Europe and the United States (US).

           There is a growing trend that is often not recognized; China’s role in the global market is
            changing from being the top manufacturing centre and exporter to becoming a powerful global
            buyer as well. This new trend is just beginning and needs the support of world leaders, as the
            global economy can only grow through greater economic openness.

           Over the past two decades, trade with China has gone through big changes. Economic reforms,
            as well as the country’s entry into the World Trade Organization, have allowed China to supply
            cheaper goods to Europe and the US, and helped western companies to cut costs by moving
            their production lines to China.

           Now we are in a new phase, where China is buying significantly more from the global market
            than it did in the past. China’s most recent trade figures indicated a rise in exports of 18 % in
            the last year while imports increased by 31 %, shrinking the nation’s current account surplus.
            China is expected to be the world’s biggest import market in 10 years.

           China’s role as the world’s biggest supplier will not fade away. There is a lot of competition
            from cheaper alternative markets, such as Bangladesh, India and Vietnam, but nothing
            can beat China’s vast choice of products and suppliers. Over the years, Chinese suppliers
            have improved their advantage in terms of pricing, good infrastructure, speed to market and
            compliance with international standards. Consumers worldwide will, therefore, continue to
            benefit from China’s ability to offer a wide choice of goods at low prices.

           At the same time, producers in Europe and the US are already benefiting from China’s
            growing appetite for food and beverages, home supplies, industrial machinery and
            construction materials.

                                          Promised food yet to appear amid crisis

           Food riots across Haiti have left at least six Haitians and a UN peacekeeper dead.
            They also resulted in a large increase in international promises of food and agricultural aid,
            but only a small fraction of the food has been delivered – less than 2 % as of early July 2008.

           According to aid workers, the poorest families need immediate help, and little of the promised
            emergency food has reached them. Most of what has reached Haiti is stuck in ports or
            in warehouses. It has not been possible to distribute the food aid due to high fuel prices,
            poor infrastructure and a weak and corrupt national government.

           A World Food Programme spokesman said that it is difficult to get food into Haiti, and that
            his agency is focusing on urban areas that are easiest to reach. “We’re trying to help as much
            as we can, but that doesn’t mean we’ll solve everything,” he said.

           Emergency food aid programmes are only temporary measures. Programmes to create jobs
            and help Haitian farmers increase production are more critical to ending the country’s chronic
            hunger and helping both urban and rural Haitian households to break out of the poverty cycle.

           As a means of addressing Haiti’s development problems, Spain is proposing a different
            aid model. Spain has promised US$100 million to help revitalize agriculture in Haiti
            and rebuild roads and schools. The bilateral aid will be provided from 2009 to 2012.
            However, the Deputy Prime Minister of Spain urged Haiti to improve its security so Spain
            could continue investing in the Caribbean nation.
