Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of
facts e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

“ITGS terminology refers to both the IT technical terminology and the terminology related to social and
ethical impacts.”

(c)   Explain two features that could be included in the Kindle to allow improved
      access to e-books by persons with impaired vision.                          [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • paper-like screen which allows easy reading of text and viewing of images
        in different lighting conditions
      • changing the text features (e.g. size, style, font) in order to accommodate the
        needs of persons with impaired vision - visually impaired users could adjust the
        font to double the height and width
      • text-to-speech feature which will read newspapers, blogs and e-books out loud
      • e-books can be stored in audio format - with the addition of headphones users
        can listen to the e-books
      • zoom/magnifying feature - which allows sections of text to be enlarged
      • adjust contrast/brightness of Kindle - an off white background may create less glare
      • braille keyboard - allows visually impaired users to do word searches/add notes
      • voice input/speech recognition - allows visually impaired users to verbally
        request functions eg book purchase.

      Award [1 mark] for each feature identified that allows improved access to
      e-books by persons with impaired vision up to a maximum of [2 marks].
      Award an additional [1 mark] for the development of each feature up to
      a maximum of [2 marks]. Mark the first two correct features identified.

(d)   Instead of purchasing printed textbooks, the Bay City International School
      is considering providing all IB teachers and their students with a Kindle and
      e-books. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages, for IB students, of using
      the Kindle and e-books instead of printed textbooks.                          [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Disadvantages of the Kindle compared to printed textbooks
      • Special licensing arrangements will have to be made for the use of e-books for
        all the students. No licensing is involved in the purchase of textbooks
        (licensing agreements could be expensive, students will need to abide by
        licensing agreements).
      • Not all of the current textbooks that are required for IB courses may be
        available on the Kindle (i.e. alternative textbooks may have to be selected
        which are not as good as the original printed textbooks.
      • Accessibility to e-books for students (i.e. students may need to download an
        e-book again and not have enough download rights).
      • Students may not stay focused on their studies due to other features of the
        Kindle (e.g. access to Wikipedia, blogs, Internet, playing music).
      • If the battery fails in a place where power is not available, the student cannot
        replace the battery and loses access to the e-books until it is recharged.
      • Some students are accustomed to writing in/highlighting text books - however
        the search & notes features may be more convenient once they become used to
        the Kindle.
      • Security measures will need to be taken as theft/damage/loss could occur - this
        is less likely with printed texts and a student would lose all of his texts/students
        may need to pay for replacement hardware and e-books.
      • Students may begin to prefer to use the Kindle instead of using books resulting
        in a loss of research skills and therefore a negative impact on learning
      • Health impacts could result from poor ergonomics - sitting hunched over the
        Kindle, continuously reading from a screen.
      • The Kindle currently is black and white - this would be a disadvantage with
        some subjects (eg Biology) where coloured illustrations enhance the explanation.

      Advantages of the Kindle compared to printed textbooks
      • the Kindle in school bags compared to carrying school books
        (i.e. the Kindle is lighter than textbooks, up to 200 books can be carried)/
        organisation is easier with all books in the one place.
      • the Kindle and e-books provide additional learning opportunities not possible
        with printed textbooks (e.g. listening to audio versions of textbooks, increasing
        the text size, annotating in the margins, bookmarking and exporting
        annotations and bookmarks).
      • e-books can easily be updated - unlike text books which require a new edition for
        information to be current
      • delivery of books is immediate through download - unlike text books which
        may need to be collected from a store or sent to the school (possibly from
        overseas if the school is in a remote location).

Do not accept responses that are not advantages or disadvantages for
IB students eg environmentally friendly/cost to the school is not acceptable.

In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on the
ITGS terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT technical
terminology.

2.   (a)   Identify two file formats that are used to post images on the Internet.               [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • JPG
           • GIF
           • PNG.

           Award [1 mark] for each file format up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe two different graphics techniques that could be used to create the
           photo in Image 3 by using elements from the photo in Image 1
           or from other digital sources.                                              [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • lasso a missile/ select with selection tool eg in Image 1 and copy and paste the
             missile into Image 3 (possibly on a new layer)
           • resize eg the missile in Image 1 and copy and paste the missile into Image 3
           • rotate eg a missile in Image 1 and copy and paste to create multiple copies of
             the missile in Image 3
           • lasso eg the cartoon character from a digital source and copy and paste into
             Image 3 (possibly on a new layer)
           • use any of the above techniques and flatten the layers of Image 3
           • use the cloning tool to duplicate parts of an image eg clone a missile in image 1
             and copy to image 3
           • use layers to superimpose objects - objects can be placed on top of one another
             and locking/hiding layers assists editing/superimpose the cartoon image onto
             image 1
           • magic wand tool (eg Photoshop) allows selection of pixels of similar colour - eg
             this could be used to select a missile in Image 1 and copy and paste to image 3
           • copy and paste - a missile in image 1 could be copied and then pasted into
             image 3.

           Award [1 mark] for identifying one graphic technique that could be used to create
           the photo in Image 3 by using elements from the photo in Image 1 or from other
           digital sources up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional [1 mark]
           for a description of each graphic technique up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Publishers, such as News Magazine, may use the same photos in both their
      weekly colour magazine and on their web site. Explain the problems that
      may arise in the weekly colour magazine or on the web site from trying to use
      the same image files for both purposes.                                       [4 marks]

      Answers may include:

      Problems for the web site
      • initial images may be high resolution and load slowly
      • file size may require too much storage space on the web server
      • colours on the web site may not be the same as in the printed version due to
        differences in the appearance of colours on monitors and printers
      • quality of the images on the web site will be different from the printed version
        (i.e. not glossy high resolution images).

      Problems for the weekly colour magazine

      • colours may appear fine on the monitor, but colour adjustment will be required
        to synchronize colours between the monitor and printer
      • shape of the image may need to be adjusted for the design of the page.


      [1 mark]
      A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the
      reason is not clear.

      [2–3 marks]
      A reasonable description of the problems that may arise from trying to use the
      same initial image for both purposes. The answer may be unbalanced and lack
      appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [4 marks]
      A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of why problems may arise from
      trying to use the same initial image for both purposes.

(d)   Private individuals often eyewitness news events as they occur.
      Using cell (mobile) phones they can immediately capture a photo and post it
      to a public web site. This type of posting is very different from the reporting
      of a news photographer to a news agency, which follows well-defined
      processes for editing and submitting photos.

      Discuss the ethical implications of an amateur photographer posting images
      to a public web site.                                                      [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • Amateur photographers may unethically manipulate their own photos before
        submitting them to the public web site. The work of the professional
        photographer must follow National Press Photographers Association (NPPA)
        guidelines.
      • Copyright/ownership of the images that are posted on the web site by the
        amateur photographer (i.e. web site policy claim ownership). The professional
        photographer is given credit for his work.
      • Photos placed on public web sites by citizens are not controlled
        (i.e. by any ethical guidelines other than the individual’s sense of right and
        wrong, no control persons). The news photographer’s work is monitored
        (i.e. by policies from the news agency and/or NPPA).
      • The amateur photographer may include persons in photos without permission
        or not using good ethical judgment. The professional photographer must
        follow policies set by the news agency and/or NPPA.
      • Poor quality of iPhone image could lead to misinterpretation of events - unlike
        a news agency there is no quality control of amateur photos.
      • The amateur photographer does not have to provide his/her name so is less
        accountable (cannot be contacted), whereas the news agency provides details
        of the organisation and possibly the photographer.
      • Copyright/ownership of images - news agencies are required to
        acknowledge/lock copyright images but amateur photographer may upload
        images without taking these measures (eg photo of a work of art).
      • Amateur photographers may post images without captions/context leading to
        misinterpretation - images provided by a news agency usually include captions
        and/or accompanying text to explain the photo.
      • Public websites may have less security measures in place than a news agency
        site resulting in potential loss of integrity of photos due to hackers.

      In part (d) of this question it is acceptable if there is more emphasis on the
      ITGS terminology related to social and ethical impacts and less on IT technical
      terminology.

3.   (a)   Identify two input devices that are required in order for Jules to interact with
           a real person.                                                                   [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • microphone
           • digital video camera or web cam
           • camera.

           Award [1 mark] for each input device up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe the steps that Jules would take in order to follow the movement
           of the person talking to him.                                            [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • capture the initial image of the person with the web cam/robot (sensors)
             captures image
           • use facial recognition software to determine the parts of the face to be tracked
             (reference points) / identify parts of the face (eg eyes for eye contact)
           • record an initial position (i.e. t0), of the face to be tracked/set the position of
             the human in relation to robot’s own position
           • record time lapse intervals
           • capture another image at a second position (i.e. t1)
           • determine the location of the reference points
           • compare new position of reference points (t1), with the initial position (t0)
           • if position is the same as before, then no movement is detected and there is no
             adjustment
           • if position changes, movement is detected and robot adjusts to the movement
           • changing voice frequency may assist in determining the person’s position
           • calculate the rotation to move Jules’ head
           • actuators/mechanical devices rotate robot’s head the required distance
           • loop/repeat the process.

(c)   Jules may have difficulty understanding a sentence in a conversation with
      a human. Explain why this could happen.                                   [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      •   vocabulary used in the sentence is unknown to the robot (reason: word is not
          in its internal language database)
      •   unusual grammar or sentence structure (reason: may be limited by Jules’
          ability to eg analyse context)
      •   accent or dialect making the words sound different (reason: robot has not
          been trained to recognise that person’s voice)
      •   idiomatic expression was used
      •   unclear/inaudible speech (reason: captured voice unclear then converted to
          digital sound files which can’t be matched)
      •   background noise/interference may mask human voice input
      •   linguistic differences - words may have different meaning depending of the
          context.

(d)   The organizers of an important tennis tournament are considering using
      a robot similar to Jules, named Tennis-Umpire, for the purpose of umpiring
      some of the games. This robot, which remains seated throughout the match,
      uses its own cameras to analyse the game and then communicates
      its decisions to the human spectators using speech.

      Evaluate whether the organizers should go ahead with this decision
      to replace human umpires with robotic umpires such as Tennis-Umpire. [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive
      • Robot would consistently determine the outcome of each play – eliminates
        variation in human reaction.
      • Robot is not affected by physical conditions (e.g. tiredness, weather,
        crowd reaction).
      • Robot is not biased – a human umpire may have a preference towards
        a particular player winning, or according to recent studies, tennis umpires are more
        likely to make mistakes when they call balls “out” than when they call them “in”.
        These errors are a result of the way the human brain processes visual information
        about motion.

          [Source: adapted from http://physorg.com/news144328896.html, 4 July 2009]

      Negative
      • Robots involve mechanical moving parts, there is a possibility of a problem
        in the physical functioning of the robot (necessitating replacement with another
        robot or human umpire).
      • Robot may not be able to follow the movement of the ball quickly enough, causing
        a delay in processing the call.
      • In a tennis game there are several other officials – one robot cannot call all
        of the plays (players may block the view, other umpires will be required with the
        ability to communicate with the Tennis-Umpire).
      • Robots can judge technical details of tennis (e.g. location of the tennis ball,
        applying the rules), but cannot judge human aspects of the game
        (e.g. inappropriate behaviour by players).
      • Job loss for current umpires.
      • Cost of Tennis-Umpire including hardware, software, updates, maintenance,
        repairs – this will be offset by saving on salaries.
      • Public (players/supporter) reaction to Tennis-Umpire may be negative – how do
        players dispute a decision?
      • A robot is not programmed to anticipate the unexpected – eg if a supporter
        interrupts play by running onto the court a human umpire could request a replay.

                             Area of impact: Business and employment

4.   (a)   Identify two characteristics of a P2P network.                                    [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • no server or client computers
           • each computer is a node
           • network used primarily for sharing files between the users.
           • a direct link between two computers via an internet connection
           • every computer acts as a client and a server.

           Award [1 mark] for each characteristic up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Users of illegal P2P file sharing networks run the risk of
           downloading viruses. Describe one indication that a computer has a virus
           and one preventative measure that a user can take to avoid viruses
           on their computer.                                                       [4 marks]

           Answers may include:
           Signs of a virus
           • unusual actions on the computer screen or computer (e.g. message or image
              is displayed on the computer screen, unusual sound or music plays randomly)
           • available memory is less than what should be available
           • program or file is suddenly missing
           • file problems (e.g. file size changes without explanation, file is corrupted)
           • operating system runs much slower than usual
           • warning appears from an anti-virus program.

           Preventative measures
           • no downloading of files from unknown sources
           • no downloading of illegal files
           • firewall
           • using anti-virus software
           • downloading current definitions for anti-virus software to keep it updated.

           Award [1 mark] for one indication that a computer has a virus and
           award an additional [1 mark] for a description up to a maximum of [2 marks].
           Award [1 mark] for one preventative measure that a user can take to avoid
           viruses on their computer and award an additional [1 mark] for a description up
           to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain two kinds of evidence that could have been presented in court
      to prove that copyrighted songs were offered by the woman using
      a P2P file sharing account.                                           [4 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • Internet service provider (ISP) provides the data log of the files transferred
        from the woman’s computer using her TCP/IP number
      • the police could have found evidence on the computer hard disk used by the
        woman indicating her P2P username and illegal music downloads
      • evidence could have been presented from someone who downloaded music
        from the P2P user “tereastarr”
      • evidence on the woman’s computer hard disc of illegal music in a public folder
        which has been made available for sharing by other users.

      Award [1 mark] for each kind of evidence that could have been presented in court
      to prove that copyrighted songs were offered by the woman using a P2P
      user account up to a maximum of [2 marks]. Award an additional [1 mark]
      for the development of each kind of evidence up to a maximum of [2 marks].
      Mark the first two correct kinds of evidence identified.

(d)   A range of online solutions have been developed to provide customers with
      legal access to music files.

      To what extent have online solutions been made available to meet customers’
      needs? Use specific examples in your response.                              [10 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • range of services are offered by web sites (e.g. collection of MP3 music, search
        functions, download/setup, help/support)
      • online purchase - effective means for purchasing/downloading individual
        music titles from an online service (e.g. iTunes, Spotify)
      • subscription-based model (e.g. Napster /Spotify a subscription charged and
        artists are paid each time their song is played)
      • free download - download music made available by the artist for free (e.g. MySpace)
      • easy access to purchase songs eg You Tube, in collaboration with Apple
        iTunes, is now including a link under its music videos to direct users to
        purchase the song from iTunes
      • the iPhone app, Shazam tags a sound track that is playing, identifies the track
        and provides information for purchase via iTunes.

      The specific examples may be analysed in the following manner:

      Some customers feel that online solutions are not meeting their needs because
      • some solutions are only available in certain countries
      • some downloads are only available for approved players
      • customers may be reluctant to give personal details
      • many young people do not have access to credit cards which are required for
        payment
      • costs of online purchase.

      However others are moving towards legal downloads because:
      • these sites have GUI which are easy to use
      • most music is available
      • even though there is a fee, music is still cheaper than purchasing in a shop
      • there is no need to worry about viruses – viruses may be associated with some
        P2P file sharing
      • reviews are often available
      • it may be possible to try out songs before buying
      • secure payment is possible
      • songs are high quality
      • it may be possible to purchase a single song as well as an album.

      In part (d) of this question it is expected that there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      the social and ethical impacts.
