           producing an inflationary gap
           an identification of the inflationary gap on the x-axis
           an explanation that the higher price level means that costs of production rise as workers negotiate
           higher wages to compensate for inflation

           a conclusion that the long-term effect is an increase in the price level with no change in real
           output.

           on the marginal propensity to inject or add income to the circular flow e.g. the higher the MPC
           the higher the value of the multiplier
           an explanation that the size of the multiplier depends on the marginal propensity to save or,
           generally, on the marginal propensity to withdraw or leak out of income from the circular flow,
           e.g. the higher the MPS the lower the value of the multiplier
           a numerical example using one of the formulae for the multiplier
           an explanation of the numerical example.
