Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 3
published in the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but
must be used in conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all
examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact
your team leader.

 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
         detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
         are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
        limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
        but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth, historical
        knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in
        nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
        commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
        an understanding of historical processes has been made. An attempt at a structured
        approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
        generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
        and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
        top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant, in-depth
        knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to
        indicate some in-depth understanding, but it is not consistent throughout. Events are
        placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
        comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently
        integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
        knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
        such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
        interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
        balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
        commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
        may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
        may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
        present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
        contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-
        structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   In what ways, and with what results, did Urban II (1088–1099) expand papal power?

     Odo of Lagery, born c1035, entered the Church and became Archdeacon of Rheims, but changed
     from being a secular cleric by entering the monastery of Cluny, where he became Prior. Circa 1075
     he was recruited by Pope Gregory VII to enter the papal service. He became Cardinal-Bishop of
     Ostia,
     and Pope in 1088. He faced a difficult situation; Rome and much of the papal revenue was
     controlled by Henry IV, who had also backed the anti-Pope Clement III. The reform
     movement started by Pope Gregory VII was threatened. Urban II addressed and reversed the
     situation, implementing a successful reform movement, by meeting and convincing clergy and lay
     nobility in a series of councils, of the need for reform, including the celibacy of clergy,
     restoration of church property, and condemnation of simony. His principal reforms were
     incorporated into ecclesiastical law, and he presided at and increased church courts. In 1095 he
     preached and partially organized the First Crusade, which also enhanced papal power and authority,
     and made the Pope the accepted and effective leader of Christendom.


2.   Discuss the impact of Francis of Assisi (c1182–1226) on the religious and social life of
     medieval Europe.

     Born to a wealthy family in Italy, Francis abandoned his luxurious existence in favour of a religious
     life. He adopted extreme poverty, but remained within society, working and preaching with the
     poor and sick. But his example gained him a large following from all walks of life, so Pope
     Innocent III approved the Franciscan order in 1209. Francis was ordained deacon but his humility
     prevented him from becoming a priest. At first Francis and his fellow friars rejected possessions,
     and were itinerant, but later the Franciscan order built friaries, and adopted a rule and organization.

     Francis and his followers, and later the Franciscan order, had an impact on religious and social life
     in various ways: Francis himself was an example of love and charity to all “God‟s creatures”;
     his work with the poor and sick was important for the social life of thirteenth century Europe;
     poverty took the place of what had become in many instances, rich monasticism; missionary work
     was undertaken in different parts of Europe and beyond; Francis and his followers worked within
     the world by their charity and preaching; the Franciscan movement was part of a thirteenth century
     reform movement. Unlike the Dominicans they did not emphasize education and learning.

3.   Analyse (a) the main features of the ideology of the Ismaili branch of Shiism and (b) its impact
     on the Islamic world.

     The Ismaili branch of Shiism recognizes seven rather than twelve imans. Ismail, the eldest son of
     the sixth imam, Jafar al-Sadiq (d. 765), was disinherited and most Shiites recognized his brother
     Musa al-Kazim as imam. Ismailis regarded Ismail as the seventh and last imam, and expected that
     he would soon return as the Mahdi and overthrow existing corrupt governments, and establish
     justice. The Ismaili Iman was considered to be infallible.

     Ismaili influence was centred on the Fatimid Empire from 909 in North Africa, then from
     969 to 1171 in Egypt and Syria, but did not attempt to convert the Sunnis. Ismaili belief that
     religious precepts have a secret inner meaning, passed from Muhammad to Ali, and from him to
     later imams and thus affected Islamic philosophy, but doctrinal differences had a negative impact
     on the Islamic world, in causing disputes.

     The question is divided into sections (a) and (b) to help candidates to focus, but do not penalize
     candidates who treat the question and their answer as a whole. Both parts should be addressed in
     order to reach [12 marks].


4.   To what extent was the decline of the Fatimids in the twelfth century due to internal
     divisions?

     The Fatimid Empire ruled in Morocco from 909 until 969, and in Egypt until 1171.
     They claimed descent from Muhammad‟s daughter Fatima as their right to rule. The Fatimids
     probably reached the peak of their power under al-Muizz who ruled from 935 to 975.
     He conquered Egypt, part of Syria and Palestine. He built Cairo, and made it his capital. Internal
     divisions among the Fatimid Ismailis caused disintegration and a break-up into factions such as
     Assassins, Druzes and Khojas, which affected the Fatimids. Other factors included: after a
     successful economic period during which they had peaceful relations with their neighbours, they
     were weakened by the rise of the Seljuks and by the Crusades; from the mid-twelfth century the
     Fatimids lacked strong leaders; they were also weakened by Norman invasions and Salah-al Din
     (Saladin) who fought against the Fatimids in Egypt (1164–1168), became vizier in Egypt in 1169
     and ended Fatimid rule in 1171.


5.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Louis VI (1108–1137) in extending royal power
     in France.

     Louis VI ruled France from 1108 to 1137 at a time when royal authority was almost confined to the
     Île-de-France. Louis spent most of his time and effort in enforcing his feudal rights, such as money,
     rents, labour and military services, at first in the royal demesne. The King also sought to impose
     some control over the Church in his territories, such as the appointment of bishops
     and abbots. By the end of his reign his authority as feudal lord of his demesne was secure.
     In the second half of his reign he also tried to exert more authority over the great feudal lords who
     exercised feudal authority in their fiefs in much of France. In 1124, the Emperor Henry V invaded
     France, but Louis was able to assemble a large and comprehensive army including most of the great
     feudal lords, and caused the Emperor to withdraw. Thus Louis had exercised a royal perogative that
     had not been tested for more than a century, and by his death he and his chief minister Suger had
     consolidated and enlarged the royal demesne and increased royal power. Thus most candidates will
     probably emphasize his successes, but there were also some failures, e.g. he failed to avenge the
     murder of Charles, Count of Flanders, and establish William Clito as the new Count.

6.   “A belligerent [aggressive] ruler mainly interested in territorial expansion at the expense of
     his neighbours.” To what extent do you agree with this judgment of Henry II as King of
     England and ruler of the Angevin Commonwealth from 1154 to 1189?

     Candidates can agree or disagree with this quotation. Henry II did spend most of his adult life
     fighting, but much of this was to defend what he had inherited, and put down rebellions, including
     those by his sons. He was also ruler of the Angevin Commonwealth.

     Henry‟s inheritance included England, Normandy, Maine, Touraine and Brittany; then his
     marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine joined her extensive territories to his, and caused enmity
     with her previous husband, Louis VII of France.              The quotation especially refers to
     Henry‟s fighting in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, but candidates may also refer to his interest in
     expanding his Angevin Commonwealth. These should be credited, but do not penalize those who
     do not address this aspect. Malcolm III of Scotland paid homage in 1157, and Henry was
     recognized as overlord of Ireland in 1171. The focus of the answer should be on the quotation, but
     “to what extent” allows a brief and concise mention of other features of his rule such as ending the
     anarchy of Stephen‟s reign, dealing firmly with the barons, and legal reforms including the Assizes
     of Clarendon 1166 and Northampton 1176.

     Do not expect all the above, and accept other relevant points.
                                                 –7–                N10/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



7.   Discuss the importance of the military orders for the Crusades between 1100 and 1291.

     Candidates will probably focus their answers on the Templars and Hospitallers.

     The Order of the Temple was established around 1119 to protect Christian Pilgrims to the
     Holy Land, and was formally recognized by the Church at the Council of Troyes (1128). They
     made a significant military contribution to the defence of the Crusader States, and also built many
     fortifications.

     An example of their military contribution was the Battle of Montgisard in 1177, when they
     defeated a superior army under Salah al-Din (Saladin). The Templars played a major role in
     the Battle of Hattin in 1187, which was a major defeat for the Christian Forces. They did not
     play a direct role in the recovery of Jerusalem in 1229. In the following decades their activities
     were concentrated around Acre, which finally fell in 1291.

     The Order of the Knights Hospitallers of Saint John of Jerusalem had its origins around 1080 to
     care for poor and sick pilgrims in Jerusalem. After the First Crusade, it also acquired a military
     function, and in 1113 this was confirmed by the Pope. They followed the Augustinian rule and
     were divided into three classes: knights, chaplains and serving brothers. Like the Templars, the
     Hospitallers were important in the defence of the Crusader States, and they built major
     fortifications, including the fortress of Krak des Chevaliers. After the Fall of Jerusalem in 1187,
     their activities were focused on the defence of the County of Tripoli, and they remained in the Holy
     Land until the fall of the Crusader States in 1291. Their importance was military, as a fighting
     force, as they were present until 1291, and for their aid to the sick.

     Although not a military order, some candidates might mention the Assassins, an offshoot of the
     Ismaili sect of Muslims. During the Crusades they targeted Christian leaders, including
     Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, whom they killed in 1152. Conrad of Montferrat also fell victim to
     assassination in 1192, and Edward I of England survived a similar attack at Acre in 1271.


8.   For what reasons, and with what results, were Christian Crusader States founded?

     The Crusader States were Jerusalem, Antioch, Edessa and Tripoli. Jerusalem was founded
     in 1099, and the fall of Acre in 1291 signified the end of the Crusader States. The states were
     founded as a result of Christian crusading victories, to try to maintain and defend
     their conquests. They were also founded because of the ambitions of certain crusaders,
     who had taken part in order to obtain land and titles, such as Godfrey de Bouillon and Bohemond I
     of Antioch.

     The results of the founding of the Crusader States included: introduction of Western
     European architecture, especially castles, churches and cathedrals; practices and lifestyles;
     foundation and work of the military orders; perhaps the lengthening the Christian presence
     in the area; on the whole the peaceful existence of the Muslim population who were taxed,
     but not subjected to persecution or forced conversion; feudalism and the participation of the states
     in European politics.

     There are no mark divisions/allocations for reasons and results, but both should be addressed in
     order to achieve satisfactory to good marks.

9.    Compare and contrast the roles of Genghis Khan (1206–1227) and Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane
      1370–1405) as Mongol leaders.

      For “compare”
      Both were Mongol leaders and ruthless conquerors; both owed their positions to their military
      talents and prowess; both amassed a large Mongol Empire.

      For “contrast”
      Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire and unified the Mongol tribes.
      His main conquests were in North China, Central Asia and Turkistan; he was also an able
      administrator, and issued a code of law. He introduced an alphabetic script for the Mongol
      language, and was willing to learn from some of his conquered people. His military talents
      included strategy and espionage. He was not a Muslim.

      Timur-I-Lang‟s conquests were in Persia, Turkestan, India, Egypt and Syria; he was not interested
      in administration, and left vassals to rule; he was a patron of the arts and imported foreign
      craftsmen for his capital Samarkand; although a Muslim he plundered and fought fellow Muslims.
      He did not form a unified empire. His fighting qualities and techniques followed and improved
      earlier military methods. His killings and vengeance were notorious. Because of his administrative
      and settlement failures, he often had to reconquer areas that he had already conquered previously.

      If only Genghis Khan or Timur-I-Lang is addressed, the maximum that can be awarded is
      [7 marks].


10.   Evaluate the impact of Mongol invasions on the Islamic world up to 1260.

      The impact of the Mongols on the Islamic world was on the whole negative. The greatest impact
      was military. The discipline and mobility of the Mongol forces defeated the Muslim armies.
      His conquests in Turkistan first brought Genghis Khan into contact with the Islamic world.
      He then turned to Iran and Afghanistan. Baghdad fell in 1258 and the last Abbasid Caliph was
      defeated and killed, but the Egyptian Mamluks rallied and defeated the Mongol army at Ain Jalut in
      Palestine in 1260. In 1294 when Kublai Khan died, Mongol power was declining, and in 1295 the
      Mongol Khan converted to Islam. The struggle for power in the Middle East continued, but was
      then within the world of Islam.

      Another impact of the Mongol invasions was to open Asia to the West by restarting
      communications which had been closed by Islam, and thus facilitating contact and trade between
      East and West.

11.   Analyse Umayyad rule and society in Cordoba between 756 and 1031.

      „Abd al-Rahman I captured Cordoba and founded a dynasty and later „Abd al-Rahman III founded a
      Caliphate. Cordoba became the capitol of Umayyad rule in Spain, and the centre of culture
      and learning. The tenth century was its peak, with the great mosque built between 785 and 980, and
      the magnificent court of „Abd al-Rahman III. Merchants and trade flourished; Cordoba exported
      weapons, leather goods and silk and imported wheat from the Maghreb. The Umayyads introduced
      a legal code and system of taxation. Non-Muslims especially paid tax, and Umayyad rule was
      supported by a ruling group of Arab and “Arabized” families. The Caliphate ended in 1031, and
      was succeeded by a number of small states.

      Cordoba was on the river Guadalquivir so food and materials could be landed, and after
      immigration had been developed goods could be exported. It was also a centre where roads
      crossed, so a market developed. As the ruler became more autocratic, a royal city was built outside
      Cordoba, at Madinat al-Zahra, but Cordoba retained Islamic institutional buildings, its great
      mosque, where an elaborate ritual developed around the Caliph, and law courts. Theologians,
      lawyers, scholars, poets and musicians gathered in Cordoba.


12.   What was the Reconquista and why was it successful?

      The Reconquista was the drive by Spanish Christians to recapture the Iberian Peninsula from the
      Muslims. After the Muslim invasions of the eighth century, Christians were only able to maintain
      control over small kingdoms in the north of Spain. By the eleventh century Spanish Christians
      began to campaign to expand these kingdoms and retake the peninsula. Good progress was made
      by the thirteenth century, and the last Muslim kingdom, Granada, fell in 1492.

      The Reconquista was successful because of the increasing unity and strength of
      the Spanish kingdoms and the decline of the Umayyad Muslim dynasty, due to internal
      and external factors. After the end of the Caliphate in 1131, the small states that succeeded it
      quarrelled among themselves. This allowed the larger Christian states, Aragon and Castile, to
      play them off against each other, or offer protection in the form of tribute. Freelance mercenaries
      (such as El Cid) joined the fight, but in 1086 Muslim Spain was united under the Almoravids
      from North Africa. They were later challenged by the Almohads, whose intolerance made
      them unpopular. The cooperation of the three large Iberian kingdoms, Castile, Aragon
      and Portugal, was successful in all areas except Granada by the mid-thirteenth century.
      Little changed until the final push came with the union of Aragon and Castile, under Ferdinand
      and Isabella.

13.   “Although Frederick II‟s (1220–1250) attempts to unify Germany and Italy failed, he was a
      great and feared Emperor.” To what extent do you agree with this verdict?

      The wording of this question allows candidates to use all their knowledge about Emperor
      Frederick II. Frederick was born in 1194 and succeeded to a vast inheritance, which was probably
      impossible for one person to govern. He was crowned King of the Germans in 1215 and Holy
      Roman Emperor in 1220, which also gave him claims in Italy. He was King of Sicily from 1197
      and crowned himself King of Jerusalem in 1229 after leading a successful crusade. He was
      opposed by the lay and spiritual princes in Germany, and devolved imperial power on them in order
      to maintain their support in other regions. He was opposed by, and fought with the Papacy,
      throughout most of his adult life, and was also opposed by the Lombard League in Italy. He built a
      power base in the kingdom of Sicily, issuing the Constitution of Melfi in 1231 which incorporated
      his administrative reforms. He was a patron of art and learning, but his power was declining in
      1250, and he left an impossible situation for his heirs to solve.

      The above offers some suggestions for candidates, but many other points and aspects could
      be provided. Marks will depend on focus, analysis and argument.


14.   Discuss the impact of the reign of Edward I (1272–1307) on the nature and role of government
      in England.

      This question requires candidates to focus on internal aspects of Edward I‟s reign, although the
      effects of his wars on English society could also be relevant. Edward was born in 1239 and
      succeeded his father, Henry III, in 1272. He combined a forceful and militaristic foreign and
      imperial policy with advancing royal authority through legal and administrative forms, as well as
      exerting more control over the barons and lords, for example in the Statutes of Westminster
      (1275–1290). His campaigns, especially in Wales and Scotland, although expensive, made
      England‟s borders more secure. To meet the rising costs of war he turned increasingly to
      parliament, summoning representatives of shires and boroughs, expecting them to consent to his
      requests for increased taxation. The wool subsidy which he instituted in 1275 provided both useful
      revenue, and security on which the crown could borrow. He also sought to give the crown more
      control over the clergy by passing statues to limit the authority of church courts, which led to
      difficulties with Archbishops Peckham and Winchelsey. In 1290 he expelled the Jews. After 1294,
      fighting on three fronts, Wales, Scotland and France, he faced increasing discontent, financial and
      political. He died deeply in debt.

15.   Compare and contrast the challenges to royal authority in England and France between 1300
      and 1485.

      Challenges to royal authority in England and France which could be used for comparison include:
      disputed successions; internal and external wars; increased taxation, especially to pay for war; loss
      of confidence and political instability; opposition from powerful lords.

      Individual events in England and France which could be used for either comparison or contrast
      include: the imprisonment and murder of Edward II; claim of Edward III to France and the claims
      of French kings for overlordship of Gascony; discontent with Richard II of England and Charles
      VI‟s recurrent madness and the position of the Dauphin Charles in France until his coronation in
      1429; dynastic wars, such as the Wars of the Roses in England, and Burgundians and Armagnacs in
      France. Candidates might point out that royal authority also increased in some aspects in both
      countries.

      If only challenges to royal authority in either England or France are addressed mark out of
      [7 marks].


16.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Philip the Fair between 1419 and 1467.

      Philip was born in 1419 and was known as both “the Fair” and “the Good”. He played an important
      role in his duchy in France, and in wider European politics. At first he supported England
      against France, signing the Treaty of Troyes, which named Henry V as successor to the
      French throne, but in 1435 he joined France against England. He inherited a large and
      rich duchy, and he added to it by marriage, purchase or conquest. The Treaty of Arras (1435)
      released Philip from performing homage to the French King. Philip‟s court in Burgundy
      was regarded as the most prosperous and civilized in Europe, and affected European culture
      and manners. Nobles came from all over Europe to take part in tournaments organized by the
      ducal court. He founded the chivalric Order of the Holy Fleece and was a patron of the arts,
      especially of Flemish painters including Jan and Hubert van Eyck. However his policies,
      especially the wars, were expensive and his imposition of taxes led to a rebellion, led by Ghent.
      The rebels were defeated, with 20 000 killed.

      There will probably be more attention to his successes, but for top bands some failures should also
      be mentioned.

17.   In what ways did famine and pestilence cause social and economic changes in Western Europe
      during the fourteenth century?

      Famine and pestilence affected all social groups, but some were more affected than others.
      Plagues were more damaging to the countryside than to urban areas, because the country had less
      capacity for recovery than a town. There were great famines in 1316 and 1317 throughout Europe,
      although these were caused by the ravages of war as well as plague. The bubonic plague seems to
      have started in China in about 1333; in 1346 it was raging in Sicily, and by 1348 it had reached
      France, Spain, England and Germany. Both urban areas and the countryside suffered many deaths,
      and there are differences of opinion over which were affected more seriously.

      Economic effects can include: scarcity of labour; substitution of wages for labour services;
      high prices; decline in rental income due to the lack of tenants to take up vacant holdings.
      Agricultural production was greatly diminished. But some peasants and merchants profited,
      and rose as landlords and gentry. Royal ordinances concerning labour tried to pin prices to
      their pre-plague levels and to stop men leaving their occupations for more pay. These failed,
      and attempted enforcement, as well as the demand for higher wages caused riots in places.

      Social changes can include: religion and the Church which was affected by inadequately trained
      clerics who were ordained to replace dead clergy; many monasteries and nunneries suffered from
      high mortality rates, thus the fall in numbers estimated to be about 50 % in 1350. This affected
      both monasticism and the laity in the form of lack of employment and charity. The plague also
      caused some people to alter their views on religion – fatalism found an intellectual expression in the
      new Augustinian doctrine; new sects were founded, and mysticism was more widespread.

      Credit those who address this religious aspect of social change, but do not penalize those who
      do not.

      Mark the answer as a whole, and reward those who are able to provide specific details to support
      their argument.


18.   Evaluate the importance of trade and urban development in the fourteenth century.

      This question covers trade and urban development before and after the mid-century bubonic plague.
      Towns had been increasing in size especially since the twelfth century. Various causes are
      suggested, starting with the increase of population, but there is no one clear reason for this.
      Possibly an increase in food production helped. Towns attracted people in times of lawlessness,
      invasion and uncertainty, when it was thought that they offered more protection within their walls.
      The growth of a money economy and decline of the lordship/manorial system also helped.
      With an increase of trade, manufacturing, etc. towns prospered. Trade provided a livelihood and
      a better standard of living for many. It also interacted with many areas of medieval Europe, for
      example the wool and cloth trade introduced specialization and influenced trade routes and fairs.
      Both urban development and trade led to more and better education and the spread of ideas.
      The mid-century plagues halted urban development for a time, but also led to the advance of
      many who survived and had the ability to fill a need or gap. The fourteenth century was a time of
      class movement.

      Mark as a whole, but expect both trade and urban development to be mentioned. Candidates can
      answer in depth about one country, or use examples from several sources.

19.   Analyse the reasons for, and results of, the fall of Constantinople in 1453.

      The fall of Constantinople was the result of both the weakness of the Byzantine Empire,
      with poor emperors and internal and external disputes, and the strength of the Ottomans,
      during a period of strong leaders. Efforts by the Papacy and the West to shore up the weak
      regime failed, and after a struggle for many years the Ottomans under Muhammed II captured
      Constantinople and ended the Byzantine Empire. Some reasons that could be developed are: the
      decline of Byzantine Empire; the treatment of Constantinople by crusaders; quarrels between
      West and East in political and religious terms; the geographical situation for trade, with rivalry
      between Genoa and Venice; its strategic position; the rise and power of the Ottomans;
      Ottoman military supremacy and tactics.

      Results could include: Constantinople became the Ottoman capital; Ottoman domination of the
      eastern Mediterranean; the effect on the balance of power in the area; the decline of Genoa, but
      survival of Venice as the strong trading power; the effect on the Italian Renaissance – but this had
      started before the fall, with the exodus of scholars, artists and writers.

      Mark the question as a whole, but both parts should be covered to reach the higher markbands.


20.   “Although he was known as „Suleiman the Magnificent‟ to Europeans, his subjects knew him
      as „the Lawgiver‟.” To what extent do you agree with this judgment of Suleiman the
      Magnificent (1520–1566)?

      The quotation gives all candidates a chance to use their knowledge of Suleiman, although some
      might choose to focus almost exclusively on “Magnificent” and “Lawgiver”. This would be
      perfectly acceptable, and probably most should start with these two aspects, but others may point
      out that his rule was successful and memorable for other reasons.

      “Magnificence”: indicated Suleiman‟s magnificent court; splendid and spectacular festivals,
      displays, processions, etc., which often included fireworks; his patronage and collection of art
      and artists; foundation of libraries; and dress – all of which impressed Europe.

      “Lawgiver”: Suleiman both introduced new laws including those on religious matters, to
      supplement Muslim Sharia law, and land tenure, and codified all laws so that the same laws were
      enforced in all his domains.

      Administration: could be connected to “Lawgiver”; this was both central and provincial,
      it was hierarchical and rotating, and included an efficient tax system based on his tax register.
      The Chancellor, Chief Clerk and Treasurer were important officials.

      Military affairs: Suleiman had a very large, well-trained and organized army, as well as an
      effective navy. His forces dominated the Islamic world, Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean.
      Notable campaigns captured Hungary and Rhodes, but the siege of Vienna failed. Important
      campaigns were also fought in Persia/Iran. His weaponry and tactics, especially use of canons,
      could be considered.

      Politics and diplomacy: his alliances with France, and problems with his sons could be considered.

      Do not expect or demand all the above, but candidates must focus on the quotation in order to
      obtain a “good” mark.

21.   Compare and contrast the forms of government during the fifteenth century of two of the
      following: Florence; Milan; Venice.

      These three states were chosen as examples of forms of government and rule in Italian city states in
      the fifteenth century. Material to compare and contrast will depend on the two states chosen.

      Florence
      There was a struggle for power between rival patrician families, at the beginning of the century.
      Cosimo de Medici was the first member of the Medici family, who ruled Florence from 1421,
      although he was expelled from the city in 1433. When he returned in 1434 he became its
      established ruler. Florence‟s most successful Medici ruler was probably Lorenzo, who died in
      1492. There was then a brief democratic period under Savonarola.

      In theory Florence was a republic and ruled by the Florentine Signoria, but their inability to rule
      and maintain stability enabled first Cosimo, and then Lorenzo, to control the elections – no one
      opposed to the Medici had his vote registered. Also Cosimo enabled his supporters to be
      successful in politics and business. Therefore opposition to his rule was very weak. The “rule” of
      Lorenzo gradually became more despotic. Thus Florence was transformed from a disorderly
      republic into a princely state.

      Milan
      Milan was a duchy, ruled first by the Visconti, then by the Sforzas. Gian Galeazzo Visconti had
      enlarged the duchy, putting Pisa and Sienna under Milanese rule. After his death in 1402, the unity
      of his dominions was disrupted until his son Filippo Maria ruled Milan as Duke from 1412 to 1447,
      and restored its position. He was succeeded by Francesco Sforza, who was involved in a war
      between Venice and Milan, and entered Milan in triumph as Duke in 1450, and ruled the duchy
      ably. Ludovico Sforza usurped the Milanese government in 1480 and helped Charles VIII to invade
      Naples in 1494, but was driven out of his duchy by Louis XII in 1499. Regarded as usurpers, the
      Sforzas tried to achieve legitimacy, and therefore attempted to increase the prosperity and renown
      of their duchy.

      Venice
      Venice was a republic and from 726 CE its rulers, or doges, were elected. Venice was at the height
      of its power in the fifteenth century, dominated the Mediterranean, and especially in the first half of
      the century fought Milan frequently for the possession of northern Italy. As a result of war with
      Milan, Venice dominated Bergamo, Brescia, Padua, Verona and Vicenza. Rule was by the Council
      of Ten, and power was in the hands of a few powerful and rich families. From 1454, Venice
      generally enjoyed peace, prosperity and freedom from civil strife, and all classes and all of her
      subject cities benefited. The power of the nobles in the latter was weakened, and the ordinary
      people supported Venetian rule, but the rest of Italy did not.

      If only one state is addressed, the maximum that can be obtained is [7 marks].

22.   For what reasons, and in what ways, did the Renaissance emerge and develop in Italy?

      The Renaissance is widely accepted as having begun in the early fourteenth century in Italy,
      and probably reached its peak in the fifteenth century. Candidates will no doubt mention
      the wealth, patronage and prestige of the Italian city states and Rome; with their rivalry to
      excel in art and literature. Artists were tempted to reside there, and works of art were collected,
      by popes, princes and dukes. The following could all be analysed: the migration of scholars from
      Constantinople, even before its fall; the revival of interest in Greek and Roman classics; the
      increase and importance of education; humanism, with a new emphasis on the individual and on the
      temporal world, (although much of Renaissance art was still for churches); and the idea of the
      Renaissance man. Printing, and new techniques such as perspective and use of colour, as well as
      the study of anatomy, could also be noted.

      A good answer will develop some of the above, and support arguments with specific examples of
      art, literature, patrons, artists, new movements, etc. and perhaps emphasize man and his
      achievements in order to show continuity and change from medieval learning, art and literature.

      Mark the question as a whole, but both reasons and ways should be covered to reach the higher
      markbands.


23.   Discuss the role of religion in exploration between 1400 and 1550.

      Crusades and pilgrimages provided Christians with an opportunity to travel. In spite of efforts by
      popes in the fifteenth century, the Crusades were no longer a viable alternative, and pilgrimages
      to some holy places were impossible. Thus a new movement began – the idea of converting
      heathens in lands yet to be discovered and explored. This movement was first developed under
      Henry the Navigator in Portugal, and there was a religious element in his work for exploration of
      Africa. The legend of a Christian prince, Prester John, is said to have encouraged some exploration,
      and Spanish support for Columbus had a religious element.

      Candidates might then claim that religion was less of a spur than wealth, land, etc. but the role of
      religion must be the focus of the question. If it is largely denied, specific evidence must be
      provided to support this point of view.
                                                 – 16 –             N10/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


24.   Analyse the importance of either one European explorer or one Muslim traveller between
      1400 and 1550.

      Explorers and travellers mentioned in the guide are: Ibn Battuta; Henry the Navigator; Columbus;
      Ferdinand Magellan; Vasco da Gama; Ibn Majid; Piri Reis. This is an open-ended question and any
      other explorer or traveller between these dates could be used. Importance suggests the following
      areas: new information of former largely unknown lands; obtaining territory for the European or
      Islamic country that supported the explorer; how this increased the power and prestige of the
      supporting country; wealth, especially gold for the supporters or explorers; how the exploration or
      travel helped cartography, shipbuilding, etc.; importance for future trade; new products introduced
      into medieval Europe or the Islamic world.

      This question provides many opportunities for candidates who have studied this topic to use their
      knowledge. Do not demand all the points suggested, and accept other valid ones, but analysis of
      importance rather than a narrative or descriptive account of a voyage or voyages of exploration is
      required.
