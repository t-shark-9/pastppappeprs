                                            SECTION A

Prescribed subject 1          The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These questions relate to the beginnings of the Islamic Empire during the Rightly Guided Caliphs.

1.    (a)    According to Source C, what were the state policies introduced by
             Caliph Umar in the conquered provinces?                                      [3 marks]

      The key policies are:
         as a new regulation, soldiers are to be confined in the amsar, or military camps,
         thus preventing the softening of their soldiery, as well as avoiding friction with and
         resentment of the indigenous population;
         fixed pensions from the public treasury, collected from the fay would be distributed to the
         soldiers instead of the old booty of war;
         regular levying of the kharaj is calculated according to the productivity of the fields and
         is a measure against extortion;
         a poll tax is paid by the non-Muslims for protection of life, goods and religion, with a
         probable exemption from military service.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)    What is the significance of the picture of the Mosque of Umar
             in Source E?                                                  [2 marks]

            It was Caliph Umar’s site of prayers when he arrived in Jerusalem;
            The mosque is opposite the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and not encroaching on it.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to [2 marks].

      Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
      final mark out of [5 marks].
                                              –4–              N10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources A and B on the
     relations between the Arab rulers and the conquered subjects.                         [6 marks]

     For “compare”
          Both speak of the jyzia, or poll tax, as payment by the non-Muslims to the
          Arab authorities;
          Both acknowledge that the jyzia payment is in exchange for a secure life and freedom
          of worship;
          Both indicate a difference of civil status between non-Muslims and Arab/Muslims;
          Both Sources A and B underline the religious context and aspect of the jyzia: in Source
          A through the encounter of the two religious heads – Caliph Umar and Patriarch
          Sophronius; and in both through the use of religious symbols and references
          (crosses, churches, places of worship, sanctuary, in the name of Allah, the word of God,
          covenant of the Messenger and the believers, etc.).

     For “contrast”
          There is a difference of emphasis of the jyzia issue in the two sources;
          Source A has a somewhat reticent, if not negative point of view, concerning the
          treatment of the dhimmis. It uses the term dhimmis – while Source B calls them the
          “people of Illyaa” – with its connotation of inferiority status, frankly stating that they
          are second-class citizens in spite of the mitigating “protected”. Thus, it points to the
          discriminatory aspect of the jyzia, by qualifying it with the adjective “punitive”. By the
          same token, the freedom of worship is minimized by the mention that they have to
          worship “discreetly”. It also underlines the relationship of superior and inferior status,
          through the use of “overlord” and, “sufferance of Arab authority”;
          In contrast, Source B highlights the advantages offered to the ruled by the new rulers,
          and spells out their gratifying clauses. Only at the end of the pledge, as if to minimize
          its effects, does the sting of the jyzia appear.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are
     discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum
     [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.
                                               –5–              N10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source D for historians studying Umar’s administration of
     the Arab Empire.                                                                        [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        An extract of a historical study (2006) exploring and accounting for the
                    rapports between Islam and Christianity in the medieval Mediterranean world.
                    Stephen O’Shea is a journalist.

     Purpose:       To present an important episode of one of the first encounters between Islam
                    and Christianity. The setting is Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both
                    religions. Each of the actors represents his faith. The action depicts the
                    surrender of the Christian city to the Caliph, by its highest religious authority,
                    Patriarch Sophronius.

     Value:         This is a lively modern Western rendering of the surrender of Christian
                    Jerusalem to Caliph Umar, Islam’s head of state. The journalistic background
                    of the author results in a great readability of the text. The characters are
                    humanlike; the narrative is enlivened by the depiction of certain details in the
                    appearance and state of mind of each character. The basic historical facts are
                    in accordance with other sources.

     Limitations:   Written in the aftermath of 9/11, and broaching the present issue of the strained
                    relations between Islam and the West, the book, in this extract goes back to the
                    beginning of the relationship between Christianity and Islam. The voice of the
                    author, with a veiled Western bias is detected in the ironical rendering of
                    Umar’s entrance in the city; of Umar’s speech, rebuking the Patriarch’s
                    invitation to enter the church; in the author’s reporting on the new status of the
                    People of the Book; and in his denunciation of the jyzia.

     Source D
     Origin:        This is an extract from The Origins of the Islamic State, a medieval Arabic
                    chronicle, Kitab Futuh al-Buldan written some two hundred years after the
                    events, by the Muslim chronicler Ahmad ibn Jabir al-Baladhuri.

     Purpose:       To report on the origins of the Islamic state, through the narration of the
                    exemplary protest of the inhabitants of Hims – Christians and Jews –
                    when the Arabs, on the eve of the decisive Arab victory of Yarmuk decided to
                    abandon them to their prior Byzantine yoke; but not before they restored to
                    them the kharaj that they had levied, as they could not protect them anymore.

     Value:         An account from a medieval Arab historian, built on the Islamic methodology
                    of isnad, which usually relies on scrupulously established chains of
                    testimonies, going up to the time of the event. The document could be
                    considered a primary source, thus acquiring some authority. Also the
                    opposition of the provinces to the Byzantine rule, whether for religious or
                    cultural reasons, is generally acknowledged by a variety of other sources.
                                         –6–             N10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Limitations:   As the writer is a Muslim chronicler, who is not himself a contemporary of the
               Arab conquests, his account could be tainted with partisanship, and a bias in
               favour of Islam and the Arabs. There is too much praising of the Muslim
               warriors who too readily handed back the kharaj (in contrast, see the
               preventive measures taken by Caliph Umar, in Source C to avoid expected
               “lawless extortion” from warriors). On the other hand, the oaths of allegiance
               of the Christians and the Jews are too exaggerated, coming from subdued
               people, as well as the atmosphere of “singing and playing” surrounding the
               repayment of the kharaj.

Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance
between the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a
[4/2 mark] split. If only one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum
[6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.
                                                –7–              N10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, assess Caliph Umar’s
     administration of the conquered provinces.                                           [8 marks]

      Source material that could be used:
      Source A: The surrender of Jerusalem to Caliph Umar in person (because of his reputation
                of fairness and his sense of honour). The dhimmis status (second-class citizens).
                The payment of the jyzia for the freedom of worship. Umar’s refusal to step in
                the church of the Holy Sepulchre, for fear that it would be claimed later as
                Muslim property (protection of the People of the Book’s places of worship).

      Source B:   The candidates should discuss all the clauses stated in this extract of Umar’s
                  Covenant. They should note the religious/moral tone of the Covenant with the
                  Peoples of the Book.

      Source C: The candidates should infer the purpose of Umar’s ordinances and their value, as
                in the fiscal regulations of kharaj and jyzia. Also the candidates should note
                Umar’s consolidation of the State Treasury, as well as the creation of separate
                military encampments and its rationale. They should point to the creative
                solution of the fay and the exemption of the dhimmis from military service and
                the justification for this.

      Source D: The dissatisfaction of the Syrian cities with the Byzantine oppressive rule.
                The acceptance – if not the welcoming – of the Muslims as overlords in
                replacement of Byzantine tyranny.

      Source E:   The mosque of Umar erected in remembrance of the historical trip of Caliph
                  Umar to Jerusalem, at the invitation of Patriarch Sophronius is not replacing the
                  Holy Sepulchre Church, but neighbouring it. It attests to the peaceful
                  cohabitation of the two religions during the Islamic Empire.

      Own knowledge:
      Own knowledge could include more details on Umar’s administration of the ever-
      expanding Empire, like the diwan, its definition, its purpose and its short-term and
      long-term effects. Also, more details on the establishment of the amsars and Umar’s
      objective; what was expected from the governors. Some mention should also be made of the
      shura council nominated by Umar on his deathbed. A conclusion could assess Umar’s rule,
      taking into account his strong personality, his piety, his sense of justice, his strictness, even
      harshness when it comes to applying justice, and his high moral standards.

      Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only
      own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks].
      For maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge,
      as well as references to the sources used.

                                             SECTION B

Prescribed subject 2           The kingdom of Sicily (1130–1302)

These questions relate to the reign of King William II of Sicily.

1.    (a)     According to Source B, why was William II a good king?                     [3 marks]

      The first mark should be awarded for identifying his strength and power. The second mark
      should be awarded for identifying that he protected the weak. The final mark should be
      awarded for identifying that he upheld the law.

            He was unequalled among other kings;
            He was wealthy, strong and intelligent;
            He protected his subjects.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


      (b) What message about William II is conveyed by Source E?                         [2 marks]

      Marks may be awarded for any of the following inferences:
        the source shows that William II commissioned fine buildings;
        it shows that William II was devoted to the Virgin Mary because he is shown presenting
         the cathedral to her;
        it shows that he was a patron of the arts.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to [2 marks].

      Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
      final mark out of [5 marks].
                                            –9–             N10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and D about the
     qualities of William II as King of Sicily.                                        [6 marks]

     For “compare”
       Both sources refer to William II’s wars: Source D states that the attack on the
       Greek Empire failed, agreeing with the criticism of William II in Source C;
       Both sources refer to the marriage of Constance to Henry, heir to the German Empire.

     For “contrast”
       Source C states that William II’s foreign policy was “dangerous and irresponsible”, while
       Source D states that it was “increasingly ambitious”;
       Source C states that his enterprises “brought him nothing but defeat and humiliation”;
       Source C refers to the marriage of Constance and Henry of Germany as a “disastrous
       decision”, whereas Source D states that it was a sign of Sicily’s “high status”;
       Source D refers to William’s peace treaty with the German Empire in 1177;
       Source D refers to his leadership of Christendom and his support for the Crusades.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are
     discussed separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum
     [6 marks] expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origins and purpose, discuss the value and
     limitations of Source A and Source B for historians studying William II’s
     reputation as king.                                                                  [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:         A letter written in the early 1170s by a man who had served William II.

     Purpose:        To complain about William II’s conduct towards the Church.

     Value:          A contemporary account by a man who knew William personally and who
                     had worked for him.

     Limitations:    This is a source by a man with a personal grudge against William II, who
                     took the Church’s side of the argument.

     Source B
     Origin:         An early thirteenth century chronicle written at Monte Cassino in Italy.

     Purpose:        To compile a record of the main political events of the age.

     Value:          A near-contemporary chronicle that gives an Italian perspective of the reign
                     of William II.

     Limitations:    This is an Italian source that looks favourably on the reign William II,
                     and praises him in extravagant terms.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance
     between the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a
     [4/2 mark] split. If only one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum
     [6 marks] candidates must refer to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.
                                             – 11 –          N10/3/HISTI/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the statement in
     Source B that William II was “the flower of kings”.                                  [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A: States that William II mistreated the Church by taking its possessions.
               He also followed the advice of sinners. Furthermore, Source A predicts that God
               will be angry with William II.

     Source B: States that William II had excellent qualities as a king: intelligence, power,
               wealth, care for the poor and vulnerable, commitment to the law, and that he
               compared well with other rulers.

     Source C: Emphasizes the failures of William II’s foreign policy. His defeats were
               humiliating, he wasted money, and he did not lead his armies in person.
               He can also be blamed for the marriage of Constance to Henry of Germany.

     Source D: Emphasizes the successes of William II’s foreign policy. He made peace with the
               German Empire in 1177. His attack on the Greek Empire and his support for the
               Crusade showed that he was one of the leaders of Western Christendom.
               The marriages of William II to Joanna, daughter of Henry II of England, and of
               Constance to Henry of Germany, shows that other rulers wanted to make
               alliances with Sicily.

     Source E: Shows that William II was a major patron of building, religion and the arts.

     Own knowledge:
     Royal government was intensive during William II’s reign and the master-justiciars, such as
     Tancred of Lecce and Robert of Caserta, enforced the King’s rule. The barons and
     churchmen looked to royal justice to solve their disputes. William II ordered the building of
     Monreale Cathedral in 1174, at enormous expense. Its mosaics were one of the great artistic
     achievements of the century. William II was involved in the Crusades and in 1174 he sent
     his navy and army to Alexandria, but failed to capture the city, and suffered a major defeat.
     The Sicilian navy attacked Muslim lands in North Africa on several occasions.

     Sicily was attacked by Emperor Frederick I between 1167 and 1177, and again between 1174
     and 1176, but this ended with a peace negotiated in 1177. William II also made treaties with
     Genoa and Venice in 1174 and 1175. In 1185, Sicily attacked the Byzantine Empire and
     although they captured Salonika, they were defeated repeatedly on land and at sea, and lost
     many soldiers and ships. The war lasted for two years but ended in total failure for Sicily.

     Between 1187 and 1188 William II was planning again to send forces to the Holy Land to
     fight Salah al-Din (Saladin), but this was prevented by his death in 1189.

     Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or
     only own knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For
     maximum [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as
     well as references to the sources used.
