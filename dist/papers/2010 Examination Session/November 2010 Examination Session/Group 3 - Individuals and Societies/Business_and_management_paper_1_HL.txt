Answer two questions from this section.

1.    (a)   N-Pharma is now a successful business, but it initially struggled: “poor cash
            flow meant that the early years were financially challenging” (lines 6–7).
            Outline two problems that Yukio Nakamura’s business start-up may have faced.       [4 marks]

      (b)   Construct a fully labelled Ansoff matrix to show N-Pharma’s possible
            growth strategies.                                                                 [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the value of “social and environmental audits” (line 107) to
            N-Pharma.                                                                          [7 marks]


2.    (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    span of control (line 60)                                                   [2 marks]

		          (ii)   empowerment (line 64).                                                      [2 marks]

      (b)   Comment on the effectiveness of Susan James’ leadership style in the
            Canadian subsidiary of N-Pharma.                                                   [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the appropriateness of a cost-based pricing strategy (line 29) for
            N-Pharma’s drugs.                                                                  [7 marks]


3.    (a)   Tadashi Agi has been appointed to the new post of “director of corporate
            social responsibility” (line 101). Outline two methods of recruitment that
            could have been used in this appointment.                                          [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain how Tadashi Agi could use new technologies within N-Pharma to
            communicate his ethical vision effectively with stakeholders (lines 105–106).      [4 marks]

      (c)   Tadashi Agi is now writing a “Charter of Ethics”, setting ethical objectives for
            N-Pharma (lines 102–103). Examine the reasons why organizations consider
            setting ethical objectives.                                                        [7 marks]

                                             SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.    At their last meeting, the board of directors of N-Pharma decided that expansion outside Japan
      is essential. The Japanese pharmaceutical market has decreased over the last year. The recession
      is affecting incomes and spending patterns. Consequently drug prices in Japan are falling.

      The directors are divided about the expansion. Some support market development in Europe
      (Option 1) and others prefer market penetration within China (Option 2).

      The financial director and the director of corporate and social responsibility (CSR) favour market
      development in Europe through the acquisition of several small pharmaceutical companies
      (Option 1(b)), despite the European Union (EU) Commission having strict legislation on
      takeovers and mergers. They believe that strict quality controls in Europe will enable N-Pharma
      to establish brand loyalty. Competition from cheaper substitute drugs is of a lesser problem in the
      European market. The greater availability of well-qualified staff and the well-established
      distribution channels will reduce the time for product development by two years compared to an
      equivalent operation in an emerging market. The director of CSR argues passionately that locating
      N-Pharma in the European market will also ensure that N-Pharma’s products are manufactured
      and distributed to the highest ethical standards.

      The marketing manager supports the expansion in Beijing, China (Option 2). He reports high
      forecasted growth in emerging countries (Item 1). He said: “we’ve got to be in these markets,
      it’s a great opportunity”. He backs up his view with reference to reports by the business
      consultancy firms McKinsey & Company (Item 1) and IMS (Item 2). McKinsey & Company estimates
      that the value of the Chinese pharmaceutical market will grow from US$15 billion in 2010 to
      US$35 billion in 2015. The marketing manager argues that the growth in sales of generic drugs
      will continue as the recession develops (Items 2 and 3) and that competition will require N-Pharma
      to significantly reduce its costs.

      Either expansion option will require some senior and middle managers to relocate to Europe
      or China. The human resources manager knows that some employees have mixed feelings about
      relocating and may resist a move.



                                                          (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 5 continued)

      (a)   Identify two secondary sources of market research that the marketing manager
            could use to understand the Chinese pharmaceutical market.                       [2 marks]

      (b)   With reference to Lewin’s force field analysis model, explain why “some
            employees have mixed feelings about relocating and may resist a move”
            while others may be keen to relocate.                                            [7 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the European market and the Chinese market using a PEST analysis
            framework.                                                                       [9 marks]

      (d)   Applying your PEST analysis and using information contained in the case study
            and Items 1 to 4, recommend to the board of directors whether N-Pharma
            should develop the market within Europe through the acquisition of several
            small pharmaceutical companies (Option 1(b)), or penetrate the market within
            China (Option 2).                                                               [12 marks]

 Item 2: IMS consultancy report
 IMS, a consultancy firm in the pharmaceutical industry, forecasts that sales of drugs in the world’s
 emerging markets (such as Russia, China and India) will reach US$300 billion by 2017. This is the
 equivalent of today’s sales in the European market and the US market combined. Sales of generic drugs
 are set to increase dramatically. Quality standards will improve as firms invest in new technologies.

 The top eight markets (the USA, Germany, France, the United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Italy, Spain and
 Japan) today account for 84 % of total generic drug sales. Research and development (R&D) costs are
 set to rise further as stricter drug legislation is adopted by the European Union Commission.


 Item 3: Market investment summary
 European Market: Investment advice:
 				                Sell shares 2009–2010
 				                Keep shares 2010–2012
 				                Buy shares  2012–2015

 “European markets are predicted to be badly affected by recessionary pressures until early 2011.
 Unemployment levels will continue to rise until the end of 2011. Firms will be looking to cut costs by
 increasing use of new technologies. Governments will come under increasing pressure and many will
 face elections. Extreme political pressures and social instability will negatively affect business markets.
 Concern about unemployment in domestic markets will lower demand for imports.”

 Chinese Market:             Investment advice:
 				                        Keep shares 2009–2010
 				                        Buy shares   2010–2015

 “The Chinese market is less affected by recessionary pressures than European and US markets.
 Rural unemployment levels will continue to rise until early 2011 as exports to overseas markets fall.
 As Chinese production tends to be labour intensive, firms will be looking to cut costs by reducing wages.
 Markets will remain highly state controlled, but World Trade Organization (WTO) membership will
 require the opening of domestic markets to foreign competition.”
