      Answers may include:
      Arguments in favour of subsidizing:

        food security for a country in a crisis.

      Arguments against subsidizing:
        misallocation of resources
        hidden costs/opportunity costs of funds that could be used for public
        services
        damage to foreign farmers/unfair protectionism
