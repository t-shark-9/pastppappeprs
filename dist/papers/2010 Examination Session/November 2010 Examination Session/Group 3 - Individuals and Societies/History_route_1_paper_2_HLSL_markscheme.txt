about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

  0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
  1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
  4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are
         mainly inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are
         barely understood and there is minimal focus on the task.
  6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
         limited in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will
         understanding of historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only
         partially addressed.
  8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is
         present but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive
         in nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation.
         Critical commentary may be present. There is an attempt to place events in
         historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at
         a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
  10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are
         considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present.
         Events are generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes,
         such as comparison and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different
         approaches and interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical
         knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
  13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
         applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
         produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
         understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
         different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.
  16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of
         the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is
         used as evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as
         comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
         interpretations are used appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1   Dynasties and rulers

1.   Explain how one ruler from either medieval Europe or the Islamic world established and
     maintained their power in the period up to 1000.

     This question requires that candidates know the most important methods or reasons by which some
     individuals emerged as the leaders of their societies. In addition, they should know how these
     individuals sought to maintain their authority.

     Methods used to establish power might include but not be limited to:
       early kings were the leaders of barbarian tribes who used the word “king” to denote the leader;
       they often inherited their status;
       other kings emerged as a result of being appointed the war leader of their tribe or clan e.g. the
       Franks and Anglo-Saxons;
       this was particularly the case in nomadic tribes where war was a constant feature of life;
       the breakdown of the Roman Empire and the resulting chaos meant war leaders were able to gain
       more power and influence.

     To maintain power, the methods might include:
       rewarding warriors with money or land to maintain their loyalty;
       militarizing society where warriors were glorified in popular culture gave power and prestige to
       the king and his supporters;
       maintaining the principle of hereditary class structure to maintain power in the hands of the
       aristocracy and royal family;
       the ruler established the requirement of service from the aristocrats in exchange for land;
       the ruler obtained considerable wealth and land to maintain his power;
       the ruler used religious symbols to bolster his prestige and authority – these would include
       elaborate coronation ceremonies;
       rebellion could be seen as a violation of religious beliefs;
       Christian missionaries supported the authority of kings in medieval Europe in order to gain
       support for the conversion of society;
       the ruler had spiritual as well as temporal power – through the swearing of oaths of loyalty which
       were religious in nature;
       the ruler established himself as a lawgiver and judge as another means of controlling society;
       the ruler might also use bureaucrats and other royal servants to supervise and report on activities
       in the kingdom;
       the ruler minted coins to denote and reinforce his authority;
       the ruler used his taxing powers to pay for his administrations and to assert his power over others
       by forcing them to pay licence fees, and a range of duties and imposts in order to maintain their
       positions.

2.   “Eleanor of Aquitaine was one of the most influential individuals of twelfth century Europe.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This question involves an examination of Eleanor of Aquitaine‟s role as a ruler in her own right, as
     a strong supporter of the arts and culture as well as a strong political influence in both the French
     and English kingdoms as queen. It also relates to her role as a woman who struggled for
     independence, power and recognition in her own right – and the impact her actions had on the status
     of women.

          Her travels on the Crusades and in the interests of her dynasty and power were unequalled by
          any woman of the time and by very few men;
          Her influence in the twelfth century stems first from her position as ruler of the Duchy of
          Aquitaine – a very large and prosperous region in southwestern France;
          She was one of very few women who ruled territory in the medieval period;
          She was a lifelong patron of the arts and did much to spread music, dancing and the arts of the
          troubadours and the poems of courtly love through the courts of France and England;
          She became Queen of France at age 16 but remained a ruler of her territories;
          At the age of 19, she took the Cross and embarked with her husband on the Second Crusade.
          She dressed in armour and carried a lance – a revolutionary act for a woman at this time;
          Her presence brought thousands more to join the Second Crusade;
          Eleanor divorced her husband – a rarity at the time and remarried another king, Henry II
          of England;
          In conjunction with Henry she helped build the Angevin Empire;
          She also led a revolt against her husband, Henry II, in order to gain greater independence and
          power – this failed and she was imprisoned;
          She was the mother of two kings of England;
          During Richard I‟s reign she displayed great political skill in defending his territory while he
          was on the Third Crusade and in ransoming him when he was captured on the way home;
          She was a constant traveller at a time when travel was very difficult and dangerous;
          She traversed Europe regularly in the interest of her family, arranging marriages and
          managing her estates;
          She was an extraordinary individual who had connections to many royal families and whose
          energy and determination were equalled by few.

3.   By what methods, and with what results, did William I Duke of Normandy (King of England
     1066–1087), establish and increase his power in England?

     The response must include both methods and results.

     The methods may include but not be limited to:
       he gave extensive lands to his supporters to maintain their loyalty;
       he built numerous castles in key locations to control the country and population;
       he brutally suppressed the rebellion in the North of England – exterminated all opposition;
       he married his sister to the King of Scotland to gain his loyalty;
       replaced all the Anglo-Saxon nobles with Normans;
       all nobles held their land on strict terms from the king alone;
       maintained the office of Sheriff to assert royal control in all counties;
       as king, he retained large landholdings in all parts of the country;
       he controlled the Church, appointed all bishops and other administrators;
       established the rule that all men must answer the king‟s questions on their oath;
       he created the Domesday Book – designed to determine the tax base to support the king‟s power;
       he made all landowners swear a personal oath of loyalty to him.

     The results may include but not be limited to:
       William maintained strong central control over the barons as opposed to the kings of France who
       had little control;
       William became an absolute monarch – unusual in feudal period;
       strong kings became the rule not the exception in England;
       royal legislation was applied everywhere – giving the king great influence;
       reinforced his power by his control; of all major appointments in the Church;
       he gave England permanent unity and increased its power;
       maintained law and order and prevented internal conflicts better than was the case in
       other countries;
       England benefited economically and socially from a stronger central government.

4.   Analyse the successes and failures of either one medieval European ruler or one Islamic ruler.

     Candidates will have a wide choice of rulers from the European or Islamic worlds.

     Candidates must analyse both the successes and failures of their chosen rulers.

     Areas to consider when assessing success and failure may include but not be limited to: military
     wars, invasions, internal strife, economic development, legal codes and justice systems,
     maintenance of internal peace, education, arts and culture, peaceful dynastic succession, relations
     with Church or clergy, expansion of central authority.


5.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the collapse of two Islamic dynasties.

     There a number of factors which led to the collapse of various Islamic dynasties. These may
     include but not be limited to:
        sectarian religious disputes which led to the rise of rival factions who organized revolts and
        divided the Empire;
        tribal rivalries that led to disputes and conflict over leadership;
        ambitious individuals seeking power and territory who challenged the leadership of the dynasty;
        disputes within ruling families which weakened and divided the leadership;
        the size of the empires which led to difficulty in controlling all areas and led to the rise of
        regional challengers and separatist movements;
        a tradition of palace or military coups which led to the death and overthrow of various leaders;
        attacks by hostile forces, e.g. Byzantines, Christians in Spain and the Middle East;
        weak Caliphs who were controlled by officials or the generals.

     If only one dynasty is addressed, the highest mark that can be obtained is [7 marks].

6.   In what ways, and with what results, did „Abd al-Malik (685–705) become a powerful ruler?

     The ways may include but not be limited to:
       he maintained good relations with religious groups in Medina who had considerable influence;
       he was regarded as more pious than his predecessors which gained him great support with
       religious leaders;
       he was a clever politician who took advantage of disputes between his opponents to defeat them;
       his methods to overcome opponents were a combination of force and bribery;
       he employed and supported capable generals such as al-Hajjaj ibn Yusef who retook Mecca. He
       appointed him as governor of Iraq where he used harsh methods to quell disturbances and
       rebellions;
       when the rebels became more powerful al-Malik reinforced his generals with his elite Syrian
       troops;
       similarly he employed skillful generals who conquered North Africa;
       al-Malik ensured that they received adequate troops and reinforcements to ensure their success;
       his reforms also increased his power and popularity with the majority of the population.

     The results may include but not be limited to:
       reasserted control over the Umayyad Empire including the retaking of Mecca and the
       pacification of Iraq;
       expanded eastward into Turkestan and westward to conquer all of North Africa;
       “Arabized” and centralized the state administration creating a new class of Imperial bureaucrats;
       Arabic became the official language of the Empire;
       Arabic language sciences and Arab literature were developed;
       increased sponsorship of public art with Islamic themes;
       issued the first coinage for the Muslim world;
       expanded and improved the postal service;
       collected a body of hadith which became a cornerstone of Islamic scholarship;
       built the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

     Candidates could challenge the question by pointing out that these policies did not ensure the
     survival of the Umayyad dynasty which was overthrown in 750.

Topic 2   Society and economy

7.   Examine the origin and development of the manorial system in medieval Europe.

     A response to this question may note that the manorial system did not apply universally in Europe.
     There were considerable differences between Northern and Southern Europe as well as within
     specific countries or regions. Candidates may write about what is considered the typical manorial
     system, but others may note that it is difficult to make generalizations and demonstrate a different
     type of development.

     The development or origins of the manorial system may include but not be limited to:
       origins of the manorial system in the latifundia of the Roman Empire or the class system of the
       Germans in which warriors dominated the agricultural classes;
       land was divided by the king or ruler and given to supporters who had to provide military and
       other services. Landholders recruited peasants to work the land in exchange for services;
       agriculture was the main economic activity. As the overlord or king controlled nearly all the
       land at the outset, individuals had to submit to receive a land grant or fief;
       land had been worked by slaves, but eventually slavery disappeared and many slaves become
       serfs – a semi-free state;
       other peasants gave up freedom and became serfs as a result of needing protection from the lord
       in violent times.

     Characteristics of the traditional manorial system may include but not be limited to:
       the manorial system was one where the peasant classes laboured for a landholder (feudal lord,
       knight, etc.) in return for a piece of land of their own;
       the manor consisted of land held by the lord and the remainder was held by peasants who paid
       rent in kind to the lord and also provided him with labour services on his land;
       peasants were divided into different classes, but all owed labour service according to customary
       schedules;
       payments in kind were either fixed amounts or a percentage of yield;
       peasants or serfs were not free in that they were bound to the manor, as were their children,
       unless freed by the lord;
       peasants were subject to a great variety of additional dues and levies such as merchet, heriot,
       relief, tithes for the church, etc.;
       the lord also controlled the local courts where serfs had to pay fines or fees;
       serfs also had to pay to use public utilities, mill, oven, wine press, etc. In return peasants
       received houses, land, buildings and a share of the common fields for livestock.

8.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the establishment and importance of two cities in the
     Islamic world.

     There were many reasons for the establishment and development of towns and cities in the Islamic
     world. These were associated with the geographical, religious and government centres as well as
     the revival of trade and a growing demand for products from other areas. Also strategic locations
     often led to the establishment of towns and cities.

     Specific details will depend on the cities chosen, but some points to consider are:
       building a mosque concentrated large numbers of individuals in a specific area. Their
       requirements for food, shelter and other necessities attracted craftsmen, labourers, etc. who took
       up permanent residence;
       the revival of trade and industry led merchants and craftsmen to locate themselves in specific
       locations where they could practice their occupations;
       certain industries such as metallurgy and textiles and mining required a concentration of workers
       in a single location – from these industries, populations expanded;
       areas with poor soil had to take up industrial and commercial occupations in order to survive,
       which led to the growth of towns and cities;
       growing commerce led to the development of commercial centres;
       in the Islamic world, many cities existed prior to the arrival of Islam and the Islamic Empire.
       Many of these cities continued in the Islamic era and often increased in size and importance;
       cities associated with pilgrimage or Islamic centres of learning were founded and developed.

     The reasons for the further growth or creation of these cities could include:
       they became administrative centres with large populations of officials, soldiers and all necessary
       supporting populations;
       they became important commercial centres for trade from the eastern and western parts of the
       Islamic world;
       the size of the Islamic world encouraged trade both within the Empire and with areas outside
       which desired the products of the Islamic world – often luxury goods;
       cities were important industrial centres providing a wide range of goods to the hinterland of the
       city and for long-distance trade;
       effective communications and transportation systems that were developed by sea and land
       throughout the Islamic world aided in the growth of cities as commercial and industrial centres
       with large populations;
       the development of sophisticated and productive agricultural systems with irrigation works, etc.
       in much of the Islamic world provided the necessary food surplus to maintain and expand city
       populations;
       the status awarded to cities and their ruling elites was a major factor in their growth and
       development;
       important centres of learning culture and scholarship attracted large numbers of students,
       teachers and intellectuals to the mosques, schools and universities;
       Islamic pilgrimage required the development of trades and services to meet the needs of pilgrims;
       some Islamic cities were the largest in the world and the greatest centres of culture and riches.

     Candidates will probably select two cities from those named in the guide: Damascus; Baghdad;
     Cairo; Cordoba.

     If only one city is addressed, the highest mark that can be obtained is [7 marks].

9.    In what ways did religious institutions contribute to the medieval European economy?

      Religious institutions, which could include, monasteries, convents, schools, cathedrals and churches
      were a powerful source of economic development in Europe. Answers may refer to one or more of
      the above.

      Their contributions and influence could include:
        the building of cathedrals was a major industrial enterprise which employed thousands of
        workers and required the development of skilled trades and markets for building materials. This
        was also true for the construction of churches, abbeys, monasteries and other religious structures;
        the Church was the source of education which taught necessary skills in literacy and numeracy
        but also preserved and passed on critical knowledge in agriculture and manufacturing from the
        ancient world;
        the monasteries became exemplars of agriculture and industry where knowledge was developed
        and passed on. The Cistercians would be a key example but there were many others;
        the wealth of the Church provided a market for commercial trade and cathedral towns became
        large urban cities where business, trade and industry developed;
        the Church inspired Crusades which led to a vast increase in trade and economic activity in the
        Mediterranean and the East;
        the establishment of legal systems, often with the Church‟s influence, made life easier for
        merchants and businessmen to operate.


10.   Analyse life and work in (a) an urban environment, and (b) a village, in either medieval
      Europe or the Islamic world.

      For part a, life and work in an urban environment, candidates could indicate and analyse dwelling
      places and the difference between those of the rich and poor; household goods; public buildings,
      including religious buildings; markets; town or city fortifications; physical features such as ports;
      roads and transport. Candidates should also analyse urban occupations, such as crafts, trade and
      shops, also occupations such as lawyers, doctors and barbers.

      For part b, life in the country should be analysed. Dwelling places at least in medieval Europe were
      often shared with animals, and more of a primitive construction. The difference and importance of
      seasonal work could be considered, as well as methods of transport, clothing, visits to the nearest
      market and the importance of manorial lord, parish church or mosques, where appropriate.

      Divide marks for (a) and (b) where appropriate to [12/8 marks], [10/10 marks] or [8/12 marks], or
      mark as a whole if they are written as one essay.

      If only (a) or (b) is addressed, the highest mark that can be obtained is [12 marks].

11.   Identify and explain the significance of the components of a model Islamic city.

      Candidates should be able to identify the key as components of a typical Islamic city correctly and
      should be able to comment on their relative functions and importance.

      Cities had commercial, industrial, educational, administrative and judicial functions.

      In the heart of the city or madina there were two types of building complexes:
         the first was the main congregational mosque for meeting, study and prayer – associated with
         this would be the court of the chief qadi, schools of higher learning, and booksellers;
         the second was the central marketplace or suq – the main centre of trade where all the merchants,
         money-changers, warehouses and offices would be located in a tightly knit quadrilateral of
         streets – divided according to product or industry;
         a third group of buildings would house watchmen, supervisors of the market and the police;
         the population would live in residential quarters with gates that were closed and guarded at night
         – each quarter would have a local mosque and marketplace and perhaps a public bath which
         served as a meeting place. The quarter was the property of its residents and was a tightly knit
         neighbourhood which maintained its privacy;
         inhabitants of quarters were usually linked by some common factor – religion, kinship, ethnicity
         or marriage. This created a strong identity and solidarity in each quarter;
         Christians and Jews had their own quarters often subdivided by region or ethnicity;
         the poorer populations lived furthest from the centres. These were also areas where caravans
         were organized and where offensive industrial work such as tanning and butchering took place;
         wealthy people might live in the quarters but many lived on larger estates outside the city;
         the mosque and suq radiated cultural and economic power but government was not always
         present in the city;
         some royal palaces and seats of government were built outside cities; others were in cities, often
         in the citadel for security reasons;
         the palace would contain residences, offices, the mint, barracks and workshops for weapons and
         luxury goods.

      Some of the material above could be relevant for questions 8 or 10, but as candidates may only
      answer one question from each topic, overlap is not a problem.

12.   Assess the impact of two of the following on trade in either medieval Europe or the Islamic world
      in the period you have studied: merchants; currency and exchange; transport; industry.

      The revival of trade was one of the factors that led to greater wealth, urbanization and interaction
      between medieval Europe and the Islamic world. It was a major force in the evolution and
      development of a modern as opposed to a feudal society.

      The impact of each of these elements on trade may include but not be limited to:

      Merchants
        They evolved because of a demand for products from one area in another, such as luxury goods
        for kings, churchmen;
        The emergence of merchants expanded trade as they sought more goods to sell, funded industry
        and transportation and pushed for improved laws and financial institutions to make trade easier;
        Merchants saw the opportunities presented by events such as the Crusades and worked to expand
        contact and exchange for their own profit;
        Their entrepreneurial spirit and the investment of their profits underlay much of the trade
        expansion of the Middle Ages.

      Currency and exchange
        The medieval period lacked reliable currency – which was major hindrance to trade and
        exchange;
        There was also no secure way to make payments to someone in another country;
        In order to ease trade and exchange, a system of payment without transferring precious metal or
        coins was required;
        Medieval trade was expanded by the development of: clearing houses where debts could be
        settled between merchants at a trade fair; banks in which deposits could be made and checks
        written to settle debts;
        The development of bills of exchange or drafts which could be used to pay debts in other
        countries;
        These made the buying and selling of goods much easier as cash did not have to be transported
        and professional bankers could act as clearing houses for debts and as sources of credit. This
        facilitated international trade;
        Monasteries and other religious institutions helped in the transfer of money and credit.

      Transport
        Development of the sea routes and cargo vessels, ports and navigation systems by organizations
        such as the Hanseatic League greatly expanded medieval trade in Northern Europe, Britain and
        Scandinavia;
        A gradual improvement in roads aided communication and movement of goods as did the
        improvement of river transportation and the use of canals although these could be interrupted by
        war and local lords;
        The growth of sea traffic in the Mediterranean to the Middle East and Byzantium helped to
        increase trade and contracts between Europe and the Islamic world. The Italian cities dominated
        trade in the eastern Mediterranean;
        The development of the sea route from Flanders to Italy opened up new markets for the goods of
        each area and greatly expanded trade.

Industry
  The development of larger industries expanded trade, as in raw materials were brought from a
  distance and finished products were sold in distant markets;
  Key examples are: the textile industry of the Low Countries; the silk industry in Italy; Murano
  glass in Venice; elaborate fabrics and tapestries in Florence;
  Their products were sold everywhere from Scandinavia to the Middle East and Byzantium;
  All of this contributed to the growth of towns, shipping, the merchant class and the urban
  craftsmen. This in turn increased markets for an even wider range of products;
  Luxury goods from the Islamic world, including Andalusia, such as gold, jewellery, paper and
  exotic fruit.

If only one is addressed, the highest mark that can be obtained is [12 marks].

Topic 3    Wars and warfare

13.   Explain how the development of warfare in Europe both increased and decreased the power
      of the medieval knight in the period you have studied.

      This question requires knowledge of the effects and evolution of military technology in the
      medieval period.

      Candidates should be able to identify and explain how changes in weapons and armour at the
      beginning of the medieval period increased the military power of the knight. They should then be
      able to show how these changes began to limit or destroy that power.

      The knights‟ power was increased by:
        stirrups, high-backed saddles which kept them firmly mounted and the breeding of large horses
        to carry armoured men;
        more sophisticated armour that protected them;
        lances and broadswords which gave them striking power;
        in addition, fortification techniques produced stronger castles as bases for knights which
        dominated the countryside.

      The later changes which limited the knights‟ power:
        missile weapons: crossbows and longbows which enabled foot soldiers (infantry) to kill mounted
        knights;
        development of siege engines to use against fortifications;
        gunpowder which was used to destroy castles and in missile weapons;
        Swiss pikes which made infantry immune from cavalry charges.

14.   Evaluate the success of either Khalid ibn al-Walid or Richard I as a military leader.

      Candidates should examine the careers of either Khalid ibn al-Walid or Richard I in order to assess
      how successful they were in their military ventures during their entire careers.

      Khalid ibn al-Walid
        His very successful career covers a number of wars and regions;
        His career began as an opponent of Muhammad – he defeated Muslim forces at the Battle of
        Uhud;
        He converted to Islam;
        He took a key role in the Ridda Wars (Wars of Apostasy) (632–633) and in the wars of Islamic
        expansion where he defeated the Byzantine forces and conquered Syria;
        His campaigns against the Persian Empire – conquest of Iraq were successful;
        He was dismissed from office but continued to exercise important influence in military matters
        and aid the further expansion of Islam in the Middle East; Jerusalem was captured;
        The Wars of Expansion were continued into Anatolia 638–639.

      Richard I
      Richard I was born in 1157 and was King of England between 1189 and 1199. His career has a
      variety of aspects which may be assessed including the following:
         his wars of rebellion against his father, Henry II;
         the Third Crusade, in which he took Messina in 1190, and Acre and Cyprus in 1191;
         his wars to maintain and control Angevin lands in France;
         he fought Philip II of France and was killed while besieging Chalus;
         he advanced to within sight of Jerusalem, but failed to take it. He was then taken prisoner, and
         remained in the captivity of Henry VI until 1194;
         England was neglected and heavily taxed for his war.

15.   Assess the causes of either the Hundred Years War or the first fitna of Islam.

      The Hundred Years War
      Candidates should be aware of both the long-term and short-term causes.

      Long-term causes could include:
        continuing friction between England and France due to the King of England possessing
        substantial territory in France which the French kings wished to capture and control;
        Edward III of England claimed that he was the rightful king of France and tried to assert this
        claim in 1337;
        Edward was also defending his territory in Bordeaux which was the source of much of his income;
        Philip VI of France was providing support to the Scots who were at war with England;
        French ships attacked English ships and towns;
        Edward III was an ambitious king determined to expand his authority and gain military glory.

      Short-term causes could include:
        Philip VI attacked English possession in France 1337;
        French built up a fleet to invade England which led to the Battle of Sluys 1340;
        Edward III determined to defeat France and claim his inheritance or at least to protect his rich
        French territory.

      First fitna of Islam
      The first fitna occurred in 656 CE and lasted until 661 CE. The fitna was a civil war or a struggle
      leading to a schism.

      Causes of the first fitna could include:
        the unpopularity of the third Caliph, Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) as a result of nepotism and
        corruption in government and changes in the administration of the Islamic Empire which caused
        regional revolts;
        Uthman was assassinated;
        battles broke out over what should be done with the assassins and whether the assassination was
        justified;
        the succession of Ali ibn Abi Talib (650–661) was opposed by various groups who accused Ali
        of complicity in the murder or refused to recognize his right to succeed – this led to a series
        of battles;
        religious difference led to the revolt of the Kharijite faction;
        differences over the succession between different members of the family of Muhammad;
        the size of the Islamic Empire also led to rivalries as to who should control it and how it should
        be governed.

16.   Discuss the social and economic effects of the Crusades on either medieval Europe or the
      Islamic world.

      The most significant results of the Crusades in the Islamic world were in the political and dynastic
      areas, but there were significant social and economic effects that can be discussed.

      Medieval Europe
        Landless knights, second sons, etc. were given an outlet for their energy and ambitions;
        Increase and change in fighting methods which affected society;
        Trade and types of goods increased;
        Financial drain on Christian states, e.g. England and France;
        Religion‟s effects on society: enthusiasm for crusading;
        Knowledge, both of the ancient world, and of the East, was transmitted to Europe;
        Medicine – Arab knowledge was more advanced;
        The Crusades gave an impetus to the rise of banking.

      Islamic world
         A great increase in trade with Europe which benefitted the Islamic states;
         This trade was carried on by European merchants who established trading settlements in the
         Middle East and remained there after 1291;
         They brought a great variety of Western goods to the Islamic world and exported many products
         from the East to Europe;
         All of this was of financial benefit to Islamic states;
         The Islamic world also benefitted as these trading ports took trade from Constantinople which
         weakened the Byzantine Empire which was an enemy of the Islamic world;
         There were also negative social effects: the Arabs being the ones attacked refused Western
         influence;
         They refused to accept the Western concept that all classes had certain rights that were respected
         by the rulers – this was an alien concept in the Islamic world;
         Islam also refused to accept Western ideas as they regarded them as backward in many areas of
         science, medicine and scholarship – which gave the impression that they had nothing to offer;
         As a result, the Islamic world turned in on itself in a defensive posture after 1291;
         The external world was perceived as increasingly hostile and developing ideas which threatened
         traditional Islamic life and society;
         This caused them to reject some social, economic, scientific and technological progress that may
         have had an effect on Islamic society;
         This has led to the tensions today between modernization and extremist traditionalism.
                                                 – 19 –              N10/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


17.   Analyse the significance of either the Ridda Wars (632–633) (Wars of Apostasy) or the
      Hundred Years War (1337–1396).

      The Ridda Wars (Wars of Apostasy)
      The Ridda Wars have great significance for the Islamic world, these could include:
        they established the principle that anyone who pledged allegiance to Muhammad must continue
        it with his successors;
        they established the principle that all Muslims must pay taxes to Medina;
        this established the unity of the Muslim world and prevented breakdown into local sects or the
        rise of other spiritual leaders;
        they sought to establish the use of force as a means to maintain unity and discipline;
        this was an important victory for unity and order over tribal separatism;
        this was a preview of later struggles to maintain the control of the central government over the
        peripheral areas;
        by uniting the Arabian peninsula, they facilitated the expansion of the Islamic world.

      The Hundred Years War
      The Hundred Years War between England and France had a number of significant results for both
      states. These may include but not be limited to:

      England
        loss of all territory in France with the exception of Calais. This reduced English economic
        strength and effectively ended English claims to the French throne;
        the English government was bankrupt and the Lancastrian dynasty discredited – this contributed
        to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses;
        large numbers of unemployed troops and nobles contributed to the outbreak of the Wars of
        the Roses;
        internal strife and rivalry within the government, brought on by financial insolvency and defeats,
        contributed to the outbreak of civil war;
        financial hardship led to the outbreak of rebellions by peasants and artisans, which was a prelude
        to social disorder.

      France
         the war strengthened loyalty to the national monarchy – this increased the power of the King;
         a standing army was organized which strengthened the power of the monarchy;
         new taxes were imposed and were accepted due to the popularity of the monarch;
         the power of the nobles and the Papacy were reduced in favour of the monarch;
         the monarchy expanded its territory and incorporated former independent states;
         the foundations of a powerful, centralized French state were developed.

18.   Explain to what extent weaponry and other military technology contributed to the success of
      Islamic armies in the period you have studied.

      This is a broad question which may be focused on one of a number of periods including: the early
      Wars of Conquest; the Crusades; the struggle with the Byzantine Empire.

      Candidates should explain to what extent weaponry and military changes were responsible for the
      rapid and extensive conquests by Islamic armies.
         weapons and other military technologies did not seem to play a large role in Islamic success in
         the early years though this may have been different in later campaigns;
         Islamic armies had very basic weapons and these were often in short supply as they were not
         supplied by the state, but by the individual warrior;
         siege engines were available although not widely used during the initial conquests, but they
         became more successful in later wars.

      In addition to technology, candidates will have to analyse the importance of other factors which
      may include but not be limited to:
         the success of the Islamic armies also depended on their motivation, mobility, morale and
         leadership and the weaknesses of the opposition;
         the original desert warriors were all well-trained riders and had amassed great military skills in
         intertribal warfare;
         impact of conversion to a new religion, desire to spread the word and the belief that death in
         battle would lead to paradise;
         warfare was one of the key aspects of Islam from the time of Muhammad and the concept of
         jihad could be a powerful motivator for the troops;
         their opponents were often mercenary armies lacking dedication to their cause;
         the Byzantines and other opponents had internal divisions which weakened their military efforts;
         many people welcomed the Islamic armies as liberators from oppressive governments. This was
         particularly true in the Byzantine Empire;
         the numbers of Islamic soldiers increased as they conquered more territory – this gave them
         numerical advantages in later years;
         Islamic armies adapted to new forms of fighting very rapidly, e.g. naval warfare, which led to
         further conquests.

Topic 4     Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   Assess the impact of the architecture of religious buildings in either medieval Europe or the
      Islamic world.

      This is a very open question, and could be answered in many different ways. Candidates who have
      studied this topic should be familiar with medieval European architecture styles or the architecture
      of the Islamic world before 1550. Both Christian cathedrals and Islamic mosques conformed to
      their own religious practices, and their main designs reflected this. There were local styles, but also
      much similarity, in order to fulfil their religious observances and devotions. In medieval Europe,
      parish churches and monasteries also followed a similar pattern and generally adopted the
      architecture in vogue when they were built. The difference between Romanesque and perpendicular
      architecture is apparent. Secular buildings, especially palaces, were influenced by the current
      architectural style of religious buildings, especially with arches, windows, doors, etc.

      Approach this question with an open-mind, and credit knowledge and original thought.


20. Evaluate the significance of poetry and other forms of literature in either medieval Europe or
    the Islamic world.

      In medieval Europe, literature played a very significant role:
         much medieval writing was of a religious nature designed to explain and debate various religious
         issues and questions;
         serious works of scholarship were largely on religious topics;
         other works were written to respond to the challenges to traditional beliefs posed by the twelfth
         century Renaissance and the universities;
         the vernacular literature provided material on secular subjects such as ancient and modern
         history, politics and newly discovered facts about the physical world;
         vernacular literature celebrated history and heroes in the Norse tradition of the saga;
         lyric poetry gave rise to the troubadours and the traditions of courtly love which became part of
         the chivalric tradition;
         poetry and prose were produced to educate, entertain and amuse as well as support cultural
         traditions and concepts of heroism and valour. These would include the Chanson de Geste of the
         Carolingians, the Arthurian legends which supported chivalric codes and practices, stories of
         Greece and Rome as well as the Germanic traditions;
         this vernacular prose led to the expansion of scholarly books in the vernacular which made
         knowledge in law, science and history more accessible and also to literature that was amusing
         and topical, such as Chaucer‟s Canterbury Tales;
         the use of the vernacular helped expand literacy and the development of national languages;
         it eventually played a role in the humanist movements in the Renaissance.
                                                  – 22 –               N10/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      In the Islamic world, poetry and other literary forms were of notable significance. These could
      include but not be limited to:
         literature was a major source of inspiration to the visual arts, ceramics, painting, metalwork
         and textiles;
         literature expressed messages beyond a simple story – it was used for lessons in politics,
         statesmanship and current events through reference to events and individuals of the past;
         this led to the development of literary criticism and the study of literary forms;
         poetry written in Arabic and other vernacular languages celebrated love, descriptions of nature,
         rulers and the exaltation of God;
         the great cycles of stories of heroes which developed over the centuries began as oral traditions
         and then converted to literature;
         they took the form of entertainment, morality plays and struggles between good and evil;
         their object was to amuse and instruct. They were part of a common culture for the Islamic
         world.


21.   Analyse the causes of the twelfth century Renaissance in Europe.

      The twelfth century was a period of considerable intellectual ferment in Europe as new ideas and
      experiences became more common and more contact with the Islamic world, Constantinople and
      other areas occurred.

      The twelfth century Renaissance had a wide variety of causes. These could include:
        a new interest in the classical world particularly in the area of law by both cities and the Papacy;
        classical writing of history produced a more secular and analytical style;
        classical knowledge was used to develop the idea of a rational universe that man could
        understand;
        the conquest of Toledo in 1085 began a flood of classical and Arabic knowledge into Europe.
        European scholars brought back from Muslim Spain a vast array of practical and scientific
        knowledge as well as Greek works on politics, philosophy and science;
        reasoning, not blind faith, became the new intellectual fashion as demonstrated by Adelard of
        Bath and Peter Abelard who challenged the Church. Many other scholars travelled to the Islamic
        world and returned with new views;
        Aristotle was more widely known and his ideas formed the basis of intellectual debate;
        the Crusades had created a wealthy merchant class in Italy who supported new ideas, scholars
        and progress in science, medicine and philosophy;
        wealth of the cities led to the founding of universities which promoted more intellectual debate
        and study of classical knowledge;
        religious belief and the Church were being challenged by a more confident and informed lay
        population, but the twelfth century Renaissance also included much religious reform.

22.   Compare and contrast the contribution to intellectual development of two of the following:
      Roger Bacon (1220–1292); Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274); Robert Grosseteste (d1253).

      Candidates must select two of the named scholars, and compare and contrast their contribution to
      intellectual development during their lifetime and during the medieval period. The two chosen
      scholars can be addressed separately or together in one essay.

      Roger Bacon
      Roger Bacon was an important medieval proponent of experimental science. He lectured
      extensively on Aristotle at Oxford University; he advanced early scientific thought and advocated
      the study of mathematics as a paradigm for science; he attacked the Scholastics as ignorant
      conservatives; and wrote a number of encyclopaedias in which he advocated the use of observation
      and measurement in science. He described the making of gunpowder and was an advocate of the
      scientific method. He was imprisoned for heresy but his writings were influential in advocating the
      scientific method.

      Thomas Aquinas
      Thomas Aquinas was a leading theologian of the Middle Ages. He created a system which sought
      to reconcile and incorporate both Christian and Aristotelian elements. This was crucial to the
      Christian world as the arrival of Aristotle in the twelfth century had provided an integrated
      philosophical system that challenged Christianity. The idea that reason could replace faith was a
      crisis that had to be resolved if Christianity was to avoid a loss of influence. Aquinas created the
      Thomist synthesis which is often regarded as the most important achievement of medieval thought.
      He was a forward thinker who challenged conservative Christian ideas and opened the door for
      further scientific inquiry.

      Robert Grosseteste
      Robert Grosseteste directed the interest of the Franciscans to natural philosophy and mathematics.
      He wrote early commentaries on Aristotle‟s work in science and composed his own treatises in
      optics, astronomy, motion and light. He was among the first to attempt to reconcile the Bible with
      the work of Aristotle. He also wrote extensively on law, poetry, agriculture and theology. He was
      Roger Bacon‟s teacher and inspiration. He was an example of a churchman with a progressive and
      curious intellect – a forerunner of the Renaissance.

      If only one scholar is addressed mark out of [7 marks].

23.   “Muslim scholars both transmitted and developed scientific knowledge and ideas.”
      With reference to two Muslim scholars, explain to what extent you agree with this statement.

      The Islamic world had access to knowledge from India to Greece to North Africa. In addition, the
      unity of the Empire allowed the information to travel easily across the entire Islamic world.
      The prestige of scholars and scholarship encouraged the acquisition and development of knowledge
      in many areas and by many individuals.

      This question allows candidates to show understanding of the varied nature of intellectual life in the
      Islamic world. A list of the Muslim scholars listed in the guide follows, but candidates can select
      other relevant scholars that they have studied.
         Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (980–1037);
         al-Ghazali (1058–1111);
         Ibn Rushd (Averroes) (1126–1198);
         Ibn „Arabi (1165–1240);
         Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406).

      If only one Muslim scholar is addressed, the highest mark that can be obtained is [12 marks].


24.   Evaluate the contributions to intellectual development of the academic centres in either
      Baghdad or Cairo.

      Baghdad and Cairo were both outstanding centres of all forms of intellectual activity and
      development.

      The contributions of Baghdad could include:
        the Abbasid Caliphs and the wealthy citizens of Baghdad encouraged intellectual pursuits;
        it became the most prestigious centre of learning;
        many scholars came to teach and study in the mosques, madrasas and colleges;
        vast numbers of authors and bookshops provided scholarly materials;
        scientific research was encouraged both in original research and in translating the works of other
        scientists in order to access their knowledge;
        public libraries disseminated knowledge;
        hospitals set standards in medical knowledge and research;
        it was the leading centre until its destruction by the Mongols.

      The contributions of Cairo could include:
        a global centre of learning exemplified by the al-Azhar University which remained a leading
        centre of scholarship for centuries;
        many other schools, scholastic centres and academies grew up in Cairo as well;
        the Fatimid founders of Cairo established a tradition of seeking knowledge and this was
        continued after their fall in 1171;
        non-Islamic scholars were welcomed by the founders of Cairo and they contributed substantially
        to its intellectual achievements;
        the decline of Baghdad encouraged large numbers of intellectuals to relocate to Cairo;
        medical science was preeminent at the al-Mansuri Hospital.

Topic 5    Religion and the state

25.   Why, and with what results, did Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) reform the monastic
      movement?

      The reasons that encouraged Bernard of Clairvaux to lead a movement for monastic reform could
      include:
         a growing enthusiasm for a more ascetic way of life by churchmen;
         disillusionment with the wealth and splendour of some monasteries, e.g. Cluny;
         a wish to return to the original Benedictine Rule;
         growing religious fervour at the end of the eleventh century as exemplified by the Crusades;
         the genius and character of Bernard whose writing, oratory and personal example attracted great
         numbers to a new, more rigorous monastic movement.

      The Cistercian order was founded by Robert of Molesme in 1098 at Cîteaux in France. The
      Cistercians followed a strict interpretation of the rule of St. Benedict of Nursia; their constitution
      was laid down in the Carta Caritatis. Bernard entered Cîteaux in 1112 and in 1115 and founded a
      daughter house at Clairvaux, which quickly gained a great reputation, and many entrants to the
      Cistercian order.
         The order contributed extensively to advances in agriculture, because, in order to escape from
         the temptations, distractions and fine architecture of cities and towns, Cistercian monasteries
         were built in uncultivated areas, which when cleared provided fertile farming land;
         They were centres of orderly life in a wild environment, and the monks worked the fields, etc.;
         The Cistercian order was a model of “organized other-worldliness” and represented a mass
         sustained effort to ensure that in spite of human weakness, strict monastic poverty could be
         maintained;
         In addition, Bernard influenced the formation of the monastic military orders the Templars and
         the Hospitallers to defend the Holy Land.

      This inspired a broader reform movement in the Church which continued for some time.
      The founding of the Dominican and Franciscan orders was part of this movement and was the
      attempt by various popes to assert their authority over temporal rulers and remove the corrupt
      practices that had arisen.

26.   Analyse the reasons for the rise of heretical movements in either medieval Europe or the
      Islamic world.

      There are a variety of reasons for the rise of heretical movements in Europe and these changed at
      different times in the medieval period. They were signs that sectors of the population found the
      Church and its teaching inadequate or its moral behaviour lacking, but often heretical movements
      were caused by political events or policies.

      Reasons could include:
        a rejection of the Church‟s wealth and practices in favour of a simple righteous life as taught by
        Christ. They rejected all Church practices and tenets for a new puritanical life. They objected to
        the luxury and moral laxity of the clergy;
        the new intellectual vitality of the twelfth century encouraged heretical movements.
        Lay persons who were better educated and wealthier were examining and comparing the Church
        to its original form and were repelled by the wealth and abuses of power of the medieval church;
        the debate led by individuals such as Peter Abelard and the introduction of classical thinkers
        such as Aristotle contributed to challenges to Church authority;
        the influx of intellectual ideas from the Islamic world and the Byzantine Empire as a result of the
        Crusades encouraged movements to challenge the Church‟s authority. These included extensive
        knowledge of Greek and Roman scholars as well as scientific and other knowledge from the
        Islamic world;
        the spread of ideas such as Manichaeanism from the East. The largest example of this being the
        Albigensian movement which preached/believed in the dualism of the perfect and imperfect –
        spread throughout Europe;
        heresies were occasionally encouraged or protected by secular rulers seeking political or
        economic advantage in a particular region;
        throughout the Islamic world there were divergences from time to time, which some sects
        regarded as heresy within the Muslim religion. Although Sunni and Shiite were, the main
        divisions (these were sometimes regarded by the others as heretics), there were many more; see
        question 27 also.

27.   To what extent were political differences responsible for the division of Islam into sects?

      This question requires that candidates have an understanding of the reasons for the division of Islam
      into a number of rival sects.

      The origins of these divisions can be found in the years immediately following the death
      of Muhammad, when disputes arose over who should inherit his spiritual authority and religious
      leadership.

      The division into sects occurred within his family and amongst his early followers.

      Other factors that could be considered in the establishment of various sects over the years are:
        desire for territorial or financial power by certain individuals or families;
        ethnic or linguistic rivalries;
        tribal disputes leading to struggles over the leadership;
        changing economic and social conditions which may have influenced changes in Islamic
        doctrines;
        reactions to the wealth of the Empire which helped produce the Sufi movement, for example;
        geographic extent of the Empire which encouraged a variety of views in remote areas;
        the inclusion of many different races and cultures in the Empire which may have introduced
        differing patterns of thought or ideas.


28.   For what reasons, and with what results, did either Pope Gregory VII (1073–1085) or Thomas
      Becket clash with temporal rulers?

      This question deals with the constant conflict between religious and temporal rulers for power,
      pre-eminence, property and prestige in medieval European society.

      Gregory VII
      The clash with temporal rulers is based on the issue of the reform of the Church which involves the
      question of who should appoint bishops and select the Pope.
        By 1059, the cardinals and not the Emperor had the power to select the Pope;
        Gregory became Pope in 1073 and pushed church reform, which included the selection of
        bishops by Emperor Henry IV and their investiture as bishops by a lay ruler as opposed to a
        religious leader;
        Emperor Henry IV relied on the revenue from the sale of church offices and his power to control
        appointments to ensure that these, who controlled large estates, were loyal to him;
        This is known as the Investiture Crisis;
        The Pope declared that he could appoint and depose bishops, and that temporal rulers had to
        accept his nominees. In addition, he could depose any ruler and allow his subjects to disobey
        him;
        Gregory VII forbade lay investiture and excommunicated the Emperor;
        This was serious as his subjects were no longer obliged to fulfil their oaths of loyalty to him;
        Emperor Henry VI was forced to seek forgiveness from the Pope or face revolt at home.

The results could include:
  civil war broke out in Germany. Henry IV triumphed and marched to Rome and deposed the
  Pope in 1084;
  the issue of lay investiture was settled at the Concordat of Worms in 1122 with a compromise
  between the parties;
  other issues of papal versus temporal power were not resolved;
  the reforming spirit that Gregory VII had begun in the Church was carried on by his successors
  who sought to eliminate abuses and maintain the authority of the Church.


Thomas Becket
Thomas Becket was educated in Paris and Bologna, made Archdeacon of Canterbury, 1154,
Chancellor 1155 and Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162.

Reasons for conflict could include:
  King Henry II expected Archbishop Thomas to support him in any controversial matters
  concerning the Church and state;
  Becket set out to expand ecclesiastical/papal rights whenever possible;
  the matter became acute over the question of which courts had jurisdiction over clergy who
  broke the law. Becket insisted that they be tried only in church courts (benefit of clergy),
  but Henry insisted on a secular trial as well. Constitutions of Clarendon (1164);
  Becket had been a friend of Henry II and his attitude was seen as treacherous by the King;
  Becket was forced to flee to France for safety. He returned in 1170 but was murdered by
  supporters of the King;
  the dispute was over who should control the Church in England, the King or the Church leaders
  – the Pope represented by the Archbishop.

Results could include:
  Henry II had to do public penance for the murder;
  he had to yield the issue of punishment of clergy to the Church – this limited his authority;
  litigants in church courts could appeal to the Pope without reference to the King which limited
  Henry II‟s authority;
  however, the Church failed to expand its authority further and had to abide by the Constitutions
  of Clarendon;
  Thomas Becket was made a saint.

29.   Explain the social and religious reasons for the rise of the Sufi Orders in the Islamic world.

      Candidates should focus on the social and religious as opposed to the political reasons for the rise of
      the Sufi Orders.

      Social reasons may include but not be limited to:
        rejection of the worldliness of the Caliphate;
        rejection of wealth and class distinctions;
        embracing a life of poverty and asceticism.

      Religions reasons may include but not be limited to:
        a desire to model the life of Mohammad and the early leaders;
        reaction against intellectual theologians by emphasizing the importance of intuitive mystical
        experience;
        mystical experience cannot be described in human language.

      Reasons for the rise of the Sufi orders could include:
        sufism was an early form of Islamic asceticism which developed as a reaction to certain features
        of Orthodox Islam.

      Sufis rejected:
        the worldliness of the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates;
        wealth and class distinctions.

      Sufism was based on the simple lives of Muhammad and the first Caliphs.
        model of poor wandering ascetics and mystics.

      It reacted against the intellectualism of theologians.
          proclaimed the importance of intuitive mystical experience;
          believed that mystical experience is not describable in human language.

      It reacted against Orthodox Legalism.
          wished to go beyond the mere observance of Islamic law in favour of an inner experience of the
          divine through meditation;
          desire to sever the attachment to earthly things;
          desire to lose the sense of self in favour of a passing away into God.

      Overall Sufism had its origins in mystical elements of the Qur‟an as related in the life of
      Muhammad and his relationship with God.

30.   Analyse the role in government and administration of either clerics in medieval Europe or
      ulama in the Islamic world.

      Candidates should be aware that the learned scholars or ulama played a significant role in both
      Islamic society and in administration and government. Candidates should also be aware that there
      are differences in the role of the ulama between the Sunni and Shiite sects.

      Clerics in government in medieval Europe:
         in the early Middle Ages clerics were more literate than laymen, so were able to assist in
         administration and government;
         clerics could be recompensed with benefices, thus the ruler did not need to pay them;
         this was especially useful for those in high office as they could be appointed to bishoprics;
         most scholars at universities were clerics, so their training was useful for rulers, especially if they
         had studied law;
         with the increase of a royal bureaucracy and of courts of law, more clerics were needed;
         kings‟ treasuries were organized into government accounting departments – the Exchequer
         headed by the chancellor, who was often a bishop;
         the Church led the way in organized government and administration;
         the use of clerics in secular government and administration led to problems between Church
         and state;
         clerics in high office had little or no time for their bishoprics or other benefices.

      Ulama in the Islamic world:
        the ulama, due to their religious scholarship, acted as judges, teachers, preachers and guardians
        of shrines;
        they also had strong relations to the merchant classes for whom they worked as legal specialists
        in the preparation of documents and in resolving disputes over property and contracts;
        this made them wealthy through contacts and inter-marriage;
        their offices were often hereditary which increased their power and influence;
        they had a critical importance as judges through their knowledge of sharia;
        this made them administrators, and interpreters of the law as well as the creators of codes of
        conduct which governed life in the Islamic world;
        these codes influenced or governed many forms of daily life and behaviour which meant that the
        interpreters of these codes had extraordinary power;
        they ran the madrasas which taught knowledge and jurisprudence. The respect for their
        scholarship and knowledge of religious texts, interpretations and the Qur‟an gave them a highly
        respected place in Islamic society. This meant that they could influence opinions, practises and
        customs if they chose to do so;
        the ulama were often employed as a learned council to advise the ruler;
        their influence was often so pervasive that Islamic governments needed to secure their support in
        order to govern;
        this was especially clear in the Ottoman and Mughal Empires;
        their influence in different administrations, however, waxed or waned depending on the attitude
        of the ruler towards them. Some rulers limited their influence or chose to consult them
        selectively;
        they were often dependent on the rulers for appointments and as such would have to fall into line
        with their policies, particularly if they were powerful.
