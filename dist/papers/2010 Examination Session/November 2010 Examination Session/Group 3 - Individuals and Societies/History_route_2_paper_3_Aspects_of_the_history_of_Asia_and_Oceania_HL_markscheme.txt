Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
         appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail
         is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
         than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth, historical
        knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
        There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may
        be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications are considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4.
        Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present,
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is
        well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   To what extent was religion the main cause of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of 1857?

     Candidates may identify what they consider to be the causes of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny),
     both long-term and short-term. These may be divided into immediate causes: the issue of cartridges
     and cow and pig fat followed by military revolt, and/or the long-term causes such as: British rule;
     interference with traditional ruling systems; the way India was governed; economic changes;
     land reform; trade; the nature of the relationship between the British and the Indians; and other
     grievances. Religion must be dealt with, both Islam and Hinduism were connected to the Revolt.
     Many answers may focus on religion and the issue of cartridges as the causes, but “to what extent”
     must be addressed, indicating the merits of the argument and opinion about religion, as well as an
     evaluation of its importance.


2.   Explain why there were so few revolts and little opposition to colonial rule in the region
     during the nineteenth century.

     Despite the widespread nature of colonial domination over South and Southeast Asia and Oceania,
     there were surprisingly few major revolts against foreign rule in the period. The Great Revolt
     (Indian Mutiny) was the exception rather than the rule. Candidates need to consider why this was
     the situation. Answers may focus on the military strengths and the technological advancement of
     the colonizers. Was it because of the relative superficiality of colonial rule? Most indigenous
     peoples were agriculturalists and not impacted by foreign rule. Was it because the rulers preferred
     “commerce to dominion” as one British politician stated? Candidates may refer to the policies of
     “divide and rule” that were followed by the imperialists and the relative “popularity” of rule by the
     imperialist powers. Collaborators amongst the native population played a part too – they stood to
     gain more than they lost. Answers may refer to the heterogeneity (dissimilar or diverse
     constituents) of Asian society, which made unified resistance more difficult and to the calibre of
     some of the officials who ran the colonial administration. Examples where there were revolts and
     resistance include: Burma which fought three wars against the British, 1824–1826, 1852 and
     1885–1886; Afghanistan 1842; resistance to the Dutch in Java in 1825. In the Philippines there had
     been steady resistance on a small scale ever since the arrival of the Spanish. The Palaris Revolt of
     1762–1765 was the largest revolt, followed by the Ambaristo Revolt in 1807. Spanish policies of
     repression both helped cause as well as curbed resistance in the Philippines. In New Zealand,
     Maori resistance led to local wars against the British despite the Treaty of Waitangi 1840 – conflicts
     over land led to the First Maori War 1843–1848 and the Second Maori War 1860–1870.
     Candidates     may      focus    on     resistance     to     British    rule   in     India,   1857.
     This example can be used, but should not constitute the main focus of the answer.

3.   Compare and contrast the ways in which imperial China and Japan responded to the
     challenges posed by the arrival of Western powers in the early to mid-nineteenth century.

     This will probably be a popular question. Both countries responded in different ways to the arrival
     of the Western powers. Expect a description of the situations in both countries when the
     Westerners arrived, but the command terms require that at least some awareness of the differences
     in actions/attitudes are pointed out with specific evidence provided to support the analysis.
     Chronologically, China will probably be dealt with first and will include: the Macartney, Amherst
     and Napier missions; the Chinese reactions to Western attempts to secure concessions and the
     Canton trade system; refusal of the Emperor to deal with the Western powers. Expect the clash of
     cultures, opium trade, war and the forcing open of Chinese ports. Japan too had handled foreigners
     through isolation earlier, but in the middle of the nineteenth century, the arrival of Perry and the
     Black Ships led the Japanese to deal with the Americans through treaties. Expect some similarities
     to be pointed out as well as differences, (greater Japanese interest in Western learning,
     for example), based on the difference in government structures and power balances between the two
     countries; the question is open-ended regarding when candidates can chose to conclude.

     If only China or Japan is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


4.   Analyse the reasons for the Taiping (Taip’ing) Rebellion’s initial successes and eventual
     failure.

     Candidates may set the scene in China in the mid-nineteenth century following China’s defeat in the
     First Opium War. The reasons for the initial success of the Taiping Rebellion lie in the widespread
     discontent in China in the middle of the century caused by the economic and social problems of
     China: growing population pressure; the land problem; high taxation; price rises; the situation of the
     peasantry; the unpopularity of the Qing (Ch’ing) government; official corruption and incompetence;
     natural disasters; the effects of the Opium War and the unequal treaties; national humiliation. The
     leadership of Hong Xiuquan (Hung Hsiu-ch’uan) and his new ideas appealed to many people,
     particularly Hakka peasants and workers. These ideas included a version of Christianity; land
     redistribution and the abolition of private ownership; mutual sharing of resources; gender equality;
     banning of opium. The initial successes can also be attributed to the military weakness of the Ch’ing
     government and the sympathy of some Westerners. Hong Xiuquan (Hung Hsiu-ch’uan) founded the
     “Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace” with its capital at Nanjing (Nanking) and it ranged over sixteen
     provinces. This rebellion, from 1850 to 1864, was the most serious faced by the Ch’ing Dynasty and
     it cost the lives of about 30 million people and caused widespread destruction. The reasons for its
     eventual failure include: the internal dissension that developed; the hypocrisy in the lifestyles of the
     leaders; strategic blunders; the rise of Zeng Guofan (Tseng Kuo-fan) and
     Li Hongzhang (Li Hung-chang) and their provincial armies; the inability to appeal to the mandarin
     class due to the ideological conflict between Confucianism and Christianity; poor diplomacy with
     the Western powers; the eventual decision by Western powers to support the Qing (Ch’ing) rather
     than the rebels.

5.   Compare and contrast the contributions of Rizal and Bonifacio to the Philippine
     independence movement in the late nineteenth century.

     Candidates will identify that both men played significant roles in the Philippine independence
     movement in the late-nineteenth century. Candidates may look at background; beliefs about how
     independence should be achieved; actions; death. Many answers will focus on contrasts, but some
     comparisons should also be identified. Rizal was educated at the Jesuit College in Manila and
     studied medicine in Spain. He gained a reputation as a writer and poet. His 1887 novel, Noli Me
     Tangere, described Filipino suffering under Spanish rule. He returned to Manila the same year, but
     Spanish persecution of his family caused him to leave again. He became a dedicated reformer,
     writing articles for La Solidaridad, the journal published by the Propaganda Movement, organized
     by Filipinos in Spain who wanted greater liberty for the Philippines. His scientific and literary
     articles won him high esteem in Europe, while his second novel, El Filibusterismo, raised the
     question of revolution without advocating it. He returned from Spain in 1892, founded the Filipino
     League, an organization advocating peaceful reform, was arrested by the Spanish authorities and
     sent to Mindanao. In 1896, the Spanish authorities ordered the arrest of revolutionary leaders,
     sparking revolt. Although not involved in the revolt, Rizal was arrested, tried for treason and
     executed, making him a nationalist martyr. Andres Bonifciao was another leader, who initially
     joined Rizal’s Filipino League, but he became disillusioned and abandoned the idea of a peaceful
     struggle and founded the Katipunan in 1892, a secret society dedicated to rebellion. He also
     published his ideas and supported the Revolution which began in 1896. The Katipunan split into
     two groups and leadership conflicts between Bonifacio and Emilo Aguinaldo culminated in the
     execution of Bonifacio in 1897. Candidates may discuss who they think had a more significant
     contribution.

     If only Rizal or Bonifacio is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                  –7–               N10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M

6.   Examine the reasons why the Government of India Act (1858) and the Morley-Minto reforms
     (1909) were passed and evaluate their impact on the political organization of British India.

     For two hundred years up until 1857 the British East India Company had administered India in the
     name of the British Crown. The Government of India Act 1858 abolished the British East India
     Company and transferred its functions to the British Crown and tried to solve the defects in the
     existing system of the government of India following the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny). Reasons
     why include: inefficiency of the system; the Great Revolt. The impact of these includes changing
     attitudes to British rule although changes were more in form than substance. Candidates need to
     identify the major constitutional changes (they may mention Victoria being declared Empress in
     1877). They may also include the contribution to the rise of Indian nationalism including formation
     of the Indian Nationalist Congress (INC) and the All India Muslim League. The Morley-Minto
     reforms of 1909 should be well-known. Candidates could also address discontent in India itself;
     lack of progress in meeting the demands of the Indian Nationalist Congress; the development of
     extremism. Impact should include an increase in numbers of representatives for the legislative
     councils although these still had little real power. The principle of separate electorates for Muslims
     was established. The introduction of the electoral principle laid the groundwork for a parliamentary
     system, even though this was not the intent of Morley, increasing political awareness amongst
     educated Indians and their awareness of the contradictory nature of British government.

     If only the Government of India Act or the Morley-Minto reforms are dealt with, mark out of a
     maximum of [12 marks].

7.   “The Meiji Restoration (1868) was not just a political change, but a real cultural revolution.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates may initially explain that the Meiji Restoration in 1868 returned power to the Emperor
     after centuries of rule by the Tokugawa Shogunate. The catalyst for this change was the upheavals
     following the forced opening of Japan by Perry in 1853. The new Emperor ruled with the help of
     an oligarchy. The Charter Oath of 1868 aimed to seek knowledge from around the world in order to
     modernise Japan and make her equal to the Western powers. Candidates will need to analyse and
     assess the impact of the Meiji reforms and to distinguish between political changes and those
     affecting Japanese culture, including beliefs and values. The question looks at Japan in 1868 and in
     1890, when the Meiji Constitution came into effect. Candidates should do more than simply
     describe the events of the Restoration and indicate the impact of these changes on Japanese society
     and culture. Expect some understanding of the meaning of “revolution”.

     Politically, the major institutional accomplishment after the Satsuma Rebellion was the beginning
     of the trend toward the development of representative government. The Meiji Restoration saw the
     fast modernization and Westernization of Japan, with many Japanese scholars and politicians sent to
     study the Western system and technologies in Europe and North America, and Westerners invited to
     Japan to help develop new industries. Better candidates will recognize that politically, many of the
     feudal principles were preserved and transferred from the old feudal leaders to the Emperor as the
     embodiment of the new state.

     Cultural changes occurred with the adoption of Western dress, music, drama and dance. However,
     this transformation was not complete or universal. The impact culturally on Japan encompassed
     educational reforms with attention given to Western subjects and a popularity of many things
     Western. Buddhism came under attack and Christianity was allowed but Shintoism was still the
     national faith of most Japanese. Reformers were willing to accept what they needed from the West
     but many reacted in favour of a cultural nationalism to preserve Japanese identity and traditional
     moral values. Some Westerners came to Japan to promote an interest in Japanese arts and literature
     but the Restoration encouraged a revival of interest in Japanese culture. Cultural innovation was
     often the pursuit of fashion and fads among an educated elite and did not affect society as a whole.
     Moreover, leadership remained with a relatively small group of reformers around the Emperor,
     although by 1912 the original leaders, the genro, were dying out. Political innovation went as far as
     a conservative imperial constitution based on that of the conservative powers in Europe. Much of
     Japan’s traditional beliefs and practices remained unchanged and constituted a cultural core
     supporting the Emperor and the authority of the government. Candidates may refer to the
     Constitution of 1889 and the Imperial Rescript on Education of 1890 to illustrate how the adoption
     of Western political institutions did not imply the abandonment of traditional values and ways of
     thinking. Candidates may agree, disagree or remain undecided, depending on their perspective.
     Credit sound arguments that are based on historical evidence.
                                                 –9–               N10/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M

8.   Discuss the consequences for the region of either the Sino–Japanese War (1894–1895) or the
     Russo–Japanese War (1904–1905).

     Candidates may identify that in 1894 the major powers in the region were Britain, France, the
     United States and Russia. Initially, China was expected to win the war with Japan which began in
     1894, but Japanese modernization in the decades prior to the war had been more thorough than
     China’s and its armed forces and their command were more efficient. Even so, Japan was ready to
     make peace in 1895 because of the economic effects of the war. China’s traditional claim to
     superiority had been decisively discredited. The Treaty of Shimonoseki was unequal in Japan’s
     favour with China being forced to concede territory, pay an indemnity, open new ports to Japanese
     trade and recognize the independence of Korea. The balance of power had shifted towards Japan, to
     the extent that Britain saw it as a useful potential ally against her traditional rival, Russia.
     The Anglo–Japanese alliance of 1902 suited both Japan and Britain, but Japan was not regarded as
     an equal.

     The war with Russia in 1904–1905 further upset the Western powers’ calculations. The defeat of
     Russia left Japan dominant in Northeast Asia. The Treaty of Portsmouth recognized Japanese
     interests in Korea and China. Britain, France and the United States were greater powers on the
     world stage, but none had military or naval bases of any importance in Northeast Asia. It was not
     fully recognized at the time, but the balance of power in Northeast Asia had shifted to Japan, which
     continued to develop its military and imperialist ambitions.


9.   To what extent has the role of Mahatma Gandhi in the Indian nationalist movement been
     exaggerated?

     Candidates should identify what they consider to be Gandhi’s role in the Indian nationalist
     movement. This may include: Gandhi’s ideas and philosophy; his return to India in 1915;
     the first satyagraha campaign 1917; the second and third satyagraha campaigns; Gandhi’s support
     for the Khilafat issue; his continuation of non-cooperation; boycott of foreign goods; khadi
     movement; impact of jailing Gandhi; causes and consequences of the Salt March 1930 and the Civil
     Disobedience campaign in the same year; Gandhi–Irwin Pact March 1931; Round Table
     Conferences and Gandhi’s popularity in Britain; the second Civil Disobedience campaign; Gandhi
     jailed 1932–1933; Gandhi’s use of fasting; deterioration of relationships between Hindus and
     Muslims and Gandhi’s attempts at unity; Quit India Campaign 1942. The importance of his role
     needs to be assessed in the light of other factors which may have also contributed to the Indian
     nationalist movement. These may include: Gandhi’s relationship with Congress; the roles of
     Motilal Nehru and Jawaharlal Nehru; the role of Jinnah and the revival of the All Muslim League;
     the Government of India Act 1935 and those for and against; the impact of the Second World War;
     change of government in Britain; Wavell and Mountbatten. Some distinction could be made
     between Gandhi’s role in the Indian nationalist movement and in the final achievement of
     independence in 1947.

10.   Compare and contrast the extent to which Japanese expansion in Southeast Asia during the
      Second World War influenced the nationalist movements in two countries in Southeast Asia.

      Candidates will probably choose from Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya or the Philippines.
      The Second World War and Japanese occupation may be seen as a watershed with the pre-war
      period of colonial rule where the nationalist movements initially developed. Although nationalist
      movements did not all follow exactly the same path there are some common themes. There may be
      some discussion of the pre-war situation in order to assess the impact of the Japanese occupation on
      each country later on. The Japanese expansion into each country and the nature of the occupation
      will need to be examined. This may include: Japanese atrocities; resistance to Japanese rule; the
      way the Japanese restructured the government (e.g. Burma, Philippines); the way the Japanese used
      the colonial administration of the European countries occupied by the Nazis (Indonesia, Vietnam);
      the opportunities for nationalists to acquire experience in administration and in the military; the
      impact of Japanese ideas such as “Asia for the Asians”; Japanese support for independence from
      Western colonial rule; the immediate declaration of independence after the defeat of the Japanese in
      an attempt to pre-empt the return of the colonial power (e.g. Indonesia and Vietnam); the
      subsequent struggle with the colonial power until the final achievement of independence; the
      development of internal factional fighting and the need for the colonial power to unite the country
      again (Malaya). Candidates may compare and contrast the roles of charismatic nationalist leaders:
      Sukarno (Indonesia); Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam); Aung San (Burma); Datuk Onn and Tunku Abdul
      Rahman (Malaya); Quezon and Osmeña (the Philippines). Some assessment of the extent to which
      the Japanese occupation influenced the nationalist movements needs to be addressed. Many
      answers will focus on comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


11.   Analyse the factors that led to the rise of warlordism in China in the period from 1911
      to 1926.

      Candidates will need to define “warlordism” and recognize that its roots may be traced to the
      decline of the authority of the Qing (Ch’ing) central government in the second half of the nineteenth
      century. These long-term factors may include: the Chinese system of Banner armies; the impact of
      the Taiping (Taip’ing) Rebellion; and the rise of provincial leaders such as Zeng Guofan (Tseng
      Kuo-fan) and Li Hongzhang (Li Hung-chang), the Boxer Rebellion; the weakness of the Qing
      (Ch’ing) government. The role of Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-k’ai) may be examined: his betrayal of
      Guangxu (Kuang-hsu) in the Hundred Days Reform Movement; his allegiances during the Boxer
      Rebellion; his support for the 1911 Revolution; the reasons why Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) gave the
      Presidency of the Republic to him in 1912. Yuan’s actions showed that he had no loyalty to either
      the Qing (Ch’ing) or the new Republic. Problems beset his government; party politics failed; Yuan
      tried to make himself Emperor in 1915, but was thwarted and by the time he died in 1916 the power
      of the central government had been seriously weakened. His example undoubtedly encouraged
      other military commanders to use their armies to establish control over whatever regions they could.
      Other factors that may also be mentioned include: the way the government gave in to Japan’s 21
      Demands in 1915 and the humiliation for China as a result of the Treaty of Versailles terms. In the
      period 1917–1926 warlordism spread throughout China.

12.   “The Nationalists failed to attend to China’s urgent problems.” Examine the nature of these
      problems between 1926 and 1937. To what extent do you agree that these failures led to the
      eventual downfall of the Nationalists?

      Candidates will probably more readily see the faults and not the achievements, but much was
      achieved in terms of international recognition including: revision of the treaty system and the return
      of foreign concessions; financial reform; tariff autonomy; industrial development; communications;
      education; literature. In 1926 the situation in China was not very different to that a decade earlier
      with dominance of warlords and an absence of central control. By 1937, the Communists had been
      driven from Jiangxi (Kiangsi) and reduced in strength. The new United Front could be seen as
      evidence of success or failure depending on one’s point of view. Territory had been lost to Japan,
      but a new national purpose appeared to be forming. However, the regime failed to introduce social
      and economic reforms to benefit the masses, in particular land reform, because of its reliance on
      support from the propertied and landlord classes. There was no significant move towards
      democracy, corruption and cronyism were widespread, and the fiscal irresponsibility of the
      government was such that government receipts covered only 80 % of expenditure, and deficit
      spending led to inflation. Candidates may also cite the failure to engage the Japanese as a failure.
      Some will probably mention the analysis provided by Immanuel Hsu in dealing with: financial
      reform; tariff autonomy; the recovery of foreign concessions; communications; industrial
      development; education; the New Life Movement; literature; the neglect of social and economic
      reforms; fiscal irresponsibility. How far these perceived failures precipitated their eventual
      downfall is the assessment required in the question. There is a wealth of material and much will
      depend on the candidates’ ability to order and analyse.


13.   Examine the circumstances behind the Japanese decision to enter into the First World War
      and assess the consequences for Japan and other countries in the region.

      Japan entered the war as an ally of Britain in August 1914. It was a test of her alliance with the
      British and her acceptance as an equal with the other world powers. It was a chance for revenge
      against Germany for her role in the 1895 Triple Intervention and to take the German naval base at
      Jiaozhou (Kiaochow), which was a threat to her. Other circumstances include Japan’s growing
      population pressure and the chance to gain territories from the defeated German Empire and also to
      extend her control over parts of Asia. Japan saw opportunities in China and presented the 21
      Demands in 1915. The consequences were a disappointment for the Japanese. Japan received
      Shandong (Shantung) and Germany’s north Pacific possessions, but not a declaration of racial
      equality. For others, candidates could mention China who resented the loss of Shandong
      (Shantung). From these grievances sprang the May Fourth Movement (1919) in China and all that
      stemmed from it. Japan’s claim to Shandong (Shantung) was surrendered to China in 1922, but
      deep resentment at this fueled Japanese desires for compensation in Manchuria. Asians in general
      were disappointed with the results of the Treaty of Versailles, with the rejection of the declaration
      of racial equality being a trigger for nationalist sentiments across the region.

      N.B. Candidates may well refer to other countries/states in the region.

14.   Why did Japan fail to establish a democratic system of parliamentary government in the
      period 1918 to 1931?

      Liberal values appeared to have triumphed at the end of the First World War and the 1920s were a
      time of prosperity after the First World War, which was regarded as a victory for liberal
      democracies over autocracy. In Japan, intellectuals and students began a campaign for universal
      suffrage and true parliamentary democracy and this led to the development of the Minseito and
      Seiyukai political parties in Japan in the early 1920s. The 1920s saw more liberal internal policies,
      including the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1925 and the beginning of what appeared
      could develop into a genuine cabinet government. After the 1925 Manhood Suffrage Act, the
      number of voters rose from 3 million to 14 million. In the political milieu of the day, there was a
      proliferation of new parties, including socialist and communist parties. Political parties had to
      appeal to a broader electorate whose interests differed from those of the much smaller, propertied
      electorate prior to the reform. This all occurred in a period of economic growth as Japanese
      manufacturers made inroads in world markets. Candidates should acknowledge the existing
      conflict between liberalism and democracy on the one hand and authoritarianism and militarism on
      the other. Candidates will need to show awareness that there was a strengthening of liberal values
      in Japan in the 1920s, but that they were strongly challenged by conservative values and institutions
      which undermined them. Politicians were seen as serving business interests and as being corrupt,
      showing little concern for the difficulties of the peasantry and the labour force. The result was
      to be, by the end of the decade, the rise of a new militant nationalism which began to see the older
      institutions of the state and army as embodying the spirit of Japan, which partially helps to explain
      why Japan failed to establish a democratic system of parliamentary government in the period.

      The Depression of 1929 threatened Japanese industries and livelihoods as countries closed their
      markets to Japanese manufactures. The perceived failures of the political parties to handle the
      effects of the Depression and to withstand the extreme nationalists and militarists discredited
      democracy. Candidates will also recognize that Japan in the 1930s faced severe economic and
      social problems for which militarism appeared to provide a solution, which weak and corrupt
      civilian politicians were unable to address.


15.   Assess the view that the Second World War radically altered the foreign policies of Australia
      and New Zealand in the period from 1945 to 1965 and changed their loyalties to Britain and
      the Commonwealth.

      Both Australia and New Zealand followed similar foreign policies with some difference in
      emphasis and candidates will largely agree with the statement. Relations with Britain were
      maintained but both countries moved into closer links with the United States for defence purposes.
      The Pacific War in particular caused both New Zealand and Australia to realize that they could not
      depend on Britain for defence and they entered the ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, United States
      Security Treaty) Pact (1951) with the United States providing for mutual defence. The rise of
      Communism in East Asia presented another perceived threat and again Australia and New Zealand
      joined with others in order to meet it, this time entering the South East Asia Treaty Organization
      (SEATO) in 1954. Both agreements assumed a policy of forward defence so that both countries
      sent forces to fight in Korea and later in Vietnam. Both countries were active members of the
      United Nations and of the British Commonwealth. Economically, both countries moved to closer
      links with Asia. The extent to which the policies reflected a change of loyalties is one which
      candidates need to address.

      If only Australia or New Zealand is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

16.   Why did the Australian Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, remain in power from 1949 to 1967?

      Candidates may initially discuss Menzies’ loss of office as Prime Minister in 1941. He then left the
      United Australia Party and formed a new political party, the Liberal Party, in 1945. This party was
      to be Australia-wide and one that also appealed to the mass of the people. However, the Australian
      Labor Party (ALP) won the 1946 election, but the beginning of the Cold War in 1947 began to turn
      public opinion away from the Chifley Labor government. Many of its policies, such as the proposed
      nationalization of the banks, were perceived as too socialist. Menzies won the 1949 election, though
      the ALP still had a majority in the Senate He was a skilful politician and, at the 1951 election,
      Menzies and the Liberal party won control of both Houses.

      Menzies’ attempt to ban the Communist Party in 1951 was overturned by the High Court
      so he held a referendum on the issue, but this was narrowly defeated. Despite this set back Menzies
      remained popular. The Cold War heavily influenced his policies. The strengthening of the alliance
      with the United States and Australia’s involvement in the Korean War were popular policies. The
      Petrov Affair in 1954 fuelled the public’s Cold War fears which Menzies used to his advantage and
      he won the 1954 election. As a result of this election the Australian Labor Party split and some
      members left to form the Democratic Labor Party. The DLP subsequently gave its preferences to
      Menzies’ Liberal Party and was, therefore, a significant factor in why Menzies remained in power
      for so long. Menzies used the fear of Communism to encourage divisions within the Labor party,
      domestically and in his foreign policy. Candidates will also need to refer to other policies to that
      maintained his popularity these may include: the economy and its steady growth in the 1950s; the
      boom in agriculture; the rapid growth in manufacturing; the exporting of Australian goods; full
      employment; rising incomes; population growth aided by a massive immigration programme; and
      the expansion of both secondary and tertiary education. Menzies had the support of the suburban
      middle-class, especially women. Menzies narrowly won the 1961 election in the aftermath of the
      credit squeeze, and his foreign policies contributed to his 1963 win. His commitment to the
      American alliance and the sending of troops to Vietnam were well accepted by the electorate. At
      the same time as developing Australia’s defence ties with the USA, he also remained culturally very
      British and this reflected the public mood. Menzies was a gifted speaker and very charismatic. He
      symbolized security and prosperity. He retired in 1966 and remains Australia’s longest serving
      Prime Minister.

17.   “The American effort to preserve the Indo–Chinese peninsula from Communism was long,
      drawn-out and ended in total failure.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This should be a popular question with candidates. The reasons why the US entered the conflict
      should be linked to the Cold War and its spread in Asia. In the late 1950s when the French left
      Vietnam and South Vietnam, with American support, opposed the reunification elections required
      under the Geneva agreement which had ended the conflict between the French and the
      Communist-led Vietnamese nationalists in 1954. South Vietnam established itself as a separate
      state, prompting insurrection in the South, supported by the Communist North. Candidates may
      link the reasons why the US entered the war, the stalemate which developed, the armistice and the
      developing hard-line approach taken by Eisenhower and Dulles to Communism in the region.
      Rollback of Communism, US strategic interests, the unpopularity of Diem in the South, and the
      unwillingness of Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese to accept the situation could be mentioned
      as why the US became more deeply involved. Eventually, the United States was fighting a major
      conflict, supported on the ground by Australia and New Zealand and diplomatically by other allies.
      The Communists were supported by China, the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc in general.
      Following the Tet Offensive and Johnson’s decision to stand down in 1968, Nixon came to power.
      American withdrawal began with President Nixon’s Vietnamization policy from 1969. It ended
      with the defeat of South Vietnamese forces and the fall of Saigon to the Communists in 1975.
      There is wide scope for candidates to discuss the reasons why the US joined and why she left.
      Expect domestic issues – economic, social and political – to be mentioned too as reasons why the
      US left. The issue of “total failure” should be addressed and many students may challenge the
      assumption inherent in the question. Expect a wide range of material and reward all relevant
      comment.


18.   With reference to any two newly independent countries in South and Southeast Asia, compare
      and contrast the ways in which their governments dealt with the problem of creating national
      unity in the second half of the twentieth century.

      Candidates may choose any two newly independent countries in the region. Popular choices may
      be India, Pakistan, Vietnam or Indonesia. With reference to the chosen countries candidates may
      discuss the political tension that developed between the ideal of democratic institutions and the
      desire for strong government to prevent political divisions leading to partition and fragmentation.
      Ethnic and religious minorities existed to a greater or lesser extent in all countries of the region and
      for each country they posed a problem with regard to developing a sense of national unity.
      Candidates will need to compare and contrast the ethnic and cultural diversity within the two
      countries of their choice and provide evidence of the problems and difficulties this generated for the
      respective governments. Expect references to: integration or lack of occupations; areas of
      residence; political representation; religious observance; resistance; rebellion. Strong centralized
      government, often with military backing, was seen as a means of imposing a national ideology and
      maintaining national unity. In some cases the national identity may have been based on the culture
      and symbols of one group, in others a broader range of national symbols may have been
      incorporated. The impact of the rise of religious fundamentalism and terrorist groups may also be
      discussed. Each country will have its own particular issues. Many answers will focus on
      comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified. Reward reasoned discussion based on
      historical evidence.

      If only one country is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

19.   Describe the problems faced by Mao Zedong (Mao-Tse-tung) and the Chinese Communist
      Party in China between 1949 and 1959. To what extent were they able to solve these and
      establish China on a sound footing?

      This should be a popular question and requires a thorough knowledge and analysis of domestic and
      foreign factors and events over the period. In international terms, China played an active role and
      had gained international prestige. Candidates may mention the Korean War, China’s international
      role in the Non-Aligned Movement and its relations with the Soviet Union, but also its inability to
      attack Taiwan. Its domestic achievements include the period of reconstruction, land reform,
      the first Five Year Plan to 1957 and the Hundred Flowers Campaign 1956-7, which should both be
      seen in the context of the Great Leap Forward 1958 onwards. A balanced judgment should be
      arrived at despite the situation China found itself in economically by the end of the decade.


20.   “A strange mixture of economic reform and political rigidity characterized Deng Xiaoping’s
      (Teng Hsiao-p’ing’s) (1976–1997) rule in China.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates may initially discuss Deng Xiaoping’s (Teng Hsiao-P’ing’s) economic ideas that had
      caused him to be denounced and exiled during the Cultural Revolution. Further comment may be
      made about the brief power struggle after Mao Zedong’s (Mao Tse-tung’s) death which resulted in the
      emergence of Deng (Teng) as leader in 1978. Without ever openly criticizing Mao, he set about
      changing Mao’s policies and abandoned Maoism. The aims of his economic reforms were to
      stimulate China’s domestic economy and open Chinese trade to the outside world. His policy of the
      Four Modernizations was designed to improve agriculture, industry, science and technology and
      national defence. They aimed to create a modern Chinese state by 2000. Political reformers believed
      that a “Fifth Modernization”, political democracy, was required. This led to the pro-democracy
      movement and student unrest that resulted in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Deng (Teng)
      may have introduced economic reform, but he did not believe in political reform. He believed in the
      authority of the Chinese Communist Party as the only legitimate power. He wanted internal stability
      after the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution. His government treated dissidents harshly.

21.   Analyse the factors that contributed to the economic success of Japan in the second half of the
      twentieth century.

      Post-war Japan saw the introduction of reforms in a number of areas which radically changed the
      country, although in the immediate post-war period, the prospect for economic recovery looked
      bleak. Expect some reference to both internal and external factors that promoted economic success.
      Candidates may discuss the reforms such as those connected to labour and the new zaibatsu.
      American aid helped Japan’s recovery, with the US providing over $2 billion by 1952. The Korean
      War “boom” which helped stimulate industrial growth and trade in the decade afterwards,
      averaging almost 10 % growth per annum. The agricultural economy was boosted by more
      varied production, newer methods and new machinery, and that laid a base for a degree of
      self-sufficiency which helped Japanese society as well as the economy. Expect reference to the
      experienced and well-educated labour force and management. New industries had the latest
      machinery from the West. Economic growth continued into the 1960s and 1970s with Japan
      gaining a reputation for high quality goods which also contributed to their achievement.
      Japan’s economic success depended largely on foreign trade.

      Factors such as political stability and the security pact with the US meant that money could be spent
      on other aspects such as the economy, in order to stimulate growth and help provide capital for new
      investments. The Cold War actually aided Japan as the US sponsored liberal economic and political
      policies towards Japan. Candidates may refer to government stability and sound leadership which
      promoted economic success. Japan’s success led other Asian nations to copy the Japanese model
      and in the 1980s, the “Japanese miracle” was becoming the “Asian miracle”. Japanese investment
      in the same region also promoted economic success for Japan. Some candidates may refer to
      Japan’s disadvantages in raw materials and its dependency on imported energy as being indicators
      of why the high growth in the economy began to slow down in the late 1980s and, in the last
      decade, Japan’s economy declined as the “bubble” burst with Japan entering
      a recession. Expect reasonable coverage of the fifty-year time span indicated in the question and
      reward reasoned analysis based on evidence.


22.   Evaluate the social and economic development of one South Asian country in the second half
      of the twentieth century and show the extent to which these developments could be regarded
      as a success.

      Responses to this question require knowledge and analysis of social and economic development in
      any one country over the period. Some may adopt a descriptive approach for both social and
      economic developments but an evaluation of the policies must be present. Popular choices may
      well be India or Pakistan. A balanced judgment should be arrived at and reward initiative and
      sophisticated analysis based on appropriate evidence.

23.   In what ways, and with what results, did the role of women change in one country of the
      region in the second half of the twentieth century?

      Candidates should focus on one country in the region and should demonstrate knowledge of the
      changes in women’s roles and status in that country in the second half of the twentieth century.
      Candidates will need to provide specific factual detail and evidence of the results of these changes.
      Some candidates may initially discuss the roles and status of women in the chosen country earlier in
      the century in order to establish that there was considerable change in the second half. The ways in
      which women’s roles changed may be attributed to: education; greater social mobility; changing
      economic roles; access to new jobs and careers; living standards; rising expectations; government
      policies; international pressure. Changes in status came when there was a shift in social and
      cultural attitudes in society at large. The results of this may be: changes in family law; property
      rights; inheritance; political representation and participation; leadership; participation in religious
      and community affairs. Candidates may have different views as to the desirability of the changes,
      but should produce an argument based upon analysis and factual evidence.


24.   Analyse the social and economic impact of demographic changes in one country of the region
      since 1945.

      This may discuss immigration and emigration. Migrants are mostly young and productive and
      therefore movement away from a country may cause a demographic crisis with the population
      aging, which can cause economic problems: a shrinking group of an economically active population
      which has to finance a large inactive population. On the other hand, an influx of people into a
      country may boost the economy. Social structures refer to the distinctive, stable arrangement of
      institutions whereby human beings in a society interact and live together. Social structure is often
      treated together with the concept of social change, which deals with the forces that change the
      social structure and the organization of society. This could be taken with regard to the position of
      women in the region. Candidates could refer to social movement and to issues of population and
      migration. Education, literacy, poverty and any or all of these factors could be dealt with. Changes
      may impact the economy and the political structure but with attention primarily paid to social
      structures and internal consequences. Economic results, which are of the greatest importance for
      the development of countries, often go hand in hand with social changes. Reward initiative in the
      country chosen but expect an evaluation based on relevant historical and statistical evidence.
