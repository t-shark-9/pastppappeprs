Answer all the questions.

Refer to the Healthcare in an East African Country case study and to your own related research in
responding to the following questions.

1.    Define the following terms:

      (a)   bandwidth                                                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   embedded IT system.                                                                  [2 marks]


2.    (a)   With reference to the case study and to electronic medical record (EMR)
            management systems that you have studied, explain how compatibility
            issues may affect the development of an EMR management system
            in the East African country.                                                         [6 marks]

      (b)   With reference to the case study and to specific examples that you have studied,
            examine how telemedicine may help medical staff to provide a better service to
            patients living in remote areas.                                                     [8 marks]


3.    Once the hospital and the clinics have implemented an EMR management system,
      they will need to develop a suitable disaster recovery plan.

      Taking into consideration the special circumstances of the case study, and referring to
      the disaster recovery plans of other organizations, discuss the main points that should
      be included in a suitable disaster recovery plan.                                         [12 marks]
