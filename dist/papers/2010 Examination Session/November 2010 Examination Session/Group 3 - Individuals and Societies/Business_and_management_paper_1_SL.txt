Answer two questions from this section.

1.    (a)   N-Pharma is now a successful business, but it initially struggled: “poor cash
            flow meant that the early years were financially challenging” (lines 6–7).
            Outline two problems that Yukio Nakamura’s business start-up may have faced.       [4 marks]

      (b)   Construct a fully labelled Ansoff matrix to show N-Pharma’s possible
            growth strategies.                                                                 [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the value of “social and environmental audits” (line 107) to
            N-Pharma.                                                                          [7 marks]


2.    (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    span of control (line 60)                                                   [2 marks]

		          (ii)   empowerment (line 64).                                                      [2 marks]

      (b)   Comment on the effectiveness of Susan James’ leadership style in the
            Canadian subsidiary of N-Pharma.                                                   [4 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the appropriateness of a cost-based pricing strategy (line 29) for
            N-Pharma’s drugs.                                                                  [7 marks]


3.    (a)   Tadashi Agi has been appointed to the new post of “director of corporate
            social responsibility” (line 101). Outline two methods of recruitment that
            could have been used in this appointment.                                          [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain how Tadashi Agi could use new technologies within N-Pharma to
            communicate his ethical vision effectively with stakeholders (lines 105–106).      [4 marks]

      (c)   Tadashi Agi is now writing a “Charter of Ethics”, setting ethical objectives for
            N-Pharma (lines 102–103). Examine the reasons why organizations consider
            setting ethical objectives.                                                        [7 marks]
