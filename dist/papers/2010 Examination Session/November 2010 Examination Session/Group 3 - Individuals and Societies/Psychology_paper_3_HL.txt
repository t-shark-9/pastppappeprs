clearly label each part of their answer a and b.

1.    A questionnaire is to be used by a school administration to survey attitudes of parents
      towards the proposed introduction of lessons on birth control and sexually transmitted
      diseases.

      Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using e-mail as a means of obtaining
      research data for this specific survey.                                                   [10 marks]


2.    Contrast the use of a conversational interview with the use of a semi-structured
      interview for investigating the musical preferences of young people in their early
      adulthood.                                                                                [10 marks]


3.    (a)   Discuss how researcher expectancies that can occur in qualitative research may
            invalidate the findings.                                                             [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain precautions that could be taken to overcome the problem of researcher
            expectancies.                                                                        [6 marks]
