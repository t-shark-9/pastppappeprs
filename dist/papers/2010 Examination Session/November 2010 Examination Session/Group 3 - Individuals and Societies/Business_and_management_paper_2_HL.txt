Answer one question from this section.

1.    Dan Electro

      Dan Bowen is a sole trader who sells digital cameras directly to consumers. He owns an online
      business and all sales are processed electronically under the business name Dan Electro. The office,
      storage place and call centre are located together in an expensive and desirable city centre location.

      Dan started the business three years ago by borrowing a considerable amount of money from a bank.
      He used his residential property as collateral* for the loan.

      The cameras are bought and shipped from a reputable and reliable overseas supplier who charges
      a high price for good quality cameras and prompt transportation. Dan has to pay in advance for
      the cameras. Dan Electro’s customers are very loyal and see their purchase as good value
      for money. Repeat purchases comprise a large percentage of Dan Electro’s sales. Some customers
      have even indicated that they would pay a higher price for the cameras because of their quality
      and the good service he provides.

      Dan is now worried about the forecasted rise in interest rates, inflation and an increase in
      online competition. Dan Electro may face some cash flow difficulties in the coming years. He is
      considering various strategies in order to prevent such possible cash flow difficulties.

2.    BBT

      BBT is a well-established small private limited company specializing in online education, based in
      the United States. The owner and founder, Mark Davis, currently owns 100 % of the shares and
      enjoys complete freedom in the running of the company. The business employs three full-time staff
      who have been with the business for over six years.

      BBT has enjoyed many years of expansion in the provision of online education. Mark owns
      the copyright for his patented software, which provides him with a unique selling point (USP).
      However, the copyright will expire in the near future. Moreover, several rival companies have
      recently established a presence in the online education market.

      Mark has to raise finance to develop new educational software to maintain or improve his
      market position. His bank manager has refused to lend funds for the research and development
      (R&D) of the new software. He said “software has a short product life cycle, and your balance sheet
      has deteriorated”.

      Mark’s accountant has just presented the following financial information for BBT as of
      31 October 2010, which raised some working capital and liquidity issues.

		          (iii) Using financial and non-financial factors, explain why the bank manager
                  refused to finance the R&D of the new educational software.                   [6 marks]

      (c)   Examine two possible alternative sources of finance that Mark might use to
            fund the R&D of the new educational software.                                       [6 marks]

                                                     SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    The battle of the online search engines

      The online search engine market doubled from US$40 billion in 2008 to US$80 billion
      by 2010. Google, with the largest market share, benefited most from this growth. An executive
      from Microsoft, a market rival, says that the industry will be better served by having an alternative
      to the dominance of Google.

      Microsoft’s objective is to quickly gain a bigger share of the online search engine market by
      external growth. After pursuing unsuccessful internal growth strategies, Microsoft launched a
      US$45 billion hostile takeover bid for the search engine business Yahoo!.

      Yahoo! has many other services, such as e-mail. However, because of its lack of focus,
      Yahoo! has fallen behind Google. Yahoo! recently suffered a decline in profit causing its shares to fall
      by 40 %. As a consequence Yahoo! cut 1000 jobs.

      If successful, Microsoft’s takeover of Yahoo! will combine the second and the third largest
      companies in the online search engine market. This takeover would result in extensive job losses
      but also in cost savings of at least US$1 billion. Moreover, the combination of the two companies’
      engineering resources and expertise would expand the research and development (R&D) capability
      to produce more innovative services.

      The proposed takeover is likely to attract government investigation into the market share of the
      combined organizations. Together, Microsoft and Yahoo! would account for 35 % of the online
      search engine market.

      Yahoo! has so far been able to resist the takeover bid. Microsoft is now looking for alternative growth
      strategies such as mergers with other possible partners.

4.    World airlines are on alert

      Over the last two decades two business models have emerged in the airline industry:
      • budget airlines (also called “no frills” and “low cost”) that target price-conscious travellers who
        have a high price elasticity of demand
      • full service airlines that target travellers with lower price elasticity of demand who are willing to
        pay a higher price for more comfort and on-board services.

      With the global economic downturn the airline industry is suffering. Some airlines serving only
      business class passengers have gone into insolvency.

      The chief executive officer (CEO) of Ryanair, a budget airline, argues that costs will increase for
      all airlines and that the lowest price operators are more likely to survive. Customers will try to save
      money wherever possible. Moreover, 25 % of Ryanair passengers are business people who have
      adapted to the economic downturn by economizing. The period of expensive flights is over.

      However, the CEO of British Airways, a full service airline, disagrees. He said that budget
      airlines can no longer offer cheap tickets due to increasing fuel costs. The unique selling
      proposition (USP) of budget airlines will disappear. In contrast, he said, 40 % of British Airways
      customers are business passengers who have to keep flying. These passengers want high quality,
      highly differentiated and more expensive services. He believes that full service airlines are more
      likely to sustain their competitive advantage.

      Some market analysts argue that if fuel costs cause ticket prices to go up, budget airlines will have
      the advantage over full service airlines because of their smaller size and operational flexibility.

      Information on elasticity:
      • cross price elasticity of demand between airlines and other modes of transport (for example, car,
         train etc.): 0.5
      • income elasticity of demand for air travel: 3
      • price elasticity of demand for budget airlines: 1.9
      • average price elasticity of demand for first, business and economy class tickets for full service
         airlines: 0.95.

5.    Bricko Group

      Bricko Group is a Swedish company that sells its products in many countries around the world.
      It manufactures toys, with its best known product being the plastic building bricks known
      as “Bricko”. The company is a major employer in many Swedish towns. It takes pride in offering
      job security, generous benefits and a sense of family for its employees.

      Bricko Group is now facing the following problems:
      • increased competition in the toy market because other manufacturers can produce cheaper
         branded products
      • increased competition from other sectors such as online gaming
      • increased number of defective products
      • stricter health and safety regulations in the European Union (EU)
      • pressures from environmentalist groups in Sweden due to pollution from the production plants
      • lack of innovation and failure to launch new products in the past few years.

      In recent years Bricko Group has lost some of its market share. Bricko Group’s largest rival is
      Peppa Toys, which produces similar products. Peppa Toys has recently opened a new manufacturing
      plant that has doubled its production. Primary market research shows that Bricko Group has
      far better brand recognition but consumers prefer Peppa Toys’ lower prices. The directors at
      Bricko Group believe that developing brand loyalty will be essential to maintain its competitiveness.

      Quality assurance is an important aspect to Bricko Group, which is why the production manager
      wants to implement a Kaizen (continuous improvement) approach to manufacturing in Sweden.
      However, the financial manager is proposing to outsource the production facilities to Bangladesh so
      as to reduce costs. The research and development (R&D) department would remain in Sweden and
      would increase its activities.


      (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of primary market research for
            Bricko Group.                                                                        [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain two benefits and one limitation of a Kaizen approach to manufacturing
            for Bricko Group.                                                                    [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse the importance and role of branding for Bricko Group.                        [6 marks]

      (d)   Discuss the financial manager’s proposal “to outsource the production facilities
            to Bangladesh”.                                                                      [9 marks]
