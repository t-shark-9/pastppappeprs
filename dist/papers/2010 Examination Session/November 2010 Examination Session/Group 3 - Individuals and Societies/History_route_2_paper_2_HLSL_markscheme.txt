 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
        processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. The answer is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present
        though underdeveloped. An attempt to place events in historical context and show an
        understanding of historical processes is evident. Some attempt at a structured approach, either
        chronological or thematic has been made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and an understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and
        contrast where necessary is present. There may be some awareness of different approaches
        and interpretations. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific relevant knowledge is
        applied, and analysis or critical commentary is used appropriately to produce a focused
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and where appropriate, comparison and contrast. Awareness of different
        approaches may be shown and used to support the argumentation.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, show full awareness of the demands of the
        question and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed, accurate specific knowledge is used
        as evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and acknowledging and evaluating different interpretations
        are evident and are used to produce a level of argumentation which is convincing and at the
        highest level, insightful and revealing of a very sound grasp of the demands of the task.

Topic 1   Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   Examine the factors which hindered attempts at collective security after either the First
     World War or the Second World War.

     “Examine” requires identification of, and critical commentary on, those factors which may be
     considered as limiting the effectiveness/success of organizations tasked with implementing schemes
     of collective security. For post-1918, the League will be the institution for investigation and for
     post-1945, the United Nations Organization.

     For candidates who might select a narrower focus – for example Locarno after the First World War
     or NATO/Warsaw Pact after the Second World War – there has to be a clear explanation of
     how such organizations are involved with collective security, albeit on a regional rather than a
     global scale, such as the League or UNO.

     For factors which could be considered in relation to post-1918, candidates may refer to: structural
     problems of the organization which could inhibit effective implementation of collective security;
     the mood of revisionism/revanchism which poisoned international affairs; economic crises;
     the continuation of secret diplomacy and the pursuit of national interests of leading members of the
     organization; the lack of universality from the outset in terms of membership; the growth of
     totalitarianism and aggressive expansionism; the belief (rightly or wrongly at the time) of the
     efficacy of appeasement; etc. There is much to choose from, do not expect all, but credit especially
     answers which support claims made by reference to specifics/case studies where appropriate.

     For factors which could be considered in relation to post-1945, candidates may refer to: structural
     problems of the organization (e.g. the ability of Security Council powers to veto action);
     the re-emergence and intensification of ideological division post-1945 in the shape of the Cold War
     which led to the organization being used fitfully and/or infrequently in cases of international
     tension/conflict (Hungary, Cuba, Vietnam, etc.) even though it did intervene in earlier cases of
     threats to international peace (Korea); financial problems due to failure of member states to make
     contributions; etc. Again there is much to choose from and credit especially answers which support
     claims made by reference to specifics/case studies where appropriate.
                                                  –5–                N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Analyse the causes of either the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) or the Falklands/Malvinas
     War (1982).

     Whichever conflict is selected, better answers will consider the multi-causal nature of the war.
     A thematic approach would be a suitable approach for this type of question. The identification of
     causes should be accompanied however by an analysis of such causes. This means a level of
     critical commentary should be present in relation to the causes identified.

     For Spain, reference could be made to: the social and economic divisions which affected Spanish
     society in the early twentieth century and which were reflected in a political system heavily skewed
     in favour of vested interests pre-1931; the polarization of political life (1931–1936) as legislation
     challenging the established order was at first resented then repealed/resisted; the growth of political
     extremism of Left and Right mirroring not only events in Spain but divisions in Europe; the role of
     the army in Spain’s political life, the role and use of religion as an excuse for a “Crusade” against
     “Godless anticlericalists”; etc.

     For the Falklands/Malvinas war reference could be made to the linkage between domestic policies
     and foreign policy – there was a need for a war of distraction to deflect attention from a variety of
     social, economic and political problems associated with the military regime in Argentina.
     The historical claims to the islands and the way in which attempts had been made previously to
     bring up the issue of sovereignty without real success can also be investigated – as can the
     misreading of the intentions of Buenos Aires by London and the misreading by Buenos Aires of US
     attitudes (potential support or at least little serious objection) towards possible action.
                                                  –6–                N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   With reference to two civil wars, compare and contrast the importance of ideology in
     (a) causing the civil war, and (b) attracting outside involvement.

     The most popular choices are likely to be Russia, China (in terms of either the longer-term
     interpretation 1927–1949 or the more chronologically limited period 1946–1949), Spain, Korea
     and Vietnam. In the case of the latter two it is expected that the civil war dimension has to be
     clearly explained at the outset.

     Ideology – the belief system governing views on social, economic and political life – should be
     clearly identified in relation to whichever civil wars are chosen. It is worth noting that the issue of
     ideology is raised in context of its importance in causation and outside involvement which does
     offer the opportunity for candidates to note other factors which may be considered important in
     either or both wars.

     In most examples no doubt the Left/Right or conservative/progressive division which characterizes
     rival sides will be accurately identified and explained. In some cases, ideological banners were the
     symbols under which sides gathered support and fought, e.g. in Russia 1917–1918 and 1921–1922
     or in Spain 1936–1939. These views regarding the social, political and economic goals of the
     combatants should be made clear and the extent to which the issues were responsible for initiating
     civil war commented upon.

     In the question of outside involvement, depending upon the wars there needs to be clear and
     accurate identification of which outside interests became involved and why and when. In some
     cases ideological similarities could be seen as attracting support but often outside interests were
     motivated by other factors – whether strategic, economic, military or simply pure opportunism in
     the hope of taking advantage of the ills of the state convulsed by civil conflict to pursue a policy of
     territorial aggrandizement.

     If only one civil war is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                   –7–                N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   In what ways, and for what reasons, did technological developments affect the nature and the
     outcome of two twentieth century wars, each chosen from a different region?

     Technological developments may be taken to mean developments in weapons technology and in
     terms of any technology which has been adapted to, or developed for, military use.

     The most popular choices are likely to be consideration of the First World War of 1914–1918 which
     provides examples of a variety of technological improvements and technical innovations which had
     a significant impact on the nature of the war (the strategy, the casualties, the logistical demands, the
     necessity for an increased home front commitment, the duration, etc.) and allows for consideration
     as to whether such developments on their own – or in conjunction with other factors – were
     responsible for deciding the result.

     The Second World War is likely to prove a popular choice with developments in air power, tanks,
     submarines and aircraft carriers alongside the atomic bomb being the most obvious areas of
     treatment. Sonar, radar, encrypting machines and improved mass production techniques in industry
     on the home fronts could be mentioned.

     Other choices may be the war(s) in Indochina or other wars in which guerrilla warfare played a role
     in shaping the outcome politically and militarily. In such cases technology applied by one side was
     largely unsuccessful in dealing with the irregular warfare fought by the opposition.

     Some candidates may examine the role of increasingly sophisticated computer aided, precision
     strikes carried out in wars in the later part of the twentieth century.

     Answers, regardless of the choice of wars, require some assessment of how and why the practice of
     war and its outcomes can be linked to technology.

     If only one war or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                   –8–                N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   “In twentieth century total war, victory depended as much on the contribution of the
     home front as developments on the military front.” To what extent do you agree with
     this statement?

     A definition of total war and a brief explanation of what constitutes the home front would be a
     useful introduction to such a question with reference to the social and economic mobilization of the
     civilian population to support the war effort. Similarly, the military front could be defined:
     the sectors of air/sea/land forces which participated in the actual physical conflict. Depending on
     the conflict chosen the opportunity arises to discuss the nature and extent of each front
     (its contributions physically, materially, psychologically to the eventual outcome).

     In the case of a total war or war of attrition fought by one or both sides, the interrelationship of the
     two fronts is obvious – the war effort was a combination of both. War material, as provided by the
     home front, allowed the participating powers to undertake a prolonged conflict. When resources
     were no longer able to be produced then the ability of the participant to continue was affected.

     The First World War and the Second World War are likely to be the most popular choices. Some
     candidates may use Vietnam as an example of total war, certainly on the part of the Vietcong/North
     Vietnamese war effort.

     This question could be answered successfully by focusing on one conflict. Some candidates may
     choose to illustrate their answers by reference to more than one example.
                                                   –9–                N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

6.   For what reasons, and with what results, did war occur either between India and Pakistan
     (1947–1971) or between Iran and Iraq (1980–1988)?

     The response requires consideration of the reasons/causes for the selected example plus coverage of
     the consequences of the war(s). Consequences or results can be linked to specific results for the
     populations (civil and military) involved as well as the economic and political repercussions for the
     governments involved. The impact of the specific conflict on a wider regional or global stage can
     also be included in any consideration of results.

     The Indo–Pakistan period encompasses three physical conflicts over the period though arguably the
     preconditions for the first clash formed the basis for the subsequent wars, even though specific
     issues such as Kashmir or the support for East Pakistan/Bangladesh are specific to individual
     conflicts. For both India and Pakistan the results can be assessed in terms of economic and military
     consequences as well as diplomatic realignments of both states on a regional basis. The physical
     alterations to borders along with the political ramifications for the respective leaders of the states –
     whether the performance of their respective state led to popular support for the leader, or not –
     could be investigated.

     The war between Iraq and Iran from 1980–1988 could be examined in relation to causation by
     examination of the two regimes prior to the outset of war and investigation of the political and
     economic motives which led to conflict. Border disputes (with the desire for control of the oil rich
     area of Khuzestan) tied up with the desire of each power to establish regional hegemony in the Gulf
     area could be linked to the internal weaknesses of Iran which had recently undergone
     (1979 Khomeini) a revolution. The irritation of Iraq caused by Iranian appeals to Iraq’s Shiite
     majority (55 %) to overthrow Sadam Hussein’s secular dictatorship can also be considered in
     explanations of the Iraqi invasion of Iran in 1980.

     Results could include the physical loss of life and the devastation wreaked upon the economies of
     both participants, as well as the fall in oil production in both states. The financial and military
     support for Iraq from Kuwait (and other Gulf states), Egypt and Jordan was matched by support for
     Iran from Syria, Libya, Algeria and South Yemen. The Soviet Union, France and the US also
     provided aid to Iraq.

Topic 2   Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   “Proportional representation and coalition government were intended to produce stability and
     fair representation, yet proved fatal for democracy in Germany between 1919 and 1933.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     An understanding/explanation of what is meant by coalition government and the principle of
     proportional representation might be a good starting point – or certainly might be made clear for the
     candidate’s benefit as well as the examiner at the outset.

     Knowledge of the period 1919–1933 in Germany should be sound, though often the emphasis of
     study for candidates is less the constitutional, economic and political travails of Weimar than
     treatment of the period as little more than the inevitable prelude to National Socialism and Adolf
     Hitler.

     There should be some knowledge of the principles upon which the Weimar constitution was based,
     the circumstances in which it was founded and an appreciation of the problems (economic, political
     and social) which it encountered from birth. Some reference to the classic “golden era” from
     1924–1929 might reveal that Weimar’s constitutional system did function effectively until the onset
     of economic crisis and its corollary, a rise of political extremism.

     No doubt candidates in some cases might try to turn this into a rise of Hitler question but the
     emphasis is on examination of the constitutional principles as well as a consideration of whether the
     principles themselves were ill-advised or whether the principles were misused/abused by
     individuals and interest groups for their own reasons during and, particularly towards the end of,
     the period.
                                                – 11 –             N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.   In what ways, and with what success, did one of the following states deal with social and
     economic problems: India 1947–1964; Argentina 1983–1995; South Africa 1991–2000?

     Identification of specific social, economic and political problems at the outset would provide a
     sound basis for development.

     For India social problems could refer to class/caste divisions and how they were addressed,
     religious division, the question of women’s rights in relation to suffrage and marriage/divorce.
     Economic problems could deal with the agrarian base of society and the inequitable division of
     land, methods of cultivation, poor distribution of resources, industrial development and economic
     goals/planning and the extent to which these were realized. Political problems could include:
     reference to the initial communal massacres accompanying the partition of the subcontinent; the
     question of sovereignty over Hyderabad, Kashmir and Goa; the linguistic question which threatened
     to antagonize the southern states in particular; etc.

     For Argentina the period covers the return to constitutional rule under Alfonsin and the UCR
     (after the military junta headed by Videla, Viola, Bignone and Galtieri) and then Menem from 1989
     until 1995.

     Social, economic and political problems could include: the attempt to deal with the legacy of the
     “dirty war” which was responsible for abuses of human rights including 30 000 persons who were
     “disappeared” or reference to those forced into exile. Reference could be made to the establishment
     of CONADEP (the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons). The passing of the
     Ley de Punto Final of 1986 intended to grant amnesty for all acts committed prior to December
     1983 in a sense however mitigated the extent to which a thoroughgoing investigation was likely to
     produce charges. Attempts were made by Alfonsin to assert civilian control over the military with
     mixed success and bitterness on the part of the military. Alfonsin’s government was replaced by
     that of Menem who tried to reduce the role of the state in economic life. Facing the legacy of
     corruption and with problems of inflation Menem privatized many industries previously
     nationalized by Perón and was willing to use presidential powers to push his programme of reform.

     For South Africa the period covers the release of Mandela (1990) by Nationalist leader De Klerk
     and the negotiations of these two along with Buthelezi and others to plan the transition from an
     apartheid system to a government elected by all races. Political problems could include the
     differing views and violence between Mandela’s ANC and the Inkatha movement and the resistance
     by some whites to the transition to majority rule. The first democratic elections (1994) produced a
     62 % majority for the ANC with Mandela as president.

     Challenges to the development of the state could include reference to the lack of experience of
     many of the new black middle class elite who also indulged in nepotistic practices,
     affirmative action programmes which led to a white exodus in key areas, disruption in industry and
     agriculture, rising rates of crime and the demands on the new government to deal with a variety of
     problems including housing, the provision of clean water, devaluation of the currency, the AIDS
     pandemic, etc.

     If only social or economic problems are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                  – 12 –              N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.    For what reasons, and with what results, were democratic (multiparty) states threatened by
      political extremism?

      Political extremism may be seen as extremism in the shape of movements within the state which
      sought to undermine the rule of law and majority rule, or, some candidates may interpret the
      question as referring to external threats. Allow both interpretations.

      The nature and extent of the extremist movement needs to be identified along with its aims.
      The focus is on how the democratic (multiparty) state attempted to deal with the problems presented
      by such movements.

      Answers which dwell on events within the last ten years cannot be credited. Where reference may
      be made to, for example, “the war against terror”, it is important that current affairs do not replace
      an historical perspective.

      Some candidates may choose Weimar since it could fit well into this question, but there is a
      possibility of choosing states such as Spain 1931–1936, France 1958–1969, Great Britain 1969–
      1990 for example. All would provide examples of democratic states which faced challenges due to
      extremist movements within their own borders. Accept however as legitimate, any state which is
      democratic and which has been challenged by politically extreme groups.


10.   By what methods, and with what success, did one democratic (multiparty) state attempt to
      ensure equality of opportunity in two of the following areas: employment; health; education?

      Any democratic (multiparty) state may be selected but two areas need to be considered.

      For each area noted areas for consideration could be the existing situation which rendered state
      intervention necessary to ensure equality of opportunity – i.e. what were the barriers to such
      equality which needed to be dismantled, which groups suffered from discrimination or lack of
      opportunity, and why. What methods, e.g. specific legislation, were introduced to redress the
      inequality of opportunity? To what extent were the methods accepted and what were the effects
      upon the target groups if they are categorized as social class, ethnic, religious, gender, etc.?

      If only one area is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                   – 13 –              N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


11.   Compare and contrast the movements for the attainment of civil rights in two democratic
      (multiparty) states.

      Civil rights movements may be taken to mean those movements which sought to end discrimination
      in relation to race, religion, gender or class. Such discrimination could be seen in terms of political,
      economic and social spheres where groups were excluded from full equality of treatment.

      The movements selected could be compared and contrasted in relation to their organization, the
      specific areas of concern, the methods used to gain civil rights and the extent to which the
      movements were successful in fulfilling their aims.

      One popular choice is likely to be the Civil Rights Movement in the US, whereby African-
      Americans sought to end segregation and racial discrimination in the fields of politics (suffrage),
      education and employment, for example. Examples of movements such as the NAACP, CORE,
      the work of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael could be considered along
      with their methods of agitation and subsequent legislation in the 1950s and 1960s in particular.
      Affirmative action as seen in the case of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 may also be considered.

      Other examples could be seen in the case of Northern Ireland for example, where the struggle for
      equality was undertaken by a variety of methods, often violent from the late 1960s especially – or in
      any democratic (multiparty) state where an aggrieved section of the population has attempted to
      gain redress of real or perceived grievances in specific areas.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

12.   Assess the extent to which the main political and economic developments in Japan
      (1945–1952) were the result of Cold War fears.

      The occupation period as well as being an opportunity for the victorious allies to demilitarize,
      organize war crimes trials and break-up the zaibatsu (industrial combines) also resulted in a
      significant reorganization of Japan’s political and economic structure. The Supreme Commander
      Allied Powers (SCAP), under Generals MacArthur and Ridgeway, sought to establish democratic
      rights and institutions as a way of preventing a revival of militarism.

      Candidates, in relation to political developments, could refer to the Japanese constitution of 1947 in
      which the role of the Emperor as symbol of the state (deriving his position from the will of the
      people) is clearly stated along with the establishment of a bicameral Diet elected by universal
      suffrage. Some candidates may explain the respective importance of the House of Representatives
      and the House of Councillors. A Supreme Court was to decide on whether laws infringed
      constitutional provisions/rights and courts were independent of control by the Ministry of Justice.
      Reference could be made to the guarantees of human rights, freedom of speech, religion,
      association and the improvement in the position of women in terms of suffrage and rights within
      marriage.

      Economic developments could include coverage of legislation designed to improve the rights of
      workers (Trade Union Law 1945, Labour Standards Law 1947), land reform which by 1950 was
      responsible for redistribution of the holdings of absentee landlords to tenants and developments
      after 1947–1948 as earlier changes were altered and emphasis was placed on encouraging a revival
      of Japan industrially. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was established
      under US guidance to deal with economic recovery and a series of policies introduced to stimulate
      economic growth: an end to previous policies to abolish the zaibatsu; fixing of the dollar/yen
      exchange rate to promote currency stability.

      Reasons for the original implementation of political programmes by SCAP and the changes
      especially in the economic development of Japan by 1947–1948 should be explained and linked to
      the growing international tensions which generated anxiety in Washington and allowed for a
      re-think of Japan’s economic, political (and even military) future in a Cold War world (Maritime
      Safety Force established in 1948, Self Defence Force in 1952). The outbreak of the Korean War –
      a proxy war amongst other things – and its significance for Japan could be considered.

Topic 3     Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   “The rise to power of right-wing authoritarian or single-party leaders was due to fear of
      the Left.” With reference to two right-wing leaders, to what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The most popular choices are likely to be Mussolini and Hitler, although Franco may be selected as
      a suitable example. It is not uncommon for some candidates to ignore the term “right-wing” or
      simply be confused about the difference between right and left and accordingly write about
      Communist/Socialist single-party leaders. No credit can be given in such circumstances.

      A thematic approach is possibly the most appropriate way to tackle the question rather than an
      end-on/sequential treatment with some brief concluding points which deal with the task implicitly
      for the most part. The focus is “fear of the Left”, however, and candidates should not ignore this
      and simply choose to write about everything else. The nature and extent of the Left and groups who
      resented its presence and/or rise need to be identified even if it is subsequently argued that the fear
      of the Left was not significant or at best marginal in the rise of the Right.

      The “to what extent” invitation does permit examination of other factors which can be considered
      important. Some themes for identification (depending on the leaders selected) could be: popular
      disillusionment due to an unsatisfactory peace settlement; frustration with the current government
      (and why); economic crises; the appeal of the programmes/ideologies of the aspiring leaders; the
      support of vested interests keen to use the movements and aspiring leaders for their own purposes;
      the use of violence, propaganda; etc. There is much to choose from but do not expect all of
      the above.

      If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


14.   In what ways, and with what success, did either Castro or Mao attempt to establish a
      totalitarian state after coming to power?

      A sound introduction to such a question could be to provide a clear definition of what is understood
      by the term “totalitarian”. For some candidates it may go no further than simply the setting up of
      a single-party state and the abolition of other political parties. Better explanations will extend the
      definition to cover the attempt, in a wider variety of fields – economic, social, cultural and
      educational – to control the lives of the population and stifle the potential for opposition.

      The question requires an identification of “ways” – the methods used to implement total control.
      Such methods could consist of the use of police-state repression to atomize society, censorship,
      propaganda and indoctrination through schools and labour organizations set up to destroy the
      independence of organized labour – or in offering genuine material rewards which might appeal to
      sections of the population, (employment, social welfare programmes, etc.). Demonization of
      specified groups can be covered noting their use as scapegoats to both terrify and/or gain popular
      support.

      The extent to which totalitarianism, i.e. effective control was established, including the cowing or
      elimination of opposition needs to be addressed.
                                                  – 16 –              N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


15.   Examine the role of either education or the arts in one left-wing and one right-wing
      authoritarian/single-party state.

      Education can be interpreted as the use of formal school systems and youth movements organized
      outside school hours. Education in the sense of indoctrination/inculcating values desired by the
      single-party state can also include measures implemented amongst the adult population through
      organizations established to monitor the social and leisure activities of the population
      (e.g. Dopolavoro in Italy and Strength Through Joy in Germany).

      Education is not necessarily only to be understood as political indoctrination, single-party states
      also introduced programmes intended to strengthen the state in terms of industry and technology.
      Here literacy programmes and specialized training in engineering, science and medicine could be
      considered depending on the states chosen.

      The arts should be seen in the wider context of painting, sculpture, literature, cinema, theatre, etc.
      Specific examples to support the arguments are necessary. Do not expect coverage of all the
      aforementioned fields of artistic endeavour but there should be awareness of the aims of art under a
      single-party regime.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


16.   Analyse the methods used to maintain power by either Perón or Stalin.

      The focus is the rule and not the rise of an authoritarian or single-party leader. Answers which
      dwell on rise cannot score well. Domestic and foreign policies are appropriate fields
      of investigation.

      Methods are possibly best addressed in a thematic structure. These could include, depending on the
      leader selected: the use of a force against opposition groups and over the population generally to
      deter potential resistance; the fostering of a cult of personality as part of a larger propaganda
      campaign; economic and social welfare programmes (employment policies, land distribution,
      educational opportunities); the pursuit of an adventurous foreign policy to distract the population’s
      attention from the ills of the regime and/or to raise a spirit of nationalism which could be used by
      the leader; etc.

      Answers require specific detail to convincingly substantiate the answer. Since the task is to
      analyse, critical comment as to the effectiveness of such methods is required.

17.   Evaluate the contribution to the rise to power of Hitler of each of the following: National
      Socialist ideology; the use of force; economic crises.

      This is likely to be a very popular question. The structure of the response is already provided by the
      phrasing of the question.

      Candidates need to show the main elements of national socialist ideology clearly (these can relate to
      domestic as well as foreign policy goals, for example in the context of revisionism/revanchism/
      irredentism). Whether the appeal of ideology was great from the outset (and why) or whether
      ideology was particularly appealing at specific times (and why) could be addressed.

      The use of force in the mobilization of paramilitary formations by the Nazis (amongst others) and
      attempts to overturn the existing system violently (1923) could be addressed along with
      commentary as to the consequences (short-term and longer-term for the party). There is a marked
      difference in strategy pre- and post-1924/5.

      Economic crises – in the context of hyperinflation in 1923, and the period of the Great Depression
      from 1929, will no doubt form the basis for the third part of this question. Knowledge is not only
      required of the impact of these crises upon the nation but is also required in relation to the fortunes
      of the Hitler movement.

      Since the invitation is to evaluate there is an expectation that critical commentary will be provided
      which seeks to ascertain, for example, the relative importance of these factors.

      There is no need to identify and dwell upon other factors. The question does not ask “to what
      extent”.

      If only one of the required areas is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. If only two of
      the areas required are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


18.   Compare and contrast either economic policies or the treatment of minorities in two
      authoritarian or single-party states, each chosen from a different region.

      Economic policies could be investigated in terms of their aims, how they were implemented and the
      extent to which they attained the targets set by the single-party regime. Whether the policies were
      linked to centralized state planning (command economies) or whether they were largely undertaken
      in tandem with existing private enterprise could be investigated. Emphasis will no doubt be put on
      industrial and agrarian programmes and their nature, extent and success.

      Minorities can be seen as ethnic, religious or racial groups which became targets for the single-party
      regime. In the case of the USSR under Stalin if chosen, accept the kulaks as a minority, albeit a
      “class” as opposed to an ethnic or racial minority.

      No doubt Hitler’s persecution of the Jewish population in Germany will be a popular choice but
      treatment of the issue should not dwell overly on the horrors of the Holocaust.

      Women cannot be considered a minority and no credit can be awarded if this group is chosen.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Topic 4     Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
            Eastern European states

19.   In what ways, and with what results, did the two world wars affect the growth of
      independence movements in one African or one Asian state?

      This question requires reference to the impact of both the First World War and the Second World
      War on the independence movements with attention to “in what ways” and “with what results”.
      Candidates may structure their answers in a variety of ways, but all parts need to be addressed for
      high marks to be awarded. It is likely that candidates will refer to the ways and results of each war
      in turn. For First World War “ways”, candidates may refer to: the creation of mandates;
      the experience of colonial troops that were used to fight in the various theatres of war; the legacy of
      the Fourteen Points with its promise of self-determination. For “results”, there could be some
      discussion of the mandate system and the classification of African and Asian mandates as being
      unlikely to achieve independence in the near future; the disappointment felt by nationalists such as
      Ho Chi Minh who were ignored at Versailles; the establishment of nationalist movements in India,
      Indochina; etc. For Second World War, “ways” could include: the weakening of France and
      Britain; the legacy of Japanese occupation; the promise made to grant Indian independence; etc.
      For “results”, candidates could consider the increased readiness of Britain to retreat from the
      Empire; the influence of the US in encouraging self-determination; the Cold War that gave extra
      leverage to communist movements; etc. There is much to be discussed here, but do not expect all of
      the above.

      If only one war is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


20.   Compare and contrast the reasons for political instability following decolonization in one
      African and one Asian ex-colonial state.

      This is an open question that allows candidates to choose their own examples. There could be a
      comparison/contrast here of a number of relevant factors including: a colonial legacy of limited
      democratic experience; an unbalanced economy due to over-reliance on primary production of a
      few commodities subject to price fluctuations on the world markets; the concentration of political
      power in the hands of a colonial trained elite; tribal loyalties; religious divisions; the impact of Cold
      War rivalries; and neo-colonialism. All could contribute to a wide-ranging discussion. More than
      one state must be chosen. China, however, would not be a suitable example.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].
                                                 – 19 –             N10/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

21.   To what extent did economic problems contribute to the dissolution of Yugoslavia?

      Although there is no start date for this question, candidates will probably begin with the death of
      Tito in 1980, although some discussion of the economic situation in Yugoslavia prior to that may
      well be relevant and add depth to the answer. The question asks directly about the economic
      situation and so this ought to be dealt with in some detail. Expect some reference to the poor
      economic situation of Yugoslavia during the 1980s, with its significant national debt. The struggle
      to meet the interest payments could be mentioned along with the impact of the more general
      recession in Western Europe, including the return of Yugoslav “guest workers” thus adding to the
      problem of unemployment. The North–South divide could be mentioned with the growing
      reluctance of Croatia and Slovenia to fund the poorer regions. This could lead into some discussion
      of ethnicity and how economic inequality could be linked to ethnic conflict in Kosovo, for instance.
      Candidates should consider other factors, however and to assess “to what extent” the economic
      problems were at the root of the dissolution of the state. Problems, other than the economy,
      that could be mentioned include: the death of Tito and the failure to replace him with an equally
      charismatic, unifying leader; and the resurgence of Slovene and Croatian nationalism (although this
      could also be linked to economic issues). Expect some mention of the 1986 Memorandum and the
      role played by Slobodan Milosevic in reviving Serb nationalism. There is much that could be said
      about the emergence of multiparty systems of government in Slovenia and Croatia and the
      involvement of Germany as an economic investor in both countries. This could be linked to the
      question and an analysis of how economics influenced nationalism and calls for autonomy may be
      attempted. Expect candidates to go as far as 1990, although some may choose to go beyond that.
      A detailed account of the Balkan Wars is not required, although it could be argued that the
      “dissolution” was not complete until the wars were over. When the wars are included,
      reward relevant, well-supported analysis rather than descriptive/narrative structures.


22.   To what extent was one post-communist Central or Eastern European state successful in
      addressing the problems it faced?

      The focus of this question will be on the period after the collapse of communist rule.
      Candidates could begin by identifying the problems to be tackled by the new government before
      going on to determine how successfully they were tackled. Possible problems could include:
      the transition to a free market economy; the re-introduction of democratic institutions and a
      multiparty state; the need to acknowledge and to determine how best to address the crimes of the
      past regime; the question of minorities; future alliances either with the EU and NATO or with the
      former Soviet Union. How successfully such problems were addressed could include: an analysis
      of efforts made to accustom the population to a democratic system through the use of education and
      through the media; economic measures to ensure the availability of goods; a cap on the price of
      basic foodstuffs; and the opening of archives to allow access to previously hidden information.
      The passing of laws to safeguard the rights of minorities may also be relevant. It is necessary for
      candidates to address “to what extent” the state was successful in the application of these methods.
      Depending on which state is chosen, there is much to discuss and a good level of detail will be
      expected to support the points made.

23.   Assess the contribution of Gandhi to the emergence of an independent India and Pakistan.

      This is likely to be a popular question and candidates should have a good knowledge of Gandhi’s
      contributions to the independence of India. Candidates could discuss: his promotion of peaceful
      resistance; his attempts to downplay religious differences; his willingness to endure imprisonment;
      and his considerable charisma. Also, candidates would be expected to consider events such as the
      salt march, the Quit India campaign and other specific methods organized by Gandhi. Other factors
      that may also be discussed include: the acceptance by Britain of the inevitability of independence;
      political organizations such as the Congress Party; and the leadership of Nehru and Jinnah.


24.   “The overthrow of Communist regimes in Central and Eastern Europe would not
      have succeeded without strong, charismatic leaders.” With reference to two leaders, to what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will probably choose Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, as examples of leaders who
      were able to define and lead opposition groups in Poland and Czechoslovakia, respectively.
      Reference could be made to Charter 77 and Solidarity and the extent to which these
      organizations/movements were able to organize and to publicize opposition to the communist
      regimes. There could be some discussion of the widespread (or not) support they received and the
      methods used to publicize their campaigns.

      Candidates may also consider that Solidarity, arguably, was better known and received wider
      support than Charter 77 and that this was a reflection of the nature of the relationship between the
      people and the state in Poland and Czechoslovakia. To address “to what extent” candidates may
      also suggest that, in the GDR, Hungary, Romania or Bulgaria, for instance, the presence of
      charismatic leaders was less important.

      Other factors that brought about the overthrow of the regimes may also be introduced and could
      include: economic crises; support from Western European governments; the example of Gorbachev’s
      policies of perestroika and glasnost; the role of the Church; etc.

      Some candidates may attempt a comparative structure that could be used to good effect but this is
      not required.

      If only one state or leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 5    The Cold War

25.   Compare and contrast the roles of Truman and Stalin in the breakdown of East–West
      relations.

      Candidates may seize this opportunity to discuss the role of personalities in the outbreak of the
      Cold War.

      For “compare”
       Both Truman and Stalin led countries that had only just emerged from a period of total war
        against the Axis powers;
       Both leaders were anxious to bring about a period of economic recovery;
       Both saw their countries as the new superpowers;
       Both were eager to stamp their authority on the new world order;
       Both were prepared to expand their sphere of influence in post-war Europe;
       Both left behind a pre-war policy of isolationism for their countries;
       Both used propaganda to demonize the “enemy”.

      For “contrast”
       Stalin led a country devastated by war; Truman led a country that was unscathed;
       Truman was less experienced in international diplomacy; Stalin was a veteran of the wartime
        conferences;
       Truman’s USA had a nuclear arsenal; Stalin’s USSR did not have the “A” bomb until 1949;
       Truman had to persuade the US Congress to support his policies; Stalin was the authoritarian
        leader of the USSR.

      Arguments should be well-supported with accurate knowledge of policies and it is likely that
      the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, COMECON, COMINFORM, the Berlin Blockade, etc. will
      be mentioned.

      If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

26.   Assess the impact of either the Vietnam War (1964–1975) or the Afghanistan War
      (1979–1988) on the development of the Cold War.

      This question requires candidates to consider how either of these wars impacted upon the Cold War.
      Vietnam should be a popular choice and the dates should help candidates to avoid confusion with
      the Indochina War. It is expected that this war should be well-known although a narrative of events
      will not score well unless there is relevant analysis. Possible responses may place the Vietnam War
      in its historical context with reference to the Sino–Soviet split. Despite this, support was given by
      both the USSR and China to North Vietnam whilst the US supported the South.
      The war clearly increased tension and there was concern that expansion of the conflict would result
      in a third world war. The unpopularity of the war in both the US and Europe certainly encouraged
      the search for peace that, in turn, contributed to the policy of détente. So, US relations with both
      the USSR and China were influenced by the need for a withdrawal strategy. Some candidates may
      mention the refusal of NATO powers to send troops to Vietnam and how this weakened ties
      between Western Europe and the US.

      The Afghanistan War is a new area for this topic and this question will give candidates an
      opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of this conflict. Again, détente comes into the frame
      as this war signalled the end of this policy and led to a worsening of relations between the US and
      the USSR. Expect good knowledge of the reasons for Soviet intervention and for US support of the
      rebel mujahedeen. There is much to discuss from the boycotting of the Moscow and Los Angeles
      Olympics to the “Second Cold War” of the early 1980s. Furthermore, candidates should consider
      the influence of the conflict on Soviet policy under Gorbachev.


27.   For what reasons, and with what results, did the Sino–Soviet split influence the Cold War?

      The question requires a good knowledge of Sino–Soviet relations and an understanding of why
      these soured by the early 1960s. For “reasons”, some candidates will begin with Khrushchev’s
      secret speech of 1956, or even the Korean War. Others may begin later with the withdrawal of
      technical support by the USSR. Many interpretations of the causes of the split may be considered
      and some candidates may even argue that relations between Mao and Stalin were respectful rather
      than warm, laying the ground for a deepening of hostility after the death of the Soviet leader.
      Rivalry over the leadership of the communist world should be considered, as should ideological
      differences. Personalities may also be discussed, especially with regard to Mao and Khrushchev.

      There is room for candidates to continue as far as the death of Mao and some may go further,
      for example to the end of the 1970s.

      For “results” expect some analysis of the border conflicts along the Ussuri River, as well as China’s
      criticism of Soviet policy towards the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Prague Spring. Vietnam may
      also be discussed as well as the impact of the split on the development of détente.

28.   “The US and the USSR were successful in their efforts to maintain their spheres of influence
      between 1950 and 1962.” To what extent do you agree with this assertion?

      The focus here is on the period from the Korean War to the Cuban Missile Crisis with opportunities
      for candidates to demonstrate their knowledge of the Cold War during this time. For the US,
      possible topics to be discussed include Korea, Guatemala, Indochina, Cuba and the Middle East.
      For the USSR, there could be discussion of Hungary, Poland, East Germany (and Berlin).
      Candidates will be required to address “To what extent” and so will be expected to analyse attempts
      made to limit both the spread of the opposing ideology and to maintain spheres of interest.
      Arguably, the US held the line in Korea, secured Guatemala and lost Cuba (although they got the
      missiles removed). The USSR held on to Poland and Hungary, compromised on Berlin etc.
      Some candidates may choose to use a comparative structure and this could work effectively but it is
      not a requirement.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


29.   To what extent was the breakdown of the Soviet Union by 1991 due to economic causes?

      A good knowledge of the factors that impacted the breakdown of the Soviet Union should be
      demonstrated by candidates who choose this question. Economic causes could include: the
      slowdown in the growth of the Soviet economy; the difficulty of changing a system that was so
      entrenched, subject to central planning and fundamentally linked to the ideology of communism.
      Mention could be made of efforts by Andropov and Gorbachev to introduce some measure of
      reform but to little avail. The economic problems of the Eastern European satellite states would
      also be relevant as well as the impact these had upon demands for political change leading to the
      revolutions of 1989. The economic burden of the war in Afghanistan would also be an important
      factor, along with the pressure placed upon the Soviet economy by the continuing arms race.
      “To what extent” could be addressed by a reference to the political changes that accompanied
      Gorbachev’s efforts to push through perestroika and how these led to an upsurge in nationalism
      within the USSR. Similarly, some reference could be made to the impact that political change in
      Eastern Europe had upon the Soviet Union. The role of Ronald Reagan could also be discussed and
      the extent to which his outspending the Soviet Union on arms was the final straw. The failure of the
      Soviet Union to evolve technologically in the computer age may also be mentioned along with the
      implications of this for its armed forces.

30.   Analyse the social and economic impact of the Cold War on two countries, each chosen from a
      different region.

      This is a general question that allows candidates to choose two countries and to discuss social and
      economic changes that were influenced by the Cold War. If the countries chosen were from
      Western Europe, for instance, it is likely that there would be some discussion of the welfare state or
      the nationalization of key industries, etc. that could be mentioned as attempts to improve working
      conditions and to alleviate poverty levels. If the US were to be selected as one of the countries,
      there may be more focus on issues such as anti-communism and changes in education policies
      motivated by the Cold War etc. If the USSR or China were chosen, expect some mention of
      planned economies, limited consumer choice, the influence of ideology on education, culture, etc.
      Expect detail and good knowledge for the highest marks.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
