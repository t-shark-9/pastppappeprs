             an explanation of reasons for differences which may include:
             – natural factors
             – human factors
             – physical capital and technological factors
             – various institutional factors.

           Answers may include:
             illustration of growth using a PPC diagram
             reference to the Harrod-Domar growth model
             effects on growth of different strategies, e.g. export-led versus import
             substitution
             reference to the compound nature of growth in the effects of varying growth
             rates over time
             examples of particular countries.

           Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
