1.   (a)   (i)    Define the term variable costs.                                               [2 marks]

                  Variable costs are costs that vary in “direct proportion” to change in
                  output/level of production.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   Identify two advantages for Dan of operating as a sole trader.                [2 marks]

                  Possible advantages could include:
                   Dan as a sole trader has complete creative and management freedom
                   Dan can be more customer focused due to constant interaction and
                    communication with the customers
                   Dan does not have to share the profit with anyone else
                   accept any other relevant advantage.


                  Award [1 mark] for each relevant and appropriate advantage identified
                  up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(iv) Explain two possible limitations of the break-even model as a decision
     tool for Dan Electro.                                                  [4 marks]

     The possible limitations/drawbacks of the break-even model are:
     The model assumes that all cameras are sold.

     Dan Electro might not be able to sell all of its cameras and, therefore,
     the total revenue curve might not be as high/accurate as the model assumes:
      The model is also used under the assumption of unchanging conditions.
        Inflation and interest rates might indeed increase (forecasted) which
        could affect the demand for the camera.
      Also, the effectiveness of the model depends on the accuracy of
        the data. Dan might not have computed all the costs/revenue accurately.
      The model assumes a linear relationship, which is quite unlikely in
        real life. Dan might decide to reduce the price of the cameras to
        stimulate sales.

     Given the above, the use of the model can become less effective as a
     decision tool for Dan.

     Accept any other relevant explanation.

     Award [1 mark] for identifying each relevant and correct limitation of the
     break-even model and [1 mark] for each explanation of the limitation with

(c)   Examine two possible strategies for Dan Electro to prevent cash flow
      difficulties.                                                        [6 marks]

      Some of the possible strategies that are available for Dan Electro in order to
      overcome the forecasted cash flow difficulties are:

      Increase inflow of money:
      Dan can look for a partner. Forming a partnership can inject cash quickly with the
      added benefits of knowledge and expertise. The responsibilities of running the
      business can also be shared. However, Dan will lose the benefits of being a sole
      trader – benefits such as complete freedom in decision-making and the retaining
      of all profit.

      Dan could increase the price of the cameras. Dan has very loyal and, therefore,
      price inelastic customers. Some customers indicated that they would be willing to
      pay a higher price. This enables him to increase the price and at the same time to
      increase Dan Electro’s total revenue. However, given the increase of online
      competition and the current customers’ perception of the camera being good value
      for money, this option is somewhat risky. Dan Electro might end up with fewer
      customers and less total revenue.

      Dan Electro’s marketing expenses are relatively small. Dan might want to
      consider a marketing drive to promote the product so as to increase sales and then
      sell more than 700 cameras – which is rather a small amount. However, care has
      to be taken that the extra marketing expenditure does not outweigh the extra
      revenue. Perhaps it is a risk worth taking given the increased competition.

      Taking another loan from the bank might inject immediate cash, but may not be
      seen as a wise move as Dan is still paying back US$1000 in interest on the
      previous loan and the interest rate is predicted to rise.

      Decrease outflow of money:
      The main problem that can be seen from the data is the transportation cost per
      camera, which is a significant 22.5 % of the variable costs. Dan could negotiate a
      reduction in such costs with the current supplier. Perhaps a bulk buying deal can
      be agreed upon. However, Dan will have to take the risk of being left with
      unsold stock, which is risky given the fast changing technology in this market.

      Rent is currently extremely expensive. The costs for an “expensive and desirable”
      location are unnecessary given the fact that Dan operates an online business.
      A move to a cheaper and non-central location could provide a good solution.
      The service quality should not be harmed by this change.

      Also, Dan should ask for some credit facilities with the current supplier rather
      than continue with the current agreement of paying in advance. This will alleviate
      the cash flow difficulties. However, the supplier may not agree and may decide to
      supply to other retailers given the increase in online competition.

      Another possibility is to look for a cheaper local supplier. However, the quality of
      the cameras may be compromised and Dan Electro may lose its competitive
      advantage.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

           (ii)   Identify two disadvantages for BBT of operating as a private limited
                  company.                                                             [2 marks]

                  Some of the disadvantages for BBT may be:
                   Private limited companies are not able to raise as much finance as
                    public limited companies. BBT is unable to raise share capital from the
                    general public to finance the R&D since shares can only be sold to
                    private family members and friends with the approval of the board
                    (although currently Mark is the only shareholder in the company).
                   Despite Mark being the sole shareholder of the company, he does not
                    have complete privacy enjoyed by sole traders and partnerships due to
                    the fact that some of the financial data and other information have to be
                    published.
                   Mark needs to have his company accounts audited by an external
                    accountant, which adds to the administrative costs of the business.
                   It is usually far more expensive to establish a private limited company
                    compared to setting up a sole proprietorship or a partnership.
                   Accept any other relevant disadvantage identified.


                  Award [1 mark] for each appropriate and relevant disadvantage identified,
                  up to a maximum of [2 marks].

            (according to the generally accepted method the candidate has chosen),
            award [3 marks]. If the balance sheet balances but the order of the assets or
            liabilities is significantly inaccurate, such as placing share capital and
            retained profit as a liability, award [2 marks]. Award [1 mark] if the
            candidate conveys some understanding of a balance sheet and some sense
            that assets equal liabilities + owners’ equity.

            Do not penalize a response more than once for errors that are carried
            forward.

       [2 marks].

(iii) Using financial and non-financial factors, explain why the bank
      manager refused to finance the R&D of the new educational software. [6 marks]

       The current ratio is just 0.625, i.e. for every US$100 of current liabilities,
       BBT has only US$62.5 of current assets. Hence, BBT clearly lacks
       sufficient liquidity to pay for its short-term liabilities and this represents
       high risk to the bank manager. BBT may have to stop trading due to
       liquidity problems despite making profit and having a very healthy
       ROCE ratio. It is evident that the bank manager is more concerned about
       liquidity than profitability and perceives the situation as undesirable –
       “your balance sheet has deteriorated”.

       Other financial considerations might include:
        Debtors account for over 93 % of its current assets (US$28 000 out of
         US$30 000). This represents high risk to the bank as it raises the
         likelihood of bad debt.
        BBT does not have any stock to sell to generate extra cash to pay its
         short-term liabilities.
        BBT owes US$48 000 to its creditors. This sum is significantly more
         than the value of its current assets.

       Non-financial factors that might have influenced the bank manager’s
       decision include:
        BBT’s patent (its unique selling point) is about to expire and this makes
          the company significantly less competitive, especially as other rival
          companies have recently entered the online education market. The bank
          manager might be worried that a significant amount of time and money is
          needed to develop new patented software.
        Educational software has a short shelf-life (life cycle) during which time
          the investment costs may not be recouped.

       Accept any other financial and non-financial factor to support a valid
       explanation.

           Award [1 to 2 marks] for a general or limited response and/or no reference
           to the stimulus material.

           Award [3 to 4 marks] for a partial explanation of why the bank manager
           refused to finance the R&D. The response may cover two issues/reasons
           only. For a meaningful reference to and explanation of only financial or
           non-financial factors for [3 marks].

           Award [5 to 6 marks] for a thorough, relevant explanation of why the
           bank manager refused to finance the R&D that includes meaningful
           reference to both financial (which includes actual figures) and non-financial
           factors. The response should cover more than two issues/reasons.

(c)   Examine two possible alternative sources of finance that Mark might use to
      fund the R&D of the new educational software.                              [6 marks]

      Possible sources of finance might include:
       Using retained profits – whilst this would not incur any interest payment, it is
        unlikely that the US$8500 the company holds would be sufficient to fund the
        R&D. BBT could sell dormant or underutilized assets to raise cash; again this
        might not be sufficient to fund the R&D.
       Business development loans to meet the specific development needs of BBT.
        The USA government might offer financial aid for educational purposes to
        support BBT’s R&D of the new software. However, BBT is a profit-making
        private limited company that has to compete with state owned or charitable
        education providers.
       Venture capital – venture capitalists might be attracted to BBT due to its
        potential of earning high profits on the commercialization of the software.
        However, this option might result in Mark having to give up some ownership
        rights to the company.
       Accept any other relevant source of finance in the context of BBT.

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced examination of two
      possible alternative sources of finance.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
      a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced examination, award a maximum
      of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

                                               SECTION B

3.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    market share                                                                     [2 marks]

                  Market share is the percentage of all sales within a market that are held by a
                  company (or a product/brand). Market share can be measured in terms of
                  total revenue or by units sold.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  External growth is growth from outside the company such as by acquiring
                  or merging with another company. It is the quickest form of growth.

(b)   Draw the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix for 2010 and distinguish

                               Cash cows      Dogs



      Microsoft’s online search engine could be classified as a question mark (problem
      child) if one refers to the sentence “after pursuing unsuccessful internal growth
      strategies...” One might conclude that Microsoft’s online search engine had low
      market share in a fast-growing industry that grows from US$40 billion to
      US$80 billion. Hence, Microsoft presents a large bid for Yahoo! Still, the
      combined expected market share is 35% which clearly indicates that at the point
      of its takeover bid, Microsoft had a lower market share. It is the second largest
      company in the market.

      One might argue that it can be classified in 2010 as a star. The industry has
      grown/is growing, but given the dominant position of Google, an assumption is
      made that the online search engine of Microsoft is not a cash cow.

      Credit either of the two possibilities.

      Google’s online search engine services can be classified as a star – its online
      search engine has the largest market share in a fast-growing industry from
      2008 to 2010. Accept the classification of Google as a cash cow if supported by
      relevant explanation/assumption, as the stimulus material does not provide
      information of the exact growth rate from 2010 onwards.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      The response is in the form of a list. No clear distinction is made between the
      positions of the search engines Microsoft and Google. The BCG matrix is not
      drawn. If only the matrix is drawn and fully labelled award up to [2 marks].

      [3 to 4 marks]
      The response provides a reasonable distinction between the positions of the
      search engines of Microsoft and Google.          The response may be brief.
      The BCG matrix is drawn but may not be entirely accurate and/or fully labelled.
      The application/distinction between the positions of the products of the two
      organizations may lack detail or accuracy in places. The position of the search
      engine of one organization is well explained. Some reference is made to the
      stimulus material. At the bottom of the markband there is a tendency towards
      fragmentary common sense points.

      [5 to 6 marks]
      The response provides a clear, relevant, detailed and accurate distinction between
      the positions of the search engines Microsoft and Google. The BCG matrix is
      drawn; it is entirely accurate and is fully labelled. Allow for one inaccuracy in
      drawing for [5 marks]. Reference is made throughout to the stimulus material.

(c)   Examine the possible effects that a successful takeover bid by Microsoft of
      Yahoo! would have on employees and one other stakeholder.                   [6 marks]

      The hostile takeover will result in extensive job losses, probably more among
      Yahoo!’s employees. The job losses or even a threat/fear of job losses will
      negatively affect some of the remaining employees. Moreover, some of the
      employees in a middle/junior management position in Yahoo! may lose their
      positions and power. Consequently, the motivation of many employees might be
      negatively affected. A fall in motivation can result in a loss of efficiency and
      potential synergy between the two organizations. However, one might argue that
      Yahoo!’s employees will not be able to afford the demonstration of any kind of
      dissatisfaction given their fear of further job losses. Efficiency might increase.
      A takeover might create some eagerness among employees to collaborate on
      R&D. On the other hand, Microsoft’s management might enjoy more power/
      interest/financial rewards. Hence, their motivation is likely to increase as well as
      efficiency and productivity.

      Some of the other possible stakeholders are:
      The respective shareholders, the managers, competitors, potential investors, the
      wider community, the government and consumers.

      If Microsoft is successful in its hostile takeover bid of Yahoo! the following
      possible effects can be examined:

      Microsoft shareholders: stronger market position may enhance shareholders’
      value in the long run, especially given the predicted cost saving of at least
      US$1 billion that can enhance profit. However, in the short run some of their
      dividends may have to be forgone to finance the takeover bid.

Managers: Yahoo!’s managers may lose their positions. Microsoft’s management
might enjoy more power/interest/financial rewards.

Other shareholders: given a more prominent position for Microsoft, in terms of
market power, profitability and so on, Google shareholders might experience a
fall in dividend.

Job losses might have further negative consequences on the wider community.

Consumers: may benefit from more choice, more innovative products and
possibly lower prices in the market as the dominance of Google will be somewhat
reduced.

The above stakeholders are used just as examples. Reward any other relevant
stakeholder(s) introduced as long as the examination uses relevant information
from the stimulus material.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced examination, award a maximum
of [4 marks].

For [5 marks] a response may be judged as somewhat balanced as long as some
contrasting/opposite and detailed effects on two different groups of stakeholders is
apparent.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss Microsoft’s decision to launch a hostile takeover bid for Yahoo!.               [9 marks]

      The response should focus on the possible interest and benefits as well as the
      possible disadvantages to Microsoft resulting from a proposed hostile takeover
      bid. The response should not be a repetition of the previous answer where the
      focus is on the interest of specific stakeholders. (There may be a minor overlap
      between the questions.)

      The possible benefits to Microsoft:
      Microsoft pursued unsuccessful internal growth strategies and, therefore, looked
      at this external growth option as an opportunity. This type of external growth will
      enable Microsoft to achieve its immediate goal to acquire a big share of the online
      search engine market quickly after playing a largely unsuccessful catch up game
      with Google, who has the largest share of the online search engine market.
      Yahoo! has other services like e-mail. Therefore, the proposed takeover could be
      judged as a good strategic move on behalf of Microsoft to enhance its product
      portfolio by acquiring other online services in a growing market.

      The strength of the financial argument lies in the cost saving of at least
      US$1 billion, possibly due to various economies of scale such as financial,
      managerial, technical, and/or marketing.

      A synergy is expected to be created between the two organizations. Analysts
      predict that “the combination of the two companies’ engineering resources and
      expertise would expand the research and development (R&D) capability” to
      produce better and more innovative services. A competitive advantage might be
      created or at least this takeover can be judged as a market follower strategy
      (Porter), or possibly a defensive move against the market leader. Perhaps, due to
      a fall in Yahoo!’s share price, the takeover deal might not be as expensive as it
      might have been had Yahoo! not experienced a 40 % fall in their shares.

      However, Yahoo! indeed suffered a decline in profit and saw its shares fall by
      40 %. Moreover, it was forced to cut 1000 jobs. Yahoo!’s added value and the
      possibly synergy might be questioned by some. Moreover, due to the fact that
      the takeover is actually hostile, operational and cultural clashes may be created,
      which can reduce the operational efficiency of the company. Yahoo!’s somewhat
      lower brand image/market position might negatively affect Microsoft’s reputation.

      A takeover is likely to lead to extensive job losses. The proposed change might
      be extremely difficult to implement and be more expensive than originally
      estimated. Microsoft might find it difficult to recruit in the future.

      It is also expected that the proposed takeover is likely to attract the attention and
      possible action of the government. However, as Google was the market leader in
      2010 and the proposed takeover bid will result in Microsoft and Yahoo!’s
      combined market share of 35 %, it is unlikely that any drastic action will be taken
      against Microsoft.

           Accept any relevant argument for or against the proposed takeover.

           On the whole, it appears that given the present needs/objectives of Microsoft, the
           potential benefits are the more significant ones and the proposed takeover is likely
           to be the appropriate strategic move against an extremely strong competitor. The
           possible drawbacks are more on the speculative side – apart from job losses which
           occurred anyway in Yahoo!.

           Accept any other relevant discussion.


           A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments in favour and at
           least two arguments against.

                 Unique selling proposition (USP) refers to the unique features/
                 attributes/benefits of a product/service that a company focuses on and
                 promotes to its target market in order to differentiate it from its competitors.

             Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of consumers’
             demand to a change in real income. It is calculated by dividing the
             percentage change in demand by the percentage change in real income.

(b)   With reference to Porter’s generic strategies model, distinguish between the
      competitive advantages of the two business models in the airline industry.   [6 marks]

      Porter suggests that a business can achieve a competitive advantage over its rival
      by using one of the following generic strategies:
       cost leadership
       differentiation
       focus (cost or differentiation).

      Budget airlines like Ryanair use a cost leadership strategy. The organization is
      geared to reducing costs in every aspect of operation and offering a standard but
      adequate product/service to many segments in the market. The general approach
      is low costs that are lower than the major competitor; a no frill service and a low
      price suitable for price elastic consumers. Perhaps it could be argued by some
      candidates that the strategy used is a cost focus approach where businesses
      concentrate on particular segments (price conscious consumers).

      Full service airlines like British Airways use a broad differentiation strategy.
      These airlines seek to provide service benefits that are different from those of their
      competitors and are widely valued by the consumer. The aim is to achieve a
      competitive advantage by offering a better service at a higher price than the
      budget airlines/competitors. These airlines target business as well as economy
      class passengers who want a differentiated/full service.

      Perhaps it can also be said that full service airlines use a focused differentiation
      strategy for business/first class passengers. This strategy seeks to provide high
      and unique perceived product/service benefits, justifying a substantial price
      premium to a selected market segment of business people who expect a very high
      level of comfort and are willing to pay a premium price for such differentiated
      services.
                                       – 22 –            N10/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Candidates need to refer to “costs” as Porter uses the term “cost leadership”
strategy as one of the three strategic options. The cost leadership will result in a
lower price.       Candidates must use the correct order and terminology.
Porter does not use the terminology “price leadership”. In case of confusion,
less marks will be awarded based on the use of the business terminology and so
on – as stated in the markbands below.

Accept any of the generic strategies of each airline, provided that there is a
distinction between the competitive advantages of the two business models.


[1 to 2 marks]
No reference is made to both types of airline and/or the information in the
stimulus material. The answer may be no more than a list of some possible
actions/tactics or strategies.

[3 to 4 marks]
The response exhibits a partial distinction between two different and contrasting
strategies used by both types of airlines – the budget and the full service ones.
Award [3 marks] if the distinction demonstrates some application of Porter’s
generic strategies even though they are not implicitly identified. Award [4 marks]
if the distinction demonstrates a fuller application of Porter’s generic strategies
model.

[5 to 6 marks]
A detailed, relevant, applicable distinction is provided of two different and
contrasting strategies used by both types of airline – the budget and the
full service ones. The explanation/distinction demonstrates a sound understanding
and application of Porter’s generic strategies model. The distinction uses the
relevant terminology appropriately. (If there is no use of the relevant
terminology, the candidate cannot access this markband.)

Explicit and consistent references are made to the budget airlines and also
full service airlines – and to the information in the stimulus material to support the
distinction.

(c)   Examine the likely effects on the airline industry of cross price elasticity of
      demand and income elasticity of demand.                                         [6 marks]

      Other modes of travel are substitute goods. The low figure of 0.5 for cross price
      elasticity of demand indicates that there is not a significant movement from
      air travel to other modes of travel. This is probably due to the significant increase
      in fuel costs, as mentioned in the stimulus material, that affects nearly all other
      modes of travel. It appears that the global airline industry does not have to worry
      about alternatives/substitute products/services, as the rail and car industries are
      also hit by an increase in fuel prices. Other factors – the other types of elasticities
      mentioned – are likely to be more significant in determining customers’ reactions.
      The competition lies within the airline industry.

      On the other hand, income elasticity of demand of 3 seems to have contributed/or
      likely to contribute significantly to a fall in demand. Income elasticity of demand
      for services is very elastic. Consumers are very responsive to a change in their
      income. National and disposable income is falling. With a global economic
      downturn many customers are likely to significantly reduce their demand for such
      a relatively luxury service (normal good).

      Accept any other relevant examination.


      To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced examination of
      both cross price elasticity of demand and income elasticity of demand.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3 marks]. If the response is
      a one-sided relevant approach with no balanced examination, award a maximum
      of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the claim made by the British Airways CEO “that full service airlines
      are more likely to sustain their competitive advantage”.                      [9 marks]

      On the one hand, it can be argued that the CEO of the full service airline might be
      correct. The average price elasticity of demand of all classes of passengers is less
      than one (0.95), which means that on the whole consumers are relatively price
      inelastic. The full service airlines are clearly successful in branding and
      differentiating their services among business and first class passengers who might
      still be willing to pay a higher price/extra for additional services.

      Higher prices will result in a lower quantity demanded for air travel. Both types
      of airlines are likely to experience a fall in quantity demanded. The effect on total
      revenue will be determined by the relative percentage increase in price to the
      relative percentage fall in quantity demanded. Therefore, an increase in price will
      not result in a fall in total revenue for full service airlines, given the price
      elasticity of demand being determined by loyalty and the targeting of business
      people.
                                        – 24 –            N10/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


At the same time, given the relatively high price elasticity of demand of
passengers travelling on budget airlines (1.9), this type of airline is likely to
experience a fall in total revenue (and, therefore, profit).

However, the increase in the costs/price of fuel (variable cost) puts pressure on all
airlines’ profits. The full service airline might still not survive the slowdown
unless operational efficiency is increased. Also, a point may come when
passengers will not be willing or able to afford the services if the economic
downturn persists. It is likely that business people will travel less due to the
economic downturn. Moreover, many consumers have already moved away from
the full service airlines and use budget airlines. 25 % of passengers on the low
budget airlines like Ryanair are business travellers. The graph also supports the
notion that while the growth rate of first/business class passengers is stagnating,
the growth of the economy class passenger has slowed down – whilst still
growing. Heavy reliance on first/business class passengers might not be an
appropriate strategy to be used by the full service airlines during a
downturn/recession, especially given the high income elasticity of demand (3).

It appears that both types of airline are under enormous pressure regarding
pricing policy and efficiency but, perhaps, as also indicated by some market
analysts, the budget airlines are in a better position to weather the storm given
their size and flexibility. Therefore, the full service airlines are not more likely to
sustain their competitive advantage.

5.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of primary market research
           for Bricko Group.                                                      [4 marks]

           Advantages of primary market research for Bricko Group include:
            it allows Bricko Group to gather new data and information from customers in
             order to identify their purchasing patterns and to anticipate changes in their
             spending behaviour
            it provides up-to-date and, therefore, perhaps more reliable market research
             findings in order for Bricko Group to compete with its rivals such as
             Peppa Toys
            it is conducted for the specific needs of Bricko Group and, therefore, directly
             addresses the problems it currently faces
            accept any other relevant advantage that is described in the context of
             Bricko Group.

           Disadvantages of primary market research for Bricko Group include:
            the relatively higher cost of conducting primary research adds to the expenses
             of Bricko Group
            the potentially monotonous and time-consuming task of collecting and
             interpreting primary data could delay decision-making at Bricko Group
            imperfections in market research techniques (such as a statistically invalid
             sample size) will lead to unrepresentative and misleading findings
            accept any other relevant disadvantage that is described in the context of
             Bricko Group.

(b)   Explain two benefits and one limitation of a Kaizen approach to
      manufacturing for Bricko Group.                                 [6 marks]

      Kaizen is the Japanese philosophy of changing for the better, i.e. continuous or
      continual improvement. Kaizen is, therefore, a process of improvement in
      productivity and efficiency from making small and continuous progress.
      The production manager wants to implement Kaizen in order to deal with some
      of the problems being faced by Bricko Group, especially the increased number
      of defective products.

      Possible benefits of a Kaizen approach for Bricko Group could include:
       Kaizen can help Bricko Group to eliminate waste generated, including the
        waste generated by its defective products, through investigating ways to
        improve the productivity and efficiency of the company’s processes and
        operations as well as the implementation and use of zero defect policies.
        Kaizen is, therefore, fundamental for lean production and quality assurance. It
        is evident that Bricko Group needs to cut costs in order to compete with Peppa
        Toys. The implementation of Kaizen can enable Bricko Group to reduce costs
        as well as increase quality and become more competitive.
       Since suggestions for improvements can come from all ranks within the
        organization, not only are more ideas generated, but Bricko Group also benefits
        from having more motivated staff (since they are able to express their own
        points of view). The involvement of staff and the process of generating ideas
        can enable Bricko Group to overcome the apparent lack of innovation and the
        current failure to launch new products.
       Since people tend to be resistant to change, the workforce might be more
        receptive to making small changes that lead to productivity gains. This is
        because small but continuous changes are far less disruptive to the organization
        than large one-off changes.

      Possible limitations of a Kaizen approach for Bricko Group could include:
       The initial implementation tends to be costly and time consuming. Bricko
        Group might not be able to afford it due to the need to become more
        competitive in the very short term. The stimulus indicates that the financial
        manager is looking for ways to reduce costs, hence Bricko Group might not be
        able to afford the implementation of Kaizen.
       Kaizen is not necessarily easy to implement. The implementation of Kaizen
        requires the effort and devotion of each and every member of the workforce to
        make productivity gains. This is a problem for organizations that have
        individuals who are simply not motivated by taking on extra responsibility or
        working in cohesive teams.
       Whilst Kaizen might be appropriate to the highly skilled and creative staff in
        the R&D department, such an approach may not be so applicable to the
        production plant workers where a more traditional “command and control” or
        “scientific management” system might be the norm.

      Accept any other relevant benefit/limitation explained.

      Award a total of [4 marks] for two benefits and [2 marks] for one limitation.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct benefit/limitation identified and
      [1 mark] for each clear explanation of the benefit/limitation up to a maximum of

(c)   Analyse the importance and role of branding for Bricko Group.                           [6 marks]

      The role of branding to Bricko Group includes:
       Creating a legal identity for its products that are protected by law in the various
        countries that Bricko Group operates in.
       Acting as a vital source of product differentiation (mainly from its rivals but
        also from its other toys).
       Encouraging customer loyalty or brand loyalty in the Bricko Group brand.
       Creating an image of high-quality branded toys.
       Raising international recognition and awareness of the Bricko Group brand.

      Consequently, branding is important to Bricko Group because:
       It acts as a form of intellectual property, thereby giving Bricko Group the
        ability to differentiate itself from Peppa Toys and other rivals.
       Intellectual property rights can increase the book value of Bricko Group on its
        balance sheet – thereby making it easier for Bricko Group to secure external
        sources of finance to fund its R&D plans.
       Brand recognition and brand loyalty can help Bricko Group to regain lost
        market share and maintain its market position and market standing. However,
        it appears that Bricko Group was not able to maintain its superior market
        position. Its brand loyalty is somewhat weaker.
       Research has shown that customer purchasing habits are affected by branding
        and not just prices. In some cases, the brand is considered more important than
        the price. However, in the case of Bricko Group, consumers prefer their rival’s
        lower price.

      However, it appears that the competitors also recognized the role and possibly the
      importance of branding and used it to their advantage. Moreover, branding is
      only one part of the consumer’s buying decision. The market positioning of the
      brand is also important. Bricko Group charges higher prices, perhaps because of
      its market presence, but this has led to its market share falling. Customers were
      clearly attracted to brand image and market positioning of Peppa Toys and
      other competitors.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      Candidates need to consider the importance and role of branding for the response
      to be considered balanced and to achieve the top markband.

(d)   Discuss the financial manager’s proposal “to outsource the production
      facilities to Bangladesh”.                                            [9 marks]

      Outsourcing refers to the strategy of transferring internal business activities to an
      external organization. The main purposes of this are to improve efficiency and
      reduce costs of production. In the case of Bricko Group, the financial manager is
      proposing to shift production facilities to Bangladesh where subcontractors should
      be able to carry out the outsourced work at a lower cost.

      The arguments for this proposal include:
       A reduction in production costs. Outsourcing overseas (offshoring) can help
        Bricko Group to remain internationally competitive with the emergence of
        increased competition in the toy market and other sectors such as online
        gaming.
       Bricko Group can perhaps develop other important activities like marketing
        and R&D in order to compete more successfully.
       Cost reduction advantages can also mean that Bricko Group becomes able to
        reduce prices to compete with Peppa Toys’ lower prices and so recover or gain
        greater market share.
       Outsourcing production facilities overseas can also eliminate the growing
        concerns from environmentalists in the European Union (EU)/Sweden who are
        worried about the pollution generated in Bricko Group’s production plants.
        Outsourcing to Bangladesh can help Bricko Group by eliminating the need to
        comply with the stricter health and safety regulations in the EU. Whilst quality
        standards must still be adhered to, offshoring ultimately helps to reduce the
        company’s costs.
                                        – 29 –          N10/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


However, the arguments against this proposal include:
 Concerns at Bricko Group since its core function (manufacturing toys) is being
  outsourced – most businesses outsource their auxiliary rather than core functions.
 Outsourcing to Bangladesh will most likely cause job losses in Sweden.
  This will upset staff who had previously enjoyed job security at a company that
  had pride in promoting “a sense of family for its employees”.
 Subcontractors in the Bangladesh plant need to be monitored to ensure that
  production deadlines and quality standards are met. This will add to
  Bricko Group’s operational and administrative costs. In addition, maintaining
  quality standards of the toys might prove more difficult when dealing with an
  overseas subcontractor and hence the reputation of Bricko Group might be
  at risk.
 Certain stakeholder and pressure groups may have ethical concerns with
  Bricko Group’s use of outsourcing to Bangladesh for the fear that the company
  might exploit foreign workers in less economically developed countries.

Accept any other relevant discussion.

Candidates are expected to reach a conclusion in their answers.

Given the fact that figures/data are not given on possible cost saving, it might be
difficult to come to a definite and final conclusion. Nevertheless, the arguments
against seem stronger given the past performance/history/reputation of
Bricko Group. The quality issue of children’s toys is of significant importance
and perhaps it can be said that Bricko Group should not risk it. The possible
negative effects on the loyal staff and the consequent effect on employees’
motivation, organizational culture and so on are also very significant.
Bricko Group should perhaps find other ways to cut costs and overcome some of
the current difficulties it is facing. The proposed implementation of Kaizen might
just be the solution for cost cutting.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two arguments for and at least two
arguments against.
