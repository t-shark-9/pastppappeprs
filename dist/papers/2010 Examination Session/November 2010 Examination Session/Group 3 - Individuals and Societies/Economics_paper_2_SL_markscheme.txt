           which shows the demand for corn shifting to the right, with more
           being demanded and supplied at a higher price or for providing an
           explanation that corn is used for producing biofuels and so if there is an
           increase in the production of biofuels, then there will be an increase in
           the demand for corn, raising the price of corn and the quantity demanded
           and supplied.

      many commodities is low.                                                            [4 marks]

           For drawing a correctly labelled demand and supply diagram for a
           commodity, which shows a relatively inelastic supply curve (one which
           would touch the x-axis if extended) or for providing an explanation that
           agricultural commodities are inelastic in supply because they are crop
           based and so it is difficult to increase quantity supplied significantly in
           the short-run.

           Candidates may offer a perfectly inelastic supply curve for agriculture,
           explaining that the crop nature of the product leads to a set quantity being
           produced in any time period. If this is properly explained, then it should
           be fully rewarded.

           Candidates may write about minerals, explaining that their supply is
           inelastic because their sources are limited and it is difficult to discover
           new sources of minerals quickly. This is equally applicable.

  (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
        evaluate Ecuador’s policy response to increasing food prices (Table 1).        [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
          the concept of a maximum price
          a price ceiling diagram.

        Possible positive consequences:
          affordable bread for consumers (Table 1)
          affordable food is a merit good
          increases the purchasing power of the urban poor (paragraph ).

        Possible negative consequences:
          reduced revenue/income for farmers as the price of bread is below the
          equilibrium price
          shortages of bread
          need for a rationing system
          possibility of parallel markets
          need for government intervention to increase supply
          other policy options (Table 1).

        Effective evaluation may be to:
           consider short-term versus long-term consequences
           examine the impact on different stakeholders
           discuss advantages and disadvantages
           prioritize the arguments.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
        which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
        rewarded beyond level 2.

                       An explanation that it is the growth of real output in an economy
                       over time.

           increase or for providing an explanation that because the demand for
           water is relatively inelastic, when costs increase and supply shifts to the
           left, price will increase to cover a substantial part of the cost increase.

          regulation as the most direct form of control
          problems of implementation (paragraph )

        Responses should include:
          an explanation of tight monetary policy.

        Possible positive consequences include:
          a reduction in the inflation rate (Figure 2)
          an appreciation of the currency, making imports cheaper.

        Possible negative consequences include:
          a lower rate of economic growth (Figure 1)
          a worsening of the current account deficit as the exchange rate increases
          (Figure 3)
          increased unemployment (Figure 4)
          a fall in the growth rate of per capita income (paragraph )
          a reduction in the rising entrepreneurship (paragraph )
          changes in the distribution of income.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
           consider short-term versus long-term consequences
           examine the impact on different stakeholders
           discuss advantages and disadvantages
           prioritize the arguments.

        employment may fall in western countries as firms move production to
        China (paragraph )

           circumstances for Haitian households.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3-4
           For drawing a correctly labelled poverty cycle diagram, which shows a
           suitable circular argument beginning and ending with poverty and/or low
           incomes and for providing an explanation that there are factors that are
           connected that will perpetuate poverty and for describing such a series of
           circumstances for Haitian households.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams cannot be rewarded with full marks.

(c)   With reference to Figure 1, explain why there is a difference between the
      Human Development Index (HDI) figures for Haiti and Madagascar.                   [4 marks]

           For noting that Madagascar has a higher HDI and that the HDI includes
           more than just GDP per capita.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3-4
           For noting that Madagascar has a higher HDI and that the HDI includes
           more than just GDP per capita and for explaining that education and
           healthcare in Madagascar are presumably better than in Haiti,
           thus leading to a relatively higher HDI position, despite its lower GDP
           per capita.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate aid as a means of achieving economic development in Haiti.              [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
        a definition of economic development
        some types of aid.

      Factors relating to the aid include:
        food aid is essential in the short-run (paragraph )
        aid is of little use if it cannot be distributed (paragraph )
        rural areas suffer more than urban areas (paragraph )
        food aid is a temporary measure (paragraph )
        development aid is critical (paragraph )
        rebuilding roads and schools (paragraph )
        importance of aid to help education and health (Figure 1)
        aid is no use without infrastructure and solving corruption
        other factors – institutional
        alternative of trade
        criticism of aid schemes
        discussion of the difference between multilateral and bilateral aid in the
        Haitian context
        evaluation of long-term aid as opposed to food aid (paragraph ).

      Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short-term versus long-term consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

      There needs to be some reasoned conclusion, for the evaluation to be effective
      – not just a list of advantages and disadvantages. There clearly has to be
      evaluation of the ways that aid can or does contribute to economic
      development, not just a general discussion of aid.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.
