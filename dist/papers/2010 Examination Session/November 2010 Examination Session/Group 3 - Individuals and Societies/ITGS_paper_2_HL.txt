1.    The Kindle is an electronic book (e-book) reader that has been developed by Amazon.com
      for purchasing and downloading their e-books. Over 230  000 e-books are available for the Kindle.
      An e-book can be downloaded directly to the Kindle using the same 3G wireless technology used
      by cell (mobile) phones. All of the e-books that a customer purchases are listed in the customer’s
      personal online Amazon record and can be downloaded again if necessary. Customers can also access
      blogs and subscribe to newspapers that are downloaded automatically to the Kindle.


      Features of the Kindle include:
      • supports a range of formats for documents (txt, doc, pdf, html and azw which is specific
        to the Kindle), graphics (jpg, gif, png), and audio (aa, mp3)
      • ability to search for a word or phrase through all the e-books stored on the Kindle
      • notes can be added to the text or in the margins using the Kindle keyboard and these can be exported
      • pages can be bookmarked for future use
      • built-in dictionary and wireless access to Wikipedia.

      (a)   Identify two methods that can be used to create a pdf file from a file saved
            in DOC format.                                                                                          [2 marks]

      (b)   A customer is already registered at Amazon.com as an e-book customer.
            Describe a step-by-step process that could be used by the customer to login,
            purchase and download an e-book from the Amazon.com server directly to
            their Kindle.                                                                                           [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain two features that could be included in the Kindle to allow improved
            access to e-books by persons with impaired vision.                                                      [4 marks]

      (d)   Instead of purchasing printed textbooks, the Bay City International School
            is considering providing all IB teachers and their students with a Kindle
            and e-books. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages, for IB students,
            of using the Kindle and e-books instead of printed textbooks.                                      [10 marks]

2.    Photo editing is often used to improve the appearance of photos that are published in print
      or posted on the Internet. Organizations such as the National Press Photographers Association
      have published a “digital manipulation Code of Ethics” that states: “As journalists we believe the
      guiding principle of our profession is accuracy; therefore, we believe it is wrong to alter the content
      of a photograph in any way that deceives the public.”

(Question 2 continued)

      (a)   Identify two file formats that are used to post images on the Internet.               [2 marks]

      (b)	Describe two different graphics techniques that could be used to create the
          photo in Image 3 by using elements from the photo in Image 1 or from other
          digital sources.                                                                        [4 marks]

      (c)   Publishers, such as News Magazine, may use the same photos in both their
            weekly colour magazine and on their web site. Explain the problems that may
            arise in the weekly colour magazine or on the web site from trying to use the same
            image files for both purposes.                                                        [4 marks]

      (d)   Private individuals often eyewitness news events as they occur.
            Using cell (mobile) phones they can immediately capture a photo
            and post it to a public web site. This type of posting is very different from
            the reporting of a news photographer to a news agency, which follows
            well-defined processes for editing and submitting photos.

            Discuss the ethical implications of an amateur photographer posting images to
            a public web site.                                                                   [10 marks]

3.    david Hanson, Chief Executive of Hanson Robotics Inc, is a leader in creating robots that are among
      the most advanced in the world. He has created jules, an example of a “social robot” that uses
      artificial intelligence, integration of natural language processing, automatic speech recognition
      and text-to-speech. It is possible to have a natural, interactive conversation with jules.
      Frubber is an elastic material that has been developed by Hanson Robotics Inc which looks like
      natural skin and makes jules’ realistic facial movement and speech possible.

      jules also uses “computer vision” through a device in his eye which captures the image of the person
      talking to him. “Computer vision” includes face recognition and face tracking to simulate complete
      verbal and non-verbal interaction, such as maintaining eye contact and turning the head to follow the
      movement of the human to whom jules is talking.

      david Hanson also teaches his robots their history, vocabulary, and develops their basic
      “personality”, either based on a real person or an imaginary character. Hanson’s robots have been used
      in games and toys, research and psychiatry scenarios, military training and animations.

      (a)   Identify two input devices that are required in order for jules to interact with
            a real person.                                                                           [2 marks]

      (b)   describe the steps that jules would take in order to follow the movement
            of the person talking to him.                                                            [4 marks]

      (c)   jules may have difficulty understanding a sentence in a conversation with a human.
            Explain why this could happen.                                                           [4 marks]

      (d)   The organizers of an important tennis tournament are considering using a robot
            similar to jules, named Tennis-Umpire, for the purpose of umpiring some
            of the games. This robot, which remains seated throughout the match,
            uses its own cameras to analyse the game and then communicates its decisions
            to the human spectators using speech.

            Evaluate whether the organizers should go ahead with this decision to replace
            human umpires with robotic umpires such as Tennis-Umpire.                              [10 marks]

4.    The recording industry is taking court action against private individuals and peer-to-peer (P2P)*
      file sharing services that are involved in the illegal downloading of music files.

      A US federal jury has found a woman guilty of sharing copyrighted music online,
      and ordered her to pay US$222  000 in damages to the six record companies represented by the
      Recording Industry Association of America.

      The woman had downloaded 24 songs without permission and shared them online through
      a P2P file sharing account. However, the woman denied the charges and testified that she did not have
      an account. During the trial, the woman’s Internet service provider (ISP) presented evidence that
      copyrighted songs were offered by the woman as a P2P file sharing user under the name “tereastarr”.

  *         peer-to-peer (P2P): technology that allows Internet users to locate each other through the use

      (c)       Explain two kinds of evidence that could have been presented in court
                to prove that copyrighted songs were offered by the woman using a
                P2P file sharing account.                                                                               [4 marks]
