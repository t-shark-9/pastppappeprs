Subject details:         Computer science HL paper 2 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer all questions in one Option. Total 65 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of
  a semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
  accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
  that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
  correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
  slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
  parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
  is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
  with “FT”.


General guidance

  Issue            Guidance
  Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
  more than          maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
  the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
  of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
  responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
  prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
  in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
  questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

Option A — Databases


1.   (a)   Award [1 max].
           atomicity;
           sorting;                                                                                    [1]

     (b)   Award [2 max].
           Not all of this information may be necessary for the purposes it is being collected
           for / asks for too much information;
           Teachers may be concerned about issues of privacy;
           If the information is shared with third parties it could be used / aggregated to
           identify the teacher / identity theft;
           Teachers may be put off either by the excessive time required to complete the
           form;
           This may lead to some teachers refusing to complete the application form / not as
           many teachers will sign up;                                                                 [2]

     (c)   Award [2 max].
           Atomicity in transactions ensure that the indivisible series of database operations
           either all occur, or nothing occurs;
           This prevents updates to the database occurring only partially / this maintains
           data integrity / consistency;
                                                                                                 [2]

     (d)   Award [3 max].
           Isolation specifies the sequence that changes is processed / specifies that any
           parallel processing must produce the same result as if the processes were
           carried out sequentially;
           Each post to the thread takes place independently of others;
           One post will be completed before another starts / a post will not become visible
           until completed;
           Data and the transaction (row for the thread) is locked for that moment when the
           transaction is carried out;
           The addition of one post to the thread must not displace another’s, regardless of
           the order in which they finally appear;
           A transaction log is created prior to the transaction to allow rollback;
           This means that should an error occur part of the way through the transaction it
           will be rolled back and the database will return to its original state;                     [3]
                                            –5–                N19/4/COMSC/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

      Data configuring / applying patches or upgrades;
      Setting permissions / passwords / access rights / ensuring security;
      Back up / recovery / archiving;
      Data cleansing / consistency checks on data / remove data errors;                   [2]

(f)   Award [4 max].
      The large number of educators is critical to the number of fields included in any
      composite key;
      The composite key must be unique;
      Composite key could be made up of several fields;
      Allow suitable example (eg combinations of first name, last name, email, phone
      number etc.);
      Allow example that would not be suitable;
      Part of the primary key could include a random element in case of duplicated
      name and dates of birth;
      This would require an understanding of the nature of the educators, for example,
      are they of a particular age which would reduce the possible number of dates of
      birth, are they from one particular country so certain names would be more likely
      to occur;
      This would influence the number of fields that would be required to reduce the
      possibility of a duplicate entry occurring;                                         [4]

     (b)   (i)    Award [2 max].
                  Length check;
                  Could ensure only a value within an acceptable range is entered (allow
                  example);
                  Type/format check on bill;
                  Only numerical (int/float etc);                                                     [2]

           (ii)   Award [2 max].
                  Double entry;
                  Will only allow data entry if both match;
                  Proof reading;
                  Will give a visual check that the data is correct;

     (c)   Award [2 max].
           When the length of the bill / beak of the spoonbill is measured it is simply a
           decontextualized figure such as 10 cm;
           When it is included in the database and interrogated it will have a meaning, so it
           then becomes information;

           The database will contain only the figure “10”;
           the “cm” will not be included and is part of the meaning of the attribute/field.

           Note: the “information” mark must reference the database in some way                 [2]

     (d)   Award [2 max].

(e)   Award [3 max].
      Data modelling gives a visual representation of the proposed system;
      So that all stakeholders have the same understanding of the system;
      Shows basic relationships / establishes naming conventions etc;
      Some that developers are able to develop the actual database;
      Avoiding issues such as redundancy/lack of integrity/lack of consistency;

      The data model will take the information from the conceptual schema and logical
      schema to informs the physical model for the development of the database;
      A lack of modelling may result in a structurally deficient implementation with poor
      data integrity / redundant data;
      This may mean developing prototypes of the database to test whether the
      proposed structure of the database will function as intended;
                                                                                            [3]

(f)   Award [3 max].
      Note: only award full marks if there is a valid reference to the scenario.

      Referential integrity requires that a value used as a foreign key corresponds to a
      value of a primary key / validates the database through relationships;
      Therefore if the Ciconiiformes/order of the Spoonbill is not in the database, you
      will not be able to add it because of referential integrity;
      Referential integrity constraints;
      Ensure that if a record is updated or deleted, these changes will made in related
      cells and the possibility of update anomalies is reduced / eliminated;                      [3]

3.   (a)   Award [2 max].
           Note: Allow answers that refer to any stage of normalisation.
           Each data item hasn’t be broken down any further / contains repeating data;
           Each row is not unique / does not contain a primary key;
           Each field/column does not have a unique name / does not have atomic values;        [2]

     (b)   Award [2 max].
           This would mean that data is duplicated within a table / allow an example of
           duplicated data in this table;
           However, when it is updated, it may not be updated in all cases;
           Which could lead to anomalies within the data and the incorrect information
           being used;                                                                         [2]

           The usefulness of information is often time dependent;
           Example relating to the US presidential election, such as
           Electoral opinions before a public debate may have less value than those after
           the debate;                                                                         [2]

      They use link analysis in order to establish relationships / associations between
      different data sets / different entities in the same data set;

      Examples relating to the US presidential election, such as:
      How people voted in relation to some other factor, e.g. the level of use of social
      media / where they took their vacations / size of family …;                          [2]

(f)   Award [2 max].
      Note: maximum marks only if reference is made to the scenario

      Examples relating to the US presidential election, such as
      Unusual switch in pre-electoral voting opinions;
      Sudden pro-candidate or anti-candidate sentiment in a particular state;              [2]

(g)   Award [6 max].

      Mark as follows:
      Award [1] for a generic advantage of data mining;
      Award [1] for expanding on this advantage;
      Award [1] for linking this to the scenario;
      Similarly for a disadvantage;
      Award [1] for a valid conclusion;

      Advantages of data mining [3 max].
      Clustering / cluster analysis allows objects to be treated as one group enabling
      the uncovering of previously hidden patterns;
      For example, cluster analysis may search groups by race or gender to discover if
      a candidate is unpopular with a demographic;
      Classification methods (e.g. genetic, rough set, fuzzy set) can be used to
      recognize patterns that describe the groups to which an item belongs;
      For example, classifying voters by income may provide useful information that
      can affect future publicity strategies;
      Association analysis allows a series of statistical relationships to be further
      explored or tested;
      Associations look for If-then rules that predict a particular stance on a
      controversial topic (eg abortion) may influence the religious voters;

      Disadvantages of data mining [3 max].
      Data mining is based on the data collected from individuals;
      This data may be sensitive personal information that the individual concerned
      may not want to be shared;
      This personal data may be reaggregated to compromise the privacy and/or
      anonymity of the data subjects;

      Conclusions [1 max].
      The development of more sophisticated processing algorithms is inevitable, so
      although there are potential concerns about the invasive nature of data mining,
      providing sufficient safeguards are put in place, there is nothing inherently wrong

            PageRank algorithm [2 max]
            PageRank works by counting the number and quality of inlinks of a page to
            determine a rough estimate of how important the website is;
            The assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links
            from other websites;
            Pages are given a score (rank) / counts links per pages;

            HITS algorithm [2 max]
            Based on authorities and hubs;
            Authorities: A page is called an authority, if it contains valuable information and if
            it is truly relevant for the search query. It is assumed that such a page has a high
            number of in-links;
            Hubs: These are pages that are relevant for finding authorities. They contain
            useful links towards them. It is therefore assumed that these pages have a high
            number of out-links;                                                                     [4]

            Cloud computing can scale up or down depending on current demands more
            easily than local client server networks;
            Client / server networks are more secure than the cloud as the data transmission
            is carried out locally;
            Client / server networks have lower levels of latency than the cloud as the data

             Advantages of using compression [2 max]
             Allows for more rapid upload/download as the compressed file is smaller
             than the original;
             Scrolling through the coursework may be quicker;

             Disadvantages of using compression [2 max]
             This may mean that the overall quality of the work is reduced;
             This may be an issue when printing the work / or the quality of the image is
             a key contributor to the overall quality of the work;

             Overall comment [1 max]
             The impact of using compression may be dependant on the context in
             which the work is compressed;                                                  [4]

            The Internet is growing exponentially meaning that more and more nodes (in this
            case IB World Schools) can be added;
            This has led to greater connectivity between the different nodes;
            However, the number of hops required to transmit information from one node to
            another is growing linearly;
            Therefore, each node can access the increased number of nodes with no
            discernible latency which makes increased levels of collaboration between these
            nodes possible and desirable;                                                              [3]

            Browser Retrieves a Web Page;

            Then, it interprets this code and displays it as a web page for you to view;

            Browser acts as a bridge between URL and DNS;
            The user inputs the URL / website domain name on web browser’s address bar;
            The web browser passes this website domain name to a domain name server;                   [3]

      (c)   Award [3 max].
            User type the domain name into the URL search area on the web browser and
            press “Enter” on the keyboard.

            The domain name is intercepted by a “Domain Name Server” or DNS.

            The main function of the DNS is to look up in its database the domain name you
            have typed and find the matching IP address.

            It then forwards the request onwards, using this address.

            If it cannot find the IP address in its own database, it then contacts other Domain
            Name Servers until it finds it, or if it can't find it anywhere, it displays a “web site
            not found” message to you.

            When the request reaches the destination, the pages are sent back.                         [3]

            Connectivity is a basic concept in Graph Theory. Graph theory can be used to
            model or analyse the nature of the connectivity on a selected area, the web;
            In World Wide Web, each web page is represented by vertex/node;
            The hyper links between web pages are represented by edges/lines in the graph;
            Arrows would indicate the direction of the hyperlinks (1-way / 2-way);
            In Graph Theory, a graph is said to be connected if there is a path between every
            pair of vertex. From every vertex to any other vertex, there should be some path
            to traverse. That is called the connectivity of a graph;
            Similar concept is used in connectivity of World Wide Web, where each vertex
            representing a type of web page is connected to any other vertex representing
            other kind of web pages;                                                            [3]

      Advantages of using collective intelligence [2 max]
      Collective intelligence costs significantly less per unit / pro rata than hiring a
      professional;
      A single task is being worked on simultaneously by numerous individuals so it
      can be completed much more rapidly than using a single person;
      It allows access (maybe part time or at very short notice) to a large number of
      contributors for specific events or tasks;

      Disadvantages of using collective intelligence [2 max]
      It may be hard to ensure sufficient quality control occurs as collective intelligence
      is a very deregulated environment;
      It may be hard to verify the originality of the work, or which work was originally
      completed by who;
      There may be many ideas, but it may be difficult evaluate each idea thoroughly
      as there may be a lack of centralised planning and/or a lack of a clearly defined
      hierarchy;

      Conclusions [1 max]
      Collective intelligence can help organizations in solving a problem in certain
      contexts;
      These may include where there is a need to provide information quickly such as a
      health related requirement, or where the final information is not critical to the
      wellbeing of others, for example a site such as Wikipedia;                              [5]

            Award [1] for a reference to the context;

            Note: to a certain extent mixing and matching can take place

            It promotes code reuse;
            because the superclass POSline;
            holds common data and actions that are shared by all newly developed classes;

            It reduces maintenance overhead;
            because you only have to update the superclass;
            in this case POSline;

            allows extensibility / ability to create other classes easily;
            specific types of check-out can be created;
            reducing development time / costs / testing;                                              [3]

      (c)   Award [4 max].
            Saves development time;
            Since classes and their methods do not need to be rewritten;

            Promotes abstraction;
            Because reusable code exists that functions without knowledge of internal
            working;

            Libraries contain error-free / robust code;
            because it has been used and tested many times;

            Promotes efficiency / organization;
            As code will be shorter / easier to read / develop;
