Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                                 Section A
1.   (a)   (i)     State one transfer of matter occurring within the soil profile.                [1 max]

           biological mixing by soil animals/earthworms / leaching / seepage / capillary
           action / drainage / percolation / infiltration / eluviation / absorption of
           minerals/water by living organisms;


     Do not accept INPUTS of matter eg precipitation, leaf litter, parent material, particle deposition or
     OUTPUTS of matter eg erosion; or TRANSFORMATIONS of matter eg evaporation/weathering.


           (ii)    State one transformation process occurring within the soil profile.            [1 max]

           decomposition;
           humus formation/humification of organic matter;
           weathering of primary minerals/parent rock;
           nutrient cycling/nitrogen fixation/nitrification/denitrification/ammonification;
           evaporation;
           rusting soil;

     Do not accept inputs, outputs or transfers of matter or transformations that do not occur within the
     soil profile.

           (iii)   Identify one example of an output to the atmosphere from the soil system.           [1]

           Nitrogen (from denitrification) / water (vapour from evaporation) / heat (from
           radiation/conduction) / soil particles/erosion (from wind) / CO2 (from soil organism
           respiration) / methane (from anaerobic decomposition);

     Do not credit the processes in brackets ... these may give rise to the outputs but are
     not themselves an output from the soil.

     (b)   Describe two characteristics of soil with high primary productivity.                        [2]

           optimum/medium particle size / loam soils / mixed/balanced composition of
           sand/silt/clay;
           allow good drainage/permeability/resist water-logging;
           prevent excessive leaching/good water-holding capacity;
           provide sufficient air space/porosity for root growth/O2 supply;
           contain ample dead organic matter/humus (for decomposers);
           healthy/abundant decomposing community/soil organisms;
           high availability of minerals/inorganic nutrients;
           appropriate pH (6.0–6.8);

     (c)   Outline two conservation methods that could be used to reduce soil erosion.            [2 max]

           Cultivation techniques:
           contour ploughing with furrows following the contour lines/at right angles to the
           slope/to reduce runoff;
           terrace farming forms a series of steps in the hillside area/to prevent run-off;
           maintaining cover crops/plant roots/stubble/mixed agriculture/agroforestry to hold
           soil in place between harvesting;
                                             –6–                 N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      mulching consists of applying organic material over the exposed soil / preventing
      surface runoff;
      buffer strips/vegetative areas by watercourses to reduce run-off/water erosion;
      adding soil conditioners/lime/humus/organic material/fertilizers to increase root
      growth/hold soil together;
      wind reduction techniques, eg wind/shelter breaks to prevent wind erosion;
      avoid overgrazing/over-cropping/monoculture which degrades soil texture;
      zero/minimum tillage reduces soil agitation/potential for erosion;
      trickle/drip irrigation reduces run-off causing erosion;

Note: As an ‘outline’ Q, response requires just a little more than just naming a
technique eg ‘terrace farming involves creating steps on a hillside’ or ‘terrace farming
prevents run-off’ are acceptable ...but ‘terrace farming’ alone is insufficient.
                                                 –7–                 N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Using Figure 2, identify one reason for the trend shown in the curve for:

           (i)    aquaculture

           Increased demand for aquaculture due to: [1 max]

           increased human population/increased demand for more food / decrease in some
           capture fisheries / genetic improvements in stock / technological advances in
           farming / shift of diet preferences to healthier provision of protein / increased
           demand for fishmeal/fish oil/animal feed / economically more viable/attractive /
           perceived as more ecologically effective than terrestrial livestock / need for food
           security (especially in Asian countries);

           (ii)   capture fisheries

           Reasons for increase, and reasons for less increase than aquaculture or
           stabilization should equally be credited [1 max]

           capture fisheries increased due to increased demand/human population/improved fishing
           technology;
           capture fisheries have increased less than aquaculture/stabilized due to depleted
           stocks/overfishing / negative impact of climate change / marine pollution / international
           regulations / growth of aquaculture reducing demand / most fish grounds have no more
           potential for production increase / reduced cost-effectiveness;


     (b)   Outline two negative environmental impacts of aquaculture.                            [2 max]

           loss/degradation of natural habitats;
           disease spread through farms;
           organic waste/excess food causing eutrophication/build-up of sediment/red tides;
           antibiotics/chemical treatments causing pollution;
           GMOs/non-indigenous species accidentally escaping, affecting the wild fish
           populations;
           depletion of freshwater reserves/salinization/aquifer depletion;


     (c)   Describe two strategies for the management of sustainable capture fisheries.          [2 max]

           regulation of quotas/minimum size of fish caught / harvesting less than or equal
           to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY);
           designation of marine protected areas (exclusion zones) / limited fishing zones;
           restriction on mesh size of nets/bottom-trawling/drift-netting/explosion/methods
           that decrease bycatch/damage habitat;
           restriction to fishing seasons / to let stocks recover;
           international/local efforts to monitor/study fish populations and identify
           MSY/sustainable limits of fishing;
           enforcing global treaties on sustainable practices / reducing unsustainable
           subsidies;
           reduce marine/plastic pollution that causes fish deaths/reduces stock;
           provide incentives for move toward aquaculture / reconciling the rights of various
           stakeholders;
                                                   –8–                  N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



3.   (a)   Identify the region with the highest fertility rate in the period 2005–2010.               [1]

           Sub-Saharan Africa;

     (b)   Outline two possible reasons for the projected change in total fertility rate in
           Sub-Saharan Africa in the period 2045–2050.                                            [2 max]

           increased level of education;
           emancipation/empowerment/greater independence of women economically/in
           having children;
           material ambition/increased economic cost of large families / urbanization;
           decrease in need to use children for labour; (due to increased mechanization of
           agriculture)
           (increased foreign funding toward) spread of family planning/ contraception;
           reduced child mortality (due to health improvements) would allow having less
           children;
           political decision/governmental initiatives to reduce young dependents and
           improve development / increased implementation of anti-natalist policies;

     Note: TFR is an average figure per capita so responses making reference to overall
     size of population are irrelevant and should not be credited.

     (c)   Identify two reasons for the projected increase in total fertility rate in Europe by
           the period 2045–2050.                                                                  [2 max]

           pronatal policies/governmental incentives (to address economic issues/increasing
           dependency ratio/international competition);
           eg reduced taxation/financial support for extra children;
           longer maternity/paternity leave;
           better day-care facilities/nurseries for infants/more flexible working hours for
           parents with small children;

     Do not credit ‘migration’. This may affect growth rate but would have an uncertain effect
     on TFR (unless candidates include the conditions of the migration coming from a
     country with high TFR that is subsequently maintained in host-country).
                                                 –9–                  N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   (a)   Using Figure 4, identify the country that is above the threshold for high human
           development and below the Earth’s biocapacity.                                           [1]

           Cuba;

     (b)   Outline the relationship between carrying capacity and ecological footprint.         [2 max]

           ecological footprint (EF) is the reciprocal/inverse of carrying capacity (CC);
           populations with high per capita EF will have low CC / a population with a low EF
           would be less limited by CC in a given area (and vice versa) / EF determines
           whether a population is living within limits of CC;
           EF identifies area needed (to satisfy the needs of a designated population)
           whereas CC identifies maximum population for sustainability (a designated area
           may sustain);
           EF is easier to calculate but has clear implications for CC;
           both EF and CC depend upon rate of resource consumption/waste produced;
           both EF and CC depend upon local environmental resources/waste processing
           ability;
           both EF and CC facilitate a quantitative assessment of sustainability;
           local EF may increase by import of goods produced elsewhere, whereas CC is
           dependent only to local productivity / CC may decrease through export of goods;
           EF is not applied to non-human populations (whereas CC is difficult to apply to
           human populations);

     (c)   To meet the minimum criteria for sustainability, a country needs to raise its
           human welfare above the threshold of high human development and have an
           ecological footprint below the Earth’s biocapacity.

           Evaluate two strategies a country can implement to achieve the minimum criteria
           for sustainability.                                                                  [4 max]

           There is a huge range of potentially creditable responses/strategies for
           sustainability so do credit responses not listed below but of equivalent relevance
           and detail.

           Strategy: reducing consumption of resources by change in lifestyle/reduced
           population growth/improved efficiency/imposing sustainable limits/ etc;
           Advantage: addresses problem at the source / may simultaneously solve multiple
           problems / etc;
           Disadvantage: may be unpopular / depends upon uncertain technological
           advance / may reduce economic development in LEDCs / etc;

           Strategy: reducing pollution through reducing consumption / limiting/regulating
           emissions / cleaning-up/restoring polluted ecosystems / finding cleaner
           resources/alternatives / etc;
           Advantage: some levels are more effective as they attack root of problem / helps
           to preserve biodiversity / reduces ecological footprint / etc;
           Disadvantage: clean-up may be expensive/ineffective / regulations may hinder
           development / production / technological advances may not be forthcoming / etc.

           Strategy: improving conservation/protection of species through conservation
           areas/CITES/ex-situ institutions/public campaigns/ etc;
           Advantage: biodiversity is maintained improving resilience/increasing stability /
           potential human resources are preserved / local populations may be
           educated/involved / etc;
                                           – 10 –              N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     Disadvantage: ex-situ conservation does not provide full range of habitat
     resources/genetic diversity / conservation areas may conflict with local population
     needs / policing/monitoring may be ineffective / etc;

Award [3 max] if the response gives either no advantages or no disadvantages.
Award [2 max] if the response gives neither advantages nor disadvantages.
Award [0] if no strategies are identified.
                                                   – 11 –               N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                                Section B

Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 19
with the guidance given below for each question.

5.   (a)   Outline, using examples, the differences between primary and secondary
           pollution.                                                                                [4 max]

           Primary pollution:
           is active upon emission of pollutant;
           eg carbon dioxide/sulphur oxides/ozone/lead/nitrates/phosphates/heat/light;

           Secondary pollution:
           occurs when primary pollutants undergo some kind of physical or chemical
           change;
           nitrogen/sulphur oxides combining with water to form nitric acid/sulphur acid/acid
           rain;
           nitrogen oxides/VOCs combining to form tropospheric ozone/photochemical
           smog;

     Note: some pollutants (eg ozone/sulphur oxides) can be credited as both a primary and
     secondary pollutant but to gain credit for the latter there must be an identification of a
     primary pollutant from which it is derived.

     Do not accept eutrophication (eg toxic substances released from algal blooms) as example of
     secondary pollutant


     (b)   Explain the causes and effects of acid deposition on natural ecosystems.                     [7 max]

           Causes:
           burning of fossil fuels releases NOx / SOx;
           the sources of these are mainly coal-burning industries/transportation/electricity
           generation;
           emissions from livestock/use & production of inorganic fertilizers also contribute;
           volcanic eruptions can also cause acid rain/release oxides of N/S;
           NOx/SOx react with water to form acid deposition;
           this acid may be deposited locally as dry deposition or dissolve in air moisture
           and reach ground by wet precipitation;
           nitrous oxides produce nitric acid / sulphur oxides produce sulphuric acid;
           wind may carry primary pollutants causing ecological damage to be widespread;

           Effects:
           direct adverse effect of acidity on living organisms eg kills lichens / plankton / fish
           / soil microbiota;
           causing leaf-fall/thinning of waxy cuticle/reduced immunity to disease/root
           damage in terrestrial plants;
           leading to reduced primary production/plant growth;
           indirect toxic effect by changing chemistry of soil/water;
           eg increased solubility/leaching of plant nutrients/reduced soil fertility;
           eg increased solubility/release of toxic metals/aluminium damaging fish/plants;
           such toxic metals might undergo bioconcentration/biomagnification;
           overall, may therefore cause loss of biodiversity/reduction in food chains/webs
           etc;
                                             – 12 –               N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Note: Do not credit biomagnification except in the explicit context of releasing heavy
metals. And do not credit impacts of ocean acidification or impacts on limestone/urban
infrastructure which are beyond the limits of this question.
Award [5 max] if either causes or effects are not included in response.


(c)   To what extent is pollution impacting human food production systems?                     [9 max]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each

6.   (a)   Outline the factors that contribute to total biodiversity of an ecosystem.             [4 max]

           biodiversity includes the diversity of species, habitat and genes;
           species diversity involves both the variety/number of species/richness and their
           relative proportions/evenness;
           habitat diversity refers to the range of different habitats in an ecosystem or
           biome;
           ...which may vary due to environmental gradients/changing abiotic
           conditions/altitude/latitude/major disturbances (volcanic activity/landslides, etc);
           habitat/niche diversification promotes species diversity;
           genetic diversity refers to the range of genetic material/genes in a
           population/species;
           ...which is influenced by mutation/sexual reproduction/natural
           selection/speciation;
           high primary productivity/insolation/precipitation/optimum abiotic conditions
           promote biodiversity;
           succession promotes greater biodiversity by increasing length/branching of food
           chains / because it leads to improved abiotic conditions;

     Credit can be gained through description of particular ecosystems eg. climax
     communities; hotspots; but the specific factors must be identified to gain credit.
     Do not credit human impacts or any factor reducing biodiversity.

     (b)   Explain how ecological techniques can be used to study the effects of human
           activities on the biodiversity of a named ecosystem.                                   [7 max]

           named ecosystem, eg shallow stream running through woodland;

           studies should be made before and after human activity/in proximal and distal
           positions from activity;
           Explanation: to provide evidence of human causation/correlation;

           transects and quadrats may be used to sample area;
           Exp: to reduce overall workload but be representative of area;

           sampling should be repeated over time/distance;
           Exp: to increase reliability;

           abundance/biomass of biotic components may be measured;
           Exp: to assess whether population size/productivity of populations/species have
           been affected.

           numbers of motile organisms can be measured using Lincoln Index/mark–
           release–recapture;
           Exp: because quadrats are ineffective if organisms are constantly on the move;

           abiotic components may be measured using probes/thermometers/chemical
           tests, etc;
           Exp: because human activity may alter prevailing abiotic conditions;

           indicator species may be identified/quantified (using keys);
           Exp: because their presence/abundance will indicate degree of human impact;

           species diversity can be measured using a diversity index (eg Simpson’s);
                                              – 14 –               N19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Exp: because the index takes into account both species richness and
      equitability/distribution/relative abundance / can quantitatively compare different
      habitats/same habitat over time;

      genetic & habitat diversity can be identified;
      Exp: because these are also components of overall biodiversity.

         down with massive percentages of species threatened by habitat degradation
         and climate change’;

7.   (a)   Outline how energy drives the hydrological cycle.                                      [4 max]

           primary source of energy driving hydrological cycle is solar energy;
           solar energy causes changes of state in water eg
           evaporation/sublimation/melting/transpiration;
           condensation of water releases (latent) heat energy causing air to
           rise/hurricanes;
           solar energy causes the temperature differences that create winds/cause
           movement of water vapour in the atmosphere/advection;
           kinetic/wind energy moves clouds (from ocean over land, usually);
           solar energy melts ice producing streams/lakes/rising ocean levels;
           solar energy causes both transfers (eg advection) and transformations (eg
           evaporation) in hydrological cycle;
           precipitation/run-off/streamflow occurs due to gravitational energy/difference in potential
           energy between the high and low positions;
           transpiration is driven by opening of leaf stomata which is due to chemical energy (cellular
           respiration in mitochondria);

     (b)   Explain, with the use of a system diagram, how human activities affect flows in
           the global water cycle.                                                                [7 max]




     Award up to [4 max] for identifying following impacts either on the diagram or in words:

           melting (1) will increase due to global warming/climate change/increased greenhouse gas
           emissions;
           freezing (2) will decrease due to global warming/climate change/etc;
           precipitation (4,6,8) will be polluted due to acid formation/emissions of NOx & SOx/ combustion
           of coal;
           precipitation (4,6,8) could change/increase/decrease due to climate change/etc;
           percolation/infiltration (8) will decrease due to urbanisation / soil compaction caused by eg
           overgrazing;
           run-off (5) will increase due to urbanization/deforestation;
           warmer/polluted streams (5) due to thermal/toxic pollution from industrial effluent;
           evaporation (3,7,9) will increase due to global warming/climate change/etc;
           evapotranspiration (10) will increase due to global warming/climate change/etc;
           evapotranspiration (10) will be reduced due to deforestation;
           uptake by plants (11) will be reduced due to deforestation / urbanization / long fallow periods;
           groundwater flow/aquifers (12) will change dependent on climatic impacts/precipitation / rate
           of human extraction;

      cloud seeding increases precipitation (4,6,8) (addressing problem of drought/fog around
      airports);

8.   (a)   Outline how the concept of sustainability can be applied to managing natural
           capital.                                                                              [4 max]

           natural capital refers to natural resources that can supply a natural income of
           goods or services;
           natural income is the yield/growth obtained from natural resources/capital;
           to be sustainable, natural capital must be used at rate slower than its
           replenishment / within maximum sustainable yield / that fulfils current needs
           without compromising future availability;
           if more than the natural income is extracted, then the use is unsustainable;
           exploitation of natural capital may also be unsustainable due to processes of
           extraction/transport/processing / environment should be in same condition as at
           outset to be sustainable;
           altering human behaviour/values/choices through policies/legislations/campaigns
           so that unsustainable exploitation of natural capital is reduced;
           non-renewable natural capital is either irreplaceable or can only be replaced over
           geological timescales / non-renewable natural capital can never be used
           sustainably;
     The question addresses the essential nature (concept) of sustainability rather than
     specific practices. However, do credit candidates for valid and specific examples if they
     exemplify any of the generic principles above.

     (b)   Explain how environmental indicators are used to assess sustainability.               [7 max]

           environmental indicators (EIs) may involve measures of biodiversity/
           pollution/population/climate/emissions/resource consumption;
           EIs are tools for measuring progress toward sustainability/supporting policy
           evaluation/informing the public/comparing nations;
           EIs involve the setting of measurable goals from established baseline
           measurements;
           EIs can be used at a range of scales from local to global;
           after some time, measures can be reassessed and compared to the baselines/
           domestic objectives/international agreements (eg Kyoto/Montreal Protocol);
           environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are EIs that measure a wide profile of
           indicators usually before and after some development;
           ecological footprints(EFs) are EIs that focus on rates of consumption compared
           to rates of natural income;
           if a population’s EF is greater than the area available this indicates
           unsustainability;
           the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment used indicators to give a scientific
           appraisal of the condition/trends in the world’s ecosystems and services;
           certain species can be used as indicators of pollution;
           some indicator species are particularly sensitive to pollution so a low abundance
           may suggest heavy pollution / high abundance suggest clean environment (eg
           lichens);
           loss of these sensitive species may be an effective indicator for appealing to the
           public;
           some indicator species are particularly resistant to pollution so a high
           abundance/dominance of these species may suggest high pollution (eg tubifex
           worms/coliform bacteria);
