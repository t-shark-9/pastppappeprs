                                                Section B

Answer the following question.

4.   Problems are continuing with Enrich drinks. Aran is becoming increasingly frustrated with
     the lack of growth of sales. He always wants to succeed and is driven by the need to get
     tasks completed. The Enrich part of his life is not a success. He blames the workforce. The
     workforce does not share his vision. Employees are mainly part-time workers and parents
     who value jobs that enable them to fit work around school hours. As Aran has become
     more autocratic in his leadership style, labour turnover has increased. Last month, from a
     workforce of twelve, one retired and two left for what they called “better jobs”.

     There are also increasing problems with the quality of Enrich drinks, as batches of Enrich are
     rejected by the quality control department. Elsie, the manager of the production department,
     blamed suppliers, saying that Aran had damaged business relations with them due to his
     impatience. Elsie also blamed Aran for poor stock management. She has proposed total
     quality management (TQM) as a solution to these problems.

     Detox

     Accord decided to start the production and marketing of Detox, the green tea drink that
     helps athletes to relax. Detox proved to be very successful. Encouraged by the success
     and boosted cash inflow, Kayla is considering producing a range of snack bars based on
     Enrich and Detox flavours and recipes. Accord would use the Enrich brand name for the
     snack bars. The market for healthy snack bars is very competitive and dominated by a few
     large companies who spend large amounts of money on advertising. The market is growing
     rapidly – some market researchers estimate by 34 % per annum. There are many examples
     of small businesses entering the market successfully on a small scale. Kayla estimates that
     the proposal would involve an investment of $100 000, with forecast net returns of $80 000
     for four years. Aran thinks that the money could be better spent on marketing Enrich drinks.

     (a)   Define the term labour turnover.                                                           [2]

     (b)   For Kayla’s proposal calculate:

           (i)    the payback period;                                                                 [2]

           (ii)   the net present value (NPV) using a discount rate of 6 %*.                          [2]

     (c)   With reference to Accord, explain one advantage and one disadvantage of using total
           quality management (TQM).                                                                  [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether Aran and Kayla should change the organizational culture of Accord to
           overcome the problems with Enrich drinks.                                                 [10]

                                              Section C

Answer the following question.

5.   Accord have not yet made a decision about producing a range of snack bars.

     Kayla is certain that there is a market for the snack bar products. The snack bars would
     complement Accord’s product portfolio. The investment required, according to Kayla’s
     estimate (see Section B), is acceptable and she is certain that it is the right time for the
     business to grow. Her information on the market (see Appendix 1) is very positive. In
     contrast, she believes that it is too difficult to grow in the beverage market because of
     competition, so she would prefer to switch from drinks to snack bars. She likes owning the
     business and has very clear objectives for the future.

     Aran is becoming increasingly frustrated. His idea of targeting a mass market for Enrich and
     Detox has been rejected by Kayla and other managers at Accord. His efforts to introduce
     total quality management (TQM) failed because employees resisted the change. He is
     interested in performance and not relaxation, so he does not like Detox as an idea for a product.

     Aran has been approached by Star Food (SF), a multinational company (MNC) that produces
     a range of food products including soft drinks. SF are interested in the Enrich brand name
     and Accord’s contracts with sports centres. SF have offered to buy Accord for $5 million. This
     is approximately five years of earnings for Accord. Kayla and Aran would keep the Detox
     part of the business. Aran would be happy to accept the offer, particularly given the risk that
     Accord may not survive (Table 1). Aran likes the certainty that the sale would bring. He would
     accept a small payment from Kayla to sell his share of the Detox business to her.

                                         Year 2                   34 %

(Question 5 continued)


           Appendix 1: Extract adapted from a Mintel report on sports nutrition food

       “New research shows that in some countries, such as the UK, as many as one in four
       adults have consumed a sports nutrition product (drinks, bars etc) in the past 3 months.
       Sales are growing rapidly. The market is expanding beyond the elite sports people
       and gym fans. The products are increasingly attracting ‘lifestyle’ users who see these
       products fitting in with a healthy, active life style. There are plenty of opportunities for
       new developments of products.”

                         [Source: Mintel’s Attitudes towards Sports Nutrition UK 2016 report]


     Using the case study and the additional information on pages 3 and 4, recommend whether
     Accord should start making and selling snack bars or whether Kayla and Aran should sell
     Accord to SF. A force field analysis of the options could help you in your answer.                [20]
