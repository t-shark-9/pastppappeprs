                                                   Accord

     Aran and Kayla are successful international athletes. They live in a country that is a mainly
     tertiary economy with few primary producers. Aran, a marathon runner, has won several national
     titles. Kayla, a heptathlete, competes in tournaments nationally and overseas.

     The government of this country has limited funds to support athletes. Aran and Kayla must
 5   frequently apply for scholarships and corporate sponsorship funding for travel, equipment and
     entrance fees to competitions. They also apply to charities and non‑governmental organizations
     (NGOs) for financial support.

     As athletes in a humid climate, Aran and Kayla drink a lot of water. Aran also began
     supplementing his water intake with expensive, carefully selected imported energy drinks,
10   which were becoming increasingly popular. In 2018, the brand leader sold over six billion drinks,
     with its sales growing at 25 % each year. Aran researched energy drinks and discovered that
     the health benefits and costs are controversial. Some manufacturers argue that energy drinks
     can improve thinking skills and attention spans. This is similar to the way other caffeinated
     products, such as tea and coffee, are used by older consumers. Most medical pressure groups,
15   however, argue that energy drinks have negative side effects, especially if consumed by
     younger consumers. They warn that the amount of caffeine and sugar contained in these drinks
     can be harmful.

     Aran decided that he would only consume a limited range of carefully selected energy drinks to
     support his demanding training programme. These carefully selected energy drinks are supplied
20   by multinational companies (MNCs) that sell through business-to-consumer (B2C) channels
     only. The market for these specialized energy drinks for athletes is niche and medical approval
     from sports governing bodies is required before the drinks can be used by athletes.

     Concerned about the cost of the energy drinks and their composition, Aran decided to make
     his own drinks from imported ingredients such as oranges, kale and spinach. Aran called this
25   energy drink Enrich. Enrich is made only from natural ingredients. Aran believes that Enrich will
     be the first all‑natural energy drink on the market and considers “all natural” to be its unique
     selling point/proposition (USP). Kayla has questioned this USP, arguing that all‑natural energy
     drinks already exist. Aran countered by saying that, in addition to providing excellent nutrition for
     marathon running, Enrich would save athletes money: they would not need to purchase vitamins
30   or go to the doctor as often. Aran felt that Enrich should be viewed not only as an energy drink
     but as a brand of related products and services, which would allow Enrich to become a healthy
     lifestyle brand. He was already thinking about long‑term goals.

     Aran offered free samples of Enrich to athletes in different sports who lived and trained in
     his country. When Aran struggled to pay for his training and competitions, he also sold small
35   quantities of Enrich to offset some of the expenses. Aran assures his customers that Enrich is
     nutritious, produced with 100 % natural ingredients and would meet the standards set by the
     sports governing bodies. Once refrigerated, it would also stay fresh for up to a week. Aran also
     thinks that Enrich could be frozen and transported to customers over longer distances, but
     further research and development is required.

40   With their international sporting careers nearing an end, Aran and Kayla decide to create a
     partnership called Accord. Their vision is to sell Enrich as an ethical energy drink free from
     added sugar, caffeine, artificial sweeteners and preservatives. The business would also have
     very high ethical objectives, which would determine their future marketing, operations and
     financial direction.

45   Kayla completed some secondary market research about the potential size of the market for
     all‑natural energy drinks. She had just attended a food and beverage conference, where she
                                                –3–              N19/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     learned that some MNCs were considering producing fruit and vegetable energy drinks. Posing
     as a potential customer rather than a potential business owner, Kayla discovered that one MNC,
     ABC, had carried out some primary market research using a snowballing technique to see how
50   large the all‑natural energy drink market could become in four years.

     Starting up Accord was easy and quick. Kayla registered the business and offered to manage
     the financial aspects. She also focused on building the brand value of Enrich by using social
     media, their athlete contacts and friends and family, which numbered over 100 people.
     She used these contacts to conduct primary market research on attitudes to natural and
55   health‑related energy drinks. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. However, Kayla was
     concerned about the fact that this first attempt to conduct primary market research focused on
     people they already knew. If Accord had conducted random sampling on attitudes to natural
     and health‑related energy drinks, would they have received the same favourable feedback?
     Given Aran’s enthusiasm, she decided not to tell him about her concerns.

60   Kayla and Aran decided that Kayla should manage marketing and finance, and Aran manage
     the operations and supply chain. They chose not to create a human resource department
     because Accord had a small workforce. Aran already had the overseas supplier contacts but
     would need additional suppliers of fruit and vegetables. He would also need to find space to
     prepare and store the energy drinks. Aran thought that if Enrich was successful, they might
65   need to find a small factory. This factory would use job/customized production.

     Aran knew the price of the Enrich range was significantly more expensive than those charged
     by the large MNCs, which supplied an ever‑increasing range of energy drinks, fruit drinks and
     other beverages. Enrich’s drinks averaged $3.00 per bottle, compared with a typical price of
     $2.20 for similar drinks from MNCs. These MNCs, such as ABC, were large and experienced in
70   the beverage market and had significant branding advantages, economies of scale and wider
     promotional reach. Enrich was restricted to below‑the‑line promotional methods, which Kayla
     thought the most cost effective. Kayla also thought that below-the-line promotional methods
     would allow Accord to have tighter control over their positioning as the foremost ethical provider
     of energy drinks.

75   However, Kayla’s secondary market research indicated that many of the competing energy
     drinks produced by MNCs were being sold to teenagers, contrary to government policies and
     agreements with retailers such as supermarkets. The drinks had labels such as “not to be sold
     to children”, but retailers were ignoring these laws. Kayla became convinced that Enrich could
     create a USP as the only locally produced, caffeine-free, all‑natural energy drink. Enrich would
80   be sold only through affiliated sports and leisure clubs. The additional health benefits and cost
     savings experienced by their customers would strengthen their USP and brand value.

     The restriction of selling only through affiliated sports clubs would enhance their ethical
     credentials (as teenagers who are not members of a sports club would not be able to purchase
     the drinks) but would initially limit their sales. Kayla argued to Aran that establishing Accord and
85   their brand was more important than generating large profits in the short term – profits would
     hopefully follow in future years. Kayla argued that Enrich had a first‑mover advantage in this
     particular market given that the multinational competitors were only just beginning to consider
     the idea of all‑natural energy drinks. As such, Kayla still regarded Enrich as a niche product.

     Aran saw things differently. He thought that treating Enrich as a niche product would narrow the
90   possible market segments. He favoured a mass-market approach. Aran considered Enrich a
     significant product innovation. If Accord waited to launch the brand as a mass-market product,
     they would be missing out on potentially high profits. Becoming impatient, he argued that
     they should borrow immediately for revenue and capital expenditures to finance increased
     production. They would soon need more skilled employees to manage the equipment. Through
95   his contacts, Aran had heard that ABC would soon be launching a new all‑natural energy drink.

                                                                                               Turn over
                                                   –4–              N19/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

        After three months of operation without a decision, sales of Enrich were satisfactory but below
        forecasts. Aran and Kayla were both working very long hours. Feedback from their friends and
        fellow athletes was positive, yet new customers contacting Accord through social media said
        they were confused about whether Enrich was a fruit juice or an energy drink. They also claimed
  100   that the health benefits of Enrich were exaggerated and the drink was too expensive.

        This feedback took Aran and Kayla by surprise. Advising caution, Kayla felt that they should do
        more research on customer perception and the competition. However, Aran argued that they
        should expand production to lower per unit costs. They could then reduce prices and keep gross
        profit margins the same. He believed that sales would pick up in three months. However, they
  105   had invested so much time and effort into Enrich that they both wanted to continue with it. They
        decided to increase production using existing capacity.

        Kayla was unsuccessful, however, in finding external sources of finance to increase
        production capacity. After considering several alternatives, a business angel looking to invest
        in new, socially responsible businesses contacted Accord. The angel investor wanted some
  110   involvement in the day-to-day management, which Kayla was reluctant to allow.

        Aran also looked for potential investors. A famous athlete, Jesse, looking to rebuild his own
        brand identity after accusations of cheating, contacted Aran. Jesse had won a major competition
        in a specially designed innovative running outfit. The outfit reduced wind resistance, and other
        competitors complained that it gave him an unfair advantage. Jesse and the competitors
  115   carried out their disagreements on social media and sympathy for Jesse diminished after it was
        revealed that he was paid $2 million to wear the running outfit against the wishes of his other
        sponsors.

        Aran was nervous about Jesse but also sympathetic. He respected Jesse as an athlete and
        knew that his association with the brand could help boost the media reach of Enrich at a time of
  120   increasing sales. However, he feared a social media backlash could undermine and tarnish the
        brand.

        After some further investigations into suitable premises and production equipment to support
        the future growth of Enrich, Kayla and Aran found an affordable abandoned confectionery
        production plant that would increase the production capacity. Some of the older confectionery-
  125   making equipment would need to be replaced.

        Kayla carried out some further market research to see if the additional capacity could be used
        for another drink that would complement Enrich. These drinks could form part of the lifestyle
        brand that Aran had envisaged. Her investigations led her to discuss with Aran the idea of a
        drink based on green tea, called Detox, which could allow athletes to relax after a hard training
  130   day. As with energy drinks, the health effects of green tea to help athletes relax were not
        conclusive. However, Kayla argued that unless they introduced this new product, Enrich would
        struggle to be economically sustainable.
