Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

 Marks     Level descriptor
           • Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands
              and implications of the question. Answers are well structured, balanced and effectively
              organized.
           • Knowledge is detailed, accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical
              context, and there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
 13–15     • Examples used are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to support the
              analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are clear and coherent. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
              evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer.
           • The answer contains well-developed critical analysis. All, or nearly all, of the main points
              are substantiated, and the response argues to a reasoned conclusion.
           • The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well
              structured and organized, although there may be some repetition or lack of clarity in
              places.
           • Knowledge is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
              there is a clear understanding of historical concepts. Examples used are appropriate and
 10–12
              relevant, and are used to support the analysis/evaluation.
           • Arguments are mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and evaluation of
              different perspectives.
           • The response contains critical analysis. Most of the main points are substantiated, and
              the response argues to a consistent conclusion.
           • The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
              demands are only partially addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured
              approach.
  7–9      • Knowledge is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their historical
              context. Examples used are appropriate and relevant.

              commentary, but this is not sustained.
           • The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there
              may be an attempt to follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and
              coherence.
  4–6      • Knowledge is demonstrated but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
              understanding of historical context. The answer makes use of specific examples,
              although these may be vague or lack relevance.
           • There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in
              nature, rather than analytical.
           • There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The response is poorly
              structured or, where there is a recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on
              the task.
  1–3      • Little knowledge is present. Where specific examples are referred to, they are factually
              incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           • The response contains little or no critical analysis. It may consist mostly of
              generalizations and poorly substantiated assertions.
   0       • Response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

Section 1: Indigenous societies and cultures in the Americas (c750–1500)

1.   “Empires had a more efficient political organization than confederations.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that empires were politically more efficient than confederations. The political organizations may or
     may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
     empires and confederations, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both
     systems will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to succession procedures, levels of tribal sovereignty, political responses of
     empires and confederations to internal rivalries and other challenges, or long-lasting political
     organization. While other relevant factors, for example the influence of religious beliefs on political
     organization, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


2.   Evaluate the impact of systems of exchange on two indigenous societies.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of systems of exchange in
     two indigenous societies, weighing up their strengths and limitations. A comparative approach
     between the two systems of exchange may or may not be used. The two indigenous societies may
     or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The impact may extend beyond the
     timeframe, but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of both societies, or they may prioritize their evaluation of one of them. However,
     two societies will feature in their response. Candidates may evaluate the contribution of the
     systems of exchange to labour specialization, developments in urbanization or in transport. Both
     strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be equal focus on
     each. While other relevant factors, for example the relationship between systems of exchange and
     territorial expansion, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in
     the question.
                                                    –5–                   N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 2: European explorations and conquests in the Americas (c1492–c1600)

3.   Discuss the impact of Columbus’s exploration on the Americas.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
     Columbus’s voyages of exploration on the Americas. The impact may extend beyond the
     timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
     the religious impact and discuss the attempts to convert the indigenous peoples to Christianity.
     Candidates may refer to economic effects and discuss, for example, the exchange of goods or the
     tributes imposed on the indigenous peoples. They may also consider the impact of the
     establishment of the encomienda system on the indigenous population. They may discuss the
     response to the arrival of Columbus and refer, for example, to the burning of the settlement of La
     Navidad in Haiti. While other relevant factors, for example the impact of Columbus’s exploration on
     encouraging further voyages of discovery, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
     on the issue raised in the question.


4.   “Political instability was the most significant factor in the defeat of the Incas.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that political instability was the main reason for the defeat of the Incas. Causes for the Inca defeat
     may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may discuss the extent to which the Inca Civil War (1527–1532) encouraged Pizarro to
     march to Cajamarca. They may discuss the political instability produced by the rivalries between
     the regions that supported Atahualpa and those supporting Huáscar. They may also refer to the
     role of Atahualpa in inviting the Spanish into Cusco. While other relevant factors, such as the
     Spanish technological superiority or the impact of European diseases on the Incas, may be
     referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                  –6–                 N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 3: Colonial government in the New World (1500–1800)

5.   To what extent did two colonial governments overcome political challenges?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     colonial governments overcame political challenges. The two governments may or may not have
     been contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to the challenges arising from the colonial governments’ relations with their
     colonial ruler. They may consider challenges arising from the territorial divisions, for example, the
     creation of new viceroyalties and captaincies. They may also focus on the challenges presented by
     religious orders, indigenous people or the creoles. While other relevant factors, such as the impact
     of economic factors on the colonial governments, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
     remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
     the suggestion.


6.   Examine the impact of Anglo-French rivalry on North America up to 1763.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between Anglo-French rivalry
     and events in North America up to 1763. The impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must
     be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may consider the impact of Anglo-
     French rivalry on the military and trading alliances with the indigenous peoples or on fur and fish
     trade. They may refer to the territorial impact of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). They may also
     examine the impact of the French and Indian Wars and of the Treaty of Paris (1763), which made
     Britain the dominant power in North America. They may also refer to the Proclamation Act (1763),
     which divided British colonies from indigenous lands, and examine the impact on both the
     indigenous people and colonists.
                                                  –7–                 N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 4: Religion in the New World (1500–1800)

7.   Evaluate the influence of the Catholic Church in Spanish and Portuguese America.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Catholic Church, weighing up the
     importance of its influence in Spanish and Portuguese America. The influence may extend beyond
     the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
     offer equal coverage of Spanish and Portuguese America, or they may prioritize their evaluation of
     one. However, both regions will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may
     not be used. Candidates may refer to the role of the Catholic Church in the conversion of
     indigenous peoples to Christianity and in the development of syncretism, its influence in education
     or in the abolition of indigenous slavery. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated,
     but there does not need to be equal focus on each. While other relevant factors, such as
     indigenous resistance, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
     in the question.


8.   “The political organization of religious orders was more successful than their economic
     organization.” Discuss with reference to one religious order in the Americas.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that religious orders were more successful at their political organization than at their economic
     organization. Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and economic organization, or they
     may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
     response. Candidates may refer to the political and economic relationship of religious orders with
     indigenous groups and with European settlers. They may also discuss the extent to which the
     orders achieved political and economic autonomy. While other relevant factors, such as the
     expulsion of the Jesuits, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
     raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                 –8–                  N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 5: Slavery and the New World (1500–1800)

9.    Discuss the economic impact of slavery in the New World.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
      impact of slavery in the Americas. The economic impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may refer to the extent to which slavery was successful in either replacing or
      complementing indigenous labour. They may discuss the significance of slavery to the expansion
      of, for example, sugar and tobacco plantations. They may discuss the impact of slavery on other
      economic activities, such as mining. They may also discuss the economic impact of the slave trade
      itself. While other relevant factors, such as the living and working conditions of slaves, may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


10.   Discuss the nature and impact of slave rebellions.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the nature and
      impact of slave rebellions. Nature may predate the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked
      to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of nature and impact, or
      they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may discuss the extent to
      which slave rebellions were violent, popular or spontaneous in nature. For impact, candidates may
      discuss the extent of success of the rebellions, their impact on slave legislation or their
      contributions to further rebellions in other regions of the Americas. While other relevant factors,
      such as the Haitian Revolution (1791–1804), may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                   –9–                  N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 6: Independence movements (1763–1830)

11.   With reference to the period from 1763 to 1776, discuss the crises that led to the thirteen British
      colonies in North America declaring independence.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the crises that
      occurred in the British colonies that led them to declare independence. While there may be events
      prior to 1763 that led to the crises, the crises themselves must be within the timeframe stated.
      Candidates may refer to the crises in chronological order or in order of importance. They might
      discuss the political and economic changes that occurred after the ending of the French and Indian
      War. These could include the Proclamation Line of 1763, the end of salutary neglect and increased
      taxation upon the colonies, such as the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, and the Tea Act. Other events
      that could be discussed are the Boston Massacre, the Coercive Acts, the First and Second
      Continental Congresses as well as the later military engagements at Lexington, Concord and
      Bunker Hill.


12.   Compare and contrast the independence processes in two Latin American countries.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the independence processes in two Latin American countries, referring to both throughout. The two
      processes may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may
      compare and contrast the role of political or intellectual elites. They may refer to the role of Latin
      American juntas, the Catholic Church, indigenous people or mestizos in both processes. They may
      compare and contrast the role of foreign nations, their military contributions or the role of foreign
      volunteers. Candidates may compare and contrast the violence involved in each process or the
      contributions of individual leaders. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but
      there does not need to be an equal number of each.
                                                  – 10 –               N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 7: Nation-building and challenges (c1780–c1870)

13.   “Caudillos offered an effective response to the challenges of independence.” Discuss with
      reference to one caudillo.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that caudillos responded effectively to the challenges that came with independence. Candidates
      may refer to a caudillo who achieved some economic progress after the wars of independence or
      may discuss a case in which a caudillo compromised economic development. They may discuss
      the extent to which a caudillo was effective at preventing territorial disintegration by suppressing
      domestic opposition or challenges from foreign powers. Candidates may also discuss whether the
      caudillo promoted some extent of democracy or whether they overlooked legitimacy. While other
      relevant factors, such as the reasons for the challenges, may be referred to, the bulk of the
      response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement.


14.   Examine the causes and effects of the 1837 rebellions in Canada.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the causes and
      effects of the 1837 rebellions in Canada. Causes may predate the timeframe and the effects may
      extend beyond the timeframe, but both must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may differentiate between causes and effects in Upper Canada as opposed to Lower
      Canada or they may group causes and effects together for both. Causes could include land
      distribution policies, commercial and industrial policies and the power of the Church of England for
      Upper Canada. For Lower Canada, causes relate to Anglo-French disputes over control of the
      government. Effects of the rebellions are the Durham Report and its proposal for uniting the two
      colonies into the Province of Canada and eventually a more democratic government.
                                                       – 11 –                 N19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


Section 8: United States' Civil War: Causes, course and effects (1840–1877)

15.   Examine the arguments for and against slavery in the United States during the period.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of arguments used
      by those opposed to slavery and those in favour of slavery during the studied period. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of both sides of the debate or they may prioritize their discussion of the
      arguments. Abolitionists’ arguments included the immorality and brutality of slavery; the dichotomy
      between American ideas of freedom and equality and slavery; the economic stagnation that it
      caused the South. Pro-slavery arguments from the period included historical and biblical
      justification; constitutional recognition of slavery; scientific justification of racial inferiority; the social
      justification that slaves were being provided for, which they couldn’t do themselves. While other
      relevant arguments could be included, such as maintaining or diminishing the power of slavocracy,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


16.   “Sectionalism was the main cause of the Civil War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that sectionalism was the main cause of the Civil War. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Sectionalism was the divide between the northern states and the southern states, where all
      issues were seen as benefitting one but not the other. This divide was the result of disagreements
      over the expansion of slavery, tariffs and the enforcement of fugitive slave laws. Other examples of
      sectionalism could be the Wilmot Proviso, the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas–Nebraska Act.
      While other causes, such as economic differences, cultural differences, the issue of states’ rights
      and slavery, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised by the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 9: The development of modern nations (1865–1929)

17.   Evaluate the impact of urbanization on the development of two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of urbanization in two countries, weighing
      up the strengths and limitations. The two processes of urbanization may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries,
      or they may prioritize their evaluation of one. However, both countries will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      contribution of urbanization to economic modernization, housing, urban planning or transport. They
      may evaluate the impact on demands for social and political reform. They may refer to social or
      racial conflicts emerging from urbanization. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
      indicated, but there does not need to be equal focus on each. While other relevant factors, such as
      the rise of trade unions, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question.


18.   Discuss the factors that influenced developments in the arts in two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the factors that
      influenced developments in the arts in two countries. Factors may predate the timeframe, but they
      must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may refer to the influence of European movements, such as Realism, in
      literature and visual arts. They may discuss the motivations to produce art with a national identity
      and refer to the rise of, for example, Nativism. Candidates may discuss the influence of social and
      political ideas, as seen, for example, in the work of Mexican muralists. While other relevant factors,
      such as US–Latin American tensions, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.

Section 10: Emergence of the Americas in global affairs (1880–1929)

19.   “Economic interests led to the entry of the US into the First World War.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      economic interests led to the US entry into the First World War. Reasons for US entry may predate
      the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      refer to economic interests of American banks wanting to insure repayment of loans to the Allies
      and of American armament manufacturers and other industries in the US that had profited from
      selling to the Allies and who would continue to profit from US entry. Other reasons for US entry
      could be the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare by the German Navy, the proposed
      alliance with Mexico in the Zimmerman Telegram, and Wilson’s desire to be at the peace table
      when the war was over. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree
      with the statement.


20.   Evaluate the economic impact of the First World War on two countries of the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the economic impact of the First World
      War on two countries of the Americas. A comparative approach may or may not be used. The
      impact may extend beyond the timeframe, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. The question does not require that the countries chosen were involved militarily, though
      they certainly could have been. Likely choices are the United States, Canada and Brazil, but
      accept any other relevant country for which an economic impact can be shown. Candidates may
      refer to industrial growth in war industries, agricultural expansion and increased sales. If the
      chosen country entered the war, candidates are likely to discuss the economic growth as a result
      of increased wartime spending. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries or they
      may prioritize their evaluation of economic impact on one.

Section 11: The Mexican Revolution (1884–1940)

21.   Evaluate the contribution of Porfirio Díaz to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contributions of Porfirio Díaz to the
      outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, weighing up his importance or otherwise. Some factors may
      predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to Díaz’s personalistic dictatorship, his disregard for the 1857 Constitution
      and his use of repression. They may refer to social inequality and poverty under his rule. They may
      also refer to the issue of Díaz’s succession. Both Díaz’s importance and limitations must be clearly
      indicated, but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While other relevant factors, such
      as the rise of new political figures, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the
      issue raised in the question.


22.   Examine the aims and achievements of Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the aims and
      achievements of Villa and the Mexican Revolution. Candidates may offer equal coverage of aims
      and achievements, or they may prioritize their examination of one of them. However, both aspects
      will be a feature of the response. Candidates may consider Villa’s opposition to the Porfiriato, his
      determination to see revolutionary reforms enacted fully or his support for a land reform in Mexico.
      Candidates may examine Villa’s effective military leadership of the Division of the North and refer
      to his victories, for example at the battle of Zacatecas or his entrance to Mexico City in 1914. While
      other relevant interrelationships, such as the methods used by Villa, may be considered, the bulk
      of the response will remain on those raised in the question.

Section 12: The Great Depression and the Americas (mid 1920s–1939)

23.   Compare and contrast the responses of Herbert Hoover and Franklin D Roosevelt to the Great
      Depression.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      Hoover and Roosevelt in terms of responses to the Great Depression, referring to both throughout.
      Candidates may refer to the actions taken by each president during their term of office. For
      similarities, both presidents thought government should take some action, but at different levels of
      government and in different quantities. Both provided aid to banks and industry, and both offered
      public works programmes. In contrast, Hoover’s responses were much smaller and less effective;
      whereas Roosevelt’s were much larger, and, at least temporarily, more effective. Candidates might
      add that Hoover’s responses were limited because he thought the economy would correct itself,
      whereas Roosevelt felt government intervention was necessary. Both similarities and differences
      must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal number of each.


24.   Evaluate the effectiveness of the response to the Great Depression in one country in Latin
      America.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the response to the Great Depression
      in one country in Latin America, weighing up the strengths and limitations of that response.
      Candidates may refer to any Latin American country that suffered from the Great Depression.
      Probable choices include Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. For Brazil, candidates could discuss the
      responses of Vargas with import substitution industrialization (ISI) and Estado Novo. For Argentina,
      the Concordancia and ISI could be discussed. For Mexico, the responses by the Maximato and,
      later, Cárdenas could be discussed. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated, but
      there does not need to be an equal focus on each.

Section 13: The Second World War and the Americas (1933–1945)

25.   “The contributions of countries in the Americas to the Second World War were limited.” Discuss
      with reference to two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the contributions of countries in the Americas to the Second World War were limited.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries or they may prioritize their discussion by
      the amount of contributions. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may
      refer to economic, diplomatic or military contributions. Canada, the United States and Brazil are
      likely choices for candidates who disagree with the quote. Many other countries in the Americas
      could be used to agree with the quote. Candidates might use one country with heavy involvement
      and another with limited involvement to show the differences between countries in the Americas.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


26.   Discuss the social impact of the Second World War on one country in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact
      of the Second World War on one country in the Americas. The social impact may extend beyond
      the Second World War, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. The social
      impact of the Second World War on one country will certainly vary depending on which country is
      chosen. Some common themes that could be mentioned include impact on women, families,
      minority groups, society as a whole, personal liberties, the arts and media, culture and
      government. While other relevant factors, such as political or economic factors, may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the questions.

Section 14: Political developments in Latin America (1945–1980)

27.   “Fidel Castro’s social and cultural policies were more successful than his economic policies.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that Castro’s social and cultural policies were more successful than his economic policies. The
      impact of Castro’s policies may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
      issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social/cultural and economic
      policies, or they may prioritize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may consider the achievements of education reforms, health
      policies, policies towards women or racial policies. They may discuss the impact of the agrarian
      reforms or of economic programmes, such as Guevara’s moral incentives; the Revolutionary
      Offensive (1968) or the “Year of the 10 Million Ton Harvest” (1970). Candidates may refer to
      Cuba’s economic dependence on the Soviet Union. While other relevant factors, such as relations
      with the US and the USSR, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


28.   Compare and contrast the rise to power of two populist leaders in the Americas.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the rise
      to power of two populist leaders, referring to both throughout. The two leaders may or may not
      have been contemporaries with each other. Reasons leading to their rise may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      compare and contrast the leaders’ relationships with the urban working classes, existing political
      parties or the Catholic Church. They may refer to the leaders’ appeals to popular discontent with,
      for example, existing military rule or fraudulent governments. They may compare and contrast
      ideological factors, the role played by charisma, the use of the media and mass rallies. Both
      similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.

Section 15: Political developments in the United States (1945–1980) and Canada (1945–1982)

29.   “Kennedy failed to implement his New Frontier programme.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Kennedy failed to implement his New Frontier programme. Candidates need to determine whether
      or not Kennedy implemented the policies of the New Frontier. Candidates may indicate that
      Kennedy was able to get some policies enacted but failed in others. Achievements could include
      raising the minimum wage; increasing social security benefits; creating the Peace Corps; signing
      the Equal Pay Act of 1963; increasing the budget for NASA and the race to the moon; providing
      support for the civil rights movement. However, a coalition of Republicans and Southern
      Democrats defeated national health insurance for the elderly and the poor; voted against increased
      federal spending for education and for conservation programmes and against civil rights legislation.
      Candidates might indicate that many of these were later passed under Johnson to honour
      Kennedy, but they were not accomplished as part of his New Frontier. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement.


30.   Evaluate the impact of Nixon’s domestic policies.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Nixon’s domestic
      policies, weighing up their strengths and limitations. The impact may extend beyond Nixon’s
      administration, but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
      discuss the creation of environmental programmes, such as the Environmental Protection Agency
      and the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. Other domestic policies could be the creation of the
      Family Assistance Plan and increases in Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare. On civil rights
      matters, Nixon preferred to let states, rather than the federal government, determine how to end
      segregation. Economically, Nixon was faced with a combination of inflation and recession, which
      became known as stagflation. He increased tariffs and implemented wage and price freezes to
      control the economy. Candidates need to evaluate the impact of these programmes, and that
      impact could be social, economic or political.

Section 16: The Cold War and the Americas (1945–1981)

31.   Evaluate the reasons for US participation in the Korean War.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for US participation in the
      Korean War, weighing up the importance or limitations of those reasons. Reasons may predate the
      timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to US participation as a result of Truman’s containment policy, his desire to protect South Korea
      from North Korean aggression and a fear that it was orchestrated by Stalin and communist
      expansionism. They might also include Truman’s reluctance to allow another country to fall to
      communism after Mao’s victory in the Chinese Civil War. A desire to show that, unlike the League,
      the United Nations would act against aggression could also be stated.


32.   Examine the impact of the Cold War on the foreign policy of either Canada or one Latin American
      country.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the Cold War and the
      foreign policy of either Canada or one Latin American country. The response does not have to
      include the entire timeframe of the Cold War and is more likely to focus on particular events
      relevant to the country chosen. During the Cold War, Canada was closely aligned with the United
      States and thus was involved in several projects and organizations such as NATO and NORAD.
      However, Canada did not always agree with the US and openly expressed differences regarding
      Cuba and Vietnam. Any Latin American country is acceptable, but most will probably focus on
      Cuba and Castro’s revolution. Candidates may refer to Castro’s rejection of US interference, his
      closer ties with the Soviet Union, and eventually his leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement.
      Whichever country is chosen, candidates must examine the impact of the Cold War on foreign
      policy.

Section 17: Civil rights and social movements in the Americas post-1945

33.   Examine the tactics and successes of African-American civil rights organizations up to 1965.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the tactics and
      successes of African American civil rights organizations up to 1965. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of tactics and successes or they may prioritize their examination of successes. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to several African American
      civil rights organizations, such as CORE, NAACP, SCLC and SNCC. Tactics could be court case
      challenges to segregation, economic boycotts, forced school integration, sit-ins, interstate bus
      rides, marches and voter registration drives. Specific examples for successes could be Brown v.
      Board of Education, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Little Rock, Greensboro sit-ins and the March
      on Washington. Less successful examples could be the Freedom Rides, marches in Albany and
      Selma, and many school districts that closed rather than integrate. While other relevant
      interrelationships, such as tactics and leadership, may be considered, the bulk of the response will
      remain on that raised in the question.


34.   “Feminist movements had a positive impact on societies in the Americas.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that feminist movements had a positive impact on societies in the Americas. The feminist
      movements may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. They may offer equal
      coverage of several feminist movements in different countries or they may prioritize their
      discussion based upon the impact of the feminist movements. Candidates may refer to the impact
      in social, economic, legal or political terms. Candidates may refer to feminist movements in the
      United States, Canada, Argentina, Cuba or any other country in the Americas with notable feminist
      movements. While the impact will be dependent upon the countries chosen, there are some
      commonalities across the region that might be addressed. Economic and educational
      opportunities, voting rights and political participation, divorce laws, reproductive rights, elimination
      of gender discrimination and attitudes towards sexual harassment are all areas that could be
      discussed.

Section 18: The Americas (1980–2005)

35.   Discuss the post-transition challenges experienced by two countries of Latin America.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the post-transition
      challenges experienced by two countries of Latin America. The two countries and the post-
      transition challenges they faced may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The
      challenges experienced will be dependent upon the countries chosen, but candidates should be
      aware of the multitude of diverse challenges faced during the post-transition period. The
      challenges may predate the post-transition timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may refer to economic challenges such as poverty, foreign debt,
      inflation and economic dependence; political challenges such as weak political institutions, creating
      a constitution and disenfranchisement; social challenges such as inequality, illiteracy and multiple
      ethnicities.


36.   “Economic cooperation in the Americas was beneficial to the region.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that economic cooperation in the Americas was beneficial to the region. Candidates are expected
      to discuss examples of economic cooperation such as NAFTA, CAFTA or other agreements and
      determine whether those agreements have been beneficial to the region. For NAFTA, trade
      between the three countries has quadrupled since 1994, but there have been other inequalities as
      a result of the agreement. Candidates may refer to smaller examples of economic cooperation
      within the region, but those examples should still discuss whether they were beneficial for the
      nations involved. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
