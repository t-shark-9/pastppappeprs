                                                      Section A
Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].
1.    Biometric authorization
      Bright Creativa is an advertising company with approximately 100 employees, who work in
      their head office in Seattle. The company has decided to introduce a biometric authorization
      system using fingerprint scanners (see Figure 1). This enables the employees to gain
      access to the company’s resources, for example to enter the building, log on to the company
      network and even purchase items from the company cafe.
                      Figure 1: An employee using biometric authorization to access
                                       the office at Bright Creativa

      The system is linked to the company database. The employee’s identification number
      (employee ID) is the primary key field in the Employee table, which stores their personal
      details. The company database includes other tables that store data on when they access
      the building, the frequency that they log on to the network and the items they purchase from
      the cafe. Some employees are concerned about the increased level of surveillance within the
      company, but the company has reassured these employees that a privacy policy has been
      developed.

      (a)    (i)     Identify two fields that could be in the Employee table of the database.                           [2]

             (ii)    Identify two characteristics of a relational database.                                             [2]

             (iii)   Identify two methods that could be used to ensure that the data input to the
                      database is accurate.                                                                             [2]

      (b)    As part of the implementation of the biometric authorization system, Bright Creativa has
             written a privacy policy.

             Explain three features that Bright Creativa would need to include in a privacy policy
             linked to the company’s biometric authorization system.                                                    [6]

      (c)    To what extent is the employees’ improved access to company resources outweighed
              by their concerns about the level of surveillance by the company?                                         [8]

2.   Wildfire modelling

     The fire control centre in the Kinakora National Park in New Zealand often has to cope with
     the natural phenomenon of wildfires. Staff have been collecting data about wildfires since 1970.

     The size of each fire is measured and the vegetation types affected are recorded. Data on
     the weather conditions is collected from sensors in the park. The staff at the fire control
     centre use this information to fight the fire.

     A new computer modelling system is being developed using the product development life
     cycle (PDLC). With data collected from previous fires, this new system will improve the
     quality of the information available when fighting future fires.

     The new system will enable staff at Kinakora National Park to send information to tourists in
     the park to warn them when they are in danger from a fire.

                              [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2019]


     (a)   (i)     Identify two stages of the product development life cycle (PDLC).                    [2]

           (ii)    Identify two methods that could be used to train the staff to use the new
                   modelling system.                                                                    [2]

           (iii)   Identify two measurements that could be taken by the weather sensors in the
                   Kinakora National Park.                                                              [2]

     (b)   Two methods for informing tourists about wildfires in Kinakora National Park are:
            y Short Message Service (SMS) texting/text messaging
           y Posting information on the Kinakora National Park website.

           Analyse these two methods.                                                                   [6]

     (c)   Evaluate Kinakora National Park’s decision to use computer modelling to develop
           strategies for dealing with wildfires.                                                       [8]

3.   Online learning

     TailorEd is a free online learning system that personalizes students’ learning by providing
     teachers with data about how students are progressing in their courses. Students create a
     personal profile and work through the assignments at their own pace. Teachers can log in to
     the learning system to see how the students are progressing. However, concerns have been
     expressed about the amount of data that is being collected.

     The school has found that when students access the course platform some content is being
     blocked by the school firewall. The network administrator has been asked to investigate the
     situation. Teachers believe that it would be more appropriate to train the students to use the
     platform responsibly, rather than use technology to block their access to certain websites.

                              [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2019]


     (a)   (i)     Identify two ways that the TailorEd system could provide feedback to the students. [2]

           (ii)    Identify two ways that the data collected about students’ academic progress
                   could be used by TailorEd.[2]

           (iii)   Outline how a firewall functions.                                                    [2]

     (b)   There are two possible methods for ensuring students use the TailorEd online learning
           system responsibly. They are:
           y Restrict access to sites that may be considered inappropriate.
           y Educate the students about acceptable use.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                   [6]

     (c)   To what extent do the benefits of collecting students’ progress data outweigh the
           concerns of the students, teachers and parents?                                              [8]

                                                   Section B

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Neural networks are changing surveillance

     Currently, security cameras record activities in supermarkets and a security guard watches
     the camera footage in real time. If the guard sees something suspicious, action can be taken.
     The company AI Security Innovations is looking at ways to further develop this technology
     using artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the process.

     The field of AI is developing rapidly, and is being transformed by machine learning using
     neural networks. AI Security Innovations wants to link the cameras to an AI system that can
     distinguish between something innocent, such as a child playing with a toy gun, and a crime,
     such as shoplifting (see Figure 2). These AI security cameras will be designed to make the
     decision about whether to intervene or not. This could include “locking down” the premises to
     secure all exits so that the suspect cannot escape, or sending an alert in real time to the police.

                                Figure 2: An example of a security camera




                    [Source: https://pixabay.com/photos/video-camera-surveillance-camera-3121655/]


     These cameras will be part of extremely sophisticated detection systems based on pattern
     recognition. They will be able to detect humans, rapidly separate authorized personnel from
     intruders and match faces from multiple camera sources in order to track people moving from
     location to location. Researchers are even exploring systems that can detect the presence of
     concealed guns based on the way an individual walks.

     (a)   (i)     Identify two characteristics of machine learning.                                      [2]

           (ii)    Outline one reason why neural networks may be used for the processing of data
                   from devices such as surveillance cameras.                                             [2]

           (iii)   Outline how pattern recognition works.                                                 [2]

     (b)   Explain why an agile project management methodology would be used in the
           development of the new AI surveillance camera system.                                          [6]

     (c)   To what extent should pattern recognition in AI systems be trusted to make decisions
           about sending real-time alerts to the police?                                                  [8]

5.   Automated medical image analysis
                                                         –7–                        N19/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

    EBBZS IT, based in Groningen, Holland intends to develop a system using artificial
    intelligence (AI) to assist doctors at Joelstraat Hospital to interpret medical images. The
    legacy system at the hospital is an expert system, but it is unable to keep pace with the
    advances in digital imaging.

    Due to the increased quality of the digital images (see Figure 3), the new AI system will
    be able to learn from them to assist doctors when diagnosing patients’ illnesses. It will also
    be able to cope with the significant increase in the volume of patients and the increased
    complexity of their symptoms and conditions. The managers at Joelstraat Hospital, including
    the information system manager, are unsure which changeover method to use to change
    from the expert system to the new AI-based system.

    (b)    Two changeover methods that could be used for the introduction of the new AI system are:
           y Direct changeover
           y Phased changeover.

           Analyse these two changeover methods.                                                                        [6]

    (c)    Joelstraat Hospital currently bases the diagnoses of patients’ illnesses on:
           y Information provided by the expert system
           y Discussions between the doctors and the patients.

           The new AI system will be a significant improvement over the current expert system.

           To what extent should the diagnosis of patients’ illnesses be based on the information
           provided by the AI system?                                                                                   [8]

6.   Robotic mops

     The FluffyMopa is a robotic mop that is used to clean floors. It does this by spraying water
     onto the surface and then moving across the area to clean and dry it (see Figure 4). The
     FluffyMopa has the following features:
     y Sensors to prevent the FluffyMopa colliding with walls
     y Sensors to detect the dirtiness of the floor, or the nature of the floor surface
     y WiFi receiver for control via a cell/mobile phone
     y Programmable cleaning schedule.

     Systems analysts have gathered customer feedback about the FluffyMopa and have
     recommended that a new version, the FM2, is developed. The FM2 could include features such as:
     y An app* that enables video output to a cell/mobile phone
     y Natural language processing capabilities
     y A camera to enable it to map the home.

     The timeline for the development of the FM2 has been set out in a Gantt chart.

           (ii)   The FluffyMopa is fitted with a proximity sensor that uses ultrasound to avoid
                  collisions with walls and furniture.

                  Identify the steps that the FluffyMopa would take to prevent collisions occurring.         [4]

     (b)   (i)    Distinguish between a Gantt chart and a Pert chart.                                        [2]

           (ii)   Explain why alpha and beta testing would be necessary for the development of
                  the FM2.                                                                                   [4]

     (c)   During the development of the FM2, an app was created that could enable an owner of
           a FM2 to carry out the following tasks remotely:
           y Check the quality of the cleaning using video footage from the FM2.
           y Check the amount of charge remaining in the battery.
           y Use natural language processing so that the owner can give instructions such as “OK
              Fluffy, clean the kitchen floor now”, or “Fluffy, return to the docking station to recharge”.

           Discuss whether the FM2 should be developed to include these additional features.                 [8]
