Read the passage.

Passage adapted from Griffiths, M. (2012) “ ‘Vile liars and truth distorters’: Truth, trust and the asylum
system” in Anthropology Today Vol 28 No 5.

         Asylum seekers and refused refugees are some of the most mistrusted persons in British
         society, and are commonly assumed to be manipulating the immigration system. Most of
         the 300 asylum seekers I spoke to had been accused by the UK Border Agency (UKBA)
         of providing at least some untrue information. Such accusations are crucial, because the
    5    notoriously difficult decisions about granting refugee status are often based on assessments of
         the applicant’s honesty.

         […] Deception, uncertainty and mistrust are as much characteristics of the asylum seekers’
         perspective of the immigration system as the reverse. But whilst an asylum applicant’s
         inconsistency is routinely interpreted as evidence of lying, that of UKBA representatives is
   10    considered indicative of inconsequential errors or even new versions of the “truth”. […]

         I conducted qualitative fieldwork from 2008–2010 with migrants who had claimed refugee
         protection in the UK. Some were detainees at a detention centre. There are considerable
         methodological challenges in conducting fieldwork in closed institutions and with such
         vulnerable individuals. Unable to perform “normal” participant observation, I used approaches
   15    including working for a local politician and non-governmental organisations. […]

         Constructs of truth tellers and liars are subjective, relying on cultural assumptions and
         expectations about how people think, remember and behave. British decision makers tend
         to assume that truthful asylum seekers have a good recall of events and present their stories
         in a consistent and unhesitating manner. In contrast, narrative variations and anomalies are
   20    associated with lying. […]

         However, people I spoke to admitted that occasionally they had been deceptive, generally in
         order to work illegally or to better their immigration chances. In some situations, “lies” may even
         be a rational response. For example, the rigid questions in the immigration paperwork may
         discourage full truthfulness. The UKBA assumes that people know “basic” information such as
   25    one’s date of birth, inherit names in particular ways, and that spellings remain consistent despite
         translation from different languages. Consequently, people may guess or invent these details
         rather than admit not knowing them; they adapt their statements to fit the decision makers’
         requirements. […]

         Not one of my informants trusted in the UKBA but rather gave comments such as: “I
   30    don’t have any faith in the establishment. They deceive me”, or “I don’t trust immigration.
         Immigration are stupid”. […] People also spoke of the UKBA as unfair and confusing. One
         could suddenly be released from detention and then promptly redetained, as happened to
         Sebastian from Cameroon: “They detain you, then they release you, then they detain you
         again. It is a matter of luck”. Sebastian lost his asylum appeal but was released from detention
   35    instead of being deported.

         […] Sometimes informants thought the system was downright irrational. For example, Richard’s
         assertion that he was homosexual (the basis of his asylum claim) was refuted by the authorities.
         Yet he was refused legal aid because of the income of his male British partner. Another
         man was accused of running away although he was actually in prison. Chronic mistrust and
   40    uncertainty may be a technology of power; one that encourages people to be hopeless and
         helpless. […]
                                                              –3–                       N19/3/SOCAN/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

          The irony is that a system that demands consistency from asylum seekers is itself inconsistent.
          As such, asylum seekers are held to a higher standard of truth telling than those making
          decisions about their claims. […] I would go further and suggest that the “truth value” of UKBA
     45   representatives is considered far greater than that of asylum seekers, allowing the former
          to insist on particular versions of the “truth”. This is not only discriminatory but potentially
          dangerous, as it might involve life or death decisions. […]

          I do not suggest that asylum seekers do not “lie”, merely that an examination of the context in
          which they are embedded may help explain their statements. Lying can be a rational response
     50   to negotiating a complex and inconsistent immigration system. In any case, the terms “truth”
          and “lies” are too simplistic. Sometimes people give incorrect information because they do not
          know the “truth”, or because it conveys information that is more “truthful” than the strict “truth”, or
          because they anticipate a bias of mistrust. This might not necessarily be the same as lying.

Answer question 1 and question 2.

1.    Define the term status and explain how you would apply this term in the context of the
      asylum seekers and refused refugees in the passage.                                                               [4]

2.    Explain how the key concept belief and knowledge helps you understand the ethnographic
      data presented in the passage.                                                                                    [6]


Answer either question 3 or question 4.

3.    Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of power or culture is evident in this
      passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you have studied.

OR

4.    Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in this
      passage to the approaches to research used by another anthropologist you have studied.
      Make reference to concepts and ethnographic material in your answer.                                             [10]


Answer question 5.

5.    Why does anthropology matter? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
      ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                                             [10]
