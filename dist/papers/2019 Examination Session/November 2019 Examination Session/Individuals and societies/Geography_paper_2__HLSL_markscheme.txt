                                               Section A
1.   Changing population

     (a)   (i)    State which year had the highest percentage of children trafficked.                 [1]

                  2012

           (ii)   Determine the range in percentage of women trafficked.                              [1]

                  7% (accept 46%-53%)

     (b)   Explain one way in which people trafficking can be reduced.                                [2]

           Award [1] for identification of a valid way to reduce trafficking with a further [1] for
           development/exemplification.

           For example:
           Increased border controls (checking of paperwork) / training of border control staff
           [1] eg in South Africa the documents of people travelling with children are checked
           [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • Protection, assistance and support – increased efforts to protect foreign
              national victims as well as non-immigrants.
           • Coordination of key agencies such as police forces.
           • Investigation and prosecution – of traffickers related to forced labour and
              sexual exploitation.
           • Prevention – to assist other governments to reduce trafficking.
           • Policies by industries and institutions – refusal to work with firms that exploit
              trafficked people.
           • Measures to turn back migrants – in the Mediterranean, the refusal by the
              Italian government, led by Salvini, to allow migrant rescue ships to disembark
              refugees.
           • Education – informing vulnerable groups of their rights eg The Freedom Story
              in Thailand, educating communities in destinations to raise awareness of, and
              report trafficking eg school curriculum in Nebraska.
           • Advertising – raising awareness in vulnerable groups, reduction in demand by
              restricting advertising on social media .
           • Improve the lives of vulnerable groups in source countries.
                                               –6–                 N19/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Suggest how two groups of people have been affected by one pro-natalist or
      anti-natalist policy you have studied.                                                    [3+3]

      Two different groups must be identified.
      Only credit points that are related to the effects of the policy on groups and not
      the operation of the policy.

      In each case, allow [1] for identification of a valid group and up to a further [2] for
      the development of how the group are affected by the policy and/or a link of the
      group to the policy.

      For example: Young girls in China were abandoned in nurseries [1] due to the
      preference for having boys as a result of the One Child Policy [1], which has led to
      them having no legal status and a lack of opportunities for education, healthcare, etc
      [1].

      Other possibilities include:
      • Parents with increased parental leave.
      • Children getting better education due to government provision.
      • Men of marrying age who cannot find a female partner because of gender
         imbalance.
      • Women who can now enter the workplace
      • Employers who find it difficult to recruit workers
      • Minority groups who are stopped from practising their culture
      • Younger generation that have to look after an ageing population
      • Women who have more children and go back to work part time instead of
         their original full-time job
                                                   –7–                 N19/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Global climate – vulnerability and resilience

     (a)   Briefly outline how the natural greenhouse effect operates.                                     [2]

           Longwave/outgoing radiation [1] is absorbed by greenhouse gases [1], heating
           up the atmosphere [1].

     (b)   Explain how the global energy balance can be changed by:

           (i)    solar radiation variations;                                                              [2]

                  Solar flaring / sunspot activity / solar cycles or increase/decrease in solar activity [1]
                  can change the amount of shortwave radiation entering the system [1].

           (ii)   global dimming due to volcanic eruptions.                                                [2]

                  Increased aerosols / dust / particles in the atmosphere [1] preventing the input of
                  shortwave radiation [1].

     (c)   Explain two reasons why sea-level change may result from global warming.                     [2+2]

           In each case, credit a valid reason [1] and award [1] for
           development/exemplification that explains change in sea level.

            For example:
           • Thermal expansion of the oceans [1], as at higher temperatures water occupies a greater
               space/sea level rise [1].
           • Melting of icecaps/glaciers [1] results in a global change in hydrological storage as water
               moves from the cryosphere to the oceans / increases the amount of water in the
               oceans/sea level rise [1].

           Accept evaporation and drop in sea level ONLY when specifically related to inland seas.
                                                   –8–                 N19/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Global resource consumption and security

     (a)   Describe the distribution of countries that produce more than 6kg of electronic waste per
           person.                                                                                     [2]

           Award [1] for a comment related to the general distribution and [1] for specifics of
           location.

            Possibilities include:
           • general distribution – uneven, scattered, sparse, coastal
           • specifics of location may include:
                       o Southern Africa – South Africa plus Botswana.
                       o West central Africa – Gabon plus Equatorial Guinea.
                       o Central north Africa – Libya.

     (b)   Explain two reasons why some countries receive large international flows of
           consumer waste.                                                                         [2+2]

           In each case award [1] for identification of a valid reason with a further [1] for
           development/exemplification.

           For example: Some low-income countries import waste because they receive
           money for it [1], eg Ghana is a low-income country and imports waste because
           valuable metals are found in it [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • Environmental controls/policies.
           • Costs of recycling.
           • Lack of capacity for disposal or recycling in exporting countries.
           • Demand for resources in importing countries – recovered metals.
           • Use of waste as an energy source.
           • Increasing awareness of the value of waste.
           • Trade agreements between countries.
           • Burn for power – eg Norway.
           • More space to store the waste than countries that produce it – eg Singapore.
           • Ocean currents.
           • Fragile states with limited political/economic power.

(c)   Suggest two implications of a warmer climate for the food security of places.        [2+2]

      In each case award [1] for identification of valid implication of a warmer climate
      with further [1] for development/exemplification linked to food security/food
      production.

      For example: Warmer climates lead to extreme weather events, such as
      hurricanes [1], which can destroy crops and reduce food security [1].

      Possibilities include:
       • Long-term/gradual climate change risks, such as desertification, sea level
          rise, changing climatic belts, leading to changes in magnitude of crop
          production, salinization of soils, patterns of floods for irrigation.
       • Access to food decreases because of increase in price – price increases
          because of food shortage in droughts.
       • Slight increase in warming could increase the growing season, whereas a
          very large increase may result in reduced productivity.
       • Temperature increase allows more agricultural output – increase in crop
          yields, changing limits of cultivation
       • Income declines in agricultural sector – unable to access food.
       • Spread of pests – changing climate means insects and fungi also spreading
          towards poles.
       • Ocean acidification – acid oceans impact upon plankton, which is the basis
          of the food chain.
       • Warmer temperatures lead to increased evaporation and possibly less water
          availability for crops.
       • Warmer climates require more irrigation and/or increased efficiency of
          irrigation

                                              Section B
4.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the percentage of daily income that those in extreme
                  poverty spend on food.                                                          [1]

                  Approximately 60% (allow 55% to 65%).

           (ii)   Identify in which decade extreme poverty declined the fastest.                  [1]

                  2000 – 2010 or the 2000s (do not accept 2000)

     (b)   Using evidence from the infographic, explain one way it clearly demonstrates to the
           audience how they can help end poverty.                                                [2]

           Award [1] for valid evidence from the infographic that is linked to poverty and [1]
           for linking how the audience’s help or action can be used to end poverty.

           The audience can be individuals, groups (such as charities) or governments.

           For example:
           The infographic shows that change could be achieved by alleviating extreme
           hunger [1] and individuals could donate money to provide food/improve
           agriculture [1].

           Or

           The infographic shows that change could be achieved by improving sanitation [1]
           and charities could provide clean water so that fewer people are sick and can
           work to provide money/food for their families [1].

           Or

           On the infographic, the prominent extended hand is asking for money [1]
           governments can use this for job creation, which will provide people with better
           wages [1].


     (c)   Evaluate the strength of the links between poverty and gender that are shown in this
           infographic.                                                                           [6]

           Award [1] for each link identified and a further [1] for each relevant
           development/explanation point, up to a maximum of [5]. Maximum [4] if only one
           aspect is addressed Award the final [1] for an overall appraisal that weighs up the
           strengths/limitations of the links shown in the infographic.

           The links between gender and poverty can be seen in a positive fashion (eg the
           role of women in the alleviation of poverty through education) or negative fashion
           (eg the stereotyped view of women/men in the workforce).

           There are aspects of the infographic that link gender and poverty
           • The job creation aspect has a focus on the role of men in the pictogram.
           • The help through government programs examines the transfer to mothers
              who focus on education.
           • Maternal mortality.
                                       – 11 –              N19/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



There are other aspects of the infographic that link poverty to alternative factors:
• Urban/rural
• Conflict
• The distribution of wealth in society
• The role of access to basic services.

For example:

The infographic recognizes that women have a central part in the delivery of
government programmes [1] where cash can be provided to mothers [1] who use
the money to provide education for their children [1]. The education of the most
vulnerable enables them to engage in income generating activities [1] that that takes
them out of poverty [1].

The job creation bar graph uses a symbol that depicts only men [1], implying
strongly that only men make up the work force [1] and, hence, that it is only men
that can contribute to alleviating poverty [1]. Furthermore, women are depicted as
the primary caregivers of children [1], reinforcing gender stereotypes as non-
providers of income [1]. Overall, however, the links are not very strong and it does
not seem to be the central message of the infographic [1].

5.   “The greatest global demographic challenge is the growth of overpopulated megacities.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?                                                [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3–4.

     Reponses will probably address the demographic challenge facing individuals at a local
     scale using family and community as the basis of their comment. Be prepared to credit
     other scales if valid. Answers should make use of well-developed case study/studies.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
     (AO1):
      • The growth of megacities and the threat of reduced access to housing, services
        and infrastructure.
     • The growth of megacities and the threat to health and crime.
      • The growth of megacities and the threat of physical and legal insecurity – eviction
        from unplanned settlements.
      • The growth of megacities and the threat to farmland surrounding cities – individuals
        being pushed off their land.
      • The growth of megacities and the threat to the individual’s links to community –
        segregation and isolation.
      • Knowledge and understanding of other demographic challenges such as ageing,
        migration, rapid population growth.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) that evaluates the relative importance of the demographic threat to
     individuals posed by the growth of megacities.

     Evaluation may take a variety of forms which may include:
     • An evaluation of the various demographic challenges posed by megacities.
     • An evaluation of the demographic challenges posed by megacities as opposed to
        other demographic threats, such as ageing, migration, rapid population growth and
        its impacts on employment/education opportunities, etc.
     • An evaluation of the various demographic challenges posed by megacities in
        different locations and stages of development, eg New York and Dhaka.
     • An evaluation of the changing demographic challenges posed by megacities over
        time.
     • An evaluation of how challenges are perceived in different parts of society.


     For 5–6 marks
     Expect weakly evidenced outlining of the demographic challenges facing individuals
     posed by megacities.

     For 7–8 marks
     Expect a well-structured account which includes:
     • either a well-evidenced synthesis of the demographic challenges facing individuals posed by
     megacities and other components
     • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
     and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks
     Expect both traits.

6. “A sustainable balance between population and resources can be best met by the circular economy.”
To what extent do you agree with this statement?
                                                                                           [10]

     Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on pages 3–4.

     Reponses may tackle the question at a variety of scales. They should have a clear understanding
     of the concept of “sustainable balance between population and resources” and “the circular
     economy”. This understanding can be shown by overt definitions or be woven within the fabric of
     the answer.

     Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
     (AO1):
     • An outline of the relationship between population and resources that may take one
        or more of the views identified in the guide as part of the response structure
        (pessimistic, optimistic and balanced views).
     • An outline of the linear economy of production, consumption and disposal, and a
        criticism of the resultant issues.
     • An outline of the elements of the circular economy, which may include reference to:
        o biological systems and sustainability – restoration, anaerobic digestion,
             composting, etc
        o technical systems and sustainability – maintenance, reuse, refurbish, recycle
        o minimizing system leakage – energy recovery from manufacturing.
     • An outline of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
     • An outline of population control measures – government policies and initiatives,
        social changes to encourage population control.
     • An outline of technical changes that may increase the supply of resources or
        decreased usage of resources eg energy.

     Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical
     evaluation (AO3) that evaluates the relative importance of the circular economy in the
     maintenance of a sustainable balance between population and resources. Evaluation
     may take a variety of forms, which may include:
     • an evaluation of the different approaches embodied within the response and/or as a
        concluding paragraph(s)
     • an evaluation of the level of development as a factor influencing the approach taken
     • an evaluation of how approaches may vary over time
     • an evaluation of how different approaches are perceived in different regions or
        sections of society.

     For 5–6 marks
     Expect weakly evidenced outlining of population/resource balance, the circular economy
     and other approaches.

     For 7–8 marks
     Expect a well-structured account which includes:
     • either a well-evidenced synthesis of population/resource balance, the circular economy and other
     approaches
     • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical concepts
     and/or perspectives.

     For 9–10 marks
     Expect both traits.
