Paper 2 assessment criteria

Criterion A — Focus on the question                                                                [2]

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1        Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2        Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding                                                          [6]

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
  1–2
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
  3–4
             Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

             The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
  5–6
             Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–                N19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer                                               [6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of
research to support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces
of research are appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the
research selected is relevant and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research
that makes the points relevant to the answer is better than several pieces that repeat the
same point over and over.

 Marks      Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
  1–2
            Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  3–4       partly explained.
            Research selected partially develops the argument.

            Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
  5–6       thoroughly explained.
            Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                   –5–                 N19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D — Critical thinking                                                                   [6]

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate
critical thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the
research used to support that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical thinking
are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition,
students could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a
well-developed evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a holistic
judgement of their achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0       Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
  1–2
            Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

            The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
  3–4
            Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

            The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
  5–6
            Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

Criterion E — Clarity and organization                                                            [2]

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner.
A good response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of
thought underpinning the argument.

 Marks       Level descriptor

    0        Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

             The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
    1
             throughout the response.

    2        The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B: knowledge and understanding. All
     remaining criteria should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.
                                                 –7–                 N19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.    Contrast two explanations of one or more disorders.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the differences between
      two explanations of one or more disorders, referring to both explanations throughout. It is not
      necessary for candidates to evaluate the explanations in order to receive high marks.

      The disorder(s) chosen must come from the list in the guide:
      • anxiety disorders
      • depressive disorders
      • obsessive compulsive disorders
      • trauma and stress related disorders
      • eating disorders.

      Explanations contrasted may include, but are not limited to:
      • cognitive explanations
      • biological explanations
      • social cognitive explanations
      • genetic explanations
      • psychoanalytic explanations
      • biopsychosocial explanations.


      Although not limited to the following, factors that might be considered when contrasting two
      explanations include:
      • genetic factors
      • biochemical factors
      • cognitive style
      • cognitive distortion and bias
      • cultural factors
      • environmental factors.


     Relevant studies may include but are not limited to:
      • Henninger et al.’s (1996) study on reducing serotonin levels in healthy individuals
      • Nurnberg and Gershon’s (1982) review of seven twin studies on major depression
      • Boury et al.’s (2001) correlation between amount of negative automatic thoughts and the
         severity of depression
      • Brown and Harris’s (1978) study on social factors of depression

      • Jaeger et al.’s (2002) cross-cultural study on the relationship between body dissatisfaction and
         development of bulimia

     If a candidate only discusses two explanations of one disorder without presenting a contrast, the
     response should be awarded a maximum of up to [3] for Criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining
     criteria should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.
                                                –8–                 N19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Evaluate the effectiveness of one or more treatments.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of the effectiveness of
     the chosen treatment(s) by weighing up its/their strengths and limitations. Although a discussion
     of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high
     marks.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Cooper et al.’s (2003) study on short and long-term effects of psychological treatment on post-
       partum depression
     • Neale et al.’s (2011) meta-analysis of studies of the outcome of using antidepressants versus
       placebos

     • MacDermut et al.’s (2001) meta-analysis of the effectiveness of group therapy for depression
     • Pampallona et al.’s (2004) study on the efficacy of drug treatment alone versus drug treatment
       and psychotherapy in depression
     • Vocks et al.’s (2010) meta-analysis of the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological
       treatments for binge-eating disorder.

     Evaluative points may include, but are not limited to:
     • cultural considerations
     • short-term versus long-term efficacy
     • side-effects of treatment
     • cost of treatment
     • age and gender considerations
     • focus of treatment (symptom versus cause)
     • non-compliance
     • methodological considerations of studies assessing effectiveness of treatment (small samples,
       no control group, no random allocation of patients and possibility of researcher bias).

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be awarded up
     to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded
     marks according to the best fit approach.
                                                 –9–                  N19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Developmental psychology

4.    To what extent does childhood trauma affect development?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the impact of childhood
      trauma on development. Responses may address the influence of trauma on different aspects of
      development, such as physiological, cognitive and/or social development.

      Relevant studies of childhood trauma on development include, but are not limited to:
      • the effects of deprivation in critical periods (the cases of Genie/Anna/Isabelle)
      • PTSD as a consequence of trauma (Feldman and Vengrober, 2011; Luo et al., 2012)
      • Rutter et al.’s (2001) and Rutter’s (1981) studies on the consequences of deprivation
      • Cockett and Tripp’s (1994) study on long-term attachment deprivation effects
      • Koluchova’s case study showing the possibility of reversing the effects of deprivation.

      It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address resilience in order to respond to the
      command term “to what extent”. This could also be addressed by discussing the positive and
      negative effects of trauma. Both approaches are acceptable.

     It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address other relevant factors (such as deprivation,
     neglect or domestic violence) in order to respond to the command term “to what extent”.

     more theories of gender identity development.

     Theories discussed may include, but are not limited to:
     • biosocial theory of gender development (eg Money and Ehrhardt, 1972)
     • social cognitive theory (eg Bandura, 1977)
     • gender schema theory (eg Martin and Halvorson, 1978)
     • social role theory (eg Eagly, 1987)
     • theories of transgender identity (eg Nagoshi and Brzuzy, 2010)

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • examining the underlying assumptions of gender identity development
     • evidence in support of the theories
     • discussion of strengths and limitations of the theory/theories
     • methodological and ethical considerations of the supporting studies.

6.   Evaluate one or more theories of brain development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
     theories of brain development by weighing up the strengths and limitations. Although a
     discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly
     balanced to gain high marks.

     Relevant theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • theory of neuroplasticity
     • maturational theory of brain development.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:

     Evaluation points may include, but are not limited to:
     • the accuracy and clarity of the theory
     • productivity of the theory in generating psychological research
     • methodological, cultural, and gender considerations
     • contrary explanations
     • applications of the theory
     • ethical concerns regarding research
     • relevance of animal models for human brain development.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
     should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

Health psychology

7.    Evaluate the biopsychosocial model of health and well-being.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
      the strengths and limitations of the biopsychosocial model of health and well-being.
      Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be
      evenly balanced to gain high marks.

      The biopsychosocial model has been widely accepted in the field of health psychology. It
      takes into consideration biological factors, psychological factors, sociocultural factors, as
      well as the behaviours of an individual when considering how to reduce health risks,
      prevent illnesses, and promote healthy ways of living. The goal of this model is to find
      ways to help people stay healthy and to accept and commit to treatment methods for
      health problems.

      Relevant studies may include but are not limited to:
      • Hoffman and Driscoll’s (2000) study on health promotion and disease prevention
      • Engel’s (1978) study on the biopsychosocial model and education of health
        professionals
      • Cohen and Koenig’s (2003) study on religion and the biopsychosocial model of health
        and ageing
      • Hatala’s (2012) study on the status of the biopsychosocial model in health
        psychology.

      Evaluation points may include, but are not limited to:
      • alternative/contrary explanations
      • the accuracy and clarity of the model
      • productivity of the model in generating psychological research
      • methodological, cultural, and gender considerations
      • reductionist versus holistic conceptualizations of health
      • applications of the model.

      If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
      should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

8.   Evaluate one or more explanations of one or more health problems.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
     explanations of one or more health problems by weighing up the strengths and
     limitations. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not
     have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Candidates are likely to write about health problems presented in the psychology guide:
     • stress
     • obesity
     • addiction
     • chronic pain
     • sexual health.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Steptoe and Marmot’s (2003) study of biopsychosocial aspects of stress
     • Burman and Margolin’s (1992) study on the association between marital relationships
       and health problems
     • Reed et al.’s (1999) study connecting HIV positive people and pessimism
     • Iwasaki and Smale’s (1998) longitudinal analyses of relationships and chronic health
       problems.

     Evaluation points may include, but are not limited to:
     • the accuracy and clarity of the explanation
     • productivity of the explanation in generating psychological research
     • methodological, cultural, and gender considerations
     • contrary/alternative explanations
     • applications of the explanation
     • supporting and contradicting evidence.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
     should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

9.   Evaluate one or more health promotion programmes.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of one or more
     health programmes by weighing up the strengths and limitations. Although a discussion
     of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to
     gain marks.

     The health promotion programme(s) chosen are likely to relate to one or more of the
     health problems presented in the psychology guide:
     • stress
     • obesity
     • addiction
     • chronic pain
     • sexual health.

     Relevant health promotion programmes may include, but are not limited to:
     • the Victoria (Australia) campaign, “Go for your life” promoting healthy eating and
       exercise in schools (2004)
     • the Florida (US) campaign, “TRUTH” an anti-smoking campaign arranged by and
       aimed at adolescents (1998-1999)
     • the Canadian community-based peer intervention program to prevent pregnant
       mothers from drinking alcohol (Carr, 1994)
     • programmes based on social learning theory (for example, the Sabido method to
       encourage safe sex practices)
     • Project SMART (US), promoting positive health decisions in middle school aged
       children.

     Evaluation points may include, but are not limited to:
     • alternative programmes
     • whether or not the programme is based on a psychological health model/theory
     • cultural and ethical considerations in implementation
     • methodological concerns in measuring programmes’ outcomes
     • empirical evidence related to effectiveness of the programme.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
     should be awarded marks according to the best fit approach.

      research methods used in the study of personal relationships.

      Relevant research methods could include, but are not limited to:
      • interviews (eg focus group, semi-structured)
      • naturalistic observations
      • correlational studies (eg surveys)
      • case study
      • experiments.

      Examples of studies that may be used could include:
      • Flora and Segrin’s (2003) study, using interviews, of the relational history in married
        and dating couples
      • Gupta and Singh’s (1982) study interviewing couples in love relationships and
        arranged marriages
      • Glenn’s (2005) study using interviews and questionnaires to investigate cultural
        grounding of personal relationships
      • Gatter and Hodkinson’s (2016) study of Tinder versus online dating agencies, using
        correlational design with a convenience sample and snowball sampling
      • Levenson and Gottman’s (1983) observational study of marital dissatisfaction.

      Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
      • demand characteristics/social desirability effect in self-reported studies
      • experimental research may lack ecological validity
      • issues and problems related to gender and cross-cultural differences
      • sampling bias
      • validity and reliability
      • ethical considerations.

11.   To what extent does the sociocultural approach contribute to the understanding of group
      dynamics?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
      the sociocultural approach to understanding group dynamics.

      It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address alternative approaches to
      understanding group dynamics as part of the response to the command term “to what
      extent”.

      Sociocultural factors in understanding group dynamics could include, but are not
      limited to:
      • in-group and out-group – competition and cooperation between the groups
      • integrated threat theory
      • stereotyping
      • intergroup dynamics.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Drury and Reicher’s (1999) study of intergroup dynamics
      • Brewer’s (1999) study of in-group loyalty and out-group bias
      • Abrams et al.’s (2003) study of subjective group dynamics and in-group bias
      • Fiske et al.’s (2002) model of (often mixed) stereotype content
      • Haslam and Reicher’s (2006) study on inter- and intra-group dynamics related to
        social identity
      • Tajfel’s (1971) study on ingroup/outgroup.

      Candidates may consider a small number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate
      depth of knowledge, or may consider a larger number of sociocultural factors in order to
      demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

12.   Discuss by-standerism, with reference to one or more studies.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” asks candidates to offer a considered review of
      by-standerism.

      Factors influencing by-standerism could include, but are not limited to:
      • diffusion of responsibility
      • pluralistic ignorance
      • empathy
      • norms and social roles
      • cost-reward
      • dispositional factors.

      Relevant studies could include, but are not limited to:

      • Latane and Darley’s (1968) study to investigate bystander intervention and diffusion
        of responsibility
      • Pillavin et al.’s (1969) field experiment investigating variables in helping behaviour
      • Oliner and Oliner’s (1988) study investigating dispositional factors and personal
        norms in helping holocaust victims
      • Fischer et al.’s (2011) meta-analysis on bystander intervention in dangerous and non-
        dangerous emergencies
      • Soo Hoo’s (2009) study on by-standerism in school bullying
      • Tamburri’s (2014) study on a by-standerism intervention programme targeting
        sexual assault
      • Ploetner et al.’s (2015) study on bystander effect in young children in
        helping situations
      • Manning and Levine’s (2007) Kitty Genovese archival case study.


      Discussion could include but is not limited to:
      • cognitive interpretation of the situation
      • cultural and gender considerations
      • a comparison of different explanations
      • Manning and Collins’s (2007) discussion on the Kitty Genovese murder and the social
         psychology of helping which questioned the basis of bystander research.

      Studies on prosocial behaviour should not be awarded credit for criterion C, use of research to
      support answer. However, if reference to prosocial behaviour is addressed as part of the
      discussion on by-standerism, credit can be awarded for criterion D, critical thinking.
