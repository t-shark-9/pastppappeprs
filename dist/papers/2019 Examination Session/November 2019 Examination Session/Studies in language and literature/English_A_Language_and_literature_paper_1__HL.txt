Text A

            Akshata,

            Becoming a father transformed me in ways that I could never have thought possible. I
            could never go back to being the person I used to be before. Your arrival in my life brought
            unimaginable joy and a larger responsibility. I was no more just a husband, a son, or a
     5      promising employee of a fast-growing company. I was a father, who had to measure up to the
            expectations his daughter would have of him at every stage of her life.

            Your birth raised the benchmark of my life, in every aspect. My interactions at the workplace
            became more thoughtful and measured; the quality of my transactions with the outside world
            more considerate, dignified, and mature. I felt a need to deal with every human being more
     10     sensitively and courteously. After all, some day you would grow up and understand the world
            around you, and I didn’t want you ever to think that I had done anything even remotely wrong.

            I am often asked about the qualities that I have imparted to my children. I tell them that it
            is your mother who shouldered this great responsibility and I am ever so grateful to her for
            bringing you up to be the fine individuals you are. She communicated values more by action
     15     than by talking about them. She taught Rohan and you the importance of simplicity and
            austerity. There was this one instance, in Bangalore1, when you were selected for a school
            drama for which you were required to wear a special dress. It was in the mid-eighties, Infosys2
            had just begun its operations, and we did not have any money to spend on non-basic goods.
            Your mother explained to you that we would not be able to buy the dress and that you would
     20     have to drop out of the performance. Much later, you told me that you had not been able to
            understand or appreciate that incident. We realize it must have been a bit drastic for a child to
            forgo an important event in school, but, we know you learnt something important from that – the
            importance of austerity.

            Life has changed for us since then and there is enough money. But, you know, our lifestyle
     25     continues to be simple. I remember discussing with your mother the issue of sending you kids to
            school by car once we were a little comfortable with money, but your mother insisted that Rohan
            and you go to school with your classmates in the regular autorickshaw. You made great friends
            with the “rickshaw uncle” and had fun with the other kids in the auto. The simplest things in life
            are often the happiest and they are for free.

     30     You would often ask me why there was no television at our home when the rest of your friends
            discussed stuff they watched on TV. Your mother decided early on that there would be no TV in
            our home so that there would be time for things like studying, reading, discussions, and meeting
            friends. She insisted that it was important to create an environment conducive to learning
            at home. Therefore, every night we dedicated the time between 8pm and 10pm to pursuits
     35     that brought the family together in a productive environment. While Rohan and you did your
            schoolwork, your mother and I read books on History, Literature, Physics, Mathematics, and
            Engineering, or did any office work.
                                                  –3–                  N19/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

         It is quite a well-known fact that when a daughter gets married, a father has mixed feelings
         about it. He hates the fact that there is somebody else in his daughter’s life with whom she
    40   shares her affections – a smart, confident, younger man who gets the attention that was earlier
         his alone. I, too, was a little sad and jealous when you told us you had found your life partner.
         But when I met Rishi and found him to be all that you had described him to be – brilliant,
         handsome, and, most importantly, honest – l understood why you let your heart be stolen. It was
         then that I reconciled to sharing your affections with him. A few months ago, you made me a
    45   proud grandparent. If holding you in my arms for the first time gave me indescribable joy, seeing
         Krishnaa, your lovely daughter, for the first time at your home in Santa Monica3, was a different
         experience altogether. I wondered, whether from now on, I would have to behave like a wise,
         grand old man! But, then I realized the bonus to growing older and becoming a grandparent. I
         would have the joy of pampering a child! Besides, you know what they say about grandparents
    50   and grandchildren having a common enemy – the parent! I am convinced Krishnaa and I will
         eventually exchange notes about you and be completely on the same page when it comes to
         criticizing you!

         As you pursue your goals and live a contented life, remember that there is only one planet for us
         to live in and that planet is now becoming endangered. Remember that it is your responsibility to
    55   pass on this planet to Krishnaa in a better condition than you got it from us.

         Take care, my child!
         Lovingly, Appa4

            LONGYEARBYEN, Norway — It’s freezing, snowing
            and so far north that the sun won’t rise again until
            March, but the 2000 residents of the world’s most
            northerly town wish it were much colder.

      5     That’s because the weather here on Norway’s Arctic            A street in Longyearbyen, Norway,
            Circle island of Svalbard is tame in comparison to what       the most northerly town in the world,
            it should be, despite the icy breeze that flows in from       where the sun doesn’t rise in winter.
            the sea.

            Residents and experts fear this tight-knit community — where polar bears outnumber
     10     people — is at risk of disappearing because temperatures are rising at an accelerated pace
            compared to the rest of the world.

            “Every single consecutive month has been above average,” said Kim Holmén, International
            Director of the Norwegian Polar Institute. “We have tremendous increase in the wintertime
            temperatures, almost 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) increase over the past
     15     30 years or so.”

            “Wherever I look there is change, very obvious change. The snow melts earlier in the spring,
            the glaciers are diminishing by a foot, two feet per year in thickness,” Holmén said from the
            Svalbard Science Center in Longyearbyen. “It influences life, it influences the landscape, and it
            influences the people, of course.”

     20     Melting permafrost and higher temperatures have caused havoc here in recent years, triggering
            sometimes deadly avalanches on the steep mountains that flank the town. Houses have been
            destroyed, while roads and some areas have been closed or declared unsafe to live because of
            the risk.

            Within the past two years, hundreds of residents have been affected, some having to evacuate
     25     from their homes.
                                                     –7–                  N19/1/AYENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

                                                           Mark Sabbatini, 49, a local journalist and
                                                           Longyearbyen resident, said he lost his
                                                           apartment because the melting permafrost
                                                           created dangerous cracks in the foundation.
30                                                         Sabbatini, who is originally from Alaska, said he
                                                           is now bankrupt.

                                                           “We lost the whole value of the apartment, with
                                                           no insurance compensation or any
                                                           compensation. We had people who were left
35                                                         broke and had to leave the island, people like me
      Mark Sabbatini, a local journalist, has lost         who’ve been left bankrupt and living off borrowed
      his home and is now bankrupt due to melting          funds and begging — literally begging at times —
      permafrost. In front of him sits the alternative
                                                           for just barely enough money to stay alive,” an
      English language newspaper he publishes.
                                                           emotional Sabbatini said …

40   The region was seeing an “amplification” of global warming, Arctic climate expert David Barber
     of the University of Manitoba told USA TODAY. He warned that projections predict “profound
     effects on the physics, biology and
     geochemistry of the Arctic”. The
     consequences won’t be confined to
45   the Arctic. Melting ice sheets from the
     north have the ability to influence ocean
     currents that also help control the climate
     farther south …

     Longyearbyen, a former mining town                              Map removed for copyright reasons
50   established in 1906 by American
     businessman John Munro Longyearbyen,
     has diversified its economy in recent
     years, profiting from adventurous tourists
     as well as researchers studying the Arctic.

55   The changing conditions could put these
     newer economic developments at risk.
     “At Scott Turner Glacier where we do our ice cave tours, we see from year to year how fast
     the ice is melting,” said Martin Munck, founder of the Green Dog tour company in Svalbard.
     “If worst-case scenario comes, and there is no snow during winter … I doubt anyone would like
60   to live here. No tourism and four dark months, with no light-reflecting white snow and no way to
     go out on tours.” …

     Yet with the annual average temperature of Longyearbyen expected to reach above freezing
     in the next year or two — a phenomenon never seen in the town’s recorded history — there’s
     frustration and anger.

65   “Man has changed the atmosphere,” Holmén lamented. “There are many people I hear now
     who are discussing moving down (to mainland Norway). But (Longyearbyen) is still a place that
     many newcomers find extremely attractive, and many fall in love with it. It is resilient.”

                An important aspect of climate change in the Arctic is the melting of the permafrost
              (a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year). In Svalbard,
          monitoring of permafrost is ongoing in several boreholes, including at Janssonhaugen, 20 km
             from Longyearbyen. Heating and thawing of permafrost may result in greater instability
    5       in hillsides, increasing the probability of landslides and avalanches. Thawing permafrost
             can damage buildings and infrastructure and cultural heritage sites in coastal areas are
                                           exposed to increased erosion.

           Casual factors
         The warming of the permafrost at Janssonhaugen is first and foremost a response to the rise in
  10     the air temperature in recent decades.

         Studies so far show that any changes in the snow cover have had no effect on the permafrost
         at Janssonhaugen. This is because the locality is extremely exposed to wind, and the ground
         around the borehole is blown free of snow for large parts of the winter.

    15      Status and trend
         Permafrost monitoring began in 1998. Analyses show that the temperature in the upper part of
         the permafrost is rising on average 0.8 C per decade and that this rise has been accelerating
         during the past decade.

         Rising temperatures in the permafrost have been recorded right down to a depth of 80 metres
    20   during the time the monitoring has been taking place. The active layer (the uppermost soil layer
         of the permafrost that thaws in the summer) has become 25–30 cm thicker since 1998.

            Consequences

         All buildings in the Svalbard settlements are built on piles driven into the permafrost, and roads,
         bridges, airports and other infrastructure are also constructed on permafrost. When warming
    25   and thawing of the permafrost occurs, the infrastructure may be affected in the longer term. In
         addition, the permafrost is essential for stabilizing steep mountainsides, which may become
         more unstable when warming takes place. This will have consequences for travelling, and
         also potentially for animal life if, for example, areas with arctic fox dens become unstable and
         collapse. Many cultural heritage remains in Svalbard are situated in the shore zone, where they
    30   may be vulnerable to increasing erosion in the future.

         On a circumpolar1 level, the most important consequence of the warming and thawing of the
         permafrost is, nevertheless, that large volumes of greenhouse gases, like CO2 (carbon dioxide)
         and CH4 (methane), may be released if ever deeper layers of the permafrost thaw. These gases
         have been kept out of the atmosphere because the organic carbon has been frozen in the
    35   ground. The release of such greenhouse gases may lead to a further rise in the temperature
         and thawing of the permafrost. This is one of the many feedback mechanisms in the Arctic,
         and attempts are continually being made to improve the estimates of the emissions from
         thawing permafrost.
