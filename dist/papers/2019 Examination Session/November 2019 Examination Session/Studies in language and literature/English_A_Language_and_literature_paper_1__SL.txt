         Journal entry written and illustrated by JD Hooker, and published following his expedition to the
         Himalayas (1847–1851):

         We reached the boundary between Sikkim1 and Tibet early in the afternoon… I determined the
         altitude by barometer 15 745 feet above the sea, and by boiling water, 15 694 feet, the water
         boiling at 184.1 degrees (F); the temperature of the air between 2:40 and 4 pm varied from 41.3
         degrees to 42.5 degrees, the dew-point 39.8 degrees… We were bitterly cold; as the previous
    5    rain had wetted us through, and a keen wind was blowing up the valley. The continued mist
         and fog intercepted all view, except of the flanks of the great mountains on either hand, of the
         rugged snowy ones to the south, and of those bounding the village of Lachen to the north.

         Isolated patches of vegetation appeared on the top of the pass, where I gathered forty kinds
         of plants, most of them being of a tufted habit characteristic of an extreme climate; some (as
   10    species of Caryophylleae) forming hemi-spherical balls on the naked soil; others growing in
         matted tufts level with the ground. The greater portion had no woolly covering; nor did I find
         any of the cottony species of Saussurea, which are so common on the wetter mountains to the
         southward. Some most delicate-flowered plants even defy the biting winds of these exposed
         regions; such are a prickly Meconopsis with slender flower-stalks and four large blue poppy-like
   15    petals, and a Cyananthus with a membranous bell-shaped corolla.

         After two hours I was very stiff and cold, and suffering from headache and giddiness, owing to
         the elevation; and having walked about thirteen miles botanizing, I was glad to ride down. As
         the moon sank, and we descended the narrowing valley, darkness came on, and with a boy
         to lead my sure-footed pony, I was at liberty uninterruptedly to reflect on the events of a day,
   20    on which I had attained the object of so many years’ ambition. Now that all obstacles were
         surmounted, and I was returning laden with materials for extending the knowledge of a science
         which had formed the pursuit of my life, will it be wondered at that I felt proud, not less for my
         own sake, than for that of the many friends, both in India and at home, who were interested in
         my success? We arrived at Tungu at 9 pm, my pony not having stumbled once, though the path
   25    was rugged, and crossed by many rapid streams.

         On the 26th of July the Phipun2, who waited on me every morning with milk and butter, and
         whose civility and attentions were now unremitting, proposed that I should accompany him to
         an encampment of Tibetans, at the foot of Kinchinjhow mountain. We mounted ponies, and
         ascended the Tunguchoo eastwards: it was a rapid river for the first thousand feet, flowing in
   30    a narrow gorge, between sloping, grassy, and rocky hills, on which large herds of yaks were
         feeding, tended by women and children, whose black tents were scattered about.

         On ascending a low hill, we came in sight of the Tibet camp at the distance of a mile.
                                                    –5–                  N19/1/AYENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX

          The people were natives of Gearee
          and Kambajong, in the adjacent
    35    province of Dingcham, which is the
          loftiest, coldest, most windy and arid
          in Eastern Tibet; these families
          repair yearly to Palung, with their
          flocks, herds, and tents, paying
    40    tribute to the Sikkim Rajah for the
          privilege: they arrive in June and
          leave in September. Both men and
          women were indescribably filthy; as
          they never wash, their faces were
    45    perfectly black with smoke and
          exposure, and the women’s with a
          pigment of grease as a protection
          from the wind. The men were
                                                               Lepcha girls3 (the outer figures),
          dressed as usual, in the blanket-
                                                                     and Tibetan women

                                    4
          flint, steel, and amulets ; the women wore similar, but shorter cloaks, with silver and copper
          girdles5, trowsers, and flannel boots. Their head-dresses were very remarkable. A circular band
          of plaited yak’s hair was attached to the back hair, and encircled the head like a saint’s glory6.
