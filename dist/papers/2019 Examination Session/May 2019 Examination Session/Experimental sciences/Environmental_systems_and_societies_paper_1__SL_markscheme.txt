Subject details: Environmental systems and societies SLP1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [35].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through
      marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on
      the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

2.   Indonesia has a declining birth/fertility rate due to increase in female empowerment
     /equality/education/later marriages / Timor-Leste has a high birth/fertility rate due to
     less access to education for women;
     Indonesia has a declining birth/fertility rate due to access to contraception/family
     planning / Timor-Leste has higher birth/fertility rates due to lack of access to
     contraception/family planning;
     Indonesia has lower infant/child mortality/lower death rates/higher life expectancy due
     to improvements/access to medicine/public health / Timor-Leste has high death
     rates/low life expectancy due to limited access to healthcare;
     Indonesia has increasing urbanization/migration from rural areas to cities which results
     in a lower birth rate / Timor-Leste has a high birth rate due to large rural population
     where children are required to work in agriculture/support parents/religious/cultural
     reasons;
     Indonesia has introduced population policies/publicity campaigns to reduce fertility rates;
     age-gender pyramid for Indonesia is in millions whereas for Timor-Leste it is in thousand
     because of differences in population size;                                                    [2 max]

     Do not accept statements without accompanying reason eg “Indonesia has a high life expectancy.”

     Do not accept “Timor-Leste is a less developed country / Indonesia is more developed / stage of
     demographic model” as a reason.

     Do not accept “Indonesia has greater land which allows for a larger population/Timor-Leste has
     smaller land area which accounts for smaller population”.

     Do not accept only “healthier lifestyle / medical status”.

4.   high diversity of habitats/variety of habitats provide a variety of niches that supports
     high fish diversity / high diversity of habitats/seagrass/corals/mangroves leads to high
     diversity of fish;
     variety of habitats provide different food sources that support a wide range of fish
     species;
     variety of habitats provide different breeding/nursery grounds for diversity of fish;
     variety of habitats provide different shelter/protection from predators which increases
     fish diversity;                                                                               [2 max]

     Accept converse statements eg fewer niches outside coral triangle result in less fish
     diversity.

     increase in micronekton/predatory fish (prey) of the tuna (due to reduction in
     predation);
     reduction in phytoplankton/mesoplankton/microplankton due to increase in micronekton
     population;
     loss of tuna reduces competition for food (micronekton/predatory fish) resulting in overall
     increase in sharks/marlin population;
     to compensate for loss of tuna, shark/marlin eat more micronekton/predatory fish
     resulting in overall decline of micronekton/predatory fish population;
     to compensate for loss of tuna, shark/marlin eat more micronekton/predatory fish
     resulting in an increase in phytoplankton/mesozooplankton/microzooplankton
     population;                                                                                         [2 max]

     Accept other reasonable responses.

     Do not credit the same marking point twice eg reduction in sharks and reduction in
     marlin.

     Do not accept only “collapse of marine food web” or “reduction in biodiversity”.

15.   Merits – [4 max]:
      MPAs are supported by legislation and associated enforcement powers;
      MPA could provide nursery/breeding ground for species /sanctuary for some species/
      protect species from human activities / MPAs stop reduction in fish stocks through
      fishing activities / by restricting tourism to certain areas MPAs can reduce damage
      caused by tourism to reef ecosystems;
      …this could allow recovery of threatened species/range of species/ biodiversity;
      MPA would lead to increase in population of species that could provide food;
      MPA would lead to increase in population of species that could provide an income
      avenue for local people/sustainable livelihood;
      species from MPA could move/migrate and allow for increase in biodiversity in
      surrounding areas;
      increase in regional biodiversity could lead to increase in ecotourism that provides an
      alternative income for local communities;
      improvements in marine ecosystems/increase in mangroves/seagrasses can enhance
      carbon dioxide sequestered from the atmosphere / improvements in
      mangroves/seagrasses can increase carbon storage, contributing to the mitigation of
      climate change;
      within MPAs the increase in mangroves/seagrasses/coral filters the water and removes
      pollutants in the marine environment;
      MPAs help to meet our moral/ethical obligation to conserve/protect species / MPAs
      help to meet our duty to conserve our environment for future generations;
      improvements in coastal ecosystems can help to protect coastal communities from
      extreme storm events/coastal flooding;
      increase in mangroves/seagrasses population can improve water quality for other
      primary producers/coral reefs;
      MPA creates jobs for local people and an alternative income;
      MPAs allow some restricted fishing to meet the needs of local people;

      Limitations – [4 max]:
      establishing MPAs could cause areas surrounding them to be over-exploited / many
      areas still adversely affected by fishing/human activities;
      difficult to stop people fishing/using areas that have been traditionally used;
      difficult to stop illegal fishing by non-local vessels;
      without effective policing/enforcement is unlikely to work;
      some species population may have fallen below recovery levels;
      MPAs can in the short-term lead to loss of income/resources / maybe difficult to find
      alternative income/food source in the short term for local people;
      in the short-term local communities may require support to consider other ways to earn
      money/obtain food / loss/reduction in shark fin trade results in loss of income for
      fishers;
      local community needs to be educated on value of MPAs;
      local community needs to be educated/trained on how to sustainably fish stocks
      outside the MPAs;
      as MPAs are managed by government (not local community) there may be a lot of
      bureaucracy involved and management of MPA may be inefficient / may take time to
      reach a consensus before action can be implemented / corruption may be an issue
      leading to inefficient management of MPA;
      difficult to manage/balance interests of so many stakeholders (ie six countries, local
      governments, NGOs etc.);
      predicted loss of coral by 2050 is a result of global warming, which will not be stopped
      by protecting local areas;
      with increase in tourism there may be increased pollution caused by waste/plastics
      resulting in decrease in biodiversity;
      with population growth in the area and associated increase in food demand the restriction in fishing
      within MPAs will cause human hardship;

Award [5 max] for merits and limitations.

Conclusion/opinion [1 max]
For example: over the long term MPAs can be effective at improving biodiversity/state of
the ecosystem and sustainable resources for local people although in the short term they
can pose many difficulties/hardships for local communities (without appropriate support);

A valid conclusion should be credited if it is explicit, balanced (addresses both sides of
the argument) and supported by evidence. Do not credit the conclusion if only one side
of the argument has been considered within the overall response.
                                                                                             [6 max]
