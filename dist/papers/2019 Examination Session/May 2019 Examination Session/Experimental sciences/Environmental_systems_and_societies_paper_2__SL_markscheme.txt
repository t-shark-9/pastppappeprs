Markscheme
Mark allocation

Candidates are required to answer:
• ALL questions in Section A [25] and TWO questions in Section B [40].
• The maximum total = [65].


1.   Environmental systems and societies uses marking points and markbands to determine the
     achievement of candidates

     When using marking points (All of this paper except Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional
      ii.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semi-colon (;)
      iii.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
             where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
             mark awarded
     iv.     The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated
             otherwise.

     When using markbands (Only for Section B, part (c) questions):
       i.    Read the response and determine which band the response fits into
      ii.    Then re-read the response to determine where the response fits within the band
      iii.   Annotate the response to indicate your reasoning behind the awarding of the mark
             Do not use ticks at this point
     iv.     Decide on a mark for the response
      v.     At the end of the response place the required number of ticks to enable RM Assessor to
             input the correct number of marks for the response.


2.   An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
     be accepted.

3.   Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

4.   Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

5.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
     equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
     Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
     OWTTE (or words to that effect).
                                                   –4–                  M19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
     more important than grammatical accuracy.

7.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
     marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
     the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
     should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
     script.

8.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
     to in the markscheme.

                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Outline two reasons why the species within pioneer communities in Figure 1 are
           more likely to be r-strategists than K-strategists.                                       [2 max]
           r-strategists produce greater numbers/many offspring/fast population growth;
           r-strategists distribute themselves more widely/colonize more quickly;
           r-strategists mature quickly/reproduce earlier/establish themselves faster;
           r-strategists better adapted to harsh/low-nutrient conditions/less specialised niches;
           Do not accept just ANY valid characteristic of r-strategists (eg short life-span) ...only those
           directly relevant to a pioneer community as above.

     (b)   Outline two reasons why the climax community in Figure 1 is more stable than
           the intermediate community.                                                               [2 max]
           greater number of species/habitat/ecological niches/genetic diversity in climax
           community;
           gross productivity/stored biomass is higher in climax community;
           more complex/diverse energy pathways/food webs;
           more established nutrient cycling;
           more favourable abiotic conditions/soil properties;
           more established negative feedback mechanisms;

     (c)   Distinguish between zonation and succession.                                                      [1]
           succession is the process of changes in community/ecosystem over time,
           whereas zonation is the process of changes over an environmental
           gradient/space;

     (d)   Outline two ways in which the food web is likely to change as a result of
           succession.                                                                                       [2]
           increasing numbers of trophic levels / longer food chains;
           will be composed of new/different species;
           more branching / greater complexity / more species at each trophic level;
           greater gross productivity/energy transferred at each trophic level;
           more biomass stored at each trophic level;
           increased prominence of decomposer community;

     (e)   Outline two ways in which the soil quality in the pioneer stages of the succession
           model shown in Figure 1 will differ from that in the climax ecosystem.                    [2 max]
           In pioneer communities...
               there will be lower organic content/leaf litter (due to combustion from the fire);
               there may be a higher concentration of available minerals (released from
               ashes);
               there may be fewer soil organisms (following deaths from fire);
               it will be more prone to erosion/evaporation losses (through lack of vegetation
               cover/roots by fire);
               less established nutrient recycling / reduced decomposer community;

           Accept converse of these statements for climax community.
           Note: The model shows SECONDARY succession (after fire), so not all generic features of a
           pioneer community in PRIMARY succession would be valid. eg in primary succession soil
           nutrients may be higher in climax community, but in secondary succession reverse is more
           likely (although processes of nutrient cycling/decomposition may still be more advanced
           established in climax community as in primary succession).
                                                  –6–                 M19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   With reference to Figure 2, state the country that has the highest level of
           recycling/composting.                                                                       [1]

           Austria;

     (b)   Outline two possible reasons for greater use of landfills in the United States
           compared with the European countries shown in Figure 2.                                     [2]

           more available land in USA / less available land in Europe;
           high cost/privatisation of recycling in USA / more subsidies for recycling in Europe;
           limited domestic technology for recycling established / dependence on export of
           recyclables in USA;
           in Europe, a stronger environmental education/commitment/more ecocentric EVS;
           EU laws/regulations may penalise landfill use/promote alternative disposal;

     (c)   Outline two strategies for reducing the environmental impact of landfill sites.         [2 max]

           reducing waste/employing alternative disposal methods;
           collection of methane / management to prevent spontaneous ignition;
           extraction/treatment of leachates;
           use of impermeable liner/clay/materials / locating above impermeable rock;
           locating away from surface and groundwater sources/residential areas/vulnerable
           or valuable ecosystems;
           visual screening to reduce impact of eyesore/aesthetic degradation OWTTE;
           effective cover/containment system to prevent plastics/lightweight materials
           blowing into environment;
           limiting transport distance/emissions from collecting vehicles;
           densely compacting solid waste before dumping;

     (d)   Identify two problems associated with one of the waste disposal choices of
           Germany.                                                                                [2 max]

           ALTERNATIVE 1: Waste to energy (through incineration/biogas):
           emissions from combustion/anaerobic digestion can be toxic/release GHGs/add
           to air pollution;
           still require disposal of solid waste/ash;
           requires technology/infrastructure which could be expensive/not cost-effective;
           public opposition due to noise/smell/aesthetics/perceived health threats/impact
           on property prices;
           may reduce public incentive to reduce waste;

           ALTERNATIVE 2: Recycling/composting:
           recycling can be energy intensive;
           recycling requires technology which could be expensive;
           emissions from recycling process/unaerated composting could release GHGs etc;
           limited range of products can be effectively recycled/composted (inappropriate
           materials/poor sorting/condition);
           requires political will/civil management/public collaboration;
           recycling can degrade materials;
           composting may lead to bacterial/fungal infections / leachates/run-off
           contaminating soil/water;
           may be public opposition to smell of composting;
           may reduce public incentive to reduce waste;

           Award [1 max] if chosen method is not identified. If both choices (i.e. “waste to energy” AND
           “recycling/composting” are addressed only credit the higher scoring one).
                                                   –7–                 M19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   (a)   With reference to Figure 3, calculate the difference between the highest
           concentration and lowest concentration of tropospheric ozone.                              [1]

           (peak of 175 – lowest point of 73 =) 102 (ppb);

           Accept 72 – 75 as lowest point, ie 100–103 (ppb).

           Units and working are NOT required for the 1 mark.

     (b)   State two factors necessary for the chemical formation of ozone in the
           troposphere.                                                                               [2]

           sunlight/UV light;
           NOx/oxygen (atoms/ free radicals/molecules)/hydrocarbons/VOCs;

           Note: Only credit necessary reactants for ozone formation as shown above. Do
           not credit sources of these active pollutants (eg fossil fuel use, organic solvents,
           pesticides etc).

     (c)   Outline why a high concentration of ozone in the troposphere is a direct problem
           for humans, while in the stratosphere it is a benefit to humans.                           [2]

           in the troposphere it causes respiratory illnesses / eye/nose/throat irritations /
           heart failure;

           in the stratosphere it prevents entry of UV that is harmful to humans/can cause
           mutations/skin cancer/tissue damage/cataracts/crop damage; [1 max]

           Note: Do not credit responses that simply suggest global warming/climate
           change as an impact of tropospheric ozone without referring to some direct
           impact of those phenomena on humans.

           Note: Accept “ozone in stratosphere protects humans from UV” WTTE … (use of
           “protects humans” implies UV is harmful to humans).

     d)    Suggest possible reasons for the overall trends of tropospheric ozone levels in
           Figure 3.                                                                              [4 max]

           in first few years, increase due to:
           • increase in population / car ownership/use / fossil fuel use;
           • increased industrialisation / oil industry;
           • lack of political awareness/funding to address the issue;

           from around 1991 onwards, a decline may be due to:
           • improvements in technology, eg energy efficiency/hybrid cars/catalytic
               converters/scrubbers;
           • stricter monitoring/regulations on air quality control for industries / car-
               owners;
           • switch to cleaner-burning/alternative energy sources;
           • green initiatives/education campaigns/lobbying of politicians to promote, eg
               public transport/green roofs/car-pooling/registration plate limits etc;

           Award [3 max] if only discussing decline or only discussing increase or failing to
           specifically identify either decline or increase.
                                                  –8–                 M19/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                               Section B

Part (c) questions in Section B are all to be assessed using the markbands on page 19
with the guidance given below for each question.

4.   (a)   With reference to processes occurring within the atmospheric system:

           (i)    Identify two transformations of matter.                                          [2 max]

                  condensation; evaporation; freezing; melting;

                  O3 → O2 + O; Cl + O3 → ClO + O2; SO3 + H2O → H2SO4; NOx + H2O → HNO3;

                  Accept other reasonable responses.

                  Accept any valid chemical changes identified by formulae or words (eg
                  decomposition of ozone).

           (ii)   Identify two transfers of energy.                                                [2 max]

                  radiation of sunlight/solar energy/heat/light toward earth;
                  radiation of heat/IR away from earth;
                  reflection of light/heat toward space from earth/clouds;
                  scattering of light/heat from particulate matter;
                  movement of (sensible) heat pole-wards by wind currents/tricellular
                  winds/Hadley Cell/hurricanes/tropical cyclones;
                  movement of latent heat in water vapour by winds;

     (b)   Explain how regional differences in the hydrological cycle influence the formation
           of different biomes.                                                                    [7 max]

           in certain tropical regions there is high transpiration/precipitation;
           …allowing for high productivity/tropical rainforests;
           in other tropical regions evaporation exceeds precipitation;
           …so, water is limiting for growth leading to vegetation of desert biomes;
           in polar regions large proportion of water is frozen/stored as ice/glaciers;
           …so unavailable to plants resulting in limited vegetation of tundra;
           in mid-latitudes there is moderate transpiration/precipitation;
           …allowing for moderate plant growth of temperate grasslands/forests;
           in regions where water inputs exceed outputs/surface topography promotes rise
           of water table;
           ...water accumulates above the soil to form an aquatic system/wetland;
           mountainous regions cause variations in precipitation on leeward/windward sides;
           ...may cause forest growth on windward side/drier desert-like communities on
           leeward;

           Credit can be given for responses that identify features of hydrological cycle characteristic of
           a given region OR how such a characteristic gives rise to a given biome.

           Award [3 max] if the characteristics are not directly linked to given biomes.

(c)   Climate can both influence, and be influenced by, terrestrial food production
      systems.

      To what extent can terrestrial food production strategies contribute to a
      sustainable equilibrium in this relationship?                                           [9]

      The following guide for using the markbands suggests certain features that may
      be offered in responses. The five headings coincide with the criteria given in each
      of the markbands (although “ESS terminology” has been conflated with
      “Understanding concepts”). This guide simply provides some possible inclusions
      and should not be seen as requisite or comprehensive. It outlines the kind of
      elements to look for when deciding on the appropriate markband and the specific
      mark within that band.

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of equilibria, sustainability,
         natural capital/income, climatic factors (temp/precipitation/seasonality),
         greenhouse gases, climate change, biome shifts, water conservation,
         irrigation, desertification, vegetarian vs meat-rich diets, mitigation,
         adaptation, commercial vs artisanal, intensive vs extensive, food miles,
         selective breeding/genetic engineering, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking influences of climate on food production
         eg water scarcity, shifting biomes, mean temperatures / precipitation,
         desertification, wind / rain / erosion, etc and influences of food production on
         climate eg methane production, deforestation, use of fossil fuels, global
         transport, etc and ways in which production strategies may adapt to, or
         mitigate climate change;
      • examples of food production strategies that adapt to climate change eg
         water conservation, drip irrigation, terracing, drought/temperature resistant
         crops, aquaponics, greenhouses, etc and strategies that mitigate climate
         change eg switching from meat-rich diets, localising food production,
         employing artisanal/low-energy farming strategies, etc;
      • balanced analysis of the extent to which production strategies from a range
         of contexts may contribute to, or mitigate against, an equilibrium between
         food production and the climate etc;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “although there are many production strategies that
         mitigate or adapt to climate change, the relationship has already shifted so
         far away from a sustainable equilibrium, and with growing populations, it
         seems unlikely that their contribution will be sufficient to avoid a tipping point
         in the future”;

5.   (a)   Identify four impacts on an ecosystem that may result from the introduction of an
           invasive species of herbivore.                                                      [4 max]

           reduction in plant species (through feeding);
           …(causing) reduction in overall productivity;
           reduction/loss of native herbivore species (through competition);
           …(causing) reduction/loss of carnivore species/higher trophic levels;
           …(causing) reduction in species diversity;
           shift of equilibrium/toward tipping point;
           introduction of new diseases/pathogens/parasites (carried by invasive species);
           in some circumstances may benefit ecosystem by eg increasing food for higher
           trophic levels/increasing diversity;

     (b)   Explain how both positive and negative feedback mechanisms may play a role in
           producing a typical S population growth curve for a species.                        [7 max]

           positive feedback will occur at start of S curve where numbers are small;

           Award [3 max] for following marking points as statements OR shown in a

           as populations increase/reproduce they increase the number of reproducing
           individuals;
           …which will further increase the growth rate;
           ie positive feedback …a change promoting further change in same direction;




           negative feedback occurs as graph approaches maximum/carrying
           capacity/plateau;

           diagram. See example below:
           Limiting / density dependent factors / predation/food/water availability/disease;
           …will become increasingly limiting, reducing growth rate;
           …stabilizing population at around carrying capacity

(c)   Technocentrists may support the belief that technological development has
      always been able to overcome limits to human population growth.
      To what extent do the patterns of growth and development in human populations,
      as demonstrated in the Demographic Transition Model, support this claim?                 [9 max]

   demographic transition; however, there is a finite limit to the Earth’s carrying
   capacity, and many populations are now stabilising due to self-imposed
   economic and political constraints”;

6.   (a)   Identify four strategies for limiting the impact of burning fossil fuels without
           reducing their use.                                                                   [4 max]

           vaccination/anti-malarial programmes;

           Credit any responses identifying other valid strategies that don’t involve reducing
           fossil fuel use. Do not credit “increasing efficiency of vehicles/machinery using
           fossil fuels” ...these will only limit impact by reducing consumption, which is
           explicitly excluded by question.


     (b)   Suggest a range of practical procedures that could be carried out to measure the
           abiotic and biotic impacts of an oil spill in an aquatic ecosystem.                   [7 max]

           identify a transect / sampling scheme to compare conditions over time/distance;
           carry out multiple samples at each site to ensure reliability;
           measure oil content/concentration using chemical tests;
           measure light penetration using Secchi disc;
           (use appropriate probes/meters/logging devices) to measure temperature/oxygen
           concentration/pH/salinity;
           measure change in O2 concentration of samples kept in dark as a measure of
           BOD;
           sample invertebrate populations using kick samples/Eckman grab/water samples;
           Lincoln Index/mark-release-recapture may be used to quantify fish/larger
           invertebrates;
           identify species present and abundance of each;
           use this to calculate a biotic index evaluating sensitivity/tolerance of species
           present;
           use similar data to calculate diversity with a diversity index;
           count total numbers of birds/fish etc clearly impacted/killed by oil;

           Credit any other procedures of equivalent detail and validity to those given above.
           No additional credit for evaluating procedures/discussing impacts.
           If response simply indicates measuring a named abiotic factor they can be
           credited for MP5 but can only gain one mark in total for any number of such
           factors. To gain further credit for other abiotic factors they should indicate some
           detail of the procedure beyond simple use of a probe/meter/logging device.


           Award [4 max] for responses that address only biotic or only abiotic impacts.

(c)   Even though there is growing global support for ecocentric values, the global
      consumption of fossil fuels continues to rise each year.

      With reference to energy choices in named countries, discuss possible reasons
      for this situation occurring.                                                            [9 max]

      Answers may include:
      • understanding concepts and terminology of environmental value systems,

         examples given eg “while the widespread impacts of fossil fuel use and
         globalised media have promoted a growing support for ecocentric values in
         the wider populace, it is the governments that ultimately make decisions and
         their priorities often lie with the economics and politics that favour the
         continued use of these fuels”;

7.   (a)   Identify four factors that make the estimation of carrying capacity more
           problematic for human populations than for most other species.                         [4 max]

           Humans:
           • use such a wide range of resources that could be limiting;
           • have a greater ingenuity to increase efficiency of resource use/substitute
              resources for one another;
           • local populations can import resources from elsewhere;
           • show great variation in lifestyles/demand from place to place;
           • depend on technological development demanding different resources over
              time;
           • …making it difficult to identify any one limiting factor/resource for carrying
              capacity;
           • produce a diverse range of wastes damaging their habitat/reduce carrying
              capacity;

     (b)   Explain why the ecological footprint of two populations consuming the same
           quantity of food and energy may be different.                                          [7 max]

           a population may consume the same as another but produce more (for export or
           just wasted) which will increase its EF/require more land;
           food production systems may be different in terms of efficiency / sustainability;
           …some may be more intensive / use advanced technology / fertilisers;
           …or rely less heavily on meat products / more heavily on vegetarian products;
           …or be located in a climate more favourable to food production;
           …and therefore, produce same quantity of food with less land/lower EF;
           energy production may rely more heavily on renewable sources/solar
           energy/hydroelectricity/wind power;
           …or be located in regions with higher rates of primary
           productivity/photosynthesis;
           …employ more effective mitigation strategies;
           …so, absorb carbon wastes with less local land/lower EF;
           activities other than food and energy provision may influence ecological footprint
           (eg urbanization/water pollution);
           one population may lack treatment facilities / regulations for wastewater leading
           to greater EF;
           one population may live in multistory buildings / smaller houses using less land
           so lower EF;

           Note: Question addresses difference in footprints between populations not per capita
           footprints.

           Award [4 max] for responses that address only food or only energy production OR for
           responses that make no reference to actual difference in EF or land required.

         pyramids, edge effects, design principles of conservation areas, ecotourism,
         local/national/international organisations, community support, etc;
      • breadth in addressing and linking effective conservation with eg size,
         shape, location of protected areas, central “no-go” zone/wilderness, use of
         corridors, roles of international organisations, local ownership, etc. Also with
         sustainable harvesting eg managing sustainable yield, reducing collateral
         impacts of infrastructure, raising funds and incentive for conservation,
         subsistence of local populations, commercial value of harvestable goods,
         etc;
      • examples of supporting biodiversity through large area/food base, circular
         shape to reduce edge effects, links to other areas via corridors to increase
         genetic mixing, maintaining certain/central area with no human activity,
         promoting local support by providing employment/resources/income, gaining
         global support through international bodies UNEP, Greenpeace etc;
      • balanced analysis of ways in which, and the extent to which, in a variety of
         geographical/social contexts, a protected area can or cannot support
         harvesting while at same time conserving biodiversity;
      • a conclusion that is consistent with, and supported by, analysis and
         examples given eg “one of the greatest contributions to successful
         conservation is a local “ownership” of the project and therefore, provided the
         harvesting is limited to certain areas and sustainably managed, there could
         be considerable potential for such a design to provide very successful
         conservation”;
