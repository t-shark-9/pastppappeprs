Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [30 marks] and ONE question in Section B [20 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

                  the extent to which the performer has control over the timing of the
                  movement ✔                                                                                                           2 max

                  external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve ✔

                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine ✔


1.     Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.     The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.     Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.     A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
       The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.     An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.     An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.     An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

6.     c        the Bernoulli principle explains how relative air pressure «from backspin» around a Accept annotated diagram to outline the
                golf ball means that it experiences a lift force and travels further through the air ✔ principles.

                as a golf ball travels with backspin, it experiences higher air pressure on the
                bottom of the ball and lower air pressure on the top of the ball ✔

                the ball/object is attracted to the area of lower air pressure, which is above the ball
                and therefore experiences lift ✔

                the faster the ball travels / spins, the greater the differences in relative air pressure

                against drag force ✔

                a ball struck off «laterally» centre will spin in the air, therefore creating lower

OR

a performer begins to detect and correct errors in their performance/ begins to
develop consistent movements ✔

Autonomous phase:

reaction time is shorter as motor programmes are well learnt «stored in long-term
memory» ✔

skills appear automatic/instinctive as attention is focused elsewhere ‹for example
on tactics, the move or pass or shot and on using fakes› ✔

a performer judges their own performance and is able to make changes without
external feedback from a coach ✔

a performer will perform with a greater level of skill/consistency/accuracy/fluency /
as they get closer to the autonomous phase ✔
