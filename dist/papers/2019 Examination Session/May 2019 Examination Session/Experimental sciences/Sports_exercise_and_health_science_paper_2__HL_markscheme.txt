Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [50 marks] and TWO question in Section B [40 marks].
Maximum total = [50 marks].

                  movement ✔                                                                                                           2 max

                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine ✔


1.     Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.     The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.     Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a tick (✔) at the end of the marking point.

4.     A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
       The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.     An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.     An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.     An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.

8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the
      “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.
