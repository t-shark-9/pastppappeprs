               The Pros and Cons of Joining a Fraternity or Sorority1




         One of the biggest decisions we incoming college students face is whether to join a fraternity
         or sorority. This can determine who you are friends with for the next four years and who you
         date. It can also affect where you live and even your career after graduation.

         Before making the leap, you’d better consider both the benefits and disadvantages to
    5    membership.

         First, the good news:

         • Ease of making friends: Students who have diﬃculty sustaining friendships may find that
           joining a fraternity or a sorority is a great way to bond with others and feel a crucial sense
           of belonging.

   10    • Leadership training: Every member is expected to do their part to keep the organization
           running. Members get responsibility for projects that teach discipline. This can boost your
           self-esteem and those accomplishments also look pretty good on a résumé.

         • Academic achievement: College students in a fraternity or sorority tend to do better
           academically than the average college student. That’s not surprising when you consider
   15      that older “brothers” and “sisters” are responsible for tracking the academic progress of
           younger members.

         • Networking: The benefits go beyond the college years. Fraternities or sororities are
           powerful networking organizations, giving recent graduates access to mentors in their
           chosen field.

  20     Now, potential pitfalls:

         • Time commitment: Joining one of these organizations is a serious commitment. Those
           students who have diﬃculty with time management, those with special learning needs that
           require additional time for studies, or students who want to pursue other interests should be
           cautious about the time needed to invest in a fraternity or sorority.

    25       Cost: College costs are already high. Call yourself lucky if you manage to find out exactly
           •	
             how much more you’ll pay to join a fraternity or sorority.

             Alcohol abuse: These organizations are intended to be social, which means frequent
           •	
             parties, tailgates2 and other opportunities for drinking to spin out-of-control.

           Ultimately, the decision is a deeply personal one. But it’s one that will be easier to make if
    30     you’ve done your homework first! Post your comments below.

                                                                 Adapted from www.yellowbrickprogram.com

                        Youngsters guide the elderly in the digital world
        Every week, 12-year-old students at a Saint-Léonard
         elementary school get to switch roles and become
         teachers. The Grade 6 students pair up with senior
         citizens from local retirement homes to teach them about
         technology and social media at a resource centre as
         part of a program called Inter-âge.

        The program has allowed seniors to decipher the
         workings of social networks, even if some were a little
         skeptical at first about their young teachers.                    [Marie-France Bélanger, Radio-Canada]


        “When I came here, I wanted to learn how to use social media,” said Francine Goudreault,
          who recently retired. “At the beginning, I found it a little odd having Grade 6 students as our
          teachers,” she said. “But now I love it.”

        The lessons are personalized and based on need and skill levels. Inter-âge is not a
         mandatory part of the curriculum, but creator and teacher Pierre Poulin said the majority of
         the class participates.

        Student Luciana Diaz slowly taught Gilles Lebrun how to use a tablet, while a classmate
         showed an 81-year-old woman how to contact her loved ones in Italy through FaceTime.

        Nicole Pedneault, who helps run the program, says seniors aren’t as shy when they are
         taught by children. The courses have helped them become more proficient in the digital
         world. Inter-âge makes it possible for young students to share their knowledge and passion
         for technology while also learning from their older pupils.

        The project has also helped build close relationships, like the one between Fernande Forest
         and student Daniel Ardiles. “We talk about his family, my family, our personal lives,”
         said Forest. Inter-âge gives students a chance to ﬂourish outside of regular classwork.

                                     Do you talk to yourself?




                                     Image removed for copyight reasons




        Being caught talking to yourself is embarrassing. Clearly, this is because the entire purpose
         of talking aloud is to communicate with others. But given that so many of us do so, could it be
         normal after all or perhaps even healthy?

        Psychologist Paloma Mari-Beffa said that talking out loud – known as inner talk – helps
         you to control yourself. It also may be a sign of high cognitive functioning. We often engage
         in deep conversations at 3 a.m. with nobody else but our own thoughts. This inner talk is
         very healthy, having a special role in keeping our minds fit. It helps us organise our ideas,
         consolidate memory and modulate emotions.

        The Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget observed that toddlers begin to control their actions
         as soon as they start developing language. When approaching a hot surface, the toddler
         will typically say “hot” out loud and move away. This kind of behaviour can continue
         into adulthood.

        Non-human primates obviously don’t talk to themselves but have been found to control their
         actions by using different parts of the brain depending on whether the task is visual, such as
         matching bananas, or auditory, such as matching voices. However, when humans are tested
         in a similar manner, they seem to activate the same areas of the brain regardless of the type
         of task.

        [ – X – ] a fascinating study, researchers found that our brains can operate much like those
         of monkeys if we just stop talking to ourselves. In the experiment, the researchers asked
         participants to repeat meaningless sounds out loud [ – 24 – ] performing visual and sound
         tasks. [ – 25 – ] we cannot say two things at the same time, muttering these sounds made
         participants unable to tell themselves what to do in each task. [ – 26 – ] these circumstances,
         humans behave as monkeys do, activating separate visual [ – 27 – ] sound areas of the brain
         for each task.

        This study elegantly showed that talking to ourselves is probably not the only way to control
         our behaviour, but it is the one that we prefer and use by default. However, this does not
         mean that we can always control what we say. Indeed, there are many situations in which
         that kind of talk can become problematic.

                                    Collaborative Consumption
         This month we were lucky enough to chat to the Australian author Rachel Botsman, who
         coined the phrase “collaborative consumption”. If you are new to the concept, collaborative
         consumption is a powerful cultural and economic force that is changing what we consume
         and how we consume it. It’s a move away from hyper-consumption to a notion of sharing
    5    resources. As a result, we’re buying less stuff and making meaningful connections that are
         strengthening our communities in the process.




         Q: [ – X – ]

         A: It’s about how technology is taking us back to old market behaviours – swapping, trading,
             lending, sharing – but re-inventing them. It’s also about unlocking the idling capacity of all
   10        the assets we have and using technology to redistribute this to places where it’s needed.
            Think about the average car that sits parked for many hours a day. No wonder we’re
             embracing car-share schemes which give us access to a car, without the cost and hassle
             of owning one.

         Q: [ – 31 – ]

   15    A: C
             ollaborative consumption usually involves some sort of human connection and the
            number one benefit turns out to be social. The other plus is that it gives you a little
            extra money.

         Q: [ – 32 – ]

         A: We’re a little behind, but I see that as an opportunity for entrepreneurs. A lot of clever
  20         bods1 are taking successful ideas from overseas and bringing them here.

         Q: [ – 33 – ]

         A: W
             henever we’re at the start of a new invention, there are jobs that go away but also many
            that will be created. It’s like when they invented the printing press; they wondered what
            would happen to all the scribes2.
                                                    –7–               M19/2/ABENG/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/T


    25     Q: [ – 34 – ]

           A: O
               ne of the fastest-growing spaces is virtual currencies. We’re also seeing a lot of ventures
              in the financial sector. Products will change too but there will be more of a reinvention of
              the way we think about them.

    30    TEDx Sydney.
