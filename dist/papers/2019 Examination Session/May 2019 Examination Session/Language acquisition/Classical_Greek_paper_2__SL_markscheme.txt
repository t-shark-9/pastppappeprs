            εἰκέλη) [1].

Extract 3      Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 7.73.2–7.73.3

3.   (a)    They agreed with him [1]; thought it ought to be done [1]; but thought the people would not
            obey [1]; because it was a festival day [1].

     (b)    Because they were drinking after their victory [1]; and would prefer this least of all [1].

     (c)    He feared that the Athenians would take the advantage (οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι προφθάσωσιν) [1] and
            bypass the most difficult terrain (διελθόντες τὰ χαλεπώτατα τῶν χωρίων) [1], in the night

     (e)    They told him not to lead off the army by night (μὴ ἀπάγειν τῆς νυκτὸς τὸ στράτευμα) [1]
            because the Syracusans were guarding the roads (ὡς Συρακοσίων τὰς ὁδοὺς φυλασσόντων)
            [1]; instead he should make preparations after rest (καθ’ ἡσυχίαν) [1] and prepare to retreat
            during the day (τῆς ἡμέρας παρασκευασάμενον ἀποχωρεῖν) [1].

                                                                                                    Total: [15]

            brave/good men (ἀναγκαῖόν ὂν ὑμῖν ἀνδράσιν ἀγαθοῖς γίγνεσθαι), since there is no safe
            place to be a coward (μὴ ὅποι ἂν μαλακισθέντες σωθείητε); if they escape they will see what
            they desire (ἢν διαφύγητε, ὧν ἐπιθυμεῖτέ που ἐπιδεῖν); Athenians will restore the power of the
            state again (οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι τὴν δύναμιν τῆς πόλεως ἐπανορθώσοντες); even if it has fallen
            (καίπερ πεπτωκυῖαν).

     (d)    Men make the city (ἄνδρες πόλις) [1] and not the walls or ships (οὐ τείχη οὐδὲ νῆες) [1].

     (e)    Nicias made a speech (τοιάδε παρακελευόμενος) [1], went along the ranks (ἐπῄει τὸ
            στράτευμα) [1], brought soldiers back to their place (ξυνάγων καὶ καθιστάς) [1];
            Demosthenes did the same (ὁ Δημοσθένης οὐδὲν ἧσσον) [1].

                                                                                                    Total: [15]

            [1]. Accept other relevant points supported by quotation.

     (b)    Odysseus is worried because Ajax may be mad (μεμηνότ’ ἄνδρα) [1]; Athena will cast

     (d)    He has spoken well (καλῶς ἔλεξας) [1]; he has attacked the Greeks (ἔβαψας ἔγχος εὖ) [1]; he
            has attacked the Atreidae (πρὸς Ἀτρείδαισιν ᾔχμασας χέρα) [1]; he has killed men (τεθνᾶσιν

            Achilles (οὐκ ἠξίωσαν τῶν Ἀχιλλείων ὅπλων) [1]; but gave them to Odysseus (Ὀδυσσεῖ
            παρέδοσαν) [1]. Accept other relevant explanations supported by quotation.
