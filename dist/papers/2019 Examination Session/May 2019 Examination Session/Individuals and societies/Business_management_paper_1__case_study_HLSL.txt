                                    Radeki de Dovnic Manufacturing

     Radeki de Dovnic Manufacturing (RDM) is 100 % owned by the Radeki de Dovnic family. RDM
     is located in Lobjanec, a small city in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1873, the business
     originally made coal-burning stoves for residences. Several decades later, RDM’s
     management, foreseeing the final stages of the product life cycle of coal-burning stoves,
5    also began to manufacture kerosene/oil-burning stoves. In 1949, following the Communist
     takeover of what was then Czechoslovakia, over 95 % of private sector commercial enterprises,
     including RDM, were nationalized. Following the Velvet Revolution of 1989, when Communism
     in Czechoslovakia collapsed, many companies moved from being state owned to privately
     owned. Adriana Radeki de Dovnic took over as chief executive officer (CEO) of RDM in 1990.
10   As demand for kerosene stoves had been declining for many years, in 1993, Adriana decided
     to add healthcare devices using ergonomic designs* to RDM’s product portfolio. The reasoning
     behind the move to manufacturing medical devices was that, with the baby boomer generation
     soon to reach retirement age, the demand for goods and services in the healthcare industry
     would be growing.

15   Though not immune to broader economic trends in Europe, since the Velvet Revolution
     the Czech economy has fared well. Part of this success stems from the relatively smooth
     transition, compared to some other former Soviet bloc countries, to a stable market economy
     and democracy. The fact that the capital city, Prague, is one of the most beautiful cities of
     Europe and a magnet for tourists has also aided the economy. Traditionally, educated Czechs
20   speak German in addition to Czech, a situation that has facilitated positive trade relations with
     Germany, Europe’s largest economy. A small, compact country, the Czech Republic now has an
     IT infrastructure that ranks among the best in the world.

     For many years, the head of the Radeki de Dovnic family was Dr Kristián Radeki de Dovnic
     (1920–2001), a former Austro-Hungarian baron who fled Czechoslovakia in 1944 with only the
25   money in his pockets as the Soviet army advanced westward. Escaping to the United States,
     he earned a PhD in history and became a professor at an American university. Adriana chose
     to retire as CEO in 1995, giving Kristián the opportunity to return to his home country and take
     on the role of CEO of the family business. He eagerly accepted, even though his professional
     training and experience had hardly prepared him for the task. Fortunately, his son Jan (b.1963),
30   who was born and grew up in the United States, had studied engineering at university and had
     long wanted to live in Czechoslovakia, which had been divided into the Czech Republic and the
     Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993. When Kristián died in 2001, Jan took over as CEO.

     In 2002, RDM produced its last kerosene stove and now primarily manufactures healthcare
     devices. Jan began to introduce a highly automated manufacturing process in 2006 that was
35   operational by 2009. For most orders, customers enter desired specifications for healthcare
     devices into a template on RDM’s web page. An engineer then reviews the specifications. Often,
     engineers will contact the customer if questions arise or the engineers have identified a way of
     improving the design. RDM has developed several minor adaptations to customers’ products
     that have made them cheaper to produce or more stable. Once the design is approved, they
40   transmit the information to accounting and marketing, which together determine the price (for
     the customer) of the order. A person in marketing then contacts the customer to confirm that
     they want to proceed with the order.

     Once the customer confirms, the design specifications are transmitted electronically to the
     shop floor, where robots configure the tooling. A different set of robots collects and loads raw
45   material into the manufacturing process, which is done entirely by automated machinery. Only
     occasionally do humans have to intervene. Highly trained engineers monitor the processes.
                                                  –3–                M19/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     Two areas that have yet to be automated are the costing of products, which is mostly done the
     old-fashioned way by human accountants, and delivery. Jan wonders whether it will be long
     before self-driving lorries (trucks) will replace current human-driven ones for delivery.

50   Today, RDM is highly automated, though this situation was not always the case. For decades,
     RDM employed a large unionized labour force, mass produced stoves and sold its product to
     wholesalers. Because of globalization and fierce competition from Asian manufacturers, which
     had lower cost structures, in the early 2000s Jan determined that European manufacturers
     would have to lower costs. Automation, while requiring significant capital expenditures,
55   lowers costs in the long run. In addition, digitized communication between robots allowed
     RDM to be responsive to customers’ requirements. As RDM improved its automation
     processes and integrated cloud computing, mobile devices, big data, artificial intelligence
     and three-dimensional (3D) printing, its ability to customize products improved dramatically
     regardless of the size of the order.

60   This integration of technologies also meant that RDM was not restricted
     to manufacturing healthcare devices. Rather, it could easily retool to
     manufacture other products when opportunities arose. For example,
     one large medical customer asked RDM to manufacture 500 customized
     aluminium water bottles. Customization included special design features
65   of the bottles themselves as well as their colour and finish. The customer
     wanted to give one bottle to each of its employees. With its highly
     automated processes, RDM could quickly and inexpensively produce
     the bottles, with different coloured bottles for the different divisions of the
     company and with each employee’s name on his or her own bottle. The
70   success of the order for water bottles was such that several executives [Source: adapted from
     at RDM encouraged Jan to make the manufacture of customized                      https://pixabay.com/
     aluminium water bottles a distinct division of the company.                     en/water-bottle-bottle-
                                                                                        aluminum-660024/]

     RDM’s relationship with stakeholders was profoundly changed by the move to automation.
     In the 1970s, RDM employed roughly 500 workers, making it the largest single employer in
75   Lobjanec. In 2019, the business employs 117 people, only a small number of whom are involved
     in manufacturing. Further, most of those involved in manufacturing are not skilled manual
     labourers but highly trained engineers and computer experts who manage the automated
     process. Their attitudes, aspirations and motivations differ significantly from the workers who
     survived the Second World War and had worked under the Communist regime. With this
80   reduction in, and transformation of, RDM’s labour force, the company no longer has the level of
     local influence that it formerly had. The vocational school no longer liaises with RDM regarding
     the required skills of workers. Now, with the free movement of labour throughout the European
     Union, RDM recruits engineers from universities across Europe.

     The move to automation also led to changes in the organization of RDM. Traditionally, the
85   business had been hierarchical. Design changes in RDM’s products, whether coal-burning
     or kerosene stoves, were infrequent and directed by the CEO. Now, design changes for the
     healthcare products come with almost every order. Teams composed of individuals from
     all business functions manage orders. Jan, who replaced his father as CEO in 2001, has a
     democratic leadership style, which is different to his father’s paternalistic style.




                                                                                                    Turn over
                                                     –4–                M19/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

   90   Over many years, Jan painstakingly introduced many changes in practices at RDM to create an
        environment of innovation. When Kristián headed the company, the environment at RDM was
        orderly, even dull (and somewhat depressing, as a steady stream of workers was being made
        redundant due to falling kerosene stove sales). Jan, however, is constantly seeking innovation
        in both RDM’s products and its processes. He fosters an atmosphere conducive to creativity,
   95   with heavy emphasis on teamwork, diversity, humour and fun. Most employees love this
        environment, even though it sometimes seems chaotic. The atmosphere has produced positive
        results. However, some employees have complained that there is insufficient guidance and the
        business sometimes lacks focus.

        RDM has always displayed a strong sense of corporate social responsibility (CSR), even before
  100   the concept of CSR became fashionable. The Radeki de Dovnic family, an old aristocratic family
        of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, had long held a caring and paternalistic attitude towards the
        people who worked for them, including the workers in their factory. Today, RDM maintains a full
        programme of CSR, including sourcing components from businesses who also have good CSR
        practices, paying fair wages and having a strong emphasis on care for the environment.

  105   A component of the cost to customers is delivery costs, which are based primarily upon
        weight and distance to delivery location. Given the cost of delivery, RDM can generally offer
        competitive pricing in a 700-kilometre radius of Lobjanec (see Appendix 2). This 700-kilometre
        range means RDM can be price competitive in crucially important Germany but less so in such
        potentially lucrative markets as Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and northern
  110   Italy.

        To continue to grow and access these potentially lucrative markets, the chief financial officer
        (CFO) has proposed that RDM build an additional production facility elsewhere in Europe, which
        would extend RDM’s market area. Given that the entire order/manufacture/delivery process
        could still be performed in Lobjanec, this new facility would require limited staff and most of the
  115   work will be done by robots. RDM can finance the expensive expansion through either share
        capital or loan capital. Relocation could be very expensive and may be beyond what RDM could
        raise as a private limited company so they may have to go public to raise sufficient finance.

        Before considering the CFO’s proposal, Jan knows that one other issue must be addressed:
        RDM’s marketing strategy. In fact, RDM has no marketing strategy but rather a series of
  120   practices that have evolved since the Radeki de Dovnic family regained control of RDM in 1990.
        Arguably, RDM has no corporate strategy either, apart from a vision in Jan’s mind. He effectively
        communicates that vision to employees, but no written corporate strategic plan exists to achieve
        that vision. RDM has an outdated name, a weak brand identity, no relevant vision or mission
        statement and no written operations management strategy or human resources plan. The
  125   company makes good products at competitive prices and is responsive to customers’ needs. As
        a result, the company enjoys healthy profits for now.
