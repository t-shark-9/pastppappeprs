                                          Canadian drywall tariffs will continue

          Recently imposed Canadian tariffs on drywall imports have pushed up the cost of building a
           new home by thousands of Canadian dollars (CA$) in the last four months. Drywall is a
           pre-made wall section that is used in the construction industry for building houses. Doubt
           as to whether the tariffs will remain is causing uncertainty for building firms, drywall
           manufacturers and homeowners.

          For now, higher prices will continue following a ruling by the Canadian International Trade
           Tribunal (CITT) this week. The tribunal found that United States (US) firms had been
           dumping drywall products into Western Canada over the past few years, harming the
           Canadian drywall industry.

          The ruling will end preliminary tariffs of up to 276 % imposed by Canada on imports of
           drywall from the US. However, they will be replaced by permanent, variable tariffs that
           would be imposed on imported drywall products whose prices fall below the minimum prices
           determined by the CITT.

          “The preliminary tariff was very damaging to homebuilding,” said a building industry
            spokesperson. “Not just homebuilding, but hospitals, commercial buildings, indeed any
            new construction,” he said. “It’s a cost that someone had to pay for. It lowered the profits of
            house builders.” It has been estimated that the immediate sharp increase in variable costs,
            following the imposition of the preliminary tariff, resulted in an extra CA$3000 to CA$5000 on
            the cost of building some homes.

          The preliminary tariffs were imposed after a dumping complaint by CertainTeed Gypsum
           Canada (CTGC), the last drywall manufacturer in Western Canada. CTGC has three major
           production sites and two gypsum quarries. Gypsum is a main component of drywall.

          A CTGC spokesperson had said previously that its plants and quarries could be closed, at
           the cost of 200 jobs, if the dumping of US drywall products continued. However, since the
           preliminary tariffs were imposed, the firm has announced that it has hired 30 new employees.

          In a separate report, the CITT found that the preliminary tariffs had been “substantially
           reducing competition” in Western Canada, to the detriment of Canada’s homebuilders.
           In response, supporters of the tariff have suggested that revenue from the tariffs may be
           used to help areas that lost large numbers of homes and other structures in devastating
           forest fires.

                          Current account deficit poses a challenge to Pakistan’s economy

           The president of Pakistan has expressed his concern at the significant increase in Pakistan’s
            current account deficit. The current account deficit grew to US$12.12 billion in the fiscal year
            of 2016/17 compared to US$4.86 billion in 2015/16. The deficit was caused by rising imports
            and falling exports. The increasing current account deficit may result in Pakistan having to
            request a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan to fund the deficit. To avoid this, the
            president is proposing that the importing of luxury, non-essential items needs to be reduced.

           The governor of Pakistan’s central bank agreed with the president’s concern. He said that
            the “rapidly growing current account deficit is the biggest challenge facing the country’s
            economy”. He agreed that the problem is made worse because many non-essential imports
            are being purchased, which requires borrowing from abroad. However, he stressed that
            while rising non-essential imports are a problem, “32 % of imports are capital goods” and
            are necessary for the continued growth of small to medium enterprises (SMEs), agriculture,
            housing and construction.

           Central bank advisors have also recommended depreciating the rupee (Pakistan’s currency)
            to reduce the trade deficit. The value of the rupee is currently controlled through a managed
            exchange rate system. It has been suggested that the rupee is overvalued by as much
            as 20 %. However, the central bank governor claims that a “depreciation has a number of
            negative effects”.

           In 2016, Pakistan’s economic growth reached 5.3 %, its highest point for 10 years. The
            government has estimated that it will be 6 % in 2017. According to the central bank governor,
            loans to SMEs are currently only 7 to 8 % of all loans to businesses in Pakistan. He believes
            that if loans to SMEs were increased to 15 to 17 % of all loans to businesses in Pakistan,
            there would be even higher economic growth.

           Along with the current account deficit, fiscal policy decisions have also led to a significant
            budget deficit. The budget deficit increased in 2016, resulting in greater public debt. The
            central bank recommends the government’s debt to be limited to 60 % of gross domestic
            product (GDP).

                                           China’s increasing presence in Bolivia

           Between 2000 and 2014, annual bilateral trade between China and Bolivia increased
            dramatically from US$75.3 million to US$2.25 billion. China has become the fifth-largest
            market for Bolivian exports, which mostly consist of raw materials such as minerals,
            hydrocarbons, wood and soybeans.

          At the same time, China has become Bolivia’s main source of imports. China now supplies
           half of Bolivia’s clothing, cars, motorcycles, cell phones, computers and other electronics.
           Bolivia’s expenditure on Chinese imports significantly exceeds the revenue that is received
           from its exports to China. Since 2014, Bolivia has experienced significant current account
           deficits with China.

           In recent years, the Bolivian government has taken loans from Chinese banks to support the
            purchase of Chinese imports of goods and services, along with Chinese-built roads, bridges,
            railways, hydroelectric power plants and mining facilities. In 2015, the Bolivian government
            owed more than US$600 million to Chinese banks.

          The socialist Bolivian government wants to implement an ambitious Five-Year National
           Development Plan from 2016 to 2020. Faced with sharply declining export revenues and
           commodity prices, it will rely increasingly on foreign capital to fund its projects.

          All projects financed by Chinese loans must be awarded to Chinese companies, which come
           with their own materials, equipment and technology, and often their own labour. The new
           loans will have a combination of commercial interest rates, between 2.5 % and 4 %, and
           concessional interest rates, up to 1 %. The Bolivian government is expecting to be able to
           repay the loans through continued growth of the economy.

           China’s foreign direct investment (FDI) is mostly being aimed at energy and infrastructure
            development. Chinese firms are currently involved in major road-building projects,
            hydroelectric power station projects, expanding airports and developing a steel-producing
            plant. These projects have created problems for local communities in terms of water
            contamination and the overuse of Bolivia’s scarce water supply.

          This FDI strategy generates profits for Chinese firms in the short term, as they build and
           improve the infrastructure. Since Bolivia is a resource-rich country, Chinese firms will be
           looking to invest in profitable mining projects in the future, once the infrastructure is in place.

                             The World Bank reports on economic growth in Kenya

          The World Bank’s recent overview of Kenya has given a positive assessment of Kenya’s
           growth prospects, based on domestic and international factors. The East African nation of
           Kenya has a population of approximately 46.1 million, which increases by an estimated one
           million per year. The World Bank projected 5.9 % economic growth in 2016, rising to 6 % in
           2017. This positive outlook is based on continued low oil prices, growth in the agricultural
           sector, expansionary monetary policy and ongoing infrastructure investments.

          The World Bank has identified other key contributing factors to Kenya’s short-term growth.
           These include an expanding services sector, higher levels of construction, currency stability,
           low inflation, a growing middle-class and rising incomes, a surge in remittances (money sent
           by a foreign worker to their home country) and increased public investment in energy and
           transportation.

          Tourism, information and communications and public administration are among the sectors
           that have registered the highest growth. Inflation has been at an average of 6.3 %, which is
           within the Kenyan central bank’s target range.

          The World Bank also predicted that, of 82 countries investigated, Kenya would have the
           highest long-term growth and that its real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050 should
           be seven times larger than it is today. Fast population growth, a modest improvement in
           the business environment, urbanization and fast-growing neighbouring countries are all
           contributing factors to the positive prediction.

          While the growing Kenyan economy is creating more jobs now than in the past, these are
           mainly in the informal services sector and are low productivity jobs. 9 million young people
           will join the labour market in the next 10 years. Given the scarcity of formal sector jobs,
           they will continue to find jobs in the informal sector. These jobs are usually in very small
           businesses, often run from homes.

          The World Bank suggests that there is a need to increase the productivity of jobs in the
           informal sector. It says that this could be achieved by increasing work-related skills through
           training schemes, increasing communication and learning between formal and informal firms,
           and helping small-scale firms to become suppliers for firms in the formal sector. To create
           more and higher-skilled jobs, it is also essential to reduce the cost of doing business.

          According to the World Bank, Kenya has made significant structural and economic reforms
           that have contributed to sustained economic growth in the past decade. However, economic
           growth does not always mean economic development. The main development challenges
           facing Kenya include poverty, inequality, climate change, low commodity prices and the
           vulnerability of the economy to internal and external shocks.
