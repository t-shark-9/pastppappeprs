                                              Section A
1.   (a)   With reference to RDM, describe how changes in operations management altered
           its relationship with two other business functions.                                      [4]

           The shift in operations management from a traditional industrial manufacturing
           process to an automated process altered its relationship with the following business
           functions:
           • Human resources: RDM changed its recruitment from semi-skilled young people
              who had just completed their education at a local technical secondary school to
              university graduates with degrees in engineering or computer science. This shift
              almost certainly necessitated a shift in approaches to leadership and motivation.
           • Marketing: In the process of becoming an automated manufacturing process,
              RDM fundamentally changed its marketing mix. Though the decision to shift from
              kerosene stoves was market driven (declining demand), the automated process
              allows RDM to customize products and make, as in the case of the aluminum
              water bottles, wholly new products.
           • Accounting and Finance: Prior to automation, RDM made uniform products on a
              large scale. Pricing decisions would have been relatively rare – setting a fixed
              price for a product. Now that the business is making customized products, pricing
              decisions have to be made with virtually every order, which involves people from
              the accounting department. Whereas RDM had capital expenditures prior to full
              automation, it also had substantial revenue expenditures in the form of payroll.
              With automation, the mix of capital versus revenue expenditures shifted in the
              direction of more capital expenditures. This shift requires significantly different
              approaches to finance.

           Candidates should name the functions, but they can be implicit.

           N.B. R&D is not a business function.

           Accept any other relevant changes.

           Mark as a 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for an appropriate business function identified and an additional [1] for
           some description of changes in context. Award a maximum of [2] for each function
           described.

     (b)   Explain how RDM’s transformation of its manufacturing process from traditional
           mass production to highly automated production affected the interests of internal
           stakeholders.                                                                            [6]

           • Employees – jobs will change, different skills, highly trained engineers and
             computer scientists.
           • Managers – tasks will change, management role different.
           • Shareholders – may have sacrificed dividends for investments but reaped
             benefits later.

           Accept any other relevant internal stakeholders.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

           Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer, or for only considering one
           internal stakeholder.

Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

Award a maximum of [6].
                                                  –9–                 M19/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   With reference to RDM, outline one advantage and one disadvantage of Jan’s
           leadership style (lines 88–89).                                                          [4]
           Jan’s leadership style is democratic with hints of laissez faire. A simple assertion
           that it is democratic or is laissez faire is insufficient for context.
           Advantages:
           • Employees feel that they have more freedom and more say in the operation of
             the business.
           • Greater sense of autonomy and purpose, which fosters creativity, innovation and
             teamwork.
           • It extends responsibility for decision making to a broader group, increasing the
             likelihood of employees exercising authority more responsibly. When engineers
             contact customers to help them with their design, for example, they know that
             they are representing the business to the outside world and must bear that
             responsibility.
           • Most employees like this leadership style.
           Disadvantages:
           • It is less orderly than the style of Jan’s father. According to the case, despite an
              atmosphere of “teamwork, diversity, humour and fun,” sometimes RDM now
              seems a bit chaotic.
           • Decision making can take longer. When Kristián ran the business, he made all
              the decisions, and he could make them as quickly (or take as long) as he wished.
           • Some employees want the type of clearer guidance often found in autocratic
              management.

           Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.
           Mark as a 2 + 2.
           Award [1] for an appropriate advantage and [1] for a disadvantage identified and an
           additional [1] for application to the points identified. Maximum award: [4].

           N.B. The case study states the leadership style is democratic, but there are hints of
           laissez faire. Mention of either “democratic” or “laissez faire” on their own is not
           enough for an application mark, there needs to be use of the actual context to gain
           application marks.

(b)   Explain how innovation at RDM may have influenced their marketing practices.                 [6]
      Innovation: introduce something or some process that is new.
      Prior to changing to healthcare products, RDM’s marketing practices would have been
      based on:

      For SL and HL:
      • Product: a consumer-durable product, a product at the end of its life cycle, a standardized
        product
      • Place: presumably distributed/sold through retailers? A country/market emerging from
        communist rule
      • Promotion: little evidence of a formal marketing mix
      • Price: fierce competition, low prices.

      Additional for HL:
      • Process: unclear
      • Physical evidence: relevant?
      • People: a “conservative” family business

      There was little evidence of a marketing strategy so these items are not coordinated.
      Post innovation marketing practices based on:

      For SL and HL:
      • Place: completely different market – the healthcare sector, likely to be sold directly, not
        through retail
      • Product: range of products, customized products, different production processes
      • Promotion: now CSR business, implications for marketing. Possibility of marketing using
        IT
      • Price: lower costs, lower prices. Now likely to be individually negotiated. Needs prices for
        a wider range

      Additional for HL:
      • People: personal contact with customer
      • Process: different way of meeting customer needs, direct contact with customers
      • Physical evidence: relevant?

      Other issues include change in target market, change in nature of market (growing), creating
      USP. After innovation, these practices will need to be included in a coordinated marketing mix.
      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.
      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only considering
      one market practice.
      Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.
      Award a maximum of [6].

3.   (a)   Describe two changes in the external environment that have affected RDM.                    [4]

           A number of changes in the external environment are referred to in the stimulus.

           Social:
           • Changes in how people heat their homes (declining use of kerosene stoves).
           • The aging population of Europe increasing demand for medical care.

           Technological:
           • The Czech Republic’s improvement in the country’s IT infrastructure
           • Changing use of technology by customers eg smartphones (could also be
             classed as a social factor).

           Economic:
           • The change in economic system from communist/command to market.
           • The integration of the Czech Republic into the broader economy of central and
             Western Europe.

           Ecological:
           • Increased use of renewable sources of energy.

           Political:
           • The change in Czechoslovakia from communist to democratic.

           Legal:
           • Compliance with EU regulations.

           Ethical:

(b)   Explain how the methods used to motivate employees could have changed when RDM
      transformed from traditional mass production to highly automated production.           [6]

      Historically:
      • RDM was a traditional manufacturing firm.
      • It was hierarchical, its leadership was autocratic.
      • The business had many workers, who were expected to perform relatively simple
         functions repeatedly.
      • In such an environment, motivation typically relies upon paying workers more for
         high productivity. Workers can in turn accelerate their work if they want to earn
         more.
      • Its motivational approach was, in all likelihood, Taylorist.

      After change (to highly automated):
      • RDM had to hire different types of “workers”: highly trained engineers and
         computer scientists.
      • Employees of this type are typically less motivated by money and more by what
         Daniel Pink refers to as autonomy, mastery and purpose.
      • Employees want the freedom to do jobs without being micro-managed; they want
         to develop themselves professionally so that they become experts in their field,
         and they want to know that they are doing more than just making money, that
         they are connected to some larger purpose.

      In the case of RDM:
      • The changes in leadership style have given employees more autonomy to work
          with customers to help them.
      • The core competency of RDM is cutting edge automation and innovation
          suggests that the engineers and computer scientists themselves must be masters
          in their area of expertise to stay on the leading edge.
      • Candidates are not bound to mentioning either Taylor, Pink or other theorists.
          They may refer to other appropriate theorists. In their selection, however, they
          must convey some understanding that most employees now will not be satisfied
          with traditional money-based incentives alone.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

      Award a maximum of [3] for a theoretical answer or for limiting answer to only the
      traditional situation or to only the highly automated situation.

      Award a maximum of [5] if the answer is mainly descriptive but in context.

      Award a maximum of [6].

                                                   Section B
4.   (a)   Describe one industrial/employee relations method used by employers.                      [2]

           Types of industrial/employee method used by employers in industrial/employee
           relations include:
           • Collective bargaining/ negotiations: management negotiate with worker
              representatives /trades unions.
           • Threats of redundancies: Such threats can break the will of workers and their
              representatives, as they consider the effects of permanent loss of position.
           • Changes of contract: flexible working, productivity agreements.
           • Closure and lockouts: The owners shut down the place of employment so that the
              workers cannot enter to perform their job. This method is rather extreme.
           • Recognising /encouraging unions can help both employees and employers
           • Arbitration

           Do not allow methods used by employees e.g. creating a union as this is done by
           employees not employers, strike action. Nor methods used by employers that do not
           involve direct engagement of workers such as delegation, leadership style, team
           building etc.

           Award [1] for identification of a method and [1] for a description. Candidates do not
           have to word exactly as above. No application is required but might be helpful.
           Maximum award: [2].

     (b)   (i)     Using the information above, calculate the current capacity utilization rate at
                   RDM’s factory.                                                                    [1]

                                                  20000
                   Capacity utilization rate is          100  95% (95.2% but allow rounding)
                                                  21000

                   Award [1] for correct answer.

           (ii)    Calculate the increase in capacity at RDM if the company builds a new
                   production facility (show all your working).                                      [3]

                                                                   20000
                   Capacity utilization is now 50% so 50%                    100
                                                                new capacity
                                                  100
                   so new capacity  20000            40000 units .
                                                   50

                   Increase in capacity is 19 000 units

                   Award [3] for correct answer with working. ‘Units’ not necessary. Working wrong only
                   award [2].
                   Award [2] for correct answer without workings or wrong working or good attempt (e.g
                   40,000, or 40,000 units)
                   Award [1] for an attempt with workings. 95.2% - 50% =45.2% (allowing for rounding)
                   can be awarded [1]

                  Do not reward formula only.

(c)   Explain two possible reasons for RDM employees’ resistance to change if RDM enters
      the US market.                                                                            [4]

      Reasons for resistance to change could include:
      • new ways of working
      • Having to work with new staff in the US
      (these first two points are simply lifted from the additional material so would have to be
      developed for the second mark(s)
      • Some employees may have to move to US (disruption, culture clashes etc).
      • There could be disruption. (no supporting context)
      • There would be newly recruited employees in US, maybe on higher salaries which might
         cause resentment.
      • Newly recruited employees may not fit into the culture which may be difficult for existing
         employees
      • Low level of unionization in US which European employees may not like
      • Financial reasons – costs of moving etc

      Accept any other relevant reason.

      Mark as a 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for an appropriate reason [1] for application/context. Award a maximum of [2] for
      each reason. Maximum award overall: [4].

(d)   Using information from the case study and the additional information above, discuss
      the opportunities and threats for RDM of entering the US market.                         [10]

      Opportunities:
      • Massive market.
      • US spending on healthcare much higher.
      • Strong demand.
      • High incomes in US.

      Threats:
      • Advertising spend in the US is very high
      • Availablity of suitable people to recruit
      • Competition very high in US
      • Domination of market by big US companies
      • US industrial/employee relations and cultures may cause disruption.

      OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS SHOULD BE EXTERNAL TO RDM

      If candidate considers all four elements of SWOT only reward for that part of the answer
      relevant to opportunities and threats.

      Accept any other relevant opportunity or threat.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 6.

      For an answer with no effective use of context (Theoretical answer) award maximum [3].

      For an answer that only looks at strengths and weaknesses (internal factors) award a
      maximum [3]

      Award [4] if opportunities and threats are presented as an undeveloped list.

For an answer that only looks at opportunities or only looks at threats, award up to a
maximum of [5]. At top end context has to be good.
Both opportunities and threats considered but descriptively max {6}

Both opportunities and threats considered, good use of evidence, particularly from section B,
but no effective conclusion/evaluation award a maximum of [8].

For [10] marks a fully supported conclusion/evaluation with good use of evidence,
particularly from Section B.

                                         Section C
5.   Using the case study and the additional information on pages 4 and 5, recommend whether
     RDM should choose Option 1 or Option 2.                                                          [20]

     Option 1: Market development

     Arguments for:
     • Good use of capacity.
     • Looks good on decision tree. EV US=$11m; EV UK=$10m
     • US high cost($5m), UK lower cost ($3m), both more than Option 2
     • UK market similar to those in other European countries.
     • UK market close
     • UK market would not need major changes to distribution channels
     • Lower risk in Ansoff
     • Birth rates high in US, UK so possible aging population

The following points are on page 3 of the question paper so are not necessary for an answer but can be
rewarded:
     • US is a massive market with wealthy customers.
     • Spending on health in US is higher, incomes in US are high.
     • Likely long-term decline in Europe.
     • Lower union power in US.

     Arguments against:
     • Fluctuating exchange rates make planning especially pricing difficult
     • US likely to discourage imports and prefers direct investment
     • No experience of either market.
     • Difficult to enter the UK market
     • Possible decline in healthcare markets especially US, UK
     • There are already established suppliers in the UK market
     • Reduced healthcare spending in Europe

The following points are on page 3 so are not necessary for an answer but can be rewarded:
      • US is highly competitive, dominated by multinationals.
      • Recruiting could be expensive.
      • Different rules and regulations in US may mean changes to product designs.

     Option 2: Diversification

     Arguments for:
     • Existing product may go into decline phase of product life cycle.
     • Rapidly growing and new market. (Table 2)
     • RDM has wide experience.
     • Possible reduction in Europe health care markets because of reductions in government
        spending.
     • Importance of service industries, healthcare opportunities likely to decline especially in Europe
     • Lowest cost ($2m) Highest chance of success (0.8)
     • Decision tree gives best EV ($12m)

     Arguments against:
     • No experience.
     • Higher risk in Ansoff.
     • Recruitment may be difficult (high skills, experience needed)

 Allow discussion of any reasonable related issue. Discussion of Brexit in the UK may help a
 candidate reach a conclusion but is not to be rewarded as the issue is external to the case.

 Use the criteria on page 7.

 Criterion A: Knowledge and understanding of tools, techniques and theories

 Decision tree and data from case, the 7Ps, diversification, interpretation of data, stakeholder
 differences, pace of change, Ansoff, Risk. Force Field and SWOT, but both often misunderstood in
 which case not rewarded. Be careful, mention of market development/diversification does not
 necessarily show knowledge of Ansoff – the candidate could be quoting from the case.

 For [4] Good understanding of a range appropriate tools/techniques/theories

 For [2] Satisfactory understanding of a limited number of tools/techniques/theories


 Criterion B: Application judged by use of stimulus, in particular the extra material.

 Remember, understanding has been rewarded in Criterion A. So B is about USE

 For [4]: relevant tools, techniques and theories are applied well to the case study
 context and additional stimulus material, the application is convincing and relevant.

 For [2]: some limited context/application but not developed. Use of tools limits
 candidate’s ability to make reasoned arguments.

 Criterion C Reasoned arguments
 Options discussed in balanced way, conclusions drawn and recommendation
 made/supported.

 For [4]: There needs to be a clear recommendation supported by the data and
 analysis.

 For [2]: Some limited arguments but not justified. Or limited analysis (e.g. one-sided
 argument) but candidate arrives/draws a reasoned conclusion.

  Criterion D: Structure: This criterion assesses the extent to which the student organizes
  his or her ideas with clarity, and presents a structured piece of writing comprised of:
• an introduction, which could be scene setting, or an executive summary (e.g.
  presenting/stating the recommendation)
• a concluding paragraph. Please note this can be different from the concept of a
conclusion/recommendation shown in Criterion C. Criterion D can be rewarded without
a recommendation. Also please note that if there is an executive summary at the
beginning (e.g. presenting/stating the recommendation) then the concluding paragraph
should be more than simply a repeat of the executive summary (i.e. more than simply re-
presenting/restating the recommendation)
• fit-for-purpose paragraphs. This means: not too long, each focused on distinct issues,
• structure. This means whether there is a clear flow to guide the reader through the
       discussion, how the paragraphs are sequenced.

 For [4]: all four elements present, clearly organized.

 For [2]: No logical structure but other elements present or logical structure with other elements.

Criterion E: Individuals: Heinrik, Jan, Xi; Groups: Directors; shareholders; employees; customers;
competitors. Likely issues include what the individuals want, the impact on employees, whether
employees/managers have right skills, etc.
For [4 Individual(s) and group(s) are named and considered in a balanced way. I.e
needs 1 or more of both individuals and groups developed

For [2]: one individual or one group considered appropriately, or several individuals
and/or groups considered superficially.
For [1] one individual and/or one group considered superficially
