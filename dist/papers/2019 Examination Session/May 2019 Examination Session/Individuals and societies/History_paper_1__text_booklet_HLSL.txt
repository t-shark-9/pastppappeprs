Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Genghis Khan c1200–1227 — Leadership: rise to power; uniting of rival tribes.

Source A                  Jean-Paul Roux, an historian specializing in Asian history, writing in the
                          introductory study Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire (2003).

The Turco-Mongols long believed that there could be only one emperor on earth just as there was only
one god in heaven. In other words, Togrul the Kerait and Temujin [Genghis] the Mongol could not rule
side by side. They confronted one another in 1203 [but Togrul fled and died soon after]. Temujin annexed
Togrul’s lands and his people and became the true master of eastern and central Mongolia. The Naiman
no longer had power against him. They searched for an ally who could push the Mongols back and
thought they would find support among the Onggut, but the Onggut chose instead to warn Temujin.
Although the Naiman hoped to surprise him, it was they who were taken unawares. They collapsed with
the first attack. [The future] Genghis Khan would never forget the favour shown to him by the Onggut.
Temujin now controlled all of Mongolia.

                          writing in the academic book Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule (2004).

Temujin felt insecure knowing that one great tribal grouping, the Naiman, remained beyond his control  …
If Temujin could defeat the Naiman, his enemies would have nowhere to shelter and he would be
undisputed leader of the unified Turco-Mongol steppe tribes. With so much at stake Temujin could not
risk failure, and so he devised a careful plan …

On the day of the Feast of the Moon in the Year of the Rat (1204) Temujin led his troops into battle. To
raise the morale of his own limited forces and intimidate the numerically superior Naiman, he employed
a strategy that he was to use to great effect in future conflicts. By lighting countless camp-fires, mounting
dummies on spare horses, and trailing branches and bushes from their own horses, the Mongols were
able to create the impression that their numbers were far greater than they actually were.

The Mongols’ victory was total. Following this victory, all the other tribes that had once thought of
independence were quick to promise their full loyalty. Only the Merkits attempted to escape, but within
the same year they too had been destroyed.

Source C                An unknown author, likely a member of the Borjigids (the imperial clan of Genghis
                        Khan), describes the lead up to the fight against the Naimans, in the record of the
                        affairs of the Borjigids, often known as Secret History of the Mongols (c1228).

Alakush [Khan of the Ongguts] sent a messenger to Chingis [Genghis] saying “Tayang of the Naimans
is going to come and snatch your bows and arrows, and he asked me to be his right hand. I refused and
now wish to inform you of this.” When Chingis received this message, he held a council. Many of those
present said, “Our horses are lean, it is a bad moment for us” … [but others] said “the Naimans think that
because their country is large and their people many they have the right to brag. Here is our opportunity
to seize their bows and arrows” …

On the sixteenth day of the fourth month of the Year of the Rat (1204) Chingis [Genghis] went off to fight
against the Naimans … Chingis with his main army reached the Sa’ari Steppe and camped there.
Dodai-cherbi [a military commander] said to Chingis “We are few in number and have travelled a long
way. We had better turn out our horses to graze and establish decoy troops in large numbers all over
the Sa’ari Steppe (that is people of all kinds, other than combatants [fighters], were to be disguised as
soldiers). At night, everyone should light five fires. The Naimans are great in force, but their ruler is timid
and weak. He has never been far from home and will certainly be bewildered [confused] and deceived.
Then, when our horses have eaten enough, we will push back their scouts, make straight for their main
camp and fall upon them before they have time to draw up in battle order. In this way we should be sure
to win.” Chingis took his advice.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
The final stages of Muslim rule in Spain — Key events and actors: the Granada War and the conquest of
Granada (1482–1492).

Source E                 Joseph O’Callaghan, a professor of medieval history, writing in the academic
                         book The Last Crusade in the West: Castile and the Conquest of Granada
                         (2014).

The Castilian struggle to defeat the emirate of Granada was essentially a war of religions. In making
that statement I do not mean to exclude other more material motives … Kings and emirs fought over
boundaries, the possession of castles and lands, and economic resources. The contrast between fertile
areas in Nasrid Granada and unproductive lands in certain Castilian regions surely drew the attention
of the Castilian monarchs. Access to the Mediterranean and control of the straits of Gibraltar were also
attractions. Greed and the desire for riches led to border raids by both sides. Plunder [items seized] in
the form of livestock, jewels, and other goods, as well as people who were to be enslaved, enriched both
Christians and Muslims. All those political and economic reasons are valid and were always in play.

Nevertheless, I suggest that the struggle was ultimately a conflict between two societies, one Christian,
the other Muslim. Each society was shaped by the spirit of a distinctive religion.

                         Castilian Kings (c1492).

In the month of December [1491], not having enough provisions left, the citizens of Granada requested
a meeting with the Christians. The negotiations lasted thirty days and on 30 December, the Moors
surrendered the fortresses held by their king [Abu Abdallah]—the most important of which was the
Alhambra—to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. The terms of the treaty allowed the Moors to
keep their religion and property, as well as other privileges. The Moors also gave concessions [to the
Christians] and, to guarantee the surrender of the fortresses and of all their weapons, many of Granada’s
most important citizens were handed over as hostages …

On Saturday, King Abu Abdallah gathered his counsellors, as well as those in the city who were rioting.
He spoke to pacify them, explaining that the time for rioting had passed, because they no longer had the
supplies to resist the Christian siege. Since they had no hope of help and had given hostages, resistance
would bring harm rather than any remedy …

King Abu Abdallah wrote to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to give assurance that he would comply
with the terms of surrender, advising that it be carried out as soon as possible.

Reading this, on 2 January, the king and queen led their army to Granada … The Moorish king came out
to surrender the keys of the city.

                           Ibero-African Frontier (2010).

Expansion attracted to the edge of Muslim territories an aggressive and upwardly mobile [socially
ambitious] element from Christian society. Everywhere there were those who wished to take the
possessions of the defeated [Muslims] and acquire the prestige that would legitimize their newfound
wealth and power in the presence [minds] of the older Spanish nobility. In fifteenth-century Castile the
distinguishing traits [characteristics] of these frontiersmen were a warriorlike attitude towards
non-Christians and a pride in the purity of their own Christian ancestry. When, like the Jews, men
from the Muslim upper classes converted and somehow managed to retain their social standing and
wealth, they limited the opportunities of Old Christians who wished to acquire new status and wealth
… Conversely, the desertion of former Muslim leaders in an hour of need angered the members of the
community they had left.

                        Simon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Adolf Hitler, German Chancellor
                        and Führer (March 1935).
John Simon thanked the Chancellor for the opportunity he had had of meeting him and for the way in
which the British Ministers had been welcomed. But, observing the rule of frankness to the end, he must
say that the British Ministers felt somewhat disappointed that it had not been possible to get a larger
measure of agreement. They regretted that such difficulties were thought to exist on the German side
in connection with some of the matters discussed. He did not regret having come to Berlin. He was
sure that this meeting was the best way of continuing this investigation into the various points of view.
What he regretted was that they had not been able to do more in the direction of promoting the general
agreement which he was sure both sides wanted.
It showed that these things were more difficult and complicated than many believed them to be from a
distance…
Hitler was also grateful to the British Government for the loyal efforts they had made in the matter of the
Saar vote, and for all the other matters on which they had adopted such a loyal and generous attitude to
Germany.

                         academic book Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933–1941. The Road to Global War (2004).

Hitler’s quest to rearm Germany continued unopposed. During Anglo–French talks in London at the
beginning of February (1935), Germany’s rearmament had received the blessing of the two West
European powers even though they still hoped to convince Germany to join a multilateral Locarno-style
pact guaranteeing the borders of Germany’s East European neighbours.

Hitler’s answer to these conciliatory approaches came quickly. He removed one of the major limitations
of the Versailles Treaty and, on 16 March 1935, increased the size of Germany’s armed forces to
300,000 troops. This time, however, France, Britain and Italy seemed keen to react more firmly to the
worrying growth in Germany’s strength. At Stresa in April, an attempt was made to establish a common
front against Germany’s increasing attempts to revise [post-war settlements].

However, the reaction of the three former allies remained meek [feeble]. To the delight of the Nazi
regime, the common front against Germany was both short lived and of limited impact. By June, Britain
broke with Stresa when it agreed to a bilateral naval agreement with Germany.

                         Reich (1937).

Confronted by the German desire for naval rearmament, England [Britain], after a brief suggestion of
displeasure, quickly decided to come to terms. British leaders believed that the best way to safeguard
this primary English [British] interest would be to conclude a direct and separate agreement with
Germany which would set a maximum limit to German armaments acceptable to both countries. In
agreeing to this transaction Germany not only received the right to begin, with English consent, an
important programme of naval construction, but also potentially caused further disagreement among the
signatories of the Versailles Treaty.

The naval agreement signed in London on June 18, 1935 between England and Germany aroused great
concern in France. It was the occasion for outbursts in the press and for diplomatic manoeuvres intended
to moderate the disagreement which had unexpectedly developed between the two allied nations, and
hold together the Entente which was considered valuable. It was nevertheless obvious that by his bold
initiative, Hitler had scored an amazing success which also strengthened his prestige in Germany. He
had won the right to rearm officially both on land and on sea and this was accomplished without a violent

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

Read sources M to P and answer questions 13 to 16. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Apartheid South Africa (1948–1964) — Protests and action: non-violent protests: Freedom Charter.

Source M                Robert Sobukwe, the leader of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), making a
                        speech at the opening of the PAC’s first meeting (April 1959).

The Europeans are a foreign minority group, which has exclusive control of political, economic, social
and military power. It is the exploiting group responsible for the harmful doctrine of White Supremacy
which has resulted in the humiliation of the African people. It is this group which has robbed the African
people of their land … It is this group which states that the Native is still backward and savage …

The African people can be organised only under the banner of African nationalism in an All-African
organisation where they will, by themselves, decide on the methods of struggle without interference from
groups of minorities who arrogantly claim for themselves the right to plan and think for Africans …

Against multi-racialism we have this objection … [it] would mean giving way to European prejudice and
arrogance …

We aim, politically, at government of the Africans by the Africans for Africans, with everybody who owes
his only loyalty to Africa and who is prepared to accept the democratic rule of an African majority.

Source O                  Anthony Sampson, a British journalist who had met and worked with leaders of
                          the anti-apartheid movement, writing in the obituary of Lionel Bernstein in the
                          British newspaper The Guardian (26 June 2002).

Lionel “Rusty” Bernstein was one of the most influential and dedicated members of the small group of
white revolutionaries who supported the black liberation movement.

He played a crucial role in drafting [writing] the 1955 African National Congress (ANC) Freedom
Charter  … [and] coined [wrote] the document’s opening slogan “Let us speak of freedom”, including
rousing phrases like “the people shall govern” and “all shall be equal before [under] the law”.

In 1956, Bernstein was among the 156 people charged—and acquitted—in the so-called treason trial …

He was, quite simply, driven to protest by his sense of outrage at the segregation and oppression of
black people …

As the only multi-racial party, the SACP [the South African Communist Party, which Bernstein and his
wife had joined in 1938] acquired a heroic reputation among blacks leading the fight against racism, and
the Bernsteins were always welcoming to the black ANC leaders …

Restricted by bans and harassment [by the authorities], in 1955 Rusty resigned from his high-earning
architectural partnership. He and his wife were now totally committed to the struggle.

                          Apartheid 1948–1994 (2014).

                          Note: “Africanists” refers to black leaders who believed that the anti-apartheid
                          struggle should be fought only by black people.

Whereas Africanists within the African National Congress Youth League, like Mandela, Sisulu and
Tambo, came to value cooperation with non-Africans through the struggles in the early 1950s, others …
remained deeply suspicious of white and Indian interference. They were able to exploit popular thinking
that viewed freedom as synonymous [identical] with African leadership.

The highpoint of multi-racial opposition to apartheid came in 1955 [in a meeting that came to be known
as the Congress of the People] when the African National Congress (ANC) and its partners, the Indian
Congress, Coloured People’s Organization and the Congress of Democrats (mainly consisting of white
members of the outlawed Communist Party), met to agree the Freedom Charter … Africanists resented
the inclusion of whites, coloureds and Indians. Some left-wing critics objected that the multi-racialism of
the Congress of the People mirrored the official racial categories of the apartheid state …

Although the Freedom Charter was said to have been produced by “the people” in a democratic process
of consultation, critics alleged that its formulation [production] was controlled and manipulated by a group
of white left-wingers in the Congress of Democrats … It is now widely accepted that Communist Party
intellectual Lionel “Rusty” Bernstein was the guiding hand in the formulation of the Freedom Charter.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Rwanda (1990–1998) — Course and interventions: role of the media.

Source Q                 Mahmood Mamdani, a professor of government specializing in African history and
                         politics, writing in the academic book When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism,
                         Nativism and Genocide in Rwanda (2001).

The growing appeal of Hutu Power propaganda among the Hutu masses was in direct proportion to the
spreading conviction [belief] that the real aim of the RPF (Rwandan Patriotic Front) was not rights for all
Rwandans, but power for the Tutsi. This is why one needs to recognize that it was not greed—not even
hatred—but fear, which was the reason why the multitude responded to the call of Hutu Power. Hutu
Power extremists prevailed [succeeded] not because they promised farmers more land if they killed
their Tutsi neighbours—which they did—but because they told farmers that the alternative would be to
let the RPF take their land and return it to the Tutsi. “Defend your rights and rise up against those who
want to oppress you” the singer of Radio Libre des Mille Collines repeated as drums beat and guitars
played a traditional melody. At the receiving end of this message were men and women like Kiruhara, an
illiterate 27-year-old peasant who had spent most of his life farming in eastern Rwanda … “The stations
were always telling people that if the RPF comes it will return Rwanda to feudalism, that it would bring
oppression” Kiruhara told his captors in 1994.

                         (ICTR) following the “Media Trial”, in which the ICTR prosecuted members of the
                         media for inciting the public to commit acts of genocide (2003).

26.	The Chamber [ICTR] finds that RTLM [Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines] broadcasts
     engaged in ethnic stereotyping in a manner that promoted hatred for the Tutsi population … These
     broadcasts called explicitly for the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic group.

27.	Many RTLM broadcasts are excerpted [included] in the judgement. In one such broadcast, aired on
     4 June 1994, RTLM journalist Kantano Habimana told listeners: “… the reason we will exterminate
     them [Tutsis] is that they belong to one ethnic group” …

29.	Radio was the medium of mass communication with the broadest reach in Rwanda. The Chamber
     finds that RTLM broadcasts exploited the history of Tutsi privilege and Hutu disadvantage, and
     the fear of armed insurrection, to mobilize the population, whipping [urging] them into hatred and
     violence that was directed largely against the Tutsi ethnic group.
