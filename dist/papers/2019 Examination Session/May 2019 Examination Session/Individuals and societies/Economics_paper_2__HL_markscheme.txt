                 There is synthesis/evaluation, supported by appropriate
                 theory and evidence.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
       definition of stakeholders
       definition of tariff.

      Consumers of drywall (Canadian building firms):
       will face higher costs, and thus reduced profits (paragraph )
       fall in the production of buildings (paragraph )
       may cause unemployment.

      Domestic producers of drywall:
       will receive higher prices (paragraph ) and thus more profits
       increase in output and sales
       increase in employment (paragraph )
       supporting monopoly power (paragraph ).

      US producers of drywall:
       higher costs
       reduced sales
       lower profits and possibly a decrease in employment.

      The Canadian government:
       increased revenue (paragraph )
       possible retaliation from the US.

Canadian economy:
 reduction in competition (paragraph ), leading to inefficiency
 inflationary pressure in the housing market (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation.

To reach level 3, students must be aware of the particular situation in the Canadian
drywall market on specific stakeholders, not just present an evaluation of tariffs in
general.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
 definition of current account deficit (paragraph ) / reference to (c).

Positive effects:
 imports of capital can lead to increased economic growth in the long run (paragraph )
 high imports of non-essential goods may indicate development and higher living standards
  (paragraph ) suggests consuming outside of PPC
 Pakistan may have to depreciate the currency as advised by central bank. This will
  reduce the relative price of exports and may allow to improve Pakistan's export
  competitiveness (paragraph ).

Negative effects:
 may require “new IMF” loan and conditions that are attached regarding austerity
  (paragraph )
 persistent trade deficit may compromise “decade high” economic growth (paragraph )
 inflows on financial account increase, meaning foreign debt payments will increase and
  worsen current account deficit
 downward pressure on the exchange rate requiring use of foreign exchange reserves to
  maintain managed float (paragraph )
 may be forced to “depreciate” the rupee which will:
 increase import prices and may cause cost-push inflation
 reduce export revenues – Marshall-Lerner condition
 IMF loans to finance current account deficit (paragraph ) will require interest payments
  that may worsen the budget deficit (paragraph )
 foreign investors may be purchasing Pakistan assets to finance the deficit which could
  threaten sovereignty
 current account deficit may worsen Pakistan’s credit rating
 it may be unsustainable to finance the current account deficit by borrowing. If foreign
  investors lose confidence, there may be a rapid outflow of financial capital resulting in a
  rapid fall in the value of the rupee
 fiscal policy (paragraph ) decisions may have to be addressed to help with the
  deficit. In this case, moving from expansionary to contractionary. This may reduce
  economic growth.

Any reasonable discussion.

To reach level 3, students must be aware of the particular situation in Pakistan, not just
present an evaluation of a current account deficit in general.

              AD. This leads to an increase in real GDP, and thus economic
              growth.

              An AD/AS diagram showing a shift of the AD curve to the right
              and an increase in the level of national income AND an
              explanation that an expansionary monetary policy (reduction in
              interest rates) will increase consumption/investment increasing
              AD. This leads to an increase in real GDP, and thus economic
              growth.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level or average price level. The horizontal
      axis may be real output, real national output, real national income, real Y, or real GDP.
      A title is not necessary.

(c)   Explain the difference between economic growth and economic development
      (paragraph ).                                                                           [4]

      Responses may include:
       growth is increase in real GDP
       development is measure of well-being/standard of living/welfare
       GDP single indicator/measures only income (quantitative)
       development is composite (qualitative) / made up of multiple measures such as
        literacy rates, access to clean water, life expectancy, years of schooling, level of
        gender equality.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, discuss the
      extent to which continued economic growth may lead to economic development
      in Kenya.                                                                                [8]

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Do not award beyond level 2 if the answer does not contain reference to the
      information provided.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
 definition of economic growth
 definition of economic development.

Economic growth and economic development:
 good agricultural performance (paragraph ) may increase growth through exports,
  however dependence on primary products is dangerous because of fluctuating commodity
  prices (paragraph )
 expansionary monetary policy (paragraph ) leads to growth but might be difficult to
  maintain if it causes inflation, however, Kenya is within the central bank’s inflation targets
  at the moment (paragraph )
 infrastructure developments (paragraph ), enhanced construction (paragraph ) and
  investment in energy and transportation (paragraph ) will all lead to long-term growth,
  however, there are cost considerations for any developing country
 low inflation (paragraph ) enables expansionary policies to continue to be implemented
  (paragraph )
 moderate improvement in the business environment (paragraph ) but need to reduce
  the cost of doing business (paragraph )
 low oil prices (paragraph ) reduce costs in the economy, thus leading to increased
  SRAS and growth, however, these may not be sustained and are out of Kenya’s control
  (external shocks) (paragraph )
 currency stability (paragraph ) is a factor, but often beyond the control of developing
  countries (external shocks) (paragraph )
 fast-growing neighbouring countries (paragraph ) is beyond the control of Kenya
  (external shocks) (paragraph )
 surge in remittances (paragraph ) allows increased consumption on necessities and
  merit goods which support development, but this will be dependent upon continued world
  economy growth (external shocks) (paragrap )
 “a growing middle-class and rising incomes” (paragraph ) are signs that economic
  development is occurring
 PPF to show how economic growth can lead to development (development goods such as
  merit goods on one axis with PPF increasing)
 Kenya faces development challenges in spite of strong economic growth
  (inequality, climate change, poverty) that may compromise economic development
  (paragraph ).

Any reasonable discussion.

To reach level 3, students must show awareness of the ways and to what extent
(evaluating) economic growth may or may not lead to economic development –
making a very clear link between the two (not just an analysis on economic growth
or/and economic development). They must present a balanced evaluative approach on
how growth might or might not impact on economic development.
