Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their historical
           context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the role of women in two societies, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of women in two societies.
     The two societies must be from different regions but they may or may not have been
     contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies, or
     they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both societies will be a feature of
     the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
     economic role of women, for example their role as craftspeople or traders. Women in leadership
     roles may be discussed, for example Eleanor of Aquitaine or the Regent Dowager Liu Zhangxian in
     their respective regions. Alternatively, candidates may discuss women’s occupational roles or their
     role in intellectual and/or religious life. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but
     there does not need to be an equal focus on each.



2.   With reference to two societies, each from a different region, to what extent were developments in
     architecture the most significant cultural and intellectual development?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     developments in architecture were the most significant cultural and intellectual development in two
     societies. The two societies must be from different regions but they may or may not have been
     contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may refer to developments in military, religious or
     civic architecture, the use of new materials, the influence of expanding cultures such as Islam, or
     the impact of changes in wealth and status. While other relevant factors, for example,
     developments in music, science, and art, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
     on architecture. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                 –5–                 M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 2   Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   Evaluate the importance of religion in causing two medieval wars, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the importance of religion in causing
     two medieval wars, weighing up its impact or otherwise. The two wars must be from different
     regions but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Causes may
     predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of religion and other causes, or they may emphasize the
     evaluation of one; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative
     approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the role of the religious or military
     leaders, as in the case of Pope Urban II, in the heightening of tensions by making promises of
     celestial/material rewards, accusations of wrongdoings, or direct call to arms. Both importance and
     limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each. While
     other relevant factors, for example economic, political, or ideological causes, may be referred to,
     the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


4.   “Religious change was the most significant effect of war.” Discuss with reference to two medieval
     wars.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of religious change
     as an effect of two wars. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and they may or
     may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The changes discussed may extend
     beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. A
     comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of the
     Crusades on Europe and the Middle and Near East, or the Spanish conquests in the Americas.
     While other relevant factors, for example cultural, economic or political change, may be deemed
     more significant, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  –6–                 M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 3   Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Compare and contrast the nature of the power of two rulers.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
     two rulers in terms of the nature of their power, referring to both throughout. The two rulers may or
     may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
     other. Candidates may refer to where power was derived from as integral to the nature of power
     and so hereditary claims, as in the case of Harun al-Rashid may be mentioned. Hereditary
     privileges may also be linked to religious reasons, for example the Inca rulers who claimed divine
     descent from the sun. There may be reference to the support of the religious elite through
     manipulation of religious symbols, as in the case of coronation ceremonies that publicly confirmed
     rulers, or via the indoctrination of the population. Candidates may also refer to right by conquest,
     where power may have stemmed from control over resources as well as military strength, as in the
     case of Timur-i-Lang (Tamerlane). Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but
     there does not need to be an equal number of each.


6.   With reference to two examples, to what extent did dynasties and/or rulers overcome the
     challenges they faced?

     The question requires that candidates offer a balanced review of the extent to which challenges
     were overcome. The two rulers may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not
     have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of examples
     of challenges that were overcome and those that were not, or they may emphasize their discussion
     of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
     may or may not be used. Candidates may discuss successes and failures in war, the extent to
     which internal challenges were overcome, or the impact of economic policies. They may discuss
     the patronage of education and culture, religious policy, or administrative reforms. Candidates’
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 4   Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Evaluate the role of women in two societies, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of women in two societies,
     referring to both societies throughout. The two societies must be from different regions but they
     may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may refer to the roles of
     female leaders such as Isabella of Castile or Elizabeth I of England, or women such as Chinese
     empresses Ma and Xiaozhuang, who supported their husbands. There may be reference to
     women’s position in the European workforce, especially in domestic service, or their legal status in
     patriarchal societies, such as China. Candidates may refer to the role of women in the slave
     system in the Americas, their role as farmers and traders in Africa, or the wide variety of roles,
     sometimes of high status, of women in Arab society. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
     indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.



8.   With reference to two societies, each from a different region, evaluate the impact of cross-cultural
     exchange.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of cross-cultural exchange,
     which may be positive or negative. The two societies must be from different regions but they may
     or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Impact may extend beyond the
     timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of the two societies, or they may emphasize their evaluation of one of them;
     however, both societies will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not
     be used. Candidates may refer, for example, to the social and cultural impact of the Spanish
     conquests in the Americas, the impact of Chinese pre-eminence in world trade at the beginning of
     the period or the burgeoning West African slave trade. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the
     spread of Islam in Africa, or of European settlement in North America. Both positive and negative
     effects must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                  –8–                  M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 5    Early modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Examine how the relationship between religion and the state contributed to the expansion of two
      established states.

      The question requires that candidates consider how the relationship between religion and the state
      contributed to the expansion of two established states. The two established states may or may not
      be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of the two states, or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them;
      however, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may refer to the coexistence of political and religious power in the same
      authority, for example the Incas. They may refer to the use of religion to consolidate political
      power, through the lack of religious tolerance or the granting of ecclesiastical privileges. In some
      cases, candidates may also argue that religion did not contribute to the expansion of the state, for
      example, the Qing dynasty. Candidates’ conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


10.   “The most important challenge to colonial rule was resistance and rebellion in the colony.” Discuss
      with reference to two colonies.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that resistance and rebellion were the most important challenges to colonial rule. The two colonies
      may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of two colonies, or they may emphasize their discussion of
      one of them; however, both colonies will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may argue that rebellions and resistance threatened the
      economy, stability and settlers’ security, for example the Guo Huaiy Rebellion against the Dutch in
      Taiwan or the Vilcabamba resistance in the Peruvian Viceroyalty. While other relevant challenges,
      for example the lack of resources or wars with other colonial powers may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement.
                                                    –9–                   M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 6       Causes and effects of early modern wars (1500–1750)

      11. “Competition for resources was the most important cause of wars.” With reference to two early
          modern wars, each from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

        The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
        most important cause of early modern wars was competition for resources. The two wars must be
        from different regions and they may or may not have been contemporaneous. Causes may predate
        the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may
        offer equal coverage of both wars, or they may emphasize their assessment of one of them. A
        comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to disputes over access to
        trade routes, lands, labour or goods, for example the Beaver wars or the Ethiopian-Adal War.
        While other relevant factors, for example political and religious, may be referred to, the bulk of the
        response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
        disagree with the statement, but their conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
        appropriate evidence and sound argument.


12.     To what extent did mercenaries have an impact on the outcome of two wars?

        The question requires that candidates make a balanced review of the role of mercenaries in the
        outcome of two wars, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two wars may or may not be
        from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
        Candidates may review the impact of mercenaries in the Dutch War of Independence, and Gustav
        II Adolf’s largely mercenary army in the Thirty Years’ War. They may also review the role of
        Portuguese mercenaries in the Burmese–Siamese War (1547-1549) and Ethiopian–Adal War
        (1529–1543). It would be valid to comment on wars where mercenaries played little part, such as
        the Japanese invasion of Korea (1592–1598). While other relevant factors that affected the
        outcome of wars may be referred to, such as tactics, logistics or numerical superiority, the bulk of
        the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  – 10 –                M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


Topic 7     Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   “Developments in energy and power had the most significant role in the process of
      industrialization.” Discuss with reference to two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that developments in energy and power were the most significant contributors to the process of
      industrialization in two countries. The two countries may or may not be from the same region and
      the processes of industrialization may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of developments in energy and power, or they may
      emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      introduction of, for example, steam power during the first industrial revolution that provided an
      alternative to manual labour. Such advances enabled mechanization and extended working hours
      in factories through the use of gas lighting. Candidates may also refer to petrol-powered
      automobiles, aeroplanes and ships that facilitated global trade. While other relevant factors, for
      example, iron and steel production, mass production or mass communication, may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement.


14.   “The most significant effect of the growth of cities and factories was social change.” Discuss with
      reference to two countries, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact
      of the growth of cities and factories in two countries. The two countries must be from different
      regions. The growth of cities and factories may or may not have occurred at the same time.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries, or they may emphasize their discussion
      of one of them; however, both countries will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of cities and factories on family life,
      on public health, and on rural society (as resources may have been diverted to cities, and rural
      depopulation may have occurred). The growth of factories may have affected the nature and
      quality of housing, and the relationship between employer and employee. There may also be
      discussion of transport issues, such as congestion, and the development of suburbs.

Topic 8     Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   With reference to two independence movements, to what extent was violence an important
      method of achieving independence?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      violence was an important method of achieving independence. The two independence movements
      may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two independence movements, or
      they may emphasize their assessment of one of them; however, both movements will be a feature
      of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to
      organized military force, for example Bolívar’s forces in South America, or to the use of guerrillas,
      for example the Viet Minh. However, non-violent methods may be referred to in an effort to
      challenge the question, for example refusal to pay taxes, or civil resistance in India.


16.   “Political problems were not a significant challenge to new states in the first 10 years of
      independence.” With reference to two new states, to what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      political problems were not a significant challenge to new states in the first ten years of
      independence. The two states may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or
      may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the
      two states or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both states will be a
      feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. There may be
      discussion of the extent to which political stability was established after independence, and the
      ability of pre-independence movements to provide effective government once in power. The
      challenge of establishing new political structures may be considered. Candidates may agree, partly
      agree or disagree with the statement.

Topic 9    Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Compare and contrast the conditions that encouraged the demand for democratic reform in two
      states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the conditions that encouraged the demand for democratic reform in two states. The two states
      may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. The conditions may predate the timeframe of the world history
      topic, but they must be clearly linked to the demand for reform. Candidates may refer to the role of
      the aftermath of war, as in the case of Japan after the Second World War, or political upheaval, as
      in the case of democratic states that emerged after the demise of communism. Some democracies
      emerged as their colonizers withdrew, for example, states in Africa and South America. Candidates
      may refer to the need to represent the emergent social classes in, for example, Western Europe.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.


18.   “The development of democracy led to significant social reform.” Discuss with reference to two
      democratic states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that democracy led to significant social reform in two states. The two states may be drawn from the
      same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them;
      however, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may refer to the role played by democratic development in educational reform,
      discussing for example how far education was extended across all racial groups in post-apartheid
      South Africa, or reforms of health services such as the National Health Service in the United
      Kingdom (where universal free healthcare was established), or Medicare in the US (a much more
      limited reform). There may be discussion of the extent of provision of welfare to the unemployed or
      the sick. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Topic 10    Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   “Control of opposition was the most important method used to maintain power in authoritarian
      states.” Discuss with reference to two authoritarian states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      The two authoritarian states may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or may
      not have been contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two authoritarian states or they may emphasize
      their discussion of one of them; however, both authoritarian states will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to the persecution of other political parties, journalists, religious
      leaders or intellectuals. While other relevant methods, for example propaganda or economic
      policies may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


20.   Compare and contrast the impact of the policies of two authoritarian states on women.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of policies on women in two authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be
      drawn from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
      other. The impact may extend briefly beyond the timeframe of the world history topic but it must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to, for example, Castro’s
      educational policies and provision of childcare, Mao’s marriage law, Hitler’s policies towards
      female employment, or Peron’s reforms of maternity rights. Both similarities and differences must
      be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Topic 11   Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   “Foreign powers did not determine the outcome of civil wars.” Discuss with reference to two civil
      wars, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
      foreign powers did not determine the outcome of civil wars. The two civil wars must be drawn from
      different regions but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two civil wars or they may emphasize their discussion
      of one of them; however, both wars will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may discuss, for example, the roles of Germany and Italy in the
      Spanish Civil War, or the roles of the US and the USSR in the Chinese Civil War. While other
      relevant factors, for example tactics and leadership, may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.



22.   With reference to two 20th-century wars, each from a different region, compare and contrast the
      effects of war on the role and status of women.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the effects of two 20th-century wars on the role and status of women, referring to both wars
      throughout. The two wars must be drawn from different regions but they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Effects may extend beyond the timeframe of the word history
      topic, but they must be clearly linked to the named wars. Candidates may refer to the economic
      roles assumed by women during the chosen conflicts and comment on how these impacted their
      roles and status or there may be reference to the role of women within the armed conflict. For
      example, during the Second World War, while some Western European countries restricted female
      participation to nursing or administrative tasks, some women served in the Soviet army. In
      Vietnam, women served as village patrol guards, intelligence agents, propagandists and military
      recruiters. Candidates may also refer to social changes brought about by conflict during post-war
      periods, for example rights acquired by women or continued participation in the workforce that may
      have impacted their status within society. Both similarities and differences must be clearly
      indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Topic 12    The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   “China’s relations with the USSR and the US were largely shaped by increasing mistrust and
      suspicion.” Discuss with reference to the period between 1947 and 1979.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of China’s relations with the USSR and the US, or they may
      emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer, for example, to
      Mao’s condemnation of Khrushchev’s policies as “revisionism”, Soviet criticism of the Great Leap
      Forward, the lack of mutual support during the Sino–Indian dispute and Cuban Missile Crisis or the
      escalation of suspicion following the Ussuri River border conflict (1969). Alternatively, there may be
      reference to the expansion of the policy of containment into Asia and the growing concern over
      American involvement in Korea and also Vietnam, although this was resolved through détente.
      Reference may also be made to improved relations between the US and China after Nixon’s visit in
      1972 and the subsequent inclusion of the People’s Republic of China in the UN, as well as the
      normalisation of diplomatic relations between the US and China. Candidates may also mention the
      Chinese concerns over the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War in December 1979. Candidates may
      agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


24.   “The actions of individual leaders had a significant impact on the development of the Cold War.”
      Discuss with reference to two leaders, each from a different region.
      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. The two leaders chosen must be from different regions but they may or may
      not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage
      of both leaders, or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both
      leaders will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may refer to the leaders’ roles in the establishment of a new pro-
      communist government, their involvement in proxy wars, or their promotion of the
      development of technology and/or armaments. Candidates may also refer to actions that
      led to divisions within one of the blocks, and the impetus this may have given to
      rapprochement with rival powers, their willingness to sign treaties, or to decrease military
      armament and/or involvement. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement.
