                                          Section A
Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Describe the effect of one neurotransmitter on human behaviour with reference to one
     relevant study.                                                                                [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of the effect
     of one neurotransmitter on human behaviour in relation to one relevant study.

     Examples of appropriate studies include, but are not limited to:
     • the effect of serotonin in depression (Coppen, 1967) or prosocial behaviour (Crockett et
       al., 2010)
     • the effect of acetylcholine in memory (Antonova, 2011, Rogers and Kesner, 2003)
     • the effect of dopamine in addiction (Volkow et al., 2004; Berridge and Kringelbach,
       2009) or attraction (Fisher, Aron and Brown, 2005)
     • the effect of noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in attention (Bunsey and Strupp, 1995;
       Bymaster et al., 2002).

     Animal research may be used to describe an effect of one neurotransmitter, but the
     response must then be linked to human behaviour. If there is no explicit link to human
     behaviour, a maximum of [6] should be awarded.

     If a candidate describes the effect of more than one neurotransmitter, credit should be
     given only to the first effect described.

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study
     described.

     If a candidate describes the effect of one neurotransmitter without making reference to a
     study, up to a maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes an appropriate study without describing the effect of the
     neurotransmitter, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   Describe one study investigating reconstructive memory.                                     [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one study
     investigating reconstructive memory.

     The description of the study should include the aim, procedure and results of the
     study. The description should explicitly demonstrate conceptual understanding of
     reconstructive memory.

     Examples of appropriate studies could include but are not limited to:
     • Bartlett (1932), Brewer and Treyens (1981) on the role of schema
     • Neisser and Harsch (1992); Loftus and Pickerell (1995); Shaw and Porter (2015) on
       reconstruction of autobiographical memory
     • Loftus (1993) and Loftus and Palmer’s (1974) studies on eyewitness memories
     • Yuille and Cutshall’s (1986) study that argued that in highly emotional situations,
       memories may not be reconstructed or open to distortion.

     If a candidate describes more than one study, credit should be given only to the first
     study.

     If a candidate describes or explains a theory of reconstructive memory – for example, the
     role of schema or emotion on memory – but does not refer to an appropriate study, apply
     the markbands up to a maximum of [4].

Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   Outline social identity theory with reference to one relevant study.                            [9]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account or summary of
     social identity theory in relation to one relevant study.

     Responses should identify the key concepts of social identity theory which include, but are
     not limited to:
     • social categorization (in-group/out-group)
     • social comparison
     • positive in-group distinctiveness.

     Studies related to social identity theory may include but are not limited to:
     • Tajfel’s studies on social groups and identities
     • Sherif et al.’s Robbers Cave study (1961)
     • Cialdini et al.’s Basking in Reflected Glory study (1976)
     • Abrams’s study of the role of social identity on levels of conformity (1990)
     • Maass’s study of the role of social identity on violence (2003).

     If a candidate refers to more than one study, credit should be given only to the first study
     described.

     If a candidate outlines social identity theory without reference to a relevant study, up to a
     maximum of [5] should be awarded.

     If a candidate only describes a study related to social identity theory but does not outline
     the theory, up to a maximum of [4] should be awarded.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

 Marks    Level descriptor


    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1     Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.


    2     Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks                                          Level descriptor


    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

   3–4   The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
         Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

   5–6   The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
         Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                M19/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks Level descriptor


    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2    Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves to
          repeat points already made.

   3–4    Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

   5–6    Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                  –9–                 M19/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M




 Marks Level descriptor


    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


   1–2   There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
         discussion, if present, is superficial.

   3–4   The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
         most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

   5–6   The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
         and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

 Marks Level descriptor


    0    Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.


    1    The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
         the response.

    2    The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

4.   Discuss one or more techniques used to study the brain in relation to behaviour.              [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the way
     in which techniques are used to study the brain in relation to behaviour

     Brain imaging techniques include, but are not limited to:
     • fMRI
     • MRI
     • EEG
     • ERP
     • CAT/CT
     • PET
     • Post mortem

     Relevant studies include, but are not limited to:
     • Corkin (1997) using MRI to investigate the effect of damage to HM’s medial temporal
       lobes and the effect on memory formation
     • Brefczynski-Lewis et al. (2007) using fMRI to investigate the effect of meditation on the
       brain
     • Maguire et al. (2000) using MRI scans to investigate neuroplasticity in taxi drivers
     • Ogden (2005) using CT scans to investigate the effect of brain damage on hemineglect
     • Bert et al. (2011) using PET/CT in diagnosis of dementia
     • Fisher, Aron and Brown (2005) using fMRI to investigate dopamine and love
     • Draganski et al. (2004) using MRI to investigate the effects of learning juggling on the
       brain.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • how brain imaging techniques have improved our understanding of the relationship
        between physiological factors and behaviour
     • the reasons why different technologies are used
     • evaluation of the techniques
     • ethical and methodological considerations in the use of the techniques.

     The focus of the response should be on the discussion of how the techniques are used to
     study the brain. Although an understanding of how the technique works may be beneficial,
     it is not required for marks in the top band.

     Candidates may discuss one brain imaging technique in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss more than one brain imaging technique in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Discuss the influence of emotion on one cognitive process.                                 [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     influence of emotion on one cognitive process.

     Responses may focus on any cognitive process that is affected by emotion such as
     intelligence, perception, memory or decision making.

     Appropriate research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Brown and Kulik (1977) study of flashbulb memory
     • LeDoux (1996) theory of the emotional brain
     • Nutt and Lam (2011), Fisher and Craik (1977), Overton (1964) studies of
       state-dependent memory
     • Scherer (2001) study of appraisal theory.

     Discussion may include but is not limited to:
     • degree of empirical support
     • methodological considerations
     • application of findings
     • contrary explanations or findings.

     Candidates may discuss the influence of one emotion or emotion in general in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss different types of influences of emotion
     in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate addresses more than one cognitive process, credit should be given only to
     the first one.

6.   Discuss the influence of culture on behaviour and/or cognition.                             [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     influence of culture on behaviour and/or cognition.

     It is not necessary for candidates to make a distinction between behaviour and cognition.

     Appropriate research may include, but is not limited to:
     • conformity (Bond and Smith, 1996; Kagitcibasi, 1984; Berry, 1967)
     • attachment (Van Ijzendoorn and Kroonenberg, 1988; Sagi et al., 1985)
     • abnormal behaviour (Lin and Kleinman, 1988; Murphy, 1976)
     • addictive behaviour (Raylu and Oei, 2004; Brady, 1995)
     • memory strategies and sociocultural context (Rogoff and Waddel, 1982)
     • stereotypes and memory (Allport and Postman, 1947)
     • social identity's effect on formation of flashbulb memories (Luminet and Curci, 2009)
     • the effects of education on encoding strategies (Cole and Scribner, 1974).

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • the effectiveness of the explanations of how culture influences behaviour/cognition
     • methodological and gender considerations of relevant research
     • empirical support
     • contrary explanations or findings
     • application of empirical findings.

     Candidates may discuss a small number of cultural influences in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of cultural influences in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
