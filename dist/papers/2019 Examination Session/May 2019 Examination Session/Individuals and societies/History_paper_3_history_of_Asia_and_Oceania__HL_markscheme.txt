Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Trade and exchange: The Silk Road in the medieval world (750–1500)

1.   To what extent did the Silk Road enable political and cultural integration in the medieval world?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
     Silk Road enabled political and cultural integration in the medieval world. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of political and cultural integration, or they may emphasize their assessment of one
     more than the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
     refer to the exchange of creative arts and design, products, ideas of astronomy, medicine,
     chemistry, mathematics, religion, languages and literature, as well as the growth of cosmopolitan
     cities, as examples of cultural integration. Examples of political integration may include increased
     trade and dialogue between rulers and religions of Europe and Asia. Political, commercial, and
     religious competition and conflict between kingdoms, markets, and religious groups across Europe
     and Asia, may be referred to as examples of non-integration.


2.   Discuss the causes of the decline of the Silk Road in the 15th century.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of the
     decline in the Silk Road during the 15th century. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must
     be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the efficiency and
     ease of sea transportation of goods facilitated by newly discovered sea routes; the fragmentation
     of the Mongol Empire, which weakened the political, cultural, and economic unity of the Silk Road;
     and the impact of the decaying Byzantine Empire and the Black Death, which allowed for land
     seizures; the consolidation of regional states and decline of nomad power. While other relevant
     factors, for example the continued existence of some Silk Road routes past the 15th century, may
     be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                 –6–                 M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 2: Japan in the Age of the Samurai (1180–1333)

3.   Evaluate the political impact of the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate on Japan.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the Kamakura Shogunate weighing up
     the importance of its establishment on aspects of Japanese government and society. The
     consequences of the its establishment may extend beyond the timeframe but must be clearly
     linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the impacts on the system of
     government, changes in the feudal system and the role and influence of the Emperor. In addition,
     the establishment of internal peace, reforms of the legal system and the beginning of a tradition of
     military rule and samurai influence may be referred to. Both strengths and limitations may be
     referred to but there does not have to be an equal focus on each.


4.   “The expanding role of the samurai had a negative impact on Japanese society and culture.”
     Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the expanding role of the samurai had a negative impact on Japanese society and culture. The
     consequences of the expanded samurai role may extend beyond the timeframe of the question but
     must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the changes that
     occurred in government, and law as well as the level of internal conflict and wars. The celebration
     of the samurai traditions and the links between Buddhism and aspects of samurai culture such as
     discipline and control may also be discussed. Cultural and social changes in theatre and art as well
     as literature and new behavioural patterns and norms may be considered. Economic effects in
     manufacturing, trade and technology may also be referred to. Candidates may agree, partly agree
     or disagree with the statement.
                                                 –7–                 M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 3: Exploration, trade and interaction in East Asia and South-East Asia (1405–1700)

5.   To what extent was the “looking out” policy of China based on economic motives?

     The question requires that the candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     the “looking out” policy of China was not based on economic motives. The reasons for the policy
     may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may refer to the non-economic goals of the policy: expansion of military and diplomatic
     influence, acquisition of scientific and geographic knowledge and the establishment of tributary
     relationships with more states. The role of key individuals such as the Yongle Emperor and official
     Chinese attitudes towards foreign trade may be considered as well as the economic situation of
     China, its existing trade relationships and networks. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
     disagree with the suggestion.


6.   Discuss the impact of the voyages of Vasco da Gama (1498) and Magellan (1519) on South-East
     Asia.

     This question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the voyages of
     Da Gama and Magellan and South-East Asia. The consequences of the voyages may extend
     beyond the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates
     may offer equal coverage of Da Gama and Magellan or they may prioritize their examination of one
     of them. However, both individuals will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
     or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of territorial acquisitions by Europeans,
     destruction of local authorities, enforced subservience of local populations as well as cultural
     changes such as the introduction of Christianity and other European cultural norms, and opposition
     to the spread of Islam. Economic impacts on trade routes, goods production and distribution may
     also be considered. While other relevant interrelationships may be considered, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                 –8–                 M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 4: The rise and fall of the Mughal Empire (1526–1712)

7.   To what extent was military power important to the consolidation of Mughal rule?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     military power was important to the consolidation of Mughal rule. Reasons may predate the
     timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
     the success of leaders such as Barbur, Humayun and Akbar and their military successes in the
     consolidation Mughal rule. Their military power may also be balanced against policies designed to
     gain support such as religious toleration, increases in economic prosperity, diplomatic alliances,
     support for various ethnic groups as well as a dedication to artistic and cultural matters. While
     other relevant factors such as the condition of the states being conquered, may be referred to, the
     bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.

8.   “External factors were the main cause of the decline of the Mughal Empire.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
     Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
     question. Candidates may refer to external invasions and wars with rival states under the rule of
     Aurangzeb, in particular the Maratha Wars. They may also balance external factors against the
     internal problems created by religious tension; lavish spending; increasing financial problems,
     which caused dissent; wars of succession and weak leadership after the death of Aurangzeb.
     Candidates may also consider the impact of increased European presence in the region on the
     power and prestige of the Mughal empire. While other relevant factors, for example, the rise of new
     religious and political ideas may be discussed, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
     raised in the question.
                                                  –9–                  M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 5: Colonialism and the development of nationalism in South-East Asia (c1750–1914)

9.    Evaluate the economic, social and cultural effects of the French colonial system in Indo-China.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the of the French colonial system in
      Indo-China, weighing up the importance or otherwise of its economic, social and cultural effects.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic, social and cultural effects or they may
      emphasize their evaluation of one or two of them. However, all aspects will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
      economic exploitation of Indo-China through, for example, the repatriation of profits, the
      development of infrastructure at the expense of agriculture or the failure to promote manufacturing.
      Social effects could include the promotion of the French language and the impact of missionaries.
      Cultural effects could include colonial architecture, especially in Hanoi, and continued patronage of
      the imperial court in Hue. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does
      not need to be an equal focus on each.


10.   Examine the causes of the Philippine Revolution (1896).

      The question requires candidates to consider the interrelationship between the factors that caused
      the Philippine Revolution (1896). Some causes may predate the timeframe but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the clergy’s opposition to Spanish dominance of the Filipino Catholic
      Church and the dismay at Spanish repression following the Cavite Revolt (1872), during which
      three priests became martyrs. There may be discussion of the role of the Propaganda Movement
      led by Rizal, who campaigned from Europe against Spanish corruption in the Philippines, and the
      failure of the Spanish to reform their colonial government. Candidates may also refer to the
      immediate cause of the revolt which was the discovery by the Spanish of Bonifacio’s 100 000
      strong secret revolutionary society. While other, relevant, interrelationships such as international
      influences may be considered, the bulk of the response will remain on focussed on the events in
      the Philippines.
                                                   – 10 –                M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 6: India, Afghanistan and Burma (1750–1919)

11.   “Religious issues were the main cause of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of 1857.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of the
      Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny). Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to religious issues such as the introduction
      of Christianity, the undermining of Hinduism and the cartridge issue which offended Muslims and
      Hindus. Consideration may be given to political reasons involving expansion of British territory and
      the alienation of native rulers; military reasons such as the effect of the defeat in Afghanistan and
      deteriorating morale in the Bengal Army; economic issues related to taxation and land ownership
      policies as well as British trade policies. While other relevant factors may be referred to, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


12.   Examine the reasons for resistance to British attempts to influence Afghanistan.

      The question requires candidates to consider the interrelationship between the various reasons for
      resistance to British attempts to influence Afghanistan. Some reasons may predate the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to Afghan
      resentment of British support of the Punjab in territorial disputes with Afghanistan; British invasions
      of Afghanistan which sought to control Afghan rulers; British social and cultural practices that
      alienated the Afghans; Russian support and encouragement of Afghan resistance to Britain; the
      Afghan desire for independence, which resulted in further conflicts with Britain up until 1919. While
      other relevant factors, for example, the impact of the First World War, may be referred to, the bulk
      of the response will be on the issue raised in the question.
                                                   – 11 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 7: Challenges to traditional East Asian societies (1700–1868)

13.   Examine the reasons for the rise and fall of the Taiping [Taip’ing] Rebellion.

      The question requires candidates to consider the interrelationship between the reasons why the
      Taiping Rebellion both rose and fell. Candidates may offer equal coverage of rise and fall, or they
      may emphasize their discussion of one of them. However, both aspects will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to economic reasons for the rise, such as high taxation and rents,
      and the impact of the opium trade. They may discuss increased lawlessness, the British humiliation
      of the Qing and Hong Xiuquan’s presentation of Taiping Christianity as an alternative ideology.
      Reasons for the fall could include a divided leadership, the loss of support because of the
      destruction of temples and idols, the unpopularity of the Taiping’s extremist views on the role of the
      sexes and their anti-Confucianism, and their failure to win the support of foreign powers, who
      helped suppress the revolt.


14.   “Commodore Perry’s expedition was the most important reason for the fall of the Tokugawa
      Shogunate.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may refer to the political impact of the expedition and the subsequent unequal treaties
      that caused discontent among the daimyo, and which stoked the succession crisis of 1857 to 1858.
      There may be discussion of the economic consequences of the treaties, such as the arrival of
      cheap imports. In the long term, candidates may argue that the door had been opened to further
      unequal treaties, which prompted the growth of the anti-Western Sonno Joi movement, which
      further weakened the Shogunate. While other relevant factors, for example an unrepresentative,
      stagnant government system, long-term problems arising from over-population and frustration at
      the weakness of the bakufu, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                   – 12 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 8: British colonialism and emerging national identities in Oceania (1788–1919)

15.   “The economic impact of the gold rushes was more significant than their social impact.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of economic and social aspects, or they may emphasize
      their discussion of one over the other. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response.
      Candidates may refer to positive economic effects such as the booming economies of the different
      colonies in Australia—particularly Victoria—and in New Zealand, the significant growth of imports
      and the boost in business investment, which stimulated the market for local produce and
      infrastructure. Negative economic effects were felt in some large city centres, with labour
      shortages and inflation of goods. Social effects may include the significant increase in immigration
      and population growth; feelings of miner discontent, which forged democratic ideals; the
      acceleration of an end to convict transportation to Australia. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement.


16.   To what extent was Gallipoli significant to the political and social development of Australia and
      New Zealand?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      Gallipoli was significant to the political and social development of Australia and New Zealand.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of political and social developments in Australia and New
      Zealand, or they may emphasize their assessment of one more than the other. However, all
      aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to Gallipoli as significant in forging national identity and in beginning the long
      journey to fuller independence, even though these trends had started at the end of the 19th
      century. Both Australian and New Zealander culture and customs were evident on the battlefield
      and these characteristics became a part of the “ANZAC legend”. However, despite heavier losses
      felt elsewhere during the First World War, the notion of the ANZAC spirit and sacrifice came to
      symbolize involvement in the entire war and it continued to influence political and social
      developments well beyond the end of the war.
                                                 – 13 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 9: Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia (1860–1912)

17.   Evaluate the achievements of the Self-Strengthening Movement (1861–1894).

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the achievements of the Self-
      Strengthening Movement (1861–1894), weighing up its strengths and limitations. Achievements
      may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to modernization of the military, including the first modern weapons
      factory, new warships and engineering school; the establishment of a trade agency and a college
      that taught Western subjects, including languages; reform of the customs service and the
      promotion of shipping; coal-mining and cotton production. However, candidates may argue that
      change was limited by divisions at court, conservative resistance to modernization, corruption and
      hostility to the West. Poverty, especially in the countryside, remained deeply entrenched. Western
      exploitation of the Chinese economy continued. Defeat in war by the Japanese in 1895 symbolized
      Chinese weakness. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not
      need to be an equal number of each.


18.   “Japanese military power was the most important reason for Japan’s victory in the Russo–
      Japanese War (1904–1905).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Japanese military power was the most important reason for Japan’s victory in the Russo–Japanese
      War (1904–1905). Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue
      raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the reasons or they may
      emphasize their assessment of one or more of them. Candidates may refer to Japanese military
      reforms, which began in 1870; a new navy was built, and new disciplinary and bushido moral
      codes were introduced. While other relevant factors, for example Russian underestimation of the
      Japanese and their logistical problems, or tactics used during the war, may be referred to, the bulk
      of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement.

Section 10: Nationalism and independence in India (1919–1964)

19.   Examine the long- and short-term causes of the growth of Muslim separatism.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between long- and short-term
      causes of the growth of Muslim separatism. The causes may predate the timeframe but they must
      be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of long-
      and short-term causes or they may emphasize their examination of one over the other. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the historic division
      between Muslims and Hindus; the role of the British government in fanning communal hatred
      through their “divide and rule” policies and the offer of separate electorates to the minority group,
      Muslims, who feared that the Hindu majority would have political power in an independent India.
      The election of 1937 made Muslims fearful that they would have no protection in India. Candidates
      may also refer to the All India Muslim League, the role of Jinnah and other Muslim leaders, and
      militant groups on both sides that inflamed opinion. The result of these tensions was the Lahore
      Resolution in 1940 demanding a Muslim state and also Direct Action Day in 1946. While other
      relevant causes may be considered the bulk of the response will be on those raised in the
      question.


20.   Discuss the importance of the Second World War to the achievement of Indian independence.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      the Second World War in the achievement of Indian independence. The reasons may predate the
      timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to
      the impact of British defeats on their image; British financial and military weaknesses, which limited
      their ability to control India; the role of nationalist leaders who were encouraged by the weak British
      response to the Quit India campaign. Prospects of mutiny in the Indian Army forced Britain to make
      concessions as evidenced by the Cripps Mission. Post-war support for anti-colonialism led by the
      US and the UN, encouraged Britain to grant independence. While other relevant factors, for
      example, the role of individual leaders, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on
      the issue raised in the question.

Section 11: Japan (1912–1990)

21.   Evaluate the impact of the First World War on Japan.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of the First World War on
      Japan, weighing up its importance or otherwise. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to developments during the war, including territorial gains in Manchuria and
      Mongolia, or the impact of the Paris Peace Treaties. There may be evaluation of the economic
      impact of war, which increased industrial output, employment, prices and wages in the short term.
      However, the crash of 1920 showed that adjustment to post-war conditions was proving difficult in
      the face of continuing high prices and an over-valued currency. Candidates may evaluate the
      contribution of economic problems caused by war to the failure of Taisho democracy. They may
      also argue that the ease of victory in the First World War played some part in the rise of Japanese
      militarism.


22.   “Japan’s weakness was the main reason for its defeat in the Pacific War (1941–1945).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may argue that as the Pacific War progressed, numbers of aircraft and air
      crew proved insufficient (kamikaze tactics were hugely wasteful); the military command structure
      was ineffective, and logistical support for the armed forces was inadequate. Candidates may also
      refer to shortages of raw materials, inadequate submarine defences, tactical weaknesses, and the
      burdens of fighting on an increasingly broad front. While other relevant factors, for example the
      productive capacity of the US economy and the success of US “island-hopping” tactics may be
      referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates
      may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.
                                                  – 16 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 12: China and Korea (1910–1950)

23.   Evaluate the role of Mao Zedong’s leadership in the rise of Communism in China to 1935.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of Mao Zedong’s leadership in
      the rise of Communism in China to 1935, weighing up its strengths and limitations. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of Mao’s roles or they may emphasize their evaluation of one or more of
      them. Candidates may refer to Mao’s ideological role as a nationalist who set Marxism in a
      Chinese context, with the peasantry central to the provocation of revolution. There may be
      evaluation of his military role; already a successful commander by 1934 he further enhanced his
      reputation by adopting effective guerrilla tactics during the Long March. Both strengths and
      limitations (such as his poor oratory) must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal focus on each. While other relevant factors, for example Jiang Jieshi’s miscalculations, may
      be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


24.    Discuss the social, political and economic impact of Japanese annexation (1910) on Korea to
      1937.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social,
      political and economic impact of Japanese annexation (1910) on Korea to 1937. The impact may
      extend beyond the timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of social, political and economic impact or they may
      emphasize their discussion of one or two of them. However, all aspects will be a feature of the
      response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of
      land reform, which simplified the ownership of land but also handed much if it to the Japanese, and
      the development of industrialization. They may discuss the impact of mandatory worship of Shinto
      and the influx of western ideas in Korea. Discussion of political impact may focus on the rule of the
      Japanese Governor-General, who clamped down severely and effectively on resistance to
      Japanese rule in 1931. They may also include a discussion of the setting up of a Provisional
      Government in Exile, based in China, which gave formidable impetus to opposition by
      orchestrating resistance.

Section 13: Impact of the world wars on South-East Asia

25.   “The First World War had a limited impact on the independence movement in Vietnam.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      The effects may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
      the question. Candidates may refer to the weakening of French colonial power in Indo-China, as a
      result of the First World War. The nationalist movement, fuelled by Ho Chi Minh’s experiences at
      the Paris Peace Conference, called for independence from the French and was influenced by
      Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points and the concept of self-determination. Other groups and
      leaders, such as Phan Boi Chau also emerged during the 1920s and 1930s. Nationalist groups
      linked to the Guomindang in China as well as various communist groups also existed. The French
      colonial government brutally repressed all opposition. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement.


26.   Compare and contrast the emergence and influence of Sukarno and Tunku Abdul Rahman as
      nationalist leaders.

      The question requires candidates to give an account of the similarities and differences between the
      emergence and influence of Sukarno and Tunku Abdul Rahman as nationalist leaders in their
      respective countries, referring to both leaders throughout. Candidates may contextualize the
      situation in each country and note that there were different colonial rulers. Candidates may adopt a
      chronological approach and they may identify the similarities and differences separately.
      Alternatively, candidates may consider a thematic approach and refer to both in areas such as
      nationalist ideals espoused by the leaders in response to colonial rule and their key leadership
      roles in independence movements, along with their ability to forge unity amongst their people. The
      world wars and the impact of the Japanese occupation may also be considered, along with the
      post-Second World War period leading to independence. These may not all be covered or covered
      equally. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated, but there does not need to be
      an equal number of each.
                                                  – 18 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 14: The People’s Republic of China (1949–2005)

27.   Evaluate the impact of domestic policies on social developments in the People’s Republic of China
      under Mao Zedong.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of domestic policies on
      social developments in the People’s Republic of China under Mao Zedong. Impacts of the policies
      may extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the impact of social reforms on women, such as the Marriage
      Law of 1950 and the legalization of divorce. Women were also liberated and empowered by the
      banning of old regime practices and the codification of gender equality through universal suffrage
      and equal rights. Although, many of these policies had little impact on women in traditional rural
      areas or in the political sphere. However, candidates may refer to the way the Great Leap Forward
      worsened the social conditions of the rural population through the pursuit of unrealistic targets for
      economic development. Despite raising literacy rates, Mao’s Cultural Revolution was disastrous for
      the education system and undermined the family unit. Healthcare policies that focused on
      preventative care and the establishment of “Barefoot Doctors” during the Cultural Revolution
      improved life expectancy.


28.   “Desire for political reform was the most important reason for the events in Tiananmen Square in
      1989.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the desire for democratic reform and the wish to counter
      corruption in government, highlighted by student movements; the actions of intellectuals and labour
      activists in Beijing in April 1989, which led to the events in June. These protests led to an
      increased call for far more radical social reform from many facets of society across the People’s
      Republic of China. Candidates may also argue that the Four Modernisations had not addressed all
      of China’s problems and in many ways had created a more divisive society. Other reasons were
      the failing economy, which had caused mass unemployment, internal migration, crime and worker
      insecurity. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 15: Cold War conflicts in Asia

29.   “Ideology was the most important cause of the Vietnam War (1956–1975).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the growing popularity of Ho Chi Minh’s Chinese-style
      communism, which he had developed during his many years in France and the USSR. They may
      also identify the ideological context of the Cold War as a cause. The US, alarmed at Mao Zedong’s
      victory in China, became committed to the policy of containment fearing the spread of communism
      in the region. The USSR and the People’s Republic of China were keen to support other
      communist regimes. Ho, who wished to reunite his country, was also a nationalist and wanted to
      unify Vietnam. While other relevant factors, for example the perception of US weakness and
      strategic factors, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.


30.   Discuss the reasons for the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the reasons for the
      withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the reasons for the withdrawal of Soviet troops in
      1989. Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the reasons for the Soviet invasion and the
      reasons for withdrawal, or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them. However, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the Soviet desire to cement the
      communist seizure of power in 1978, which had been endangered by Amin’s radicalism. Russians
      had a long-term fear of Afghan instability, which might unsettle the Islamic majority in neighbouring
      Russian states such as Turkmenistan. Candidates may discuss the impossibility of defeating the
      Mujahideen who sheltered in Pakistan and received massive amounts of Saudi and American aid,
      and may also discuss the context of Gorbachev’s revolutionary approach to international relations,
      which led him to détente with the West.

Section 16: Developments and challenges in South Asia after 1947.

31.   To what extent can Nehru’s foreign policy be considered successful?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of Nehru’s foreign policy.
      Outcomes may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to Nehru’s policies.
      Candidates may refer to Nehru’s success in maintaining India’s place in the Commonwealth, his
      creation of the non-aligned movement and his work in the UN to support decolonization and peace.
      Nehru balanced the two sides in the Cold War and gained considerable aid for India, his support of
      a nuclear policy increased India’s independence and world role. Failure to avoid conflict with China
      and Pakistan may be seen as weaknesses. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the suggestion.


32.   “Economic issues were the main cause of the Sinhalese–Tamil conflict.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Causes may predate the timeframe but must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to Sinhalese resentment of Tamil commercial success, which led to policies
      to restrict Tamil property holdings and employment and access to the professions. Increased
      Sinhalese nationalism led to limits on Tamil civil and religious rights and removal from government
      and educational institutions. Tamils sought greater independence and autonomy, which led to
      conflict with the Sinhalese majority. The Sinhalese view of Tamils as outsiders was another source
      of conflict. While other factors may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue
      raised in the question.
                                                   – 21 –               M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/OC/M


Section 17: Developments in Oceania after the Second World War (1945–2005)

33.   Examine the reasons why Australian foreign policy developed an increasingly Asian focus after the
      Second World War.

      The question requires candidates to consider the interrelationship between the reasons why
      Australian foreign policy developed an increasingly Asian focus after the Second World War.
      Reasons may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may refer to the change of direction towards Asia in foreign policy in
      successive post-war governments, as a result of the outcomes of the Second World War and onset
      of the Cold War, which saw a shift away from Britain and towards the US. This involved the need to
      establish economic links with Japan due to its rising power, through trade and foreign diplomacy
      methods. Australia signed the ANZUS treaty in 1951 in the context of the Cold War and Korean
      War as it sought to confirm its allies to secure a regional power balance in the region. Candidates
      may also refer to the Colombo Plan and other ties with Asian nations during this period.


34.   “Changing attitudes between 1945 and 2005 led to policies that were more beneficial for indigenous
      people in Australia.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      Candidates may refer to the “assimilation” policies of the early part of this timeframe that led to an
      increase in expenditure on health, housing, education and training programmes and a subsequent
      halt to population decline in some regions. The social changes of the 1960s saw concerted efforts
      to review and repeal restrictive and discriminatory legislation; universal suffrage, access to social
      security and constitutional amendments were some benefits. Later decades have seen policies
      focused on “self-management” and the establishment of government support programmes to
      support the development of Australian Aboriginal people and to provide a base for Australian
      Aboriginal economic self-sufficiency. Despite changing attitudes and improved benefits, problems
      remained in many areas. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 18: Social, cultural and economic developments in Asia (excluding China, Japan
     and India (1980–2005)

35.   Discuss the causes of immigration in one country and emigration in one other country of the region
      (excluding China, Japan and India) during the period from 1980 to 2005.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the causes of
      immigration in one country and emigration in one other country (excluding China, Japan and India)
      during the period from 1980 to 2005. The processes of immigration and emigration need not have
      occurred at the same time. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to
      the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries or they
      may emphasize their discussion of migration in one over the other. However, all aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the growth in emigration within Asia since the
      1990s, particularly from less-developed countries with massive labour surpluses to fast-growing,
      newly industrializing countries, either internally within Asia, or externally. Migrants emigrated
      towards the Gulf region after oil prices surged and there was movement of highly skilled workers,
      student mobility and refugees as a result of conflict. Mobility of professionals, executives,
      technicians, and other highly skilled personnel has grown in the last 30 years.


36.   Discuss the emergence of, and responses to, terrorism in two Asian countries (excluding China,
      Japan and India).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      terrorism emerged in two Asian countries (excluding China, Japan and India) and the responses
      made. The acts of terrorism need not have occurred at the same time. Reasons may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of countries, or they may prioritize their discussion of one over the other. However,
      all aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to counterterrorism being a
      matter of policy priority since the 9/11 and Bali Bombing attacks. Reasons for the emergence of
      terrorism may include political instability and porous borders in several Asian countries. Responses
      may include support from Western nations to combat terrorist threats, and direct confrontation,
      which may have resulted in ceasefire agreements between government and terrorist groups.
