Answer one question from this section.

1.   Las Migas

     Carolina plans to set up a bakery, Las Migas, in a small town. Competition from established
     bakeries is strong. Carolina has asked for a bank loan because her personal savings are
     insufficient. The bank manager requested the following information:
     yy a business plan
     yy a cash flow forecast for the first four months of operations.

     Carolina has no experience with financial forecasts but she estimated the figures for Las Migas for
     the first four months of operations. These figures are shown in Table 1.

2.   Enjuice

     Enjuice produces canned juices. The market for canned juices is very competitive. Each
     can is sold at $8. Enjuice’s profit margins are falling. The marketing manager has conducted
     primary market research and suggested increasing advertising to increase sales. In 2018
     Enjuice sold 360 000 cans.

                                                Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   JP

     JP produces electric guitars. It is a cooperative owned by a committed workforce who share in
     the management and success (or failure) of the company and its profits. Workers enjoy having
     control over the workplace and are productive. However, JP’s continued success is threatened by
     insufficient finance, which prevents them from spending more on traditional promotional methods.

     JP’s guitars are expensive relative to the competition but are known for their quality. Its customers
     are very brand loyal. The use of social media marketing by many famous musicians influences JP’s
     brand loyalty and awareness. Unfortunately for JP, one especially famous musician using a JP
     guitar on social media recently received negative publicity about his private life.

     JP follows strict quality procedures that include quality circles. JP’s management believe that
     teams of workers employed on the production line know the production process best and are in the
     best position to make any necessary improvements. Staff turnover at JP is very low.

     XYZ, a large company known for its kitchen appliances, is considering moving into the musical
     instrument market as part of a growth strategy – they want the high gross profit margins on guitars
     (compared to the low profit margins on kitchen appliances). XYZ wants to take over JP. XYZ has a
     strong balance sheet and large cash reserves and is an expert at marketing.

     The cooperative has refused to consider the takeover bid from XYZ. The cooperative has argued
     that the culture of XYZ is too different to JP’s. XYZ’s management are viewed as too controlling.
     However, increased price competition has led to falling sales, forcing JP to make redundancies.
     Some cooperative members argue that unless JP accepts XYZ’s bid, additional jobs will be lost.

                               [Source: © International Baccalaureate Organization 2019]



     (a)   Define the term cooperative.                                                               [2]

     (b)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of social media marketing on JP’s
           promotional strategy.                                                                      [4]

     (c)   Explain two benefits to JP of using quality circles.                                       [4]

     (d)   Discuss whether JP should accept XYZ’s takeover bid.                                      [10]

4.   The Warriors

     The Warriors are a soccer* club who perform well but have not won any trophies. Recently,
     The Warriors have had above average turnover of managers, increasing time spent on recruitment.
     Player turnover has also been higher than that of other clubs.

     Dave Atkinson, owner and former player, is an autocratic leader who denies blame for the high
     manager and player turnover. He publicly criticizes players. However, fans adore Dave. He was a
     successful player, supports the fans and is committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR). He
     has:
     yy reduced ticket prices to the lowest in the league
     yy provided free, healthy snacks for junior supporters
     yy donated 20 % of The Warriors’ profits to local schools to encourage young people to play sport.

     After a recent poor performance, Dave demanded that all players donate 50 % of their pay for
     that match to good causes. Two new players used social media to complain. In response, Dave
     threatened to cancel their contracts. The other players refused to turn up for training to show
     solidarity. Dave then locked the players out of the stadium.

     This controversy comes at a critical time for The Warriors. With a dynamic new manager, they have
     their first chance to win an important final and with it significant financial gain, which is needed to
     support corporate social responsibility (CSR) and upgrade spectator facilities. On social media, the
     fans have asked Dave not to enforce the lock-out.

     Dave wants to resolve the conflict and privately regrets the lock-out. He is angry with the team but
     wants to increase The Warriors’ corporate social responsibility (CSR). Without wishing to appear
     as a weak leader, he asked another popular former player for advice.

     (b)   Explain one cost and one benefit of a high labour turnover of managers for

5.   Copper Health (CH)

     Copper Health (CH) was the market leader in the production of anti-venom* vaccines to treat
     poisonous snake bites. CH’s mission – influenced heavily by corporate social responsibility (CSR)
     – is to put customers first and profits second in the treatment of snake bites.

     Despite 100 000 deaths worldwide each year from snake bites and 400 000 serious injuries, CH
     recently announced that it will no longer produce anti-venom vaccines. Several large Mexican,
     Brazilian and Indian pharmaceutical companies have entered the market selling anti-venom
     vaccines at a much lower price than CH.

     A spokesperson for CH said: “We will remain a private limited company where corporate social
     responsibility (CSR) remains an important driving force for our mission. Our medical research is
     only financed from retained profit. When the lower-priced competition arrived, our sales and profits
     of anti-venom vaccines decreased significantly. Treating snakebites no longer makes financial
     sense. Instead, the technology used to produce anti-venom vaccines will be used to research and
     develop (R&D) other life-saving vaccines”.

     A non-governmental organization (NGO) has demanded action. “CH is the largest manufacturer
     of anti-venom vaccines in the world. Although CH’s competitors are increasing their production of
     anti-venom vaccines they will not be able to produce enough to satisfy demand for the next two
     years. There will be a major shortage. This will result in many life-threatening injuries and deaths.”

     The non-governmental organization (NGO) has urged CH to seek new sources of finance to
     continue the production of the anti-venom vaccine.
