Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source A, were the consequences of the struggle between Temujin
           [Genghis] and Togrul?                                                                     [3]

           •   Togrul was defeated in 1203.
           •   Genghis seized control of Togrul’s territory and people.
           •   The Ongguts chose to side with Genghis Khan.
           •   The Naiman were left isolated.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source D suggest about the power of Genghis Khan by 1207?                       [2]

           • Genghis expanded his territorial power.
           • Genghis conquered several tribes.
           • Genghis’s power had not yet reached its peak.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

2.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source C
     for an historian studying the rise to power of Genghis Khan.                                     [4]

     Value:
     • It was written soon after the death of Genghis and is therefore virtually contemporary.
     • It was probably written by an eyewitness to Genghis’s rise to power.
     • It provides details of Genghis’s methods, for example his use of a council and/or his military
       strategies.

     Limitations:
     • As it is likely written by a fellow Borjigid, it may seek to magnify the achievements of the clan.
     • The source reveals little of Genghis’s actions.
     • It is a general account of the Borjigids, as such information on Genghis’s rise to power may be
       limited.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
     are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
     supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
     be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

3.   Compare and contrast what Sources B and C reveal about Genghis Khan’s [Temujin’s] fight
     with the Naiman in 1204.                                                                          [6]

       5–6     • The response includes clear and valid points of comparison and of contrast.
       3–4     • The response includes some valid points of comparison and/or of contrast,
                  although these points may lack clarity.
        1–2    • The response consists of description of the content of the source(s), and/or general
                  comments about the source(s), rather than valid points of comparison or of
                  contrast.
         0     • The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and award
     credit wherever it is possible to do so. The following material is an indication of what candidates
     may elect to write about in their responses. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set
     answer is required.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources suggest that the Naiman were a rival tribal group.
     • Both sources agree that the Naiman had a numerically superior fighting force.
     • Both sources reveal that the Mongols used deception as a strategy.

     Contrasts:
     • Source B suggests that Genghis’s attack on the Naiman was due to his ambition whereas
       Source C suggests that it was a response to the Naiman’s actions.
     • From Source B it can be inferred that Genghis Khan alone decided to attack the Naiman
       whereas Source C suggests that he consulted a council that was divided on the decision to
       attack.
     • Source C describes the role of Dodai-cherbi in developing the strategy for the battle whereas
       Source B suggests that Genghis planned the attack himself.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree that Genghis Khan
     rose to power because of his military strength?                                                      [9]

     candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

     Indicative content

     Source A             Military strength was significant, as evidenced by the defeat of the Keraits,
                          which facilitated Genghis’s expansion. However, the Naiman were defeated
                          not because of military strength but by strategic cunning and the Onggut’s
                          betrayal of the Naiman.

     Source B             Military factors may be argued to have been most significant. For example,
                          tactics to defeat the Naiman/Merkit, as well as the surprise attack on the
                          Keraits contributed to his rise. However, pre-existing Kerait weaknesses
                          partially facilitated Genghis’s success against them.
                                        –7–                   M19/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Source C        In addition to the military strength of Genghis, his willingness to strategize and
                listen to the views of his commander Dodai-cherbi facilitated his victory over
                the Naiman.

Source D        It is evident that Genghis Khan expanded the empire substantially. Initially this
                was done by taking the lands of neighbouring tribes but after 1207, the
                expansion became more ambitious and led to the seizure of lands from
                dynasties, khanates and empires that were further afield. Candidates may
                infer from this that Genghis Khan’s military abilities increased as he became
                more experienced.

Own knowledge   When discussing the importance of military factors, the significance of the
                defeat of Togrul may be further developed. There may also be coverage of the
                significance of the defeat of the Tatars in 1202.

                Other factors candidates consider may include the possible betrayal of
                Jamuka, the Mongol belief that a great leader would emerge at the end of the
                11th/beginning of the 12th century and the willingness to support Genghis as
                he appeared to fulfil this role.

                Also, the personality of Genghis and his reputation as a just and generous
                ruler may be considered. Events before 1200 may be referred to, as Genghis
                had already been made a khan. He was also able to win support from those
                who questioned the traditional tribal hierarchy or disliked the claims of clan.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

5.   (a)   What, according to Source F, were the consequences for the Moors of the war and conquest
           of Granada?                                                                           [3]

           •   The Moors lost fortresses and weapons.
           •   The Moors kept their religion, properties and other privileges.
           •   Important Moorish citizens became hostages of the Christians.
           •   The Moors lost the city of Granada.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


     (b)   What does Source G suggest about the conquest of Granada?                                 [2]

           • The conquest allowed for the expansion of Christianity.
           • The conquest involved a diverse group of people.
           • The monarchs played a leading role.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
     relevant point up to a maximum of [2].

6.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source F for
     an historian studying the Christian war against Granada.                                           [4]

     Value:
     • It is a first-hand account of the Christian siege and conquering of Granada.
     • It was written to provide an official record of events.
     • It outlines the performance of the Christians against the Muslims and reveals the problems
       facing the people of Granada.

     Limitations:
     • It is a Christian perspective on the events in Granada.
     • An official chronicle, it may offer a sympathetic account of the event.
     • It is a chronicle of the Castilian kings and may not offer an in-depth account of the war against
       Granada.

     The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
     are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as supporting
     evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must be at least
     one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

     Comparisons:
     • Both sources suggest that religion played a role in the war.
     • Both sources state that there were economic motives to go to war.

     Contrasts:
     • Source E states that raids in search of booty enriched both sides (Christians and Muslims)
       whereas Source H focuses only on the benefits obtained by the Christians.
     • Source E suggests that Christians and Muslims were enslaved as a consequence of the war
       whereas Source H considers the possibility of conversion to retain social standing and worth.
     • Source E focuses on the struggle between Christian and Muslim societies whereas Source H
       suggests that the war led to internal rivalries between Old Christians and converted Jews and
       Muslims.
     • Source E focuses on the attempts of rulers to bolster their wealth whereas Source H refers to
       the attempts of a new and ambitious class who wish to increase their own fortunes by war.

     Indicative content

     Source E             Focuses on other motivations, discussing the political and economic
                          significance of Granada, which suggests that there were strong motivations for
                          the Christians to expand their interests into the region.

     Source F             Describes the internal difficulties faced by the king and the population of
                          Granada who, after a long siege and without supplies, surrendered the city to
                          the Christians. It suggests there were riots and different opinions within the
                          Muslim side because of the king´s decision to capitulate.

     Source G             Suggests that there were weaknesses within Muslim society as there are
                          Moors present in the Spaniards’ camp. However, it also shows that there were
                          diverse elements of society, for example, religious and military groups, who
                          were interested in the fall of Granada.

     Source H             States that the Castilian expansion over the south attracted aggressive
                          elements from Christian society in search of wealth and prestige. It also
                          considers that the desertion from Islam of former leaders increased the
                          difficulties faced by Muslims.

Own knowledge   Considering the situation in Granada, candidates may offer further analysis on
                the internal struggles affecting the kingdom, for example the fight between
                Abu Abdallah and al-Zagal, the struggle for the succession to the throne, and
                the vassalage to Castile that weakened its economy. Candidates may also
                refer to the complex relationship between Granada and African rulers that
                made it difficult for Abu Abdallah to obtain military support.

                To challenge the question, other factors may be considered, such as the
                importance of the Catholic kings’ policies in achieving a united front against
                the Muslim rulers. Candidates may also consider the contributions of troops,
                funds, loans and artillery made by Castile and Aragon for the war, and the
                continuous seasonal campaigns that, between 1482 and 1492, allowed for the
                conquest of Ronda, Malaga, Baza and Almeria. Candidates may also discuss
                the pillaging carried out in frontier lands that debilitated Granada and reduced
                its supplies.

candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

9.   (a)   What, according to Source I, were the conclusions reported to the British government
           regarding the March 1935 meeting in Berlin?                                               [3]

           •   Greater agreement with Germany had not been achieved.
           •   Anglo-German relations were more complex and difficult than they seemed.
           •   Germany was grateful for Britain’s loyalty.
           •   Cooperation with Germany was the best course of action.

10.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source I
      for an historian studying the international response to German aggression.                          [4]

      Value:
      • It is an official record of the meeting, produced to inform the British Cabinet.
      • It offers first-hand information about the discussions between British and German authorities
        during the meeting.
      • It reveals that the British government was disappointed about the limited progress of
        negotiations with Germany.

      Limitations:
      • Focused on the 1935 meeting, it offers limited information on how Britain planned to respond to
        Germany´s policy in the future.
      • It is centred exclusively on Anglo-German relations.
      • It offers only a British perspective on the events at the meeting.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

        consent.
      • Both sources state that Britain was interested in reaching a naval agreement with Germany.
      • Both sources consider that attitudes led to German foreign policy being successful / challenging
        Versailles.
      • Both suggest a united response did not last and/or was weak.

      Contrasts:
      • Source K states that Britain and France accepted German rearmament whereas Source L
        states that Britain’s initial reaction was of displeasure.
      • Source K suggests that the international response in 1935 was cohesive whereas Source L
        mentions the negative impact of German foreign policy on Anglo-French relations.

     Indicative content

     Source I             Although Anglo-German negotiations were held, agreement was limited since
                          issues were complex. Hitler states he had received British support in some
                          foreign policy issues, which indicates an ambiguous British reaction to
                          German aggression.

     Source J             The British response to German rearmament was hesitant.

     Source K             Conciliatory approaches to Hitler contributed to further acts of aggression. The
                          Stresa Front was a short-lived attempt to contain Hitler that ends with Britain’s
                          decision to enter the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. The reaction of Italy,
                          France and Britain towards German foreign policy is seen as “meek”.

     Source L             The deterioration of Anglo-French relations is attributed to Britain’s response
                          to German aggression. The signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement
                          launched German naval expansion.

Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss the failure of British negotiations to return Germany
                to the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference and the
                international response to Germany’s reintroduction of conscription,
                rearmament and the development of the Luftwaffe. They may offer further
                analysis on how the Anglo- German Naval Agreement, by allowing Germany
                to break the Treaty of Versailles on the rearmament question, encouraged
                Hitler to further challenge it. They may offer further details on the international
                response to events in Austria in 1934 and argue there was some initial attempt
                to check German expansion at the time. Candidates may assess the impact of
                the collapse of Stresa and the changing nature of relations between Italy and
                Germany to assess their effects on German foreign policy up to 1938. They
                may also assess the effects of the lack of international response to the
                invasion of the Rhineland (1936). They may discuss the role of international
                powers in the Anschluss (1938), the Czech crisis leading to the Munich
                Conference and the occupation of the Sudetenland (1938) to, for example,
                gauge the effectiveness of the policy of Appeasement up to 1938.

13.   (a)   Why, according to Source M, did Robert Sobukwe oppose working against apartheid with
            European (white) people?                                                             [3]

            •   The Europeans were a foreign and/or minority group in control.
            •   The Europeans exploited Africans and/or took their land.
            •   Africans should organize themselves.
            •   Multi-racialism would facilitate European “prejudice and arrogance” and/or Europeans
                perceived Africans as “backward and savage”.

      Source O for an historian studying the anti-apartheid movement?                                     [4]

      Value:
      • The source was written by someone who had lived in South Africa and who had direct
        experience of working with the anti-apartheid movement.
      • The source explains Bernstein’s role in the struggle against apartheid and fosters an
        understanding of how the anti-apartheid movement operated.
      • This source outlines the nature and/or challenges of the anti-apartheid struggle.
      • Written in 2002, the source can examine Bernstein’s role in a broader context.

      Limitations:
      • Sampson’s support for the anti-apartheid movement may affect his views.
      • As an obituary, the source may provide a sympathetic portrait of Bernstein and/or may
        overemphasize Bernstein’s contribution.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the source. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

      Comparisons:
      • Both sources recognize the important role of Lionel Bernstein.
      • Both sources refer to multi-racial support.
      • Both sources indicate that some black leaders welcomed co-operation with non-Africans in the
        struggle against apartheid.
      • Both sources recognize the important role of white supporters in drafting the Freedom Charter.

      Contrasts:
      • Source O gives the impression of untroubled co-operation between white revolutionaries and
        the black liberation movement whereas Source P indicates that some black leaders resented
        and opposed such multi-racialism.
      • Source O suggests Bernstein’s role fostered democracy whereas Source P views his role as
        controlling and manipulative.

      the struggle against apartheid represented a clash between black and white South Africans.    [9]

      Indicative content

      Source M             There was clear hostility towards any white participation in the anti-apartheid
                           struggle. The source identifies white South Africans as enemies of the black
                           people. Thus, Sobukwe is totally opposed to any cooperation with the whites
                           whom he regards as responsible for the doctrine of white supremacy.

      Source N             The number of white faces in the photograph suggests that it is too simplistic
                           to see the struggle against apartheid as a clash between black and white
                           South Africans.

      Source O             Some white revolutionaries played a central role in the anti-apartheid struggle.
                           This source, in particular, emphasizes the contribution of Lionel Bernstein.
                           For example, his crucial role in drafting the ANC Freedom Charter, his co-
                           operation with black leaders, and his resignation from a well-paid professional
                           career so as to devote himself fully to the fight to end apartheid.

Source P        While some black members of the ANC Youth League saw no place for whites
                or coloureds or Indians in the anti-apartheid struggle, others, like Mandela,
                valued co-operation with white South Africans. Consequently, opposition to
                apartheid was multi-racial. Further, the source refers to the contribution of a
                group of white left-wingers, including Lionel Bernstein, to the writing of the
                Freedom Charter.

Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss the role of significant non-black individuals, such as
                Father Trevor Huddleston, an English priest who opposed the Group Areas
                Act, 1950 and later published the book “Naught for Your Comfort”, which told
                of his experiences in Sophiatown. This book did much to encourage anti-
                apartheid activism in Britain. Candidates may also discuss the role of Yusug
                Dadoo, an Indian participant in the anti-apartheid struggle. Some white women
                also played an important role; in 1955, a group of white women founded the
                Black Sash organization to fight against the South African government’s plans
                to withdraw voting rights from coloureds. In 1956 the Federation of South
                African Women held a huge demonstration in Pretoria against apartheid in
                general and against the Pass Laws in particular. The president of this
                organization was a black woman Lilian Ngoyi, and its secretary was a white
                woman Helen Joseph.

                On the other hand, in 1959 the Pan-African Congress led by Robert Sobukwe
                broke away from the ANC partly because it objected to the ANC’s multi-racial
                composition.

candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

17.   (a)   Why, according to Source Q, did the Hutu masses respond to Hutu propaganda?               [3]

            •   The Hutu masses feared that the RPF would return power to the Tutsis.
            •   Hutu farmers were afraid of losing their land to the Tutsis if the RPF prevailed.
            •   Radios spread a message of fear across Rwanda.
            •   Hutus feared the return of feudalism and/or increased oppression.

      It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and no set answer is required. Award [1] for each
      relevant point up to a maximum of [3].


      (b)   What does Source T suggest about the role of radio in the Rwandan genocide?               [2]

       •    Radio was an important means of communication.
       •    Radio broadcasts reinforced ethnic hatred and/or incited murder.
       •    Radio broadcasts influenced young people.

18.   With reference to its origin, purpose and content, analyse the value and limitations of Source S
      for an historian studying the role of the media in the Rwandan genocide.                         [4]

      Value:
      • The source is an academic essay and/or the author is an anthropologist.
      • Produced in 2007, the source is the result of an interview with a confessed perpetrator.
      • The source offers a first-hand account of the role of the radio in inciting the genocide.

      Limitations:
      • The information provided by the perpetrator is not always consistent and/or detailed.
      • The perpetrator is trying to justify his actions.
      • The source provides only a single person’s perspective on the role of the radio.

      The focus of the question is on the value and limitations of the question. If only value or limitations
      are discussed, award a maximum of [2]. Origins, purpose and content should be used as
      supporting evidence to make relevant comments on the values and limitations. For [4] there must
      be at least one reference to each of them in either the values or the limitations.

        radio merely reported killings.
      • Source R suggests that the masses responded to radio callings for Tutsi extermination whereas
        Source S proposes that mass involvement in genocide also resulted from submission to
        soldiers’ authority.
      • Source R claims that radio had a broad reach in Rwanda whereas the perpetrator in Source S
        first claims that peasants did not own radios.
      • Source S suggests the role of the leadership was important whereas Source R highlights the
        fear of armed insurrection in inciting genocide.

      candidates are not required to refer to all four sources in their responses.

      Indicative content

      Source Q             RTLM had a role in inciting violence against Tutsis, which promoted fear of a
                           return of feudalism and oppression for the Hutus. Radio was able to reach
                           peasants across Rwanda. Candidates may argue that illiteracy contributed to
                           the effectiveness of the media message.

      Source R             Radio was a mass communication tool that was used to promote ethnic
                           stereotyping and incite killings during the genocide. Radio was also the
                           medium with the broadest reach in Rwanda.

      Source S             The author implies that radio had a significant role in inducing ordinary
                           Rwandans into genocidal action. The perpetrator denies that masses could
                           have been mobilized by messages proposed by media, and instead
                           suggests that ordinary Hutu Rwandans were bound to follow orders that
                           came from the leadership.

Source T        Radio broadcasts incited violence against the Tutsis. However, whether the
                message transmitted was carried out cannot be inferred from the source.

Own knowledge   Candidates may discuss the contribution of long term factors, for example the
                role of the colonial legacy in inspiring ethnic divisions and rivalries;
                demographic growth leading to competition for resources and other economic
                reasons; unequal opportunities for social mobility and illiteracy. Candidates
                may also refer to further reinforcement and manipulation of ethnic divisions by
                Hutu administrations, including the drafting of the Hutu Ten Commandments
                and the issuing of identity cards. The effects of the Rwandan Civil War could
                also be considered, including the formation of the RPF. Finally, candidates
                could refer to the use of other strategies that helped implement the genocide,
                including the effectiveness of the Interahamwe in organizing Rwandan Hutus;
                or the role of other media sources, for example Kangura magazine and Radio
                Rwanda.
