IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR EXAMINERS

   •    These marking notes are intended for guidance only and should not be treated as a
        checklist. Examiners should ensure that alternative responses that meet the demands of
        the question are credited accordingly.

   •    Examiners are reminded to accept cultural / geographical differences in terminology (eg
        quavers / eighth notes).

   •    Each question is worth [20 marks].

                                               Section A
This criterion concerns the candidate’s ability to:
• question 1 or question 2 – analyse and examine essential musical elements (including form and
   structure) within one of the two prescribed works
• question 3 (HL only) – compare and contrast the two prescribed works, emphasizing the presence of
   any significant musical links.

1.   Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach
     Examine the relationships between the violin and the other concertino instruments in the second
     movement of Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     Examiners should note that the question here refers to the roles of the violin and the concertino
     instruments only, and not to any relationships between the violin and the basso continuo. While it
     may be necessary to refer to the continuo part in passing (as below), candidates who explore more
     detailed relationships between the violin and this part are probably digressing. –Examiners should
     use their individual judgement to decide on the relevance of the candidate’s response to the
     question.

     There are various possible angles from which to approach this question. Candidates may:

     -     examine the violin’s role in the introduction and development of thematic material. For
           example, as the leading voice in the quasi-canonic process with which the movement begins,
           the violin is responsible for introducing the opening melodic phrase (1–3) in its solo and then,
           as the first comes voice, for stating the series of short “sighing” motifs that assume such
           prominence later on (3.3–4.1). Later, as the violin again assumes a dux role in the imitative
           process at b. 24, the violin is also responsible for introducing the altered, C major version of the
           opening theme. Other approaches to the question involving further musical elements (eg
           rhythm or harmony) may be possible, though examiners will need to consider whether the
           examples given specifically illustrate the role of the violin or might equally be applied to the
           other concertino instruments.

     -     consider the various types of textural relationships between the violin and the other concertino
           instruments in terms of the number of instruments playing (excluding continuo), the violin’s role
           within them, and whether the relationship is a more contrapuntal one (rhythmically diverse) or
           more homophonic (rhythmically parallel). In addition, the indications of other instruments
           involved give some indications of the varying timbral combinations involved, which are also an
           important feature in achieving variety. The summary below is included for the sake of
           convenience and is not intended to suggest that candidates’ responses should necessarily
           adopt this format.

2.   Dances of Galánta by Zoltán Kodály
     Examine how Kodály varies the treatment of repeated material in Dances of Galánta.

     The answers should refer to the prescribed work.

     Answers should address the question and be consistent and convincing in their display of musical
     understanding. Evidence should be located by using bar(s)/measure(s), rehearsal number(s),
     and/or instrument(s) in the works/extracts. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     [NB: Rehearsal marks are used as given in the score, ie without compensating the error.]

     Dances of Galánta treats repeated material through changes in:
     • texture [solo/tutti]
     • timbre [orchestration/sonority]
     • accompaniments
     • tempo
     • development [canon, imitation and rhythm]
     • register and key.

     A: Lento (Bars 1–49)
     • Bars 1–5 – cellos play first theme.
     • Bars 10–14 – theme repeats as horn solo perfect 4th higher.
     • Both the presentations of the theme are decorated with the demisemiquaver flourishes which
        also repeat differently as interjections from bar 20.
     • Bars 19–35 – theme repeats on solo oboe doubled by solo flute, then solo bassoon and violas,
        and finally on violins I and II in octaves (b. 27) with chordal homophony.
     • Bar 37 – clarinet I plays the theme with violin and flute flourishes, poco stringendo.

     B: Andante maestoso (bars 50–93)
     • Bar 50 – solo clarinet plays principal theme.
     • Strings play homophonic and syncopated harmonic passage with horn pedal note on E.
     • Bar 66 – principal theme in strings doubled by flutes and clarinets with open 5ths underpinning
        in cellos, basses and bassoons and harmony in horns.
     • The 16-bar phrase from bar 66 repeats over different harmony [cf. bars 50–65 and 65–82].
     • Bar 82 – second part of principal theme in violas and cellos with bassoons and clarinets, with
        homophonic accompaniment.

     C: Lento – poco a poco accel. – allegretto moderato (Bars 94 (95)–172)
     • New theme on solo flute with light pizzicato off-beat accompaniment on strings.
     • From bar 109 the consequent of the theme is played by clarinets and first violins doubled by
        violas.
     • The consequent is repeated by solo flute at bar 113.
     • Bar 119–134: timpani and then triangle add colour.
     • Bar 123 has the theme in woodwinds only, in parallel fourths with piccolo.
     • Strings (arco) present the consequent again appassionato from bar 134 with clarinets creating a
        distinct sonority. Immediate contrast is achieved in flute/piccolo and oboes playing motivic
        fragments.
     • Strings play principal theme at the Andante maestoso with an orchestral tutti until bar 167 where
        the coupling of violin II on G-string with cellos creates new sonority until bar 172.
                                           – 10 –               M19/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


D: Allegro con moto grazioso (Bars 173–235)
• Theme in solo oboe with light pizzicato accompaniment from viola, and colour from clarinet II.
• Orchestral texture is reduced.
• Bar 181 – repetition by flute I, with double natural harmonics in strings, pizzicato and grace
   notes in piccolo and oboe.
• Triangle and campanelle [di mano] (small hand-held bells) serve to highlight the lightness of the
   theme and change of register.
• Bar 209 – Tempo change at Animato with a briefly contrasting return of the string tone which
   then combines with woodwinds from bar 217.
• Bar 229 Andante maestoso – principal theme as orchestral tutti.
• Roll on timpani [B-flat].

E: Allegro (Bars 236–334)
• Strings, oboes and clarinets create contrast and variety as another new theme repeats.
• Strings have semiquavers and a rhythmic off-beat pattern on lower strings.
• Bar 252 – violins repeat the figure in sixths and in a higher register.
• Bar 258 – repeat in piccolo and clarinets with horn part, with consequent theme from
   b. 268.
• Bar 315 – theme in double-stopped sixths played by violins in octaves, with the consequent
   passage and decorative quaver movement in the woodwinds.
• Bar 317 – horns vary the theme in canon.
• Bars 322–334 provide rhythmic variety with off-beat staccato attacks in woodwinds and
   acciaccaturas.

F: Poco meno mosso (Bars 334–565)
• Theme in solo clarinet with horns and strings accompaniment.
• Bar 350 – repeated by cellos and bassoons from 354 with imitative repetitions.
• Bar 362 – second theme of this section imitated between flutes, oboes, clarinets and bassoons
   with violins.
• Bar 393 – piccolo imitated by bassoon as the horns repeat their ostinato-like figure along with
   lower strings.
• Theme imitated across the orchestra in flashes of instrumental colour.
• Bar 490 – Material from bar 236 returns differently orchestrated.
• Contrast is particularly emphatic at bar 502, where the woodwinds provide sustained trills and
   harmonic cohesion to the syncopations in strings.

G: Andante maestoso (Bars 566–578)
• Violins and violas divided in three, playing slow tremolando harmonies to support the return of
   the principal theme which was introduced at bar 50.
• Principal theme first heard in flutes, moving down to oboes and returning to clarinet before
   Allegro molto vivace.
• Final bars make a brief return to the preceding material with full orchestral tutti.

3.   Brandenburg Concerto No 2 in F major by Johann Sebastian Bach and Dances of Galánta
     by Zoltán Kodály
     Compare and contrast harmony in the prescribed works, emphasizing any significant musical links.
     In your answer, you might refer to musical features such as chords, chord progressions, key
     change, modulation and the control of consonance and dissonance.

     (HL only)

     The answers should refer to both prescribed works. The comparing and contrasting of significant
     musical links must focus on harmonic characteristics.

     Answers should be consistent and convincing in their display of musical understanding and should
     be backed up by clearly located evidence. Musical terminology should be effective in its use.

     [NB: bar/measure numbers below are as given in the score, without adjustment]

     (Note: the Bach examples below refer to the first movement of the Brandenburg Concerto no 2.
     Features of this movement are characteristic of the other two movements and serve as an
     exemplar.)

     Both works essentially use functional harmony but with significant differences of manner, reflecting
     the period in which each was composed.

     Similarities:
     • Harmony in both works is expressed mainly as chords including triadic chords (eg Kodály, Am,
       bar 9; G and A-flat majors, b. 88).
     • As Baroque music, Brandenburg No. 2 in F major emphasizes tonic, subdominant and dominant
       key relationships (eg modulation to the dominant, V of I, C major in bar 17). Kodály’s chord
       relationships also are sometimes within the frame of WCM [Western Classical Music], eg
       clarinet’s tune at 346 features clear tonic/dominant [B-flat – F].
     • Bach’s root movement is frequently within the cycle of fifths (eg 30ff, D – G – C – F). Kodály
       also uses this common Baroque device (eg 80–85: F7 – B flat – E flat – A flat).
     • Bach’s part-writing includes passages in parallel 3rds or 6ths (1–8, intervals of 3rds and 6ths
       reinforce strong tonality and harmonic clarity). Similar devices are also occasionally found in
       Kodály (83–92: countermelody in 3rds linking to classical tradition).
     • Bach’s progression is traceable from the secure bass line expressed through the basso
       continuo whose function is to provide a stable harmonic framework. Kodály’s work also
       occasionally shows strong bass line aligning to Baroque practice (eg 50–57, descending bass).
     • Bach makes use of chromaticism and dissonance within the conventions of Baroque common
       practice (eg b. 28, false relation [B and B-flat in close proximity]). Kodály also occasionally uses
       traditional chromatic dissonances (German 6th in b.100).

     Differences:
     • Bach’s harmonic practice usually expresses strong tonal centres (eg opening ritornello [1–8] in
        the tonic, F major). Kodály’s harmony may be bitonal or lack a clearly definable tonal centre (b.
        405, bitonal harmony of C minor and F-sharp minor in a tritonal root relationship) or include
        passages of whole-tone harmony (b. 169).
     • Some passages in Kodály show parallel chord progressions (eg 141–143: chords move
        stepwise D-flat to E-flat), forbidden in Bach’s harmonic practice.
     • Tonal relationships in Kodály can also be non-traditional such as where harmonic progression is
        to distant keys or where there are tritonal relationships as above (related to Eastern European
        folk music as well as the music of Bartók). Bach’s sequence of sevenths at 107–113, based on
        traditional key relationships, can be compared here with Kodály’s progression of V7 chords at
        19–28: G7 – B-flat 7 – G-flat 7 – D7 – E7.
                                              – 13 –               M19/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


• Some passages in Kodály progress from minor to major in close contrast (eg 109–112:
  harmony alternates between major and minor A-flat).
• Bach basically uses traditional major/minor diatonic scales, with some chromaticism. The range
  of scales used by Kodály includes diatonic and chromatic as well as the Lydian mode and an
  inflected Hungarian scale with augmented 2nd and flat 7th (b. 167, A-flat – B – C – D – E-flat –
  F – G-flat).
• Bach uses traditional cadences (perfect cadence in bar 8). Kodály’s cadences are often forms
  of interrupted cadence (212) or are treated non-traditionally (233–238: B-flat 9th resolves
  unusually to A minor).
• Unlike Bach, Kodály uses pedal points (tonic pedal, 6; G pedal on drum, 88; pedal on F, 421–
  442). Pedal points, drones or ostinato in open perfect 5ths sometimes suggest fundamental
  harmony related to folk music (181–8).
• Besides the more tonally defining intervals of the 3rd and 6th, Kodály occasionally use of
  intervals of the perfect 4th (123–133: melody in parallel 4ths, suggesting quartal harmony) and
  open 5ths (236).
• Bach’s modulations typify the use of tonally functional harmony of the period (eg 63–64: G
  minor [relative minor of B-flat] and modulation to E-flat major). Kodály’s tonal direction is more
  often by direct change rather than modulation (eg 88–93: expectation of a progression to C
  which turns instead to A-flat minor; sudden step to E-flat before D major in 217 suggesting
  Neapolitan flattened supertonic).
• Bach’s key relationships, modulations and associated cadences contribute to the form of each
  of the movements. By contrast, there is much less sense of overall tonal direction in Kodály.
• Kodály frequently uses homophonic accompaniment figures (eg 50–57). Bach also writes
  passages of homophony (eg 1–8), but his style is predominantly contrapuntal, and the
  underlying harmonic progression is implied rather than expressed through chords in this way
  (albeit partly by basso continuo).

     Symphony of Psalms by Igor Stravinsky
     (Identified piece, score provided)

     Musical elements and terminology [underlined]:
     • Tonality:
       A “tonal centre” partially established by pedal points [15, 49] and
       E minor block chords (1, 4, 7 etc.)
       The arpeggio figure generally traces chords of dominant 7ths on B-flat and G.
     • Rhythm and metre:
       Time signatures are variable. ranging from simple duple to single crotchet beats [14, 48].
       Tempo is constant – metronomic.
       Rhythmically limited to minim, crotchet, quaver, semiquaver divisions but also sextuplets (39–
       40].
     • Timbre:
       For large orchestra and SATB choir, but excluding violins and violas.
       Same ideas presented in different orchestrations and sonorities. Importance of voicing to
       sonority, eg spacing of punctuating chord of E minor heard from start.
     • Pitch:
       Mostly based on modal collections (1–8, 23–36) or Phrygian mode on E (15–18).
       Vocal tessitura is in mid-range. Sopranos reaching only to F.
     • Harmony:
       Pantonal but includes common chords such as E minor and dominant 7ths.
     • Dynamics:
       Relate to structure: eg E minor punctuation always mf, full chorus f, woodwind passages p
       (except bar 41).
       Dynamic range increases towards f of climax from bar 49.
     • Texture:
       Voices in unison [eg 26 – 32] or rhythmic unison [33–36].
       Opening contrasts E minor block chord with monophonic melodic movement.
       Passages such as 26–32 are homophonically supported melody with some linear movement
       creating counterpoint-like features.

     Musical structure and terminology [underlined]:
     There are two principal ideas: one arpeggio [eg 2–3], the other scalic [eg piano, 12–13].
     In a general sense, extract is episodic:

     A 1–14:       Two main ideas: opening E minor chord, which becomes motif in itself, and
                   arpeggios in solo oboe and bassoon. Mixed time signatures alternating between
                   duple, triple and quadruple time with 1/4 bars at 8 and 14.

     B 15–25:      Cellos and basses sustain pedal note on E, doubled by piano playing transformed
                   arpeggio figure beginning with E minor triad. 2nd horn traces first notes of each
                   arpeggio repetition, cello and 1st horn (18) anticipate choral entry.

     C 26–32:      Altos enter with theme limited to two pitches semitone apart. Arpeggio figure
                   rhythmically augmented in accompaniment, with two dominant 7th chords still
                   evident in bassoons’ ostinato patterns.

     D 33–36:      Whole choir enters in chordal response to altos’ unison entry. High cellos double
                   soprano line, double basses the bass voices.
                                              – 19 –                 M19/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



E 37–40:      Bridge. Cadenza-like passage for oboes, mostly of tones/semitones, ending with
              sequential chain of descending major and minor seconds.

C1 41–48:     Return to C with small changes, eg ascending flourish (47). Transposition of upper
              oboe part up two octaves and march-like tread in lower strings. Arpeggio figures
              and ostinati remain but are cut off before final flourish.

B1 49–fade: Arpeggio figure briefly repeats in a different orchestration as music fades.

Musical terminology may also include:
• Staccato; arco; pizzicato; divisi
• Espressivo/Cantabile espressivo
• Una corda (secco).

Musical context
• Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), modern/20th-century composer.
• Among his earlier work are ballet scores which were written mainly for the impresario Serge
  Diaghileff’s Russian Ballet including The Rite of Spring, Petruschka, The Firebird and Les
  Noces.
• Symphony of Psalms dates from 1930 and shows the composer’s avoidance of the lush string
  sounds of nineteenth-century Romanticism in favour of a blend of woodwind and brass with

• Composed in neoclassical style, which utilized traditional musical forms (eg concerto grosso,
  fugue). This work in particular features portions written in fugal counterpoint, which was widely
  used in the church in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Large chorus is also used to
  create the ritual atmosphere associated with the church.
• Text is Psalm 150. The work is possibly a representation of the composer’s personal religious
  faith.

     Symphony No 9 in D Minor, Movement IV (Presto) by Ludwig van Beethoven
     (Identified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements
     • Standard double-wind Classical orchestra, though with four horns and contrabassoon.
     • Extract passes through various keys, tempi and metres, though “home key” to which it
       constantly returns is D minor/major, and “home metre” 3/4.
     • Metre of even-numbered 3/4 sections (see below) is often obscured by syncopation or
       “recitative”-like rhythmic freedom and may be difficult for candidates to perceive.
     • Wide dynamic range, with expressive use of diminuendo and crescendo in places.

     Musical structure and terminology (underlined):
     Extract can be divided into short sections, of which the odd-numbered (1–9) have a similar
     character, and the even-numbered (2–8) present contrasting material. Candidates might therefore
     describe the structure as something like a “rondo”, though the similarities between sections 1–9
     are rather loose, and “through-composed” would also be acceptable:

     (1)   Presto, D minor, 3/4
           0:00    Loud dissonant chord for wind, brass and rolled timpani; broken chord/ arpeggio
                   D minor chord in even quaver rhythm; chromatic movement leads to close on an
                   octave “A” followed by pause. Homophonic texture.
           0:09    Unaccompanied cellos and basses in octaves; relatively free rhythm, recitative-like,
                   closing with diminuendo. Monophonic texture.
           0:26    Trumpets and timpani enter on D; winds add diminished 7th to produce dominant
                   minor 9th. Arpeggio/broken chord in similar quaver rhythm to opening; ends on
                   downbeat, followed by…
           0:34    … antiphony (“call and response”) between cellos and basses and chords in
                   wind. Further brief recitative passage for lower strings is answered by two staccato
                   chords for wind which transition to next section.

     (2)   Allegro ma non troppo, D minor, 2/4
           0:47    Sustained A major first inversion chord, pp. Violins introduce new figure based on
                   series of falling 4ths/5ths in double-dotted rhythm. Trumpets and timpani mark
                   end of first phrase, but second is interrupted by…

     (3)   Tempo I, 3/4, D minor
           1:01   …forte diminished seventh and another aggressive outburst for cellos and basses,
                  which however calms down with a diminuendo and ritardando.

     (4)   Vivace, 3/4, A minor
           1:22    Woodwind theme with opening falling octave in dotted rhythm and staccato;
                   pizzicato strings. Essentially homophonic with some imitation of opening figure.
                   Breaks off suddenly, followed by pause.

     (5)   Tempo I, 3/4, F major with dominant preparation for B-flat major
           1:27   Cellos and basses answer in same key (F major) and elaborate tonic chord, adding
                  E-flat at end to form dominant preparation. Diminuendo and pause.

     (6)   Adagio cantabile, 2/2, B-flat major
           1:42   2 bars only: slow, expressive (“dolce”) theme for wind based on falling fourth motif in
                  homophonic, chorale-like texture.
                                            – 21 –             M19/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(7)   Tempo I. Allegro, 3/4, G-flat major → dominant preparation for A
      1:49   Cellos and basses answer piano, answered by winds, before erupting again into
             fury, modulating to C# minor. Wind answer in same key, then move to dominant
             7th on E leading to…

(8)   Allegro moderato, 4/4, D major
      2:11    Dominant pedal in horns; new, rising and falling major-key theme in woodwind,
              mostly in conjunct motion (foretaste of section 10) in parallel 6ths and 3rds.

(9)   Tempo I. Allegro, 3/4, D major
      2:17   Final phrase of above interrupted cellos and basses; antiphony between their
             monophony and block chords from wind. Cello and bass then briefly modulate to
             subdominant; section ends with classic recitative gesture of falling 4th answered
             by perfect cadence from wind and timpani.

(10) Allegro assai, 4/4, D major
     2:43    Theme foreshadowed in (8) above is now presented in full at last by cellos and
             basses in octaves, as track fades out.

Musical context
• By Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), German composer of Classical period whose
  dramatic music foreshadows Romanticism (reference to either period acceptable).
• Opening of famous choral finale from his last completed symphony (1824), in which the cello
  and bass recitative “dismisses” in turn the themes from the previous 3 movements, before
  responding positively to the theme to which the words of Friedrich Schiller’s poem An die
  Freude (“To Joy”) are later set.
• Classical period characterized by modest orchestration and limited use of brass instruments;
  Romantic period featured more dramatic contrasts in orchestration and more “adventurous”
  harmony. This work is scored for the largest orchestra used in any Beethoven symphony,
  further enlarged by doubling of wind parts.
• First example of a major composer using voices in a symphony (in the remainder of the
  movement which this extract opens).

     The Strut by Gareth Lockrane
     (Unidentified piece, no score provided)

     Musical elements (terminology shown underlined):
     • Flute(s), saxophone(s), guitar, electric keyboard (Hammond organ), drums. (Some candidates
       may also hear electric bass, though in fact organ plays bass line.)
     • Fast 4/4 metre throughout; tempo ca. 110 bpm
     • Begins in B (major) with modal inflections, eg flattened 7th and 3rd (blue notes); “chorus”
       sections more chromatic; new section at end centred on E
     • Strongly chord-based (homophonic) texture throughout
     • Considerable use of syncopation and “swing”
     • Mostly forte dynamic though with some variation (eg “choruses” generally louder)

     Musical structure
     First part of extract has quasi-strophic or “verse/chorus”-like structure (ABAB) until 02:15, when
     new material is introduced before fade-out; each individual section is built from a number of
     repeated units based on cyclic chord progressions. The following is one possible analysis:

     Section 1 (“Verse” I)
     00:00 Drum upbeat (pick-up): single beat with grace note (“flam”).
     00:01 A: 4-bar pattern; 2 bars of B major chord + first inversion D chord upbeat, x 2.
             Syncopated, fragmented melody in guitar, with organ doubling third and sixth lower to
             produce parallel harmony; bar 3 melody (00:06) repeats motif from bar 2 but shifts it
             metrically, bar 4 introduces clearly audible flattened 3rd (blue note). “Straight eighths” in
             bass (repeated pitches) and cymbal, strong drumbeats (backbeat) on beats 2 and 4.
     00:09 A1: repeat of A.
     00:17 A2: above pattern repeats while flute joins in with short interjections above, doubled at
             unison from second entry onwards by saxophone.
     00:26 A3: repeat of A2, though solo interjections in second phrase more elaborate.
     00:35 A4: essentially repeat of A3.
     00:43 A5: final repeat of A3.

     Section 2 (“Chorus” I)
     00:51 B: 2-bar phrase. Instrumental patterns change: bass line more active, Hammond organ
             plays chromatically ascending sustained chords, starting on beat 3; drum pattern
             emphasizes beat 4 only. Above it, flute and sax play more sustained melody in unison,
             though with alto flute in lower tessitura and sax now more prominent.
     00:55 B1: repeat of above.
     00:59 B2: B repeated but transposed major third higher (sequentially).
     01:03 C: 2 bars; kind of bridge or “turnaround” leading back to A material, consisting of
             syncopated chordal “stabs”.

     Section 3 (“Verse” II)
     01:07 A6: 4-bar pattern of Verse I reappears with flute/sax interventions as in A2 – though
             pattern is different, with two instruments sometimes playing independently or in harmony
             rather than unison.
     01:16 A7: similar to A6.
     01:24 A8: again, similar to above, though for first time instruments join in with final bar of phrase.
             Improvisatory quality to saxophone interjections, and “buzzing” timbre to flute (created
             by homophonic sing/play technique).
     01:32 A9: final repletion, this time similar to original version at A2.
                                             – 23 –              M19/6/MUSIC/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Section 4 (“Chorus” II)
01:41 B3: similar to 00:51, though flute now 8va to saxophone and more prominent.
01:45 B4: repeat of B2.
01:49 B5: B2 repeated sequentially (major third higher).
01:53 B6: repeat of B4.
01:57 B7: return to B3 material at original pitch.
02:01 B8: essentially repeat of B7.
02:05 B9: material repeated again at higher pitch.
02:09 C1: “turnaround” passage with chord stabs similar to 01:03, though flute + sax now play
        melody above them.

Section 5 (new material)
02:14 E: new bass line in even quarters (something like walking bass), new chord progression,
        new melody (flute and sax unison), new drum pattern with straight eighths in cymbal. 4
        bars.
02:22 E1: similar to above, though with slight changes to melody and chord progression.
02:30 E2: similar to 02:14, but sax adds counterpoints to flute.
02:39 E3: similar to E1, but with organ holding sustained chords as track fades out.

Context
• Gareth Lockrane is a London-based flautist, composer/arranger and pianist, who performs on
  alto and bass flutes (possibly heard here) as well as the C-flute. Album The Strut released 2012
  http://www.garethlockrane.com/
• Style derives from jazz tradition, though with elements of soul and funk. Characteristics of jazz-
  funk include a move away from free or modal jazz back to a more structured music (as
  evidenced in this excerpt).
• Clues to context: mainly acoustic ensemble including drumkit and saxophone (though use of
  flute as solo instrument unusual in this style); repeated structures based on clear chord
  progressions; heavy use of syncopation and swing; “improvisatory”-like features (eg sax
  interventions at 02:29ff); use of modal inflections including blue notes; other typical features
  such as walking bass and standard drum patterns. Use of Hammond organ might suggest more
  modern period, though instrument actually dates from 1935.
• Influences on styles could include Courtney Pine, Herbie Hancock, Miles Davies, Nile Rogers,
  Snarky Puppy or other similar artists.

     • Narrow-ranging dynamics

     Musical structure and terminology (underlined):
     0:00    Section 1 - Instrumental Introduction
             mbiras play melodic ostinato motif.
     0:03    Shakers/axatse/shekere enter with rhythmic ostinato.
     0:07    Metallic percussion instrument enters with another rhythmic ostinato.
     0:13    Whistle/flute enters with a rhythmic motif (this could be whistled speech).
     0:14    Drum pattern briefly heard.
     0:23    Mbira introduces the melody which descends by step. There is a multilayered texture to
             the introduction section.

     0:29    Section 2 - Verse
             male solo vocalist enters singing a repetition of the melody which was introduced by the
             mbira.
             A four-bar phrase which is repeated 5 times with slightly embellished variations.
             Instrumental mbira ostinati set up in the introduction continue throughout the song.

     0:48    Section 3 - Chorus
             other vocalists join in, mostly in unison with the soloist but sometimes in harmony, singing
             “O mambo yeah” (2-bar phrase repeated 4 times).
     0:56    Group vocalists maintain “O mambo yeah” phrase 6 times as an ostinato while vocal
             soloist introduces a second ostinato (on pitch pattern 1-3-6-3 or 1-3-5-3) joined by
             individuals from the group.
     1.07    Group drops out and soloist continues with second ostinato alone, accompanied by the
             same constant instrumental ostinato.
     1.10    Shakers/axatse/shekere re-enter and vocals stop abruptly on first note of ostinato.

     1:15    Section 4 - Instrumental break
             mbira re-states the melody which appeared in the verse.
     1:16    solo vocal exclamation: sounds like “whey!” or “wheee!”.

     1:17    Section 5 - Chorus
             group singers return with “O mambo yeah" ostinato phrase while soloist makes speaking
             sounds or seems to embellish the second ostinato idea before joining the rest of the group
             in unison with the other singers. This phrase is repeated 12 times.

1:40     Shakers/axatse/shekere re-enter and vocals stop as all instruments continue with
         various rhythmic and melodic ostinati, which overlap to create a complex layered
         texture featuring various cross-rhythms and hemiola-like patterns as the music fades at
         1:50.

Musical context
• Traditional music from South Africa (specifically from the Bushman civilization) recorded in 2005
  – bushman civilization, ritualistic, ceremonious, oral tradition, whistled speech.
• The traditional music of Africa, given the vastness of the continent, is historically ancient, rich
  and diverse, with different regions and nations of Africa having many distinct musical traditions.
  Songs and music are used in rituals and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from
  generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to. It is also part of everyday life.
• Whistling / whistled speech used in some parts of Africa to emulate speech / facilitate
  communication.
• Traditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally (or aurally) and is not written. In
  Sub-Saharan African music traditions, it frequently relies on percussion instruments of every
  variety, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as the
  mbira or thumb piano.
• Mambo is a song is about a big African snake (mambo), which is dangerous and poisonous. It
  has been a sign of peace and good fortune in Africa for a long time especially among the Qwii,
  Nguni and Mambo peoples. If, for example, you have cattle and a mambo is present, they will
  have many calves. The singers dedicate this song to the mambo.
