                                                SUNGEN LTD

     The case study is based on two companies, Electrical Solutions plc and its subsidiary, SunGen Ltd.

     Company profile

     In 1985, Derek Gorman opened Electrical Solutions, a small retail outlet selling electrical
     equipment. As an ambitious entrepreneur Derek set himself the target to be a millionaire before
     he reached the age of 35. He was constantly looking for new business and market opportunities.
 5   There was an increasing international trend for electrical equipment, such as washing machines and
     televisions, to be sold in large out-of-town retail outlets to take advantage of economies of scale.
     Derek’s market research highlighted that there were no such retail outlets in the suburbs of several
     large Australian cities. To take advantage of this business opportunity he developed a business
     plan and obtained a $ 1.5 million bank loan (some of which was secured against his house) to open
10   out-of-town electrical retailing outlets in the suburbs of Melbourne. Sales revenue far exceeded
     expectations and in 1992 he achieved his ambition and earned his first million dollars in salary
     and bonuses.

     To develop the business further Derek converted Electrical Solutions into a private limited company
     and by 1995 it had opened 10 further stores in Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide and had a
15   turnover of over $ 22 million. However, by 2000 turnover at Electrical Solutions plc slumped as
     large global conglomerates moved into Australia to take advantage of good trading conditions.
     These conglomerates were able to use their market and buying power to drive down prices making
     the market increasingly price competitive. Electrical Solutions plc was finding it increasingly
     difficult to match these price cuts.

20   Derek felt that being a private limited company was restricting further growth of the business.
     In 2001 the board of directors decided to float 65 % of the shares of Electrical Solutions plc on
     the Australian Stock Exchange. Derek and his family kept 30 % of the shares and the remaining
     5 % was reserved for employees under an employee share ownership scheme. Derek became the
     chief executive officer of Electrical Solutions plc, a role he had fulfilled for the limited company
25   since its start-up. In 2000, Derek’s daughter Catherine joined the firm as director with responsibility
     for purchasing. Catherine had been to university in Sydney and then spent four years working
     for a large Japanese car company where she pioneered environmentally sensitive manufacturing
     techniques.

     At a board meeting in 2003, the directors agreed that for the company to grow further, it needed
30   to diversify into other areas. With the existing intense competition in the electrical equipment
     retail market, Electrical Solutions plc looked for alternative expansion opportunities.
     It commissioned the consultancy firm, Martrend, to conduct market research on its behalf and to
     investigate potential new markets. Martrend identified that consumers were increasingly concerned
     about both global warming and rising energy prices and were looking for new solutions to meet their
35   energy requirements. This offered a significant market opportunity for companies manufacturing
     solar power equipment and so Electrical Solutions plc considered entering this market. Some of the
     board of directors had reservations about this change of direction, but Catherine’s passionate belief
     in sustainable energy persuaded the majority of the board to support the idea.
                                                ––            SPEC/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     With solar power technology still developing, this represented a very new and risky market, but the
40   report from Martrend provided convincing evidence that the market was set to grow rapidly and
     that there was an opportunity to gain first mover advantage.

     In February 2003, Electrical Solutions plc set up SunGen Ltd as a wholly owned subsidiary of
     Electrical Solutions plc. Start-up capital was partly provided through a $ 1 million bank loan.
     Further capital was contributed by the parent company, using funds released from the sale of the
45   worst performing out of town retail outlets.

     Derek’s daughter Catherine was appointed the managing director of SunGen Ltd, which is based
     in Melbourne along with Electrical Solutions plc. It manufactures and sells solar power equipment
     to generate electricity for households and small firms. Customers can use this equipment to generate
     power for their own needs and they can sell any surplus electricity to the national electricity
50   provider for use by other customers.

     Production

     The production director of SunGen Ltd is Tony McGregor, an old friend of Derek’s. Tony worked
     for many years as a manager for one of the large electricity companies. Derek persuaded him to
     move with an offer of a generous financial package including shares and bonuses. Some staff
     resented this appointment.

55   SunGen Ltd manufactures the solar power equipment to customer specification. The equipment
     is assembled from components that SunGen Ltd buy from a range of suppliers, as soon as an
     order is received from a customer. Consequently, SunGen Ltd holds minimal levels of stock.
     However, some suppliers have proved unreliable and long delivery times have resulted in some
     delays in delivery of the equipment to customers, causing dissatisfaction.

60   Significant recent growth means that the assembly area is currently running at an average
     98 % capacity. Significant overtime is often required to meet demand and some of the production
     staff are expressing their concerns about the unpredictable nature of the hours they are expected
     to work.

     SunGen Ltd is also having problems with the quality of the components from one or two
65   suppliers and in the worst case this resulted in an entire system being replaced for a customer.
     Tony has suggested to the board that SunGen Ltd changes suppliers, but many of the components
     are highly specialized and the only alternative suppliers are located in Asia. The board has asked
     Tony to look at the possibility of building closer relationships with local suppliers.

     These supplier problems have led Tony to look at quality issues across all their operations.
70   Catherine is a strong advocate of Total Quality Management and is promoting the use of
     quality circles and continuous improvement. By contrast Tony, who has quite a traditional
     management style, feels that quality control issues are the responsibility of management. He wants
     the employment of additional managers, with specific responsibility for quality.




                                                                                              Turn over
                                                 ––            SPEC/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Tony and Catherine are considering the possibility of buying a computer-controlled production
 75   management system. Currently, all production information is duplicated in several systems,
      which makes coordination difficult, leading to delays in production. Catherine argues that
      a computer-controlled system would enable them to manage production more efficiently.
      She believes this will reduce unit cost(s). Tony is not convinced and argues that the costs of the
      system will outweigh its benefits.

      Marketing

 80   The market for solar power equipment is a niche market. The market is small, but is growing
      at approximately 20 % per year and SunGen Ltd estimate they have around 65 % of the market.
      There is currently only one other major firm, though their products differ from those of
      SunGen Ltd in several important respects. SunGen Ltd’s marketing director is Ying Chau and she
      was appointed in 2004. Their current product portfolio is given in Appendix 1 with details of
 85   the products.

      The initial marketing strategy targeted mainly business customers. The key market segment is
      firms who construct houses. SunGen Ltd target these customers by exhibiting at trade shows and
      through personal selling.

      SunGen Ltd want to persuade the government to accelerate the growth of the solar power
 90   equipment market. The company has commissioned a public relations firm to influence the
      government to implement two main changes:
      • modifications to planning regulations to require house builders to fit systems that use
         renewable and sustainable energy systems in new houses
      • subsidies to households who decide to fit renewable energy systems in existing houses.

 95   In June 2005, the board of directors agreed to an expansion plan proposed jointly by Ying and
      Catherine to target their products at individual households. This move was partly based on the
      results of the market research conducted by Martrend in 2003. The results found that 45 % of
      those questioned would consider fitting some sort of renewable energy generation system.
      Ying was a little unsure about the value of these results and argued that they should be
100   interpreted carefully and further market research commissioned. Catherine felt there was
      sufficient evidence from the research of a viable market and has asked Ying to design an
      appropriate marketing strategy. As part of the stategy, SunGen Ltd’s product mix was analysed
      using a product portfolio matrix (see Appendix 2). As the market is geographically dispersed,
      SunGen Ltd will require suitable distribution channels for their products, which need to be
105   professionally installed.

      Human resource management

      In 2004, Greg Robinson was transferred to SunGen Ltd from Electrical Solutions plc to manage
      the human resource department. His first priority was to recruit production staff. To speed up the
      process, he recruited a significant proportion of the staff internally from Electrical Solutions plc.

      In 2005, Greg and Catherine decided to review the organizational structure. Greg agrees with
110   Catherine that the company needs a flatter structure with fewer levels of hierarchy. Their aim
      is to ensure that the company is as flexible and responsive as possible, and able to cope with the
                                                ––            SPEC/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      rapid levels of growth they anticipate. Tony is concerned that as a result of the flatter structure
      there will be problems with lines of communication and management control. He points out
      that important decisions may not reach all staff resulting in delays in production. Tony is
115   supported by a number of the internally recruited staff, who argue that there is no clear leadership
      or vision. They feel that too often they are left to make decisions. Although they enjoy the extra
      responsibility they are unclear how their decisions fit with the company’s strategic direction.

      Along with the review, Greg and Catherine are considering changes to workers’ contracts
      to make them more flexible. Production workers will be offered a certain number of hours
120   each week according to the level of demand. A proportion of the workers will be placed on
      temporary contracts. The workforce is represented by a single trade union. It is threatening
      strike action if the proposed changes are adopted. Trade union representatives have met with
      Greg to try to resolve these issues.

      Greg and Catherine believe that staff should be given incentives. They are proposing an
125   additional training programme and appraisal system. Production staff will be required to attend
      a one-week residential training course, which is being organized for SunGen Ltd by an external
      training organization. At the end of the training programme the staff will negotiate performance
      targets with their line managers for the coming year. Then, at the end of the year, an appraisal
      system will be introduced to review these targets. High-performing staff will receive significant
130   bonuses and other incentives.

      Finance

      The finance department of SunGen Ltd consists of two staff plus the finance director,
      Alex Roderey. It is responsible for the preparation of monthly management accounts for the
      board of directors and the year-end accounts. Payroll, customer invoicing and other day-to-day
      operations are centralized in the finance department of Electrical Solutions plc. They make an
135   annual charge to SunGen Ltd for providing these financial services.

      Alex is concerned about the financial situation of SunGen Ltd. Although the growth in
      sales is promising, the company is still making significant losses and remains very short of
      working capital. Electrical Solutions plc is currently funding SunGen Ltd from their cash
      reserves, but these reserves are running down. SunGen Ltd’s forecasts suggest they will become
140   profitable in 2007, but they will need a further cash injection in the near future if they are to
      avoid problems with meeting their obligations to staff and suppliers. The financial situation is the
      main item on the agenda of the next meeting of the board of directors and Derek and two other
      representatives from the board of Electrical Solutions plc have been invited to attend this meeting.
      Alex will also raise the issue of longer-term funding at this meeting as he agrees with Catherine
145   and Tony that they need to expand capacity by building a new production facitility within the next
      18 months to avoid a significant production backlog.

      Key financial figures are given in Appendix 3.

      Future prospects

      SunGen Ltd has made a positive start with strong sales growth and a good response to the product
      range from customers. Catherine is keen to make further use of their environmental profile and
150   is currently developing a mission statement for the firm and a Corporate Social Responsibility
      report. This will consider issues relating to their products, staff, the environment, stakeholders and
      their accountability. The finance director, Alex, has raised concerns about the Australian
      housing market. Solar power equipment for new houses is a significant proportion of their
      business and therefore he is worried about reports from some commentators that house
155   prices are set to fall. There is also uncertainty about the state of the economy in general.
      However, Catherine has dismissed these concerns as she feels that demand for their systems is
      based more on people’s attitudes and environmental issues than on income levels. Forecasts for
      major Australian macro-economic indicators (as at November 2006) are given in Appendix 4.
      SunGen Ltd is also considering expansion options. JBR, an Indonesian construction company
160   operating in partnership with the Indonesian Government, approached SunGen Ltd in
      June 2007 to participate in an environmental project building low cost housing in the capital, Jakarta.
      The building designs include solar panels to reduce energy costs and to meet Indonesian
      government environmental targets. Derek and Catherine are currently discussing the merits of
      this proposal.

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

4.   Alex Roderey has prepared the provisional accounts for the year ending 31 March 2007 and has
     submitted a ratio analysis to the board of directors. The key ratios from this analysis are shown in
     Item 1 in the Additional information (page 5 of this examination paper).

     The board of directors has decided to expand capacity by building a new production plant.


     (a)   (i)    Define the term liquidity.                                                     [2 marks]

                                               SECTION C

Answer the compulsory question from this section.

5.   JBR, an Indonesian construction company (line 159 of case study) proposed a joint venture with
     SunGen Ltd. Solar panels would be mass produced in Indonesia under licence from SunGen Ltd,
     using their managerial staff and expertise. Surplus panels would be exported to Australia to supply
     increasing market demand and to reduce capacity problems in the Australian factory. This would
     cut SunGen Ltd’s unit costs, but lead to redundancies in their Australian factories. Parts would be
     imported from Australia, with the aim to find suitable local Indonesian suppliers within one year.

     Catherine decided to commission further market and economic research from Martrend (key results
     are shown in Items 3 to 7). On the basis of this research, she believes the project offers an opportunity
     to develop SunGen Ltd’s environmental profile, to support growth in the Asia Pacific region and to
     strengthen SunGen Ltd’s position in the face of new market competition.

     Derek, however, has raised the following concerns about the proposed joint venture:
     • the terms and conditions of employment in the Jakarta factories
     • the stability of the Indonesian currency and future economic trends
     • the different corporate cultures and leadership styles of the two businesses
     • opposition to the joint venture by Australian trade unions
     • communication and distribution compatibility
     • raising finance for the expansion.

     Derek and Catherine convene a board meeting to consider the joint venture proposal.


     (a)   Identify two driving and two restraining forces for the proposed joint venture
           with JBR.                                                                               [4 marks]

     (b)   Explain the purpose of SunGen Ltd having a mission statement and
           corporate objectives (Item 8).                                                          [8 marks]

     (c)   Using Items 2 to 8, analyse two issues that will influence SunGen Ltd’s decision
           to expand in Indonesia.                                                                 [8 marks]

     (d)   Using data from the case study and the additional information provided in
           Items 1 to 8, discuss SunGen Ltd’s strategic options for the coming three years.       [10 marks]

                                             SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of SunGen Ltd recruiting a
           significant proportion of their staff internally from Electrical Solutions plc
           (Line 108).                                                                        [4 marks]

           Initially a significant proportion of the staff for SunGen Ltd were recruited
           internally from Electrical Solutions plc. This may result in various advantages
           and disadvantages:

           Advantages
           • appropriate staff can be selected and their skills, abilities and experience
             will be well known. This is a good way to ensure an appropriate balance of
             skills and experience for the SunGen Ltd start-up
           • the process of recruitment is likely to be faster and more efficient by
             recruiting staff internally
           • any other appropriate advantage.

           Disadvantages
           • the internally recruited staff may form an informal group with differing
              aims and objectives from other groups. This may result in the potential for
              conflict within SunGen Ltd staff
           • recruiting a large proportion of staff internally may result in missing out on
              external expertise that could potentially have been more specialist and
              appropriate for a startup in a different area of business
           • the recruitment of a large proportion of staff internally may be a
              demotivating factor for other SunGen Ltd staff
           • any other appropriate disadvantage.

           Award [2 marks] for an appropriate description of an advantage and
           [2 marks] for an appropriate description of a disadvantage. Maximum of
           [4 marks].
                                             –4–             SPEC/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Explain the effect on motivation of offering high performing staff
      significant financial bonuses (lines 129-130).                                       [4 marks]

      The impact of the financial bonuses on motivation will depend on the
      importance of financial reward to employees and this may vary from one
      member of staff to another. Some will regard recognition and responsibility
      (non-financial factors) as more important and in these cases, the impact on
      motivation of the bonuses is likely to be lower. However, we can reasonably
      expect that the bonuses will have the following effects on motivation:
      • financial bonuses are likely to boost motivation. Financial bonuses for
         good performance are likely to be considered as a form of recognition for a
         “job well-done” and this may help boost esteem needs (as identified in
         Maslow’s hierarchy of needs)
      • the bonuses may also, on the basis that they act as a form of recognition,
         act as a “motivator” as identified by Herzberg
      • in terms of equity theories of motivation, the high-performing staff will feel
         that their contribution has been recognised and perhaps therefore feel that
         their remuneration package is fair.

      Overall, motivation can be expected to increase – it is the extent of the increase
      that cannot be certain. Arguably, high-performing staff will be the most
      motivated already and therefore the impact on motivation might be less
      than expected.

      N.B. Candidates need not refer to the work of specific theorists in
      their answers, but can be credited appropriately if they choose to.

      [4 marks]
      The impact of the bonuses on motivation is fully and clearly explained.

      [2 to 3 marks]
      The impact of the bonuses on motivation is explained, but the explanation may
      be lacking in detail.

      [1 mark]
      A limited answer that may simply identify the impact of the bonuses
      on motivation.
                                           –5–            SPEC/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Analyse the costs and benefits of changing the organizational structure of
      SunGen Ltd to a flatter structure (line 110).                                    [7 marks]

      Flatter organizations will have various advantages:
      • faster vertical communication flows – this may help SunGen Ltd to
         improve efficiency and enable faster decision-making with clearer
         implementation of strategy. Workers have been concerned at a lack of
         leadership and vision and this may help communication of the strategic
         direction better.
      • employees may feel more empowered if they are more involved with
         decision-making in a flatter structure. This may result in a boost in
         motivation and again help create a clearer sense of vision for the company.
      • flatter structures may help reduce costs with fewer staff in middle
         management positions. Given the recent growth in costs this may help
         make SunGen Ltd profitable quicker.
      • flatter structures may, if employees are given more responsibility and
         feel empowered, lead to a more innovative and creative workforce, which is
         vital in a fast-moving industry like the one SunGen Ltd is operating in.
      • flatter structures may be more efficient particularly when firms are small
         (as SunGen Ltd is) and when the staff are highly involved with the product,
         which is likely to be true for SunGen Ltd. This may help increase
         productivity and therefore enable a faster route to productivity and more
         efficient use of the existing resources.

      However, there are likely to be disadvantages:
      • staff may lack direction – this appears to be a problem already at
        SunGen Ltd and given that a flatter structure might increase the span
        of control, this might worsen the situation.
      • communication might fail or be distorted. Where there is a larger span of

2.   (a)   (i)    Define the term unique selling point.                                         [2 marks]

                  The unique selling point (or unique selling proposition) is the principal
                  characteristic of a good or service that separates it from its competitors.
                  According to this concept, successful advertising campaigns are based on
                  emphasising a product's unique selling proposition. It is the thing that
                  will make customer’s choose the product over other similar ones in
                  the market.

                  The unique selling point (USP) for SunGen Ltd is the environmentally
                  friendly nature of their product. The ability to generate free electricity
                  from the product and thereby avoid the environmental impact of other
                  forms of energy.

(b)   Explain one external opportunity and one external threat that
      SunGen Ltd is facing as a result of their expansion plan.                         [4 marks]

      The SunGen Ltd expansion plan is to target their products “at individual
      households”. Their current target market is mainly housebuilders who use the
      product on new properties or houses being restored professionally.
      The intention of the expansion plan is to start to broaden the target market to
      individual households. This may result in a number of external opportunities
      and threats:

      Opportunities
      • Governments are under pressure to meet tighter environmental targets from
        international treaty obligations (e.g. Kyoto treaty) and this may result in
        incentives being offered to households to purchase products of this nature.
        If SunGen Ltd has in place appropriate distribution strategies for their
        products to individual households, then they will be able to take advantage
        of this. SunGen Ltd are also, through a PR firm, trying to put pressure on
        the government to introduce these kind of regulations and also tighten
        environmental regulations. Their expansion plan will put them in a better
        position to take advantage of this potential new market.
      • The market for solar power products is growing at around 20 % per year
        and their expansion plan will put them in a better position to take
        advantage of this market growth.
      • There are currently few competitors and there are important differences in
        their products. SunGen Ltd’s expansion plan will put them in a better
        position to gain first-mover advantage in this new market segment.
      • Environmental awareness is increasing among individual consumers and
        the expansion plan will help SunGen Ltd take advantage of this as it will
        enable them to build appropriate distribution channels to meet this
        potential demand.
      • Any other appropriate external opportunity.

Threats
• A reduction in economic growth is forecast, and though this is not
  a recession, SunGen Ltd’s products are arguably income elastic in nature
  and so the lower level of economic growth may lead to a fall in expenditure
  on solar power products.
• The market is still risky.              Although SunGen Ltd would have
  first-mover advantage, it is still a niche market in nature and the results of
  the market research could be argued to be a little ambiguous. This may
  represent a threat to their abilities to expand into this new market.
• The market is geographically dispersed in nature and this may represent a
  challenge to the setting up of appropriate distribution channels.
• The rapid growth forecast in the market may attract new firms into the
  market and this will be a potential threat to SunGen Ltd’s position in
  this market.
• Some increase in inflation is forecast and this may lead to uncertainty
  among consumers. This combined with the drop in economic growth could
  potentially reduce the growth forecast in the market.
• Any other appropriate external threat.

(c)   House builders are the current target market of SunGen Ltd. SunGen Ltd
      is considering targeting individual households.

      Examine the marketing mix that would be appropriate for each of these
      target markets.                                                                      [7 marks]

      The market for individual households is being targeted by SunGen Ltd as part
      of their expansion plan. The marketing mix that is appropriate to this market is
      likely to be different in nature to that currently required for the target market
      of housebuilders.

      House builders – marketing mix

      Price – price will be important to housebuilders as it will represent an
      important element of their costs and they will want to minimise these.
      SunGen Ltd may use cost-based pricing or a similar pricing strategy to ensure
      they are competitive and encourage the maximum possible level of demand.
      Product – housebuilders will be a very “technically-aware” market and so
      SunGen Ltd will emphasise the nature of the product in their marketing mix.
      They will want to stress the various different versions of the product available
      and ensure that they fit in with the various different requirements of the
      housebuilder market.
      Promotion – the promotional strategy used for housebuilders will be quite
      specific and is likely to focus mainly on the use of below the line
      promotional strategies. The use of targeted e-mail, newsletters, personal
      selling and trade shows is likely to be most appropriate as their market is quite
      closely defined and easier to target using these approaches.
      Place – distribution of the product to housebuilders is likely to be
      quite straightforward. Housebuilders are likely to order several/multiple
      products at any given time and the distribution channel is direct from
      manufacturer to final consumer (housebuilders).

      Individual households – marketing mix

      Price – because they are cheap to fit, the solar panels should also have a low
      initial price. A penetration pricing strategy could be used to convince people to
      buy them and given the “luxury” nature of the product, it can be argued that the
      product will be price elastic in nature. A penetration pricing strategy will help
      in this situation. Given that SunGen Ltd are effectively competing with
      electricity companies, they will need to take electricity pricing into account.
      As energy prices increase, it may be that they can move more towards a
      skimming pricing strategy.
      Product – the nature of the product will need to be stressed to ensure
      consumers are aware of the nature of the product. The ability of the product to
      generate electricity that can be fed back into the electricity grid may need to be
      stressed along with the characteristics of the product.

Promotion – the promotional strategy used for individual households is likely
to be more focused on above the line promotion. The market for individual
households is a geographically dispersed one and to reach them may require
above the line promotion strategies. These may include newspaper and
magazine advertising, internet advertising on appropriate lifestyle and other
web sites and perhaps radio and other media advertising. TV advertising is
very unlikely for a firm the size of SunGen Ltd. Point of sales promotion may
also be used in places where the panels are being made available.
Place – the market for solar panels is very geographically dispersed and this
will require appropriate national distribution channels. This may mean
franchising a dealer network or perhaps negotiating a deal with national DIY
chains or hardware stores. It may also be possible to use a B2C distribution
method through the Internet.

3.   (a)   (i)    Define the term working capital.                                             [2 marks]

                  Working capital is the amount of money that a business has to fund its
                  day-to-day operations. It is a measure of liquidity and can be calculated
                  by deducting current liabilities from current assets. It is the portion of
                  capitalization invested in current assets.

                  [2 marks]
                  A clear and appropriate definition of working capital.

                  [1 mark]

                  definition may be lacking in detail or clarity.

                  working capital.                                                             [2 marks]

                  The sources of finance could include short-term sources of finance
                  such as:
                  • bank overdraft
                  • debt factoring
                  • trade credit
                  • selling stock.

                  Award [1 mark] for each source identified up to a maximum
                  of [2 marks].

(b)   As a result of problems with suppliers, SunGen Ltd has decided to keep
      larger levels of stock. Comment on the effects that this decision will have
      on SunGen Ltd’s liquidity ratios.                                                      [4 marks]

      The two main liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the acid test ratio.
      The acid test ratio deducts stock from current assets to allow for the fact that
      stock is the least liquid of the current assets. The latest figures given in
      Appendix 3 indicate that SunGen Ltd has a current ratio of 1.1 and an acid test
      ratio of 0.6. The value of the acid test ratio indicates possible liquidity
      problems already. If SunGen Ltd choose to keep higher levels of stock because
      of their problems with suppliers then this is likely (ceteris paribus) to lead to an
      increase in the current ratio as their current assets grow. However, the higher
      levels of stock will have no impact on the acid test ratio as this excludes stock
      to give a better measure of liquidity.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      The impact of the higher stock levels on both the current and acid test ratios is
      appropriately considered and fully explained. For [4 marks] there is
      appropriate reference to the case study.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      There is some consideration of the impact of higher levels of stock
      on liquidity, but this may not include reference to the case or to both the
      current and acid test ratios.

(c)   Examine whether SunGen Ltd should implement a Total Quality
      Management approach as proposed by Catherine.                                        [7 marks]

      Catherine is a strong advocate of Total Quality Management (TQM) and
      wants to use quality circles. This approach will involve the whole workforce in
      ensuring quality at all stages of production. The TQM approach will need to
      be embedded in the culture of the company and may be expensive with the
      implementation of new systems. It should, however, identify quality issues
      before production has taken place in contrast to a traditional quality control
      approach that checks the quality of finished goods.

      The evaluation of the TQM approach needs to consider the merits of the
      approach in the context of SunGen Ltd. A wide range of points could
      be raised:
      • TQM would require a company-wide approach and commitment from
          all staff – is this likely to be available? Tony, the production manager has a
          more traditional approach to quality control and is keen to appoint new
          managers to take charge of quality. Will he be committed to this approach?
          Given that he is a key player in these changes, it will be important to know
          his view. Without a total commitment from Tony and all other staff,
          a more traditional approach may work better.
      • TQM could require substantial investment in staff training and is likely to
          take a considerable time to yield benefits, but the benefits are likely to be
          greater in the medium to long term than with traditional approaches.
      • TQM may put more emphasis on the process and not enough on
          the product. However, it may enable the company to focus more clearly on
          the needs of customers.
      • TQM may help develop a team approach to quality and involve all staff.
          This may help motivate staff. In contrast a more traditional approach may
          mean more autocratic leadership and may demotivate staff.
      • TQM focuses on finding quality problems before production, this ensures
          that the product shipped to customers is defect-free. This may help build
          better customer relations and may be more appropriate in the light of their
          expansion plans to individual households. Given some problems that they
          have had with quality, this may be a help in restoring better customer
          relationships.
      • a TQM approach may help improve communication flows – both formal
          and informal. This may help improve productivity and ensure better use of
          resources. A more traditional approach relies on top-down communication.
          Which of these approaches is more appropriate will depend on the
          perceived staff reaction to each approach.

                 Liquidity refers to how quickly and cheaply an asset can be converted
                 into cash. Money (in the form of cash) is the most liquid asset.

           (ii) Identify two appropriate          sources    of     finance   for   the   new

                 The new production plant will need to be financed from long-term
                 sources of finance. These may be either internal or external sources
                 of finance, though their room to manoeuvre may be a little restricted by
                 their current situation in terms of ownership and liquidity. They already
                 have a substantial loan and their gearing ratio is nearly 70 %. They are
                 not able to issue shares as they are a wholly owned subsidiary of
                 Electrical Solutions plc, though Electrical Solutions plc may be able to
                 issue shares and use this as a means to raise capital. Possible appropriate
                 sources of finance could therefore include:
                 • internal investment from Electrical Solutions plc – perhaps from
                     profit or cash reserves
                 • sale and leaseback – SunGen Ltd may be able to sell some assets and
                     lease them back, though this may be difficult given their rate
                     of expansion
                 • mortgage – it is possible that they could mortgage some of their
                     fixed assets (given fixed assets of $ 1.3 m). The viability of this
                     depends on the current ownership of the fixed assets
                 • joint venture – they could perhaps undertake a joint venture,
                     for example, with a production company in a related area of activity
                 • Government grant – they may be eligible for some local or national
                     grants because of their environmental profile
                 • any other relevant source of finance (though this must be in the
                     context of the case study).

(b)   (i)   Explain the difference between the net profit margin and the

            The gross profit margin measures the profitability of the firm once the
            cost of goods sold has been taken into account. It is calculated by
            dividing the gross profit by the turnover and multiplying by 100 to get
            the figure as a percentage. The net profit margin measures the
            profitability of the firm once the expenses have also been deducted. It is
            calculated by dividing the net profit by the turnover and multiplying by
            100 to get the figure as a percentage. The difference is therefore that the
            net profit margin is measured after expenses as well as the cost of goods

            [1 mark]
            Some appropriate elements of an explanation of the difference between
            the gross and net profit margin, but the explanation may be lacking in
            detail or clarity.

(ii)   Explain how the levels of profit and cash flow on the free standing
       solar panels are likely to change through the different stages of the
       product life cycle.                                                          [6 marks]

       The cash flow from a product like the free standing solar panels as it
       moves through its life cycle will change. Initially high development
       costs (likely for solar panels) and high promotional costs will mean a
       negative cash flow, but as the products moves through the growth phase
       and into maturity, the cash flow should start to become positive.
       This could be shown diagramatically.




       As a result profitability of the free standing solar panels will
       also change through the life cycle of the product. This will be partly due
       to the fact that price elasticity will tend to vary at each stage of the
       product life cycle.

                Demand becomes more elastic through product life cycle

In the growth phase of the product life cycle, the solar panels may tend
to be fairly price inelastic in nature. People buying at this stage will tend
to be “innovators” and they may be prepared to take risks with
new products. Price will not be such an important consideration for them
– they have a greater “need” for the product. This may lead to a high
profit margin at this stage of the product life cycle, though overall
profitability is likely to be low (or even negative) due to the high
development and production setup costs for the solar panels.

However, as the product moves towards maturity, the price elasticity
will increase. The amount of competition will increase and the
increasing number of substitutes will make consumers more
price sensitive. The nature of the consumers will also change and they
are likely to be more motivated to buy by factors like price,
functionality and reliability. This is particularly likely to be true for solar
panels as they gain more widespread acceptance. This may lead to a
lower profit margin at this stage of the product life cycle, though overall
profitability is likely to be higher due to higher sales and the fact that
introductory costs should have been paid off. Profitability will,
however, depend on the nature of the competition for the product.

N.B. Candidates may explain profitability without reference to elasticity
and this should be fully credited.

[5 to 6 marks]
A clear and detailed explanation of how both cash flow and the level
of profit will change through the life cycle of the solar panels.
The explanation is related, where appropriate, to the case study.

[3 to 4 marks]
Some explanation of how cash flow and the level of profit will change
through the life cycle of the panels though this may be lacking in balance
and consider one area in more depth than the other. Award a maximum
of [3 marks] if the change in just the cash flow or level of profit is
explained in detail.

[1 to 2 marks]
A limited answer that may identify some changes in cash flow and/or the
level of profit during the life cycle of the solar panels though this may
not be directly related to the case study.

(c)   Discuss the changes in the profit and liquidity ratios between 2006
      and 2007.                                                                           [8 marks]

      From a comparison of the ratios in Appendix 3 and the ratios given, it would
      appear that there has, in general terms, been a deterioration in the financial
      position of SunGen Ltd.         However, this is susceptible to a more
      detailed analysis. Relevant points to raise might include:

      Profitability

      Gross profit margin – this has improved, though is still showing a gross loss.
      Because the figure is negative, a reduction is an improvement. This may
      indicate either an increase in productivity/efficiency in production or perhaps
      simply better control over direct costs.

      Net profit margin – this has worsened. Given the improvement in the GPM,
      this may indicate poor control over indirect costs (overheads). However, there
      may be a number of other factors at play as well. There may be costs
      associated with expansionary activities/growth e.g. marketing activity related
      to the expansion to targeting individual households, market research costs,
      research and development activity relating to proposed new products or
      perhaps costs associated with the planned expansion of their production
      facilities (e.g. architect fees etc).

      ROCE – this has improved in the sense that it is not as bad as before.
      This indicates improved efficiency in terms of the use of their assets to
      deliver profit. This may be related to increases in production efficiency or
      other related factors.

      Liquidity

      Current ratio – this has deteriorated slightly, but is still 1.0 indicating
      perhaps just sufficient liquidity. However, when looked at along with the
      acid test ratio, it may well be that there is a problem. It would appear that
      stock is a significant proportion of current assets and this would make it
      difficult for them to realise assets sufficiently. It would appear that their
      working capital position has deteriorated further since 2006. Other factors
      behind this change could include a worsening in credit control, with debtor
      days increasing and creditor days falling or increasing by less than debtor days.

      Acid test ratio – the ATR has shown a significant worsening from 0.6 to 0.4.
      It was, arguably, already too low and has gone down significantly.
      This appears to indicate that stock is now a much higher proportion of their
      current assets and has significantly lowered their overall liquidity. It may be
      that they have increased stock due to the supplier problems they have had or
      perhaps due to a projected increase in demand. However, the ATR value does
      indicate a worrying shortage of working capital that may need addressing
      quite quickly.

(b)   Explain the purpose of SunGen Ltd having a mission statement and
      corporate objectives (Item 8).                                                     [8 marks]

      A mission statement is a statement of the philosophy and overall corporate
      aims of a business, which provides the guiding hand for all its operations.
      Corporate objectives are the intermediate goals of the organisation based upon
      its mission statement. These objectives detail targets for each division or
      department of the business, which must be realised if the firm is to achieve its
      longer-term aims.

      The purposes of having a mission statement and corporate objectives are to:
      • provide a focus for the organization and a sense of shared purpose,
         which directs and stimulates the organization and its stakeholders
      • determines the nature and direction of the organization
      • identifies purpose, strategy, values and standards of behaviour
      • gives employees a clear view of the importance of objectives such as
         quality and customer service
      • identifies the role of departments and individuals in the achievement of the
         company’s aims
      • allows authority to be delegated without loss of coordination.

      For SunGen Ltd the mission and corporate aims are likely to focus on its
      environmental aims and objectives, Total Quality Management and
      market/product development.

      [7 to 8 marks]
      A clear, relevant and developed explanation of the purpose of SunGen Ltd
      having a mission statement and corporate objectives. The concepts are well
      understood and applied.

      [4 to 6 marks]
      The explanation is relevant with some understanding of the concepts and an
      attempt to illustrate why SunGen Ltd requires a mission statement
      and/or objectives. At the top of the band there is more detail and development
      of concepts.

      [1 to 3 marks]
      A limited response, but with some, albeit limited, understanding of aims
      and objectives.

(c)   Using Items 2 to 8, analyse two issues that will influence SunGen Ltd’s
      decision to expand in Indonesia.                                                    [8 marks]

      Possible issues influencing SunGen Ltd’s decision to expand into
      Indonesia include:
      • the opportunity to develop solar roof tiles into a cash cow
      • the relatively higher rates of economic growth predicted in Indonesia
         compared to Australia where economic growth is set to slow considerably
      • the higher rates of inflation in Indonesia compared to Australia –
         although the trend in inflation is encouraging
      • the higher level of interest rates in Indonesia
      • the strengthening of the Australian Dollar compared to the Indonesian
         Rupiah
      • the higher population in Indonesia indicating a much larger potential
         market
      • the relatively higher increases in house prices over the next three years in
         Indonesia compared to Australia where prices are forecast to fall. This is
         shown by increases in the house price index in Indonesia as compared
         to Australia
      • the buoyant house market in Indonesia represented by new house
         starts/builds
      • the company mission to develop sustainable energy sources
      • satisfying the company objectives to expand in the Asia Pacific region
      • the corporate objective to maximise shareholder value
      • any other relevant issue from Items 2 to 8.

      The significance of the selected issue needs to be analysed and some reference
      made to whether these issues are negative or positive influences on
      SunGen Ltd’s decision. For instance, if the economic growth issue was raised,
      the effect on the housing market might be considered in terms of demand.
      If the rate of inflation or interest rates are identified, the effect on economic
      stability and the cost of housing would be relevant.

      [6 to 8 marks]
      Two issues are identified from Items 2 to 8, which will influence SunGen Ltd’s
      decision to expand in Indonesia. Each issue is analysed (in detail) as a positive
      or negative influence on SunGen Ltd by reference to the figures or
      data presented.

      [4 to 6 marks]
      At the top of the band two issues are analysed, although data may not be
      presented to support the examination and/or there may be no or little attempt to
      categorise the issues as positive or negative for SunGen Ltd. At the lower end
      of the band, the two issues may be merely outlined.

      [1 to 3 marks]
      A limited answer with maybe only one issue considered and no development
      of ideas.
                                            – 25 –          SPEC/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(d)   Using data from the case study and the additional information provided in
      Items 1 to 8, discuss SunGen Ltd’s strategic options for the coming
      three years.                                                                        [10 marks]

      The answer should be considered within a strategic framework of:
      • where SunGen Ltd is at present (strategic analysis)
      • the options available to SunGen Ltd over the coming three years
         (strategic choice)
      and
      • how SunGen Ltd may achieve its objectives (strategic implementation)

      It is to be expected that the answer will include relevant information from the
      case and items 1 to 8 and employ a range of business concepts, tools and
      terminology.

      Possible strategic options may include:
      • expansion into new markets, such as Indonesia and/or contraction of
         markets such as Australia
      • targeting new customers e.g. individual households rather than focusing on
         industrial markets
      • development and/or rationalisation of the product range
      • diversification into new markets with new products
      • expansion of production facilities and the greater implementation and
         application of automated manufacture and design, using a range of new
         technologies e.g. CAD/CAM
      • identifying new sources of finance
      • development of a greater environmental image, taking advantage of
         marketing and promotion opportunities
      • changes in corporate and organizational structure, e.g. changes in HR,
         flattening of structures, manpower planning, joint ventures and mergers
      • subcontracting of production and consideration of changes to
         distribution channels.

      In the discussion of options, there needs to be some appreciation of economic,
      market and social trends as well as the financial position of SunGen Ltd itself.
      A number of issues may be identified from items 1 to 8, for example:
      • problems with solar roof tiles and metal solar roofs, which have a relatively
          small revenue and risk becoming dog products
      • the decline in profitability in SunGen Ltd and liquidity problems hampering
          any future expansion
      • potential economic problems within Australia, e.g. higher levels of inflation
          leading to increases in interest rates and the effects of this on SunGen Ltd.
          A significant slowdown in economic growth in relation to other countries in
          the region such as Indonesia, which may offer greater future prospects
      • the impact of changes in exchange rates on exports and imports of parts and
          finished products, especially in relation to import into Australia from
          Indonesia and export of products from Australia to other countries in
          the region
                                      – 26 –          SPEC/3/BUSMT/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



• relative merits and demerits of expansion into Indonesia in terms of the size
  and development of markets and the forecasts for the coming three years
• changes within Australia in terms of environmental awareness and concern
  and the likely impact on SunGen Ltd’s operations and marketing
• specific actions to develop and implement SunGen Ltd’s mission and
  corporate objectives, such as sustainable energy sources and the
  implementation of social and environmental audits in light of changing
  attitudes and priorities.

Answers may include reference to theorists such as Porter and Handy and
the use of tools such as BCG (The Boston Consulting Group Matrix),
product life cycles and Ansoff’s matrix. Discussion may be supported by
financial data and the use of relevant financial ratios. Some supported
conclusions should be reached, such as a recommendation to accept JBR’s
proposal for a joint venture.

It should be recognised that, given time constraints, answers are likely to cover
only a few options and to include a much narrower range of issues and
concepts than identified above. There is no “correct” answer, but judgments
should be supported.

[9 to 10 marks]
There is a good appreciation of a range of options available to SunGen Ltd
given its internal and external environment. There is good understanding
of the significance and relevance of the data presented in the case study
and items 1 to 8, to the options identified. There is evidence of critical
thinking and synthesis of ideas. Supported judgments are made applying
relevant business theories and concepts.

[6 to 8 marks]
There is consideration of some options available to SunGen Ltd and the use
of data from the case study and items 1 to 8 to support the examination
and analysis. At the bottom of the band there may be an attempt to evaluate,
but this is very poor and/or limited in scope. At the upper end of the band the
discussion includes some supported conclusions and the inclusion of business
theory and concepts, although these may be limited in scope and depth.

[3 to 5 marks]
At the bottom end of the band, the answer is predominantly descriptive and
narrow in scope and depth. At the upper end of the band, there is some
analysis of the information provided in the case study and items 1 to 8. Any
evaluation is likely to be very simplistic.

[1 to 2 marks]
A limited and generalised answer, which may be little more than a list
of disconnected and unsupported statements and proposals. Little use is made
of the data available.

Answer one question from this section.

1.   Chinese Medicine

     Mrs Chen owns a small traditional Chinese medicine chain store in a large city in China. The chain is
     known for the excellent quality of its fresh medicine as well as a reliable and quick service. Mrs Chen’s
     success is mainly due to a well established very close relationship based on mutual trust and open
     communication with her local suppliers who are able to quickly supply any type of medicine required
     by the clients.

     As the company is becoming more profitable, Mrs Chen is thinking of expanding the store’s
     activities.

     The expansion may be within China or, indeed, outside China so as to meet the needs of the growing
     Chinese communities abroad. The success of the proposed expansion is likely to be dependent on
     regional levels of economic growth.

     Mrs Chen is currently considering several options. The estimated costs of each individual option and
     the expected profit (loss) for each option are:

                                           Expected return ($) under different economic conditions

2.   Willow Carpets

     Willow Carpets, a regional manufacturer of carpeting for high-end commercial and institutional
     office space, is changing from the use of synthetic to natural fibres in its carpets.   By making
     the change, Willow Carpets intends, in the long run, to be the market leader in its segment by
     appealing to the increasingly environmentally conscious among its end-users.  This change is part
     of a multi-year shift in Willow Carpets’ operations to become “green”, or environmentally friendly.

     The change will affect the firm’s cost structure:
     • because of the higher cost of natural fibres, in the short run Willow Carpets will experience a
       12.5 % increase in its variable cost per square metre, to €4.5
     • to be consistent with its use of natural fibres, Willow Carpets will also shift to using a natural
       cleaning solvent for its machinery, increasing fixed costs of the manufacturing facility from
       €2 400 000 to €2 520 000 for the coming year
     • other expenses (administrative and other), and other fixed costs, will be €1 200 000.

     On average, Willow Carpets sells its carpets for €18 per square metre, and the firm will not be able to
     raise prices for at least several years.

     In the years, however, Willow Carpets anticipates seeing its market share grow, as consumers are
     increasingly demanding environmentally friendly products. Willow Carpets also believes that it can
     eventually position itself as a local price leader, enabling it to raise the price of carpets significantly
     and eventually to earn better margins than before the shift to natural fibres.


     (a)   Define the terms variable cost and fixed cost.                                            [4 marks]

     (b)   (i)    Calculate Willow Carpets’ break-even point, expressed in number of
                  square metres of carpet, if it continued to use synthetic fibres and after it
                  has switched to the use of natural fibres.  (Show all your working)                [4 marks]

           (ii)   Construct a break-even chart for Willow Carpets under its new
                  “green” approach.                                                                  [6 marks]

           (iii) Explain the impact on the break-even level of output and margin of safety
                 of an increase in global prices of natural fibres.                                  [5 marks]

     (c)   Examine Willow Carpets’ possible motives in shifting to natural fibres.                   [6 marks]

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Wedding Bliss

     Zara Bliss is a successful sole trader who designs and hand-makes tailor-made wedding clothes for
     both brides and grooms from the local area. Factors contributing to her success include:
     • an excellent reputation for unique and creative designs branded as Wedding Bliss
     • close relationships with her customers who look for original designs and are willing to pay a high
       price for the unique product and the service.

     Zara enjoys flexible working time as she operates from a studio at home.  She values her complete
     creative freedom but dislikes the administrative side of the business.

     Demand for Zara’s clothes is seasonal.  At certain times, she is unable to satisfy all customer orders.
     As a consequence, some of her customers have gone to her competitors.  Zara wants to expand her
     business and to create a new line of clothes in order to reduce the waiting time as well as to ensure
     more consistent cash flows.  She is considering some external growth options.

     A national clothes manufacturer, Belle Ltd, has approached her in order to buy her brand name
     and employ her as designer and creative director. The competitive advantage of the clothes
     manufacturer lies in mass-market affordable wedding clothes.  Zara has been offered a good salary
     and 10 % ownership.

     Zara is under pressure to decide quickly but she feels that she needs to apply a more formal
     decision-making process.


     (a)   Identify four stages in a formal decision-making framework.                           [4 marks]

     (b)   With reference to the stimulus material explain the differences between internal
           and external growth.                                                                  [6 marks]

     (c)   Use Porter’s Generic Strategies Model to examine the change in the competitive
           advantage of Wedding Bliss if the brand is taken over by Belle Ltd.                   [6 marks]

     (d)   Discuss whether Zara Bliss should remain as a small sole-trader or accept the
           offer from Belle Ltd.                                                                 [9 marks]

4.   Yum!

     Yum! is one of the biggest companies in the fast-food industry in America.  In 2004 it earned pre-tax
     profit of $1 billion on sales of $9 billion.  Yum! is the parent of the Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC),
     Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands.

     Mr Novak, the Chairperson of the company, has declared that he is going to improve the
     relationship with the franchisees, who own 75 % of 43 000 Yum! restaurants around the world
     (consequently restaurant managers get stock options).

     Yum! gains economies of scale across its restaurant brands through:
     • centralized purchasing and organization of advertising
     • collective acquisition of restaurant sites
     • bringing international operations within a single organization
     • putting several brands into a single restaurant unit with one operating kitchen.

     Mr Novak believes that there is potential for further growth in the American market.
     Analysts, however, think that there is little scope for fast-food companies to grow in America
     by opening new outlets. Three quarters of Americans already live within three miles of a
     fast-food outlet.  To expand, fast-food chains would have to win business from one another.

     Analysts are more optimistic about growth in the European and Asian markets.  By entering China,
     Yum! has gained first mover advantage and now has twice the number of restaurants of its nearest
     rival – McDonald’s.

     Yum! like other fast food companies has felt obliged to respond to health concerns. It has put more
     salads and lighter dishes on its menus in order to attract the health conscious eaters.

5.   Body Beautiful

     Body Beautiful Ltd is a company that owns a health club in a central city location. In the last
     three years the local city government, in an attempt to encourage a healthier lifestyle, have given two
     new competitors a licence to build nearby health clubs.  One of the new health clubs, Well-Being has
     attracted many customers of Body Beautiful Ltd by creating a range of additional service benefits.  
     These include:
     • online booking for all exercise classes
     • self-health monitoring systems using the latest technology
     • the provision of a health clinic run by a doctor on site.

     The market research carried out by Well-Being revealed that their customers, largely wealthy
     35-55 year old professionals, perceived the service benefits as distinct unique selling propositions.  
     Well Being customers are, therefore, very loyal to the new brand.

     The management of Body Beautiful in order to become more customer-focused and competitive
     decided to:
     • research the needs and profiles of current and potential customers to reduce the movement of
        members to the new clubs and to attract new customers
     • target a new untapped segment – teenagers who are not very health conscious and who are looking
        for technologically advanced gym equipment
     • replace some of the dated equipment with newer models supplied by an internationally branded
        single supplier. The price of the equipment is very high and the waiting time for the new
        equipment is at least six months.


     (a)   Identify two primary sources and two secondary sources that Body Beautiful can
           use in its market research.                                                           [4 marks]

     (b)   Using both above and below the line promotional techniques, prepare a
           promotional mix for Body Beautiful to attract “teenagers who are not very
           health conscious”.                                                                    [6 marks]

     (c)   Analyse the usefulness of market segmentation for a health club like
           Body Beautiful.                                                                       [6 marks]

     (d)   With reference to Porter’s Five Forces model, evaluate three of the competitive
           forces affecting Body Beautiful in the health club market.                            [9 marks]

                                                SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe the type of growth that Mrs Chen is considering for expansion.                [4 marks]

           Mrs Chen is considering internal growth as a method of expansion.
           Internal growth arises from within the company through increasing sales of
           existing products and/or launching new products. Mrs Chen is considering
           both expansion into the US or Europe with the current product range as well as
           expansion within China, possibly with the introduction of new products.
           This growth method is slower than external growth – merger or acquisition –
           and is usually financed by debt or reinvesting profit. Mrs Chen is likely to use
           her growing profit to finance the growth.

           [3 to 4 marks]
           The internal growth method is accurately described with relevant and specific
           reference to Mrs Chen’s options.

           [1 to 2 marks]
           The internal growth method is briefly described or merely listed. Limited,
           if any, reference is made to the stimulus material.

     (b)   (i)     Construct a decision tree and calculate the predicted outcome for
                   each expansion option. (Show all your working)                                 [7 marks]

(iii) Explain two possible positive effects on Mrs Chen’s Chinese medicine
      business resulting from worsening economic conditions in China.                [6 marks]

       Two possible positive effects may include:
       • as income falls some people might not be able to afford private
         health care, and resort to buying Chinese medicine. The demand
         will increase
       • during worsening economic conditions the price level is unlikely
         to decrease. Mrs Chen’s products may become more internationally
         competitive. Her demand and profit is likely to increase
       • due to a decrease in economic activities in China Mrs Chen might be
         able to negotiate lower prices from her supplier and stock for
         better days
       • Mrs Chen might be able to negotiate a lower interest rate from the
         bank to finance her proposed expansion
       • any other relevant issue explained.

       [5 to 6 marks]
       A clear and detailed explanation of two possible positive effects resulting
       from worsening economic conditions in China. Reference is made to
       Mrs Chen’s Chinese medicine business.

(c) Analyse the usefulness of the decision tree model for Mrs Chen.                   [6 marks]

    The use and construction of the decision tree model will enable Mrs Chen to:
    • visually see some courses of action not previously considered
    • place numerical values on decisions
    • incorporate the risk involved in each decision by considering the
       probability of each event occurring.

    All of the above should enable Mrs Chen to improve the decision-making
    process and, therefore, the results.

    On the other hand the limitations of this technique may include:
    • the financial information is not exact and figures are merely estimated
    • the probabilities also are only estimated
    • non-financial, qualitative factors are not incorporated into the decision-
       making process. Some qualitative issues might be more significant than the
       quantitative ones
    • time lag occurs in decision-making and, therefore, some of the numerical
       information may be out of date.

           Fixed costs are production costs that do not depend on the level of output.
           Fixed costs could include loan repayments, security costs and marketing and
           administration costs. Fixed costs are often also termed as overheads.

           Variable costs are costs that vary with the level of output. Variable costs
           include costs like raw materials and labour costs that are directly attributable
           to production.

(b)   (i)   Calculate Willow Carpets’ break-even point, expressed in number of
            square metres of carpet, if it continued to use synthetic fibres and
            after it has switched to the use of natural fibres. (Show all
            your working)                                                              [4 marks]

            Break-even point = fixed costs / contribution

            Break-even point – synthetic fibres

            Price = €18
            Variable cost per unit = €4.5 less 12.5 % = €3.94

            Therefore contribution = €14.06

            Break-even = 3 600 000 / 14.06 = 256 045 sq metres

            Break-even point – all natural fibres

            Price = €18
            Variable cost per unit = €4.5

            Therefore contribution = €13.5

            Break-even = 3 720 000 / 13.5 = 275 556 sq metres

      (iii) Explain the impact on the break-even level of output and margin of
            safety of an increase in global prices of natural fibres.                       [5 marks]

           The use of natural fibres represent a variable cost for Willow Carpets and
           so any increase in the price of these will cause an increase in variable
           cost per unit. This will have the effect of shifting the total cost curve
           upwards and so will increase the break-even level of output and reduce
           the margin of safety at the current level of output. The diagram below
           illustrates this.
                                                                    TR

(c)   Examine Willow Carpets’ possible motives in shifting to natural fibres.             [6 marks]

      Willow Carpets appear to be trying to anticipate a changing pattern of demand
      among consumers and turning this to their advantage in a marketing context.
      Increased environmental awareness among consumers has led to a changing
      pattern of demand with greater demand for environmentally friendly products.
      By adopting this “greener” approach now, it will enable Willow Carpets to
      develop a unique selling proposition and act as a market leader. This may also
      enable them to operate as a price leader in the market in the future and earn
      better margins.

      The higher costs of using natural fibres may be compensated by a higher level
      of demand and ultimately higher margins in the future. It may even be that in
      the short term the demand for carpets made from natural fibres is more price
      inelastic and this may enable them to charge relatively prices and restore
      their margins, but this will depend on the extent of competition in the market.

           The stages of a scientific decision-making process:
           • identify objectives

           • analyse information and ideas
           • choose a course of action

           • measure outcome
           • evaluate the result and report
           • revise objectives/information.

           Award [1 mark] for each stage correctly identified up to a maximum of
           [4 marks]. The stages identified do not necessarily have to be in the
           correct order.

     (b)   With reference to the stimulus material explain the differences between
           internal and external growth.                                                     [6 marks]

           Internal growth arises from within the company. The company grows by using
           its own resources. The expansion is based on reinvested profit or debt finance.
           For example, Zara uses the profit to move to bigger premises or Zara buys
           another machine.

           External growth arises when a firm increases its size by taking over or merging
           with another firm (integration). The external growth options are faster.
           Zara merges with another sole trader or with a private limited company as
           mentioned in the case. Zara changes her company to a private limited
           company by issuing shares privately.

                                      Porter’s four strategies are summarized in the figure below:

                                         Low

                                                              Narrow                                  Broad

                                                                       Scope of business activities

                                      The differentiation and cost leadership strategies seek competitive advantage in
                                      a broad range of market or industry segments. By contrast, the differentiation
                                      focus and cost focus strategies are adopted in a narrow market or industry.

                                      Strategy – Differentiation
                                      This strategy involves selecting one or more criteria that is used by buyers in
                                      a market – and then positioning the business uniquely to meet those criteria.
                                      This strategy is usually associated with charging a premium price for
                                      the product – often to reflect the higher production costs and extra value-added
                                      features provided for the consumer. Differentiation is about charging a
                                      premium price that more than covers the additional production costs, and about
                                      giving customers clear reasons to prefer the product over other,
                                      less differentiated products.

Strategy – Cost leadership
A business aim is to become the lowest-cost producer in the industry.
This strategy is usually associated with large-scale businesses offering
“standard” products with relatively little differentiation that are perfectly
acceptable to the majority of customers.

Strategy – Differentiation focus
A business aims to differentiate within just one or a small number of target
market segments. The special customer needs of the segment mean that there
are opportunities to provide products that are clearly different from competitors
who may be targeting a broader group of customers. The important issue for
any business adopting this strategy is to ensure that customers really do have
different needs and wants - in other words that there is a valid basis
for differentiation – and that existing competitor products are not meeting
those needs and wants.

Strategy – Cost focus
A business seeks a lower-cost advantage in one or a small number of
market segments. The product will be basic – perhaps a similar product to the
higher-priced and featured market leaders, but acceptable to sufficient
consumers. Such products are often called “me-too’s”.

Currently Zara is using a differentiation focus strategy. She has created a
unique competitive advantage by providing hand made/tailor-made wedding
clothes for brides and grooms. She charges a premium price for her highly
differentiated product that customers are willing to pay for. If she merges with
a national mass producer clothes manufacturer – Bell Ltd, the chance is that she
will follow the current strategy used by the organisation, which is
cost leadership. The competitive strategy is based on mass production,
undifferentiated, standard products for which the customers pay low prices.
Both strategies can be very profitable.

(d)   Discuss whether Zara Bliss should remain as a small sole-trader or accept
      the offer from Belle Ltd.                                                        [9 marks]

      The merits of Wedding Bliss being a sole-trader are:
      • Zara has sole ownership
      • Zara can make all the decisions and, therefore, is able to keep her flexible
         working pattern
      • Zara keeps all profit
      • limited formal documentation is needed and this is Zara’s preference.
         She dislikes administrative tasks
      • Wedding Bliss can be a very customer focused organization and so it can
         continue the close relationship with its customers. Being customer focused
         is the main contributor to her current success
      • Zara can also have complete creative freedom and flexibility – issues of
         significant importance for her
      • any other relevant point.

      However:
      • Zara is losing customers during the busy period. Irreversible damage can
        be done to the brand image
      • Zara as an owner has an unlimited liability and might lose her personal
        assets in case of financial difficulties
      • Zara wants her business to grow and she may also find it difficult as a
        sole-trader to raise more finance in order to grow
      • given the fact that she actually wants to grow, Zara will have to be legally
        responsible for the increased administration
      • limited opportunities for Zara to specialize if the firm grows.

      The merit of Wedding Bliss becoming part of a large private limited company:
      • Zara as well as the other shareholders will have limited liability
      • Zara can share responsibilities of running the business with other owners
      • Zara can still specialise in the design side rather than the administrative
         side
      • ownership will not be lost to outsiders
      • the mass-market production/flow production technique is likely to result in
         lower cost of production due to economies of scale. Therefore, profit may
         increase and Zara will have 10 % ownership.

      However:
      • Wedding Bliss will lose its unique selling point of being a
        customer-focused company. By not using a job production method to
        tailor-make wedding clothes the brand may be eroded
      • 10 % ownership will not give Zara a significant input into decision-making
      • Zara may lose her highly valued current flexibility.

It looks as if the merits for Wedding Bliss of remaining a highly customer
focused/sole-trader organization outweigh the disadvantages. Moreover,
Zara can still grow and employ an administrative manager while maintaining
her interest and talent. Perhaps a partnership would be a better option.

4.   (a)   Define the terms economies of scale and franchisee.                                 [4 marks]

           Economies of scale – the reduction in the long run unit costs as the scale of
           production increases

           A franchisee is a person or a company who has bought the local rights to use
           the name, logos and training methods of another company.

           but the definition may be lacking in detail or clarity. [2 marks] for a clear and
           appropriate definition of economies of scale.

     (b)   Explain how Yum! benefits from two types of internal economies of scale.            [6 marks]

           Based on the information provided in the stimulus Yum! benefits from:
           • Marketing economies of scale as it is able to purchase advertising slots
              and run an advertising campaign collectively. Given the enormous power
              of Yum!, the costs per unit of the above will reduce considerably.
           • Purchasing economies of scale – Yum! is able to acquire restaurant sites
              for all of its brands collectively. This gives Yum! a considerable bargaining
              power that is likely to result in lower costs per site.
           • Technical economies of scale – as large plants are often more efficient
              Yum! puts several brands into a single kitchen. The increase in kitchen size
              does not increase the cost proportionately as the equipment can be used for
              longer or for larger output. Therefore, cost per unit will fall.

           [5 to 6 marks]
           A clear and detailed explanation of two relevant types of internal economies
           of scale. Direct reference is made to Yum! and to the stimulus material.

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages to Yum! of operating their
      restaurants as franchises.                                                        [6 marks]

      The possible advantages for Yum! of operating their restaurants as
      franchises are:
      • it facilitates quick growth/expansion without incurring high capital costs.
          Given Yum!’s desire for growth it can be a good option
      • further global presence can be established rapidly with minimal risk.
          Yum! will be able to compete more easily with other famous
          branded franchisors
      • Yum! will save on running costs of the branches as the franchisee will
          finance most of the investment
      • the franchisee is likely to be highly motivated and interested in running the
          business and will have local knowledge
      • royalties as well as a sign-on payment will be paid to Yum!
      • any other relevant point.

      The possible disadvantages for Yum! of operating their restaurants as
      franchises are:
      • operational methods to ensure uniformity of service and quality standards
          may not be adhered to
      • the franchisee may have different objectives from those of Yum! so
          conflicts may occur
      • failure of an individual franchisee can seriously affect the brand image
          of Yum!
      • Yum! might have to pay for some initial training costs as well as marketing
          and supervision costs. Given Yum!’s global reach, these costs can
          be significant
      • any other relevant point.

(d)   Using the Ansoff Matrix, evaluate the strategic growth options available
      to Yum!.                                                                           [9 marks]

            Market


                     Present           Market penetration   Product development



                      New             Market development        Diversification




      Mr Novak believes that there is further scope for a market penetration strategy,
      whereby Yum! will further penetrate the American (home) market.
      However, analysts believe that this market is saturated as three quarters of all
      Americans live within three miles of a fast food outlet. Continuing with this
      strategic growth option may result in a price war with its major competitors.
      Yum! may see its profits falling if prices are significantly reduced to
      attract customers.

      Given the market analysts’ more optimistic prediction about Europe and Asia,
      Yum! can continue to use a market development strategy into new places in
      Europe and into some Asian markets. Yum! has used this strategy before as it
      is said that in China it has the first mover advantage. Yum!, therefore,
      has the knowledge and the experience of using this strategic growth
      option successfully.

      Another strategic growth option available for Yum! is of product development.
      Yum! has started to respond to the social changes in the external environment
      and cater for the health conscious people by providing salads and
      lighter dishes. Given this trend, Yum! should further continue to develop other
      products for health conscious customers. From the analysis above it appears
      that Yum! can opt for the two options of growth – market development and
      product development.

      Accept any other evaluation (the choice of one option, for example) provided it
      is well substantiated.

5.   (a)   Identify two primary sources and two secondary                    sources   that
           Body Beautiful can use in its market research.                                      [4 marks]

           Primary research involves the collection of first hand information that does not
           already exist within the company. Possible primary sources may include:
           • the use of a focus groups like teenagers/current customers
           • questionnaires to current members and to non-members
           • interviews with customers
           • telephone/on line surveys on the needs of teenagers and current customers
           • first hand and personal experience of competitor facilities.

           Secondary research involves the use of information that already exists.
           Possible secondary sources may include:
           • Government, other relevant general and specific publications as well as
              Internet sites on demography, social trends, and life style/leisure activities
              of various segments
           • economic forecasts such as changing income, employment, interest rates
           • statistics/information published by the competitors or about the
              competitors.

           Any other relevant suggestion for both primary and secondary sources.

           the case up to a maximum of [2 marks]. [1 mark] for each correct
           identification of a secondary source that is relevant to the case up to a
           maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Using both above and below the line promotional techniques, prepare a
      promotional mix for Body Beautiful to attract “teenagers who are not very
      health conscious”.                                                                  [6 marks]

      The response to this question is a rather open ended one. It is expected that the
      candidates use examples of both below and above the line promotion
      techniques and a promotional mix that are relevant and applicable to the
      teenage segment. The use of the various promotional mix components should
      be consistent.

      For example:
      • promotions below the line may include sales promotion like product
         endorsement by a famous popular sport personality who explains the
         benefits of health clubs; product placing on TV programmes watched by the
         youth segment; free trial offers or gifts which are appealing
         to teenagers
      • direct mailing after identifying the e-mail address of teenagers
      • articles about the benefits of sport activities placed in magazines targeting
         teenagers (PR)
      • above the line promotion may include advertising placed in local
         magazines and newspapers that the teenager segment is likely to read or
         cinemas as well as schools and other places they are likely to visit.
         Posters can also be placed near schools and so on
      • credit any other relevant suggestion.

      [5 to 6 marks]
      A promotional mix incorporating the use of both below and above the line
      promotion techniques.       The promotional mix is appropriate to the
      youth segment. Relevant reference is made to the service/products that
      Body Beautiful is offering.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      A promotional mix incorporating the use of below and/or above the
      line promotion. Some reference is made to the teenage segment at the upper
      end of the band.

(c)   Analyse the usefulness of market segmentation for a health club like
      Body Beautiful.                                                                    [6 marks]

      Market segmentation – dividing the market into distinct groups of buyers with
      different characteristics, behaviour and needs that require a separate
      product/service or marketing mix.
      Through market segmentation Body Beautiful will collect specific information
      and knowledge on the relevant segments and consequently will be able to:
      • target the most relevant segment(s)
      • adapt, vary and differentiate its service so as to satisfy individual
          segment(s) specific needs and, therefore, become a more customer-focused
          organization
      • differentiate and so become more competitive in a highly competitive
          market
      • develop a more concentrated marketing effort – Body Beautiful will adapt
          its marketing mix and so increase revenue while reducing costs.

      However:
      • Body Beautiful must ensure that its chosen characteristic for segmentation
        (age) is a relevant one so that profits are increased rather than decreased
      • a lot of money might be spent on market research
      • the youth market can be very volatile and young people can change their
        mind quite often and look for a different experience somewhere else
      • other competitors may copy the Body Beautiful strategy.

      Given its current volatile competitive position and provided that Body Beautiful
      researches the market thoroughly, segmentation of an untapped market can
      be useful.

(d)   With reference to Porter’s Five Forces model, evaluate three of the
      competitive forces affecting Body Beautiful in the health club market.                [9 marks]

      Porter Five Forces Model:


                                         New entrants


                                        Threat of
                                          new
                                        entrants


                                           Industry
                     Bargaining power     competitors        Bargaining power
                       of suppliers                              of buyers
       Suppliers                          Intensity of                          Buyers
                                            rivalry



                                                     Threat of
                                                    substitutes


                                          Substitutes


      The threat of new entrants is very high. Two other competitors have just
      entered into the market and the likelihood is that given the current
      government policy, more will apply for a license to operate.

      The bargaining power of the buyers is also extremely high. More choices and
      better facilities provided by more competition has already created less loyalty
      and some customers have moved to the new health clubs. This trend is likely
      to continue if Body Beautiful does not become more competitive.
      Therefore, the threat of a substitute is also very high especially as some of the
      customers perceive Well-Being to be better.

      The bargaining power of the suppliers of the state of the art gym equipment is
      very high. Unless Body Beautiful finds new suppliers without compromising
      on quality, the opportunity to negotiate better prices is very limited. It looks as
      if the rivalry between the competitors is intense as the government tries to
      increase the level of competition. It is unlikely that Body Beautiful will be able
      to influence either the government policy or the supplier policy.

      Body Beautiful is currently in a very vulnerable position and should indeed take
      the suggested actions to reduce the threat of substitutes and the bargaining
      power of its customers by becoming a more customer-focused organization and
      by differentiation of services.

           significant proportion of their staff internally from Electrical Solutions plc
           (line 108).                                                                      [4 marks]

                                             SECTION A

1.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of SunGen Ltd recruiting a
           significant proportion of their staff internally from Electrical Solutions plc
           (Line 108).                                                                        [4 marks]

           Initially a significant proportion of the staff for SunGen Ltd were recruited
           internally from Electrical Solutions plc. This may result in various advantages
           and disadvantages:

           Advantages
           • appropriate staff can be selected and their skills, abilities and experience
             will be well known. This is a good way to ensure an appropriate balance of
             skills and experience for the SunGen Ltd start-up
           • the process of recruitment is likely to be faster and more efficient by
             recruiting staff internally
           • any other appropriate advantage.

           Disadvantages
           • the internally recruited staff may form an informal group with differing
              aims and objectives from other groups. This may result in the potential for
              conflict within SunGen Ltd staff
           • recruiting a large proportion of staff internally may result in missing out on
              external expertise that could potentially have been more specialist and
              appropriate for a startup in a different area of business
           • the recruitment of a large proportion of staff internally may be a
              demotivating factor for other SunGen Ltd staff
           • any other appropriate disadvantage.

           Award [2 marks] for an appropriate description of an advantage and
           [2 marks] for an appropriate description of a disadvantage. Maximum of
           [4 marks].
                                             –4–              SPEC/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   Explain the effect on motivation of offering high performing staff
      significant financial bonuses (lines 129-130).                                       [4 marks]

      The impact of the financial bonuses on motivation will depend on the
      importance of financial reward to employees and this may vary from one
      member of staff to another. Some will regard recognition and responsibility
      (non-financial factors) as more important and in these cases, the impact on
      motivation of the bonuses is likely to be lower. However, we can reasonably
      expect that the bonuses will have the following effects on motivation:
      • financial bonuses are likely to boost motivation. Financial bonuses for
         good performance are likely to be considered as a form of recognition for a
         “job well-done” and this may help boost esteem needs (as identified in
         Maslow’s hierarchy of needs)
      • the bonuses may also, on the basis that they act as a form of recognition,
         act as a “motivator” as identified by Herzberg
      • in terms of equity theories of motivation, the high-performing staff will feel
         that their contribution has been recognised and perhaps therefore feel that
         their remuneration package is fair.

      Overall, motivation can be expected to increase – it is the extent of the increase
      that cannot be certain. Arguably, high-performing staff will be the most
      motivated already and therefore the impact on motivation might be less
      than expected.

      N.B. Candidates need not refer to the work of specific theorists in
      their answers, but can be credited appropriately if they choose to.

      [4 marks]
      The impact of the bonuses on motivation is fully and clearly explained.

      [2 to 3 marks]
      The impact of the bonuses on motivation is explained, but the explanation may
      be lacking in detail.

      [1 mark]
      A limited answer that may simply identify the impact of the bonuses
      on motivation.
                                           –5–             SPEC/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Analyse the costs and benefits of changing the organizational structure of
      SunGen Ltd to a flatter structure (line 110).                                    [7 marks]

      Flatter organizations will have various advantages:
      • faster vertical communication flows – this may help SunGen Ltd to
         improve efficiency and enable faster decision-making with clearer
         implementation of strategy. Workers have been concerned at a lack of
         leadership and vision and this may help communication of the strategic
         direction better.
      • employees may feel more empowered if they are more involved with
         decision-making in a flatter structure. This may result in a boost in
         motivation and again help create a clearer sense of vision for the company.
      • flatter structures may help reduce costs with fewer staff in middle
         management positions. Given the recent growth in costs this may help
         make SunGen Ltd profitable quicker.
      • flatter structures may, if employees are given more responsibility and
         feel empowered, lead to a more innovative and creative workforce, which is
         vital in a fast-moving industry like the one SunGen Ltd is operating in.
      • flatter structures may be more efficient particularly when firms are small
         (as SunGen Ltd is) and when the staff are highly involved with the product,
         which is likely to be true for SunGen Ltd. This may help increase
         productivity and therefore enable a faster route to productivity and more
         efficient use of the existing resources.

      However, there are likely to be disadvantages:
      • staff may lack direction – this appears to be a problem already at
        SunGen Ltd and given that a flatter structure might increase the span
        of control, this might worsen the situation.
      • communication might fail or be distorted. Where there is a larger span of
        control and a flatter structure, there may be faster vertical flows
        of information, but there may be horizontal communication problems with
        information not adequately reaching all members of staff at a given level.
      • decisions that are made may not reach all staff on time and this may result
        in delays in production. Given that these are already occurring at
        SunGen Ltd and that problems have led to delays in production, this may
        worsen the situation. Appropriate communication strategies will be
        required to ensure that this is not an issue.
      • decisions might take longer if consensus is sought and more staff are
        involved in decision-making. As SunGen Ltd work in a fast-moving,
        rapid development industry, this may hold back their growth.
      • staff may be demotivated by a lack of promotion opportunities because of
        the flatter structure. The extent of this demotivation will depend on the
        extent to which the flatter structure helps boost involvement and
        empowerment and compensates for this.
      • the greater span of control may make it more difficult for managers to
        “control” staff at their level and put them under increased time pressure
        and stress.

2.   (a)   (i)    Define the term unique selling point.                                         [2 marks]

                  The unique selling point (or unique selling proposition) is the principal
                  characteristic of a good or service that separates it from its competitors.
                  According to this concept, successful advertising campaigns are based on
                  emphasising a product's unique selling proposition. It is the thing that
                  will make customer’s choose the product over other similar ones in
                  the market.

                  [2 marks]
                  A clear and appropriate definition of unique selling point.

                  [1 mark]
                  Some appropriate elements of a definition of unique selling point, but the
                  definition may be lacking in detail or clarity.

           (ii)   Describe the unique selling point for SunGen Ltd.                             [2 marks]

                  The unique selling point (USP) for SunGen Ltd is the environmentally
                  friendly nature of their product. The ability to generate free electricity
                  from the product and thereby avoid the environmental impact of other
                  forms of energy.

                  Credit candidates if they describe another different, but nevertheless
                  appropriate USP.

                  [2 marks]
                  Identification and clear description, of an appropriate USP for
                  SunGen Ltd.

                  [1 mark]
                  Identification of an appropriate USP, perhaps with some description but
                  lacking clarity.

(b)   Explain one external opportunity and one external threat that
      SunGen Ltd is facing as a result of their expansion plan.                         [4 marks]

      The SunGen Ltd expansion plan is to target their products “at individual
      households”. Their current target market is mainly housebuilders who use the
      product on new properties or houses being restored professionally.
      The intention of the expansion plan is to start to broaden the target market to
      individual households. This may result in a number of external opportunities
      and threats:

      Opportunities
      • Governments are under pressure to meet tighter environmental targets from
        international treaty obligations (e.g. Kyoto treaty) and this may result in
        incentives being offered to households to purchase products of this nature.
        If SunGen Ltd has in place appropriate distribution strategies for their
        products to individual households, then they will be able to take advantage
        of this. SunGen Ltd are also, through a PR firm, trying to put pressure on
        the government to introduce these kind of regulations and also tighten
        environmental regulations. Their expansion plan will put them in a better
        position to take advantage of this potential new market.
      • The market for solar power products is growing at around 20 % per year
        and their expansion plan will put them in a better position to take
        advantage of this market growth.
      • There are currently few competitors and there are important differences in
        their products. SunGen Ltd’s expansion plan will put them in a better
        position to gain first-mover advantage in this new market segment.
      • Environmental awareness is increasing among individual consumers and
        the expansion plan will help SunGen Ltd take advantage of this as it will
        enable them to build appropriate distribution channels to meet this
        potential demand.
      • Any other appropriate external opportunity.

Threats
• A reduction in economic growth is forecast, and though this is not
  a recession, SunGen Ltd’s products are arguably income elastic in nature
  and so the lower level of economic growth may lead to a fall in expenditure
  on solar power products.
• The market is still risky.              Although SunGen Ltd would have
  first-mover advantage, it is still a niche market in nature and the results of
  the market research could be argued to be a little ambiguous. This may
  represent a threat to their abilities to expand into this new market.
• The market is geographically dispersed in nature and this may represent a
  challenge to the setting up of appropriate distribution channels.
• The rapid growth forecast in the market may attract new firms into the
  market and this will be a potential threat to SunGen Ltd’s position in
  this market.
• Some increase in inflation is forecast and this may lead to uncertainty
  among consumers. This combined with the drop in economic growth could
  potentially reduce the growth forecast in the market.
• Any other appropriate external threat.

(c)   House builders are the current target market of SunGen Ltd. SunGen Ltd
      is considering targeting individual households.

      Examine the marketing mix that would be appropriate for each of these
      target markets.                                                                      [7 marks]

      The market for individual households is being targeted by SunGen Ltd as part
      of their expansion plan. The marketing mix that is appropriate to this market is
      likely to be different in nature to that currently required for the target market
      of housebuilders.

      House builders – marketing mix

      Price – price will be important to housebuilders as it will represent an
      important element of their costs and they will want to minimise these.
      SunGen Ltd may use cost-based pricing or a similar pricing strategy to ensure
      they are competitive and encourage the maximum possible level of demand.
      Product – housebuilders will be a very “technically-aware” market and so
      SunGen Ltd will emphasise the nature of the product in their marketing mix.
      They will want to stress the various different versions of the product available
      and ensure that they fit in with the various different requirements of the
      housebuilder market.
      Promotion – the promotional strategy used for housebuilders will be quite
      specific and is likely to focus mainly on the use of below the line
      promotional strategies. The use of targeted e-mail, newsletters, personal
      selling and trade shows is likely to be most appropriate as their market is quite
      closely defined and easier to target using these approaches.
      Place – distribution of the product to housebuilders is likely to be
      quite straightforward. Housebuilders are likely to order several/multiple
      products at any given time and the distribution channel is direct from
      manufacturer to final consumer (housebuilders).

      Individual households – marketing mix

      Price – because they are cheap to fit, the solar panels should also have a low
      initial price. A penetration pricing strategy could be used to convince people to
      buy them and given the “luxury” nature of the product, it can be argued that the
      product will be price elastic in nature. A penetration pricing strategy will help
      in this situation. Given that SunGen Ltd are effectively competing with
      electricity companies, they will need to take electricity pricing into account.
      As energy prices increase, it may be that they can move more towards a
      skimming pricing strategy.
      Product – the nature of the product will need to be stressed to ensure
      consumers are aware of the nature of the product. The ability of the product to
      generate electricity that can be fed back into the electricity grid may need to be
      stressed along with the characteristics of the product.

Promotion – the promotional strategy used for individual households is likely
to be more focused on above the line promotion. The market for individual
households is a geographically dispersed one and to reach them may require
above the line promotion strategies. These may include newspaper and
magazine advertising, internet advertising on appropriate lifestyle and other
web sites and perhaps radio and other media advertising. TV advertising is
very unlikely for a firm the size of SunGen Ltd. Point of sales promotion may
also be used in places where the panels are being made available.
Place – the market for solar panels is very geographically dispersed and this
will require appropriate national distribution channels. This may mean
franchising a dealer network or perhaps negotiating a deal with national DIY
chains or hardware stores. It may also be possible to use a B2C distribution
method through the Internet.

3.   (a)   (i)    Define the term working capital.                                             [2 marks]

                  Working capital is the amount of money that a business has to fund its
                  day-to-day operations. It is a measure of liquidity and can be calculated
                  by deducting current liabilities from current assets. It is the portion of
                  capitalization invested in current assets.

                  [2 marks]
                  A clear and appropriate definition of working capital.

                  [1 mark]
                  Some appropriate elements of a definition of working capital, but the
                  definition may be lacking in detail or clarity.

           (ii)   Identify two possible sources of finance for an increase in
                  working capital.                                                             [2 marks]

                  The sources of finance could include short-term sources of finance
                  such as:
                  • bank overdraft
                  • debt factoring
                  • trade credit
                  • selling stock.

                  Award [1 mark] for each source identified up to a maximum
                  of [2 marks].

(b)   As a result of problems with suppliers, SunGen Ltd has decided to keep
      larger levels of stock. Comment on the effects that this decision will have
      on SunGen Ltd’s liquidity ratios.                                                      [4 marks]

      The two main liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the acid test ratio.
      The acid test ratio deducts stock from current assets to allow for the fact that
      stock is the least liquid of the current assets. The latest figures given in
      Appendix 3 indicate that SunGen Ltd has a current ratio of 1.1 and an acid test
      ratio of 0.6. The value of the acid test ratio indicates possible liquidity
      problems already. If SunGen Ltd choose to keep higher levels of stock because
      of their problems with suppliers then this is likely (ceteris paribus) to lead to an
      increase in the current ratio as their current assets grow. However, the higher
      levels of stock will have no impact on the acid test ratio as this excludes stock
      to give a better measure of liquidity.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      The impact of the higher stock levels on both the current and acid test ratios is
      appropriately considered and fully explained. For [4 marks] there is
      appropriate reference to the case study.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      There is some consideration of the impact of higher levels of stock
      on liquidity, but this may not include reference to the case or to both the
      current and acid test ratios.

(c)   Examine whether SunGen Ltd should implement a Total Quality
      Management approach as proposed by Catherine.                                        [7 marks]

      Catherine is a strong advocate of Total Quality Management (TQM) and
      wants to use quality circles. This approach will involve the whole workforce in
      ensuring quality at all stages of production. The TQM approach will need to
      be embedded in the culture of the company and may be expensive with the
      implementation of new systems. It should, however, identify quality issues
      before production has taken place in contrast to a traditional quality control
      approach that checks the quality of finished goods.

      The evaluation of the TQM approach needs to consider the merits of the
      approach in the context of SunGen Ltd. A wide range of points could
      be raised:
      • TQM would require a company-wide approach and commitment from
          all staff – is this likely to be available? Tony, the production manager has a
          more traditional approach to quality control and is keen to appoint new
          managers to take charge of quality. Will he be committed to this approach?
          Given that he is a key player in these changes, it will be important to know
          his view. Without a total commitment from Tony and all other staff,
          a more traditional approach may work better.
      • TQM could require substantial investment in staff training and is likely to
          take a considerable time to yield benefits, but the benefits are likely to be
          greater in the medium to long term than with traditional approaches.
      • TQM may put more emphasis on the process and not enough on
          the product. However, it may enable the company to focus more clearly on
          the needs of customers.
      • TQM may help develop a team approach to quality and involve all staff.
          This may help motivate staff. In contrast a more traditional approach may
          mean more autocratic leadership and may demotivate staff.
      • TQM focuses on finding quality problems before production, this ensures
          that the product shipped to customers is defect-free. This may help build
          better customer relations and may be more appropriate in the light of their
          expansion plans to individual households. Given some problems that they
          have had with quality, this may be a help in restoring better customer
          relationships.
      • a TQM approach may help improve communication flows – both formal
          and informal. This may help improve productivity and ensure better use of
          resources. A more traditional approach relies on top-down communication.
          Which of these approaches is more appropriate will depend on the
          perceived staff reaction to each approach.

4.   (a)   (i)   Define the term liquidity.                                                     [2 marks]

                 Liquidity refers to how quickly and cheaply an asset can be converted
                 into cash. Money (in the form of cash) is the most liquid asset.

                 [2 marks]
                 A clear and appropriate definition of liquidity.

                 [1 mark]
                 Some appropriate elements of a definition of liquidity, but the definition
                 may be lacking in detail or clarity.

           (ii) Identify two appropriate          sources    of     finance   for   the   new
                production plant.                                                               [2 marks]

                 The new production plant will need to be financed from long-term
                 sources of finance. These may be either internal or external sources
                 of finance, though their room to manoeuvre may be a little restricted by
                 their current situation in terms of ownership and liquidity. They already
                 have a substantial loan and their gearing ratio is nearly 70 %. They are
                 not able to issue shares as they are a wholly owned subsidiary of
                 Electrical Solutions plc, though Electrical Solutions plc may be able to
                 issue shares and use this as a means to raise capital. Possible appropriate
                 sources of finance could therefore include:
                 • internal investment from Electrical Solutions plc – perhaps from
                     profit or cash reserves
                 • sale and leaseback – SunGen Ltd may be able to sell some assets and
                     lease them back, though this may be difficult given their rate
                     of expansion
                 • mortgage – it is possible that they could mortgage some of their
                     fixed assets (given fixed assets of $ 1.3 m). The viability of this
                     depends on the current ownership of the fixed assets
                 • joint venture – they could perhaps undertake a joint venture,
                     for example, with a production company in a related area of activity
                 • Government grant – they may be eligible for some local or national
                     grants because of their environmental profile
                 • any other relevant source of finance (though this must be in the
                     context of the case study).

                 Award [1 mark] for each appropriate source of finance identified up to a
                 maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   (i)   Explain the difference between the net profit margin and the

            The gross profit margin measures the profitability of the firm once the
            cost of goods sold has been taken into account. It is calculated by
            dividing the gross profit by the turnover and multiplying by 100 to get
            the figure as a percentage. The net profit margin measures the
            profitability of the firm once the expenses have also been deducted. It is
            calculated by dividing the net profit by the turnover and multiplying by
            100 to get the figure as a percentage. The difference is therefore that the
            net profit margin is measured after expenses as well as the cost of goods
            sold have been deducted.

            [2 marks]

(ii)   Explain how the levels of profit and cash flow on the free standing
       solar panels are likely to change through the different stages of the
       product life cycle.                                                            [6 marks]

       The cash flow from a product like the free standing solar panels as it
       moves through its life cycle will change. Initially high development
       costs (likely for solar panels) and high promotional costs will mean a
       negative cash flow, but as the products moves through the growth phase
       and into maturity, the cash flow should start to become positive.
       This could be shown diagramatically.




       As a result profitability of the free standing solar panels will
       also change through the life cycle of the product. This will be partly due
       to the fact that price elasticity will tend to vary at each stage of the
       product life cycle.

                 Demand becomes more elastic through product life cycle

In the growth phase of the product life cycle, the solar panels may tend
to be fairly price inelastic in nature. People buying at this stage will tend
to be “innovators” and they may be prepared to take risks with
new products. Price will not be such an important consideration for them
– they have a greater “need” for the product. This may lead to a high
profit margin at this stage of the product life cycle, though overall
profitability is likely to be low (or even negative) due to the high
development and production setup costs for the solar panels.

However, as the product moves towards maturity, the price elasticity
will increase. The amount of competition will increase and the
increasing number of substitutes will make consumers more
price sensitive. The nature of the consumers will also change and they
are likely to be more motivated to buy by factors like price,
functionality and reliability. This is particularly likely to be true for solar
panels as they gain more widespread acceptance. This may lead to a
lower profit margin at this stage of the product life cycle, though overall
profitability is likely to be higher due to higher sales and the fact that
introductory costs should have been paid off. Profitability will,
however, depend on the nature of the competition for the product.

N.B. Candidates may explain profitability without reference to elasticity
and this should be fully credited.

(c)   Discuss the changes in the profit and liquidity ratios between 2006
      and 2007.                                                                           [8 marks]

      From a comparison of the ratios in Appendix 3 and the ratios given, it would
      appear that there has, in general terms, been a deterioration in the financial
      position of SunGen Ltd.         However, this is susceptible to a more
      detailed analysis. Relevant points to raise might include:

      Profitability

      Gross profit margin – this has improved, though is still showing a gross loss.
      Because the figure is negative, a reduction is an improvement. This may
      indicate either an increase in productivity/efficiency in production or perhaps
      simply better control over direct costs.

      Net profit margin – this has worsened. Given the improvement in the GPM,
      this may indicate poor control over indirect costs (overheads). However, there
      may be a number of other factors at play as well. There may be costs
      associated with expansionary activities/growth e.g. marketing activity related
      to the expansion to targeting individual households, market research costs,
      research and development activity relating to proposed new products or
      perhaps costs associated with the planned expansion of their production
      facilities (e.g. architect fees etc).

      ROCE – this has improved in the sense that it is not as bad as before.
      This indicates improved efficiency in terms of the use of their assets to
      deliver profit. This may be related to increases in production efficiency or
      other related factors.

      Liquidity

      Current ratio – this has deteriorated slightly, but is still 1 indicating
      perhaps just sufficient liquidity. However, when looked at along with the
      acid test ratio, it may well be that there is a problem. It would appear that
      stock is a significant proportion of current assets and this would make it
      difficult for them to realise assets sufficiently. It would appear that their
      working capital position has deteriorated further since 2006. Other factors
      behind this change could include a worsening in credit control, with debtor
      days increasing and creditor days falling or increasing by less than debtor days.

      Acid test ratio – the ATR has shown a significant worsening from 0.6 to 0.4.
      It was, arguably, already too low and has gone down significantly.
      This appears to indicate that stock is now a much higher proportion of their
      current assets and has significantly lowered their overall liquidity. It may be
      that they have increased stock due to the supplier problems they have had or
      perhaps due to a projected increase in demand. However, the ATR value does
      indicate a worrying shortage of working capital that may need addressing
      quite quickly.

Answer one question in this section.

1.   Corner Store

     Juan Pinilla, a sole trader who has been running a corner store for 40 years, has managed to survive
     the competition of the large supermarket chains. His son Pedro helps him run the store.

     Juan expects that for every month in 2007, he will:
     • sell an average of $60 000
     • mark up all his purchases an average of 20 %
     • use an average of 50 % of the gross profit to pay for the expenses.

     Pedro wants to add a delivery service and believes that buying a van at $100 000 will allow the
     firm to create additional sales of $4000 per month. The running costs of the van are estimated at
     $1000 per month. A commercial bank is willing to lend the firm the money for the van but is asking
     to see its estimated payback period first. The bank will charge 11 % interest on the loan.


     (a)   State four reasons why people may prefer to buy from large supermarkets.            [4 marks]

     (b)   (i)    Prepare a trading and profit and loss account for the year ending

2.   Vintage Clothing

     Patricia and her friend Carol have developed a taste for vintage clothing. They believe they
     can develop a successful business enterprise selling second hand and vintage style clothing to
     young buyers. They anticipate they will need the following:
     • a shop to rent: $3000 per month
     • a salary for a full time shop attendant: $1000 per month
     • running costs: $1000 per month
     • capital to furnish the shop: $10 000
     • capital to buy the first batch of second hand clothes: $3000.

     They can purchase vintage garments for an average cost price of $10 a piece. Each garment will sell
     at an average price of $30. Their aim is to sell 300 garments per month.

     Carol’s father lent them $10 000 but insisted they formed a private limited company.

     After two years of great success, Carol is considering growing by franchise although Patricia
     believes it is better to grow by setting up branches.

Answer two questions in this section.

3.   L’Oreal takes over The Body Shop

     The world’s top cosmetics group L’Oreal has taken over the famed fair trade advocate
     The Body Shop for £652 million (US$1090 million). Anita and Gordon Roddick, founders and
     owners of 18 per cent of The Body Shop, will earn approximately £130 million from the deal.

     In its mission statement, The Body Shop states that it exists to “passionately campaign for the
     protection of the environment, human and civil rights, and against animal testing within the cosmetics
     and toiletries industry”. Their ethical approach is organized into five pillars: Defend Human Rights,
     Protect Out Planet, Support Community Trade, Activate Self-Esteem, and Against Animal Testing.

     On the other hand, L’Oreal has been criticized for continuing to test certain ingredients on animals.
     Animal rights groups have protested relentlessly about this issue, saying that the company should be
     doing more to stop the practice, ahead of a total ban on the testing of animal products on ingredients,
     proposed for 2008.

     Together with industry experts, animal rights campaigners are asking how The Body Shop can continue
     to wave the ethical banner when it is owned by a company with seemingly opposing values.

4.   Harley-Davidson roars into China

     Motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson has opened a dealership in Beijing, its first outlet
     in China in more than 50 years. Entry to the Chinese market has long been a goal of the
     Milwaukee-based company, given the country’s booming economy and its citizens’ growing
     spending power. In 2001, after China joined the World Trade Organization, import restrictions,
     quotas and tariffs also dropped substantially for foreign motorcycle manufacturers.

     Harley-Davidson, teamed up with dealer Feng Hou Lun, one of the most well-established
     retailers of imported motorcycles in China. The retail outlet, which is to be located in Beijing’s
     Fourth Ring Road, will employ 14 people and be run by Feng Hou Lun’s founder, Wan Jidong.

     The dealership is to sell several models of Harley-Davidson motorcycles, parts, accessories and
     collectible goods. The outlet will also provide services, rider training and events such as
     organized rides.

     Harley-Davidson’s market penetration is expected to be gradual, mainly because of riding
     restrictions in most large cities. In Beijing and Shanghai, for example, motorcycles are banned
     from most major streets and highways. Shanghai also stopped accepting motorcycle registrations
     in 2002.

     Another challenge is the price of the motorcycles, which range from $12 000 to $37 450.
     Urban incomes average about $2200 a year in Beijing.

5.   Recruitment at Let’s Design Ltd

     When the marketing manager of Let’s Design Ltd resigned, Alex Bate, the general manager,
     decided to fill the position with an internal promotion. He based his decision on his knowledge
     that it costs nine times more to hire someone new and that no one had been internally promoted in
     the company in the last two years. He gave the job to Rupert Tait, a young and creative designer who
     had been with the company for five years. Rupert was highly regarded by his colleagues and when
     the appointment was made public, the marketing department held a party to celebrate.

     Yet two months after his appointment, problems have started to become apparent. Marketing tasks
     fell behind and the department was unable to keep up with its orders. At senior management meetings
     Rupert complained about the lack of cooperation from his team: he said no one was willing to put
     in the extra time to get the work finished. At the same time other senior managers have heard
     through informal channels of communication that Rupert’s team complained about his
     leadership style, saying he was too lenient and passive. Alex Bate is planning to take formal action
     because of Rupert’s poor performance. One possible outcome is that he could dismiss Rupert and
     recruit for his position externally.

                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   State four reasons why people may prefer to buy from large supermarkets.            [4 marks]

           Possible reasons are:
           • larger stores enjoy economies of scale and can sell at lower prices
           • large supermarkets can offer a greater variety of products
           • easy car access
           • more attractive point of sale
           • more variety of payment possibilities (debit, credit cards, cheques, etc.)
           • any other valid reason.

           Award [1 mark] per reason outlined, up to a maximum of [4 marks].

     (b)   (i)   Prepare a trading and profit and loss account for the year ending
                 31 December 2007. (Show all your working)                                     [6 marks]

                 Profit and loss account:

                 Sales             $60 000 × 12        = $720 000
                 CGS               $50 000 × 12        = $600 000
                 Gross profit      $10 000 × 12        = $120 000
                 Expenses          $5 000 × 12         = $60 000
                 Net profit        $5 000 × 12         = $60 000

                 Profit and loss account for Juan Pinilla’s store for year ended
                 31 December 2007:
                                               $000
                 Sales revenue                  720
                 Less cost of goods sold        600
                 Gross profit                   120

                 Less expenses                           60
                 Net profit before interest and tax      60

                 [5 to 6 marks]
                 An accurate profit and loss account is prepared, and laid out in
                 suitable format. All working is shown.

                 [3 to 4 marks]
                 A profit and loss account is prepared. Allow a total of three errors either
                 in calculation(s) or format. Award a maximum of [3 marks] if monthly
                 figures are used and/or no working is shown.

                 [1 to 2 marks]

      (ii)   Calculate the payback period for the van. (Show all your working)              [4 marks]

             Additional sales $4000 × 12 = $48 000 per year
             Additional costs = $1000 × 12 = $12 000 running costs per year
             Interest payment to the bank = $11 000
             Total extra costs = $23 000
             Additional net profit = $25 000

             Payback period = $100 000 / $25 000 = 4 years

             Award [1 mark] for calculating the correct sales revenue, [1 mark] for
             calculating the correct additional costs (including interest), [1 mark] for
             the correct payback formula and [1 mark] for the correct answer.
             Maximum [4 marks].

(c)   Examine the costs and benefits of Pedro’s proposal to buy a van.                      [6 marks]

      Costs: There are increased risks in buying a van, since the business will
      become more complex. A driver needs to be hired and that means caring for
      an extra worker. Vans need to be maintained, and accidents can happen.
      Insurance costs have to be taken into account. Estimated sales might not be
      realistic and the firm might face difficulties paying back the bank loan.
      The banker becomes a creditor that can sue the firm, and Juan Pinilla is fully
      liable as a sole trader. It is possible that the business will grow so much that it
      will exceed the capacity of the firm to supply customers in a timely form.

      Benefits: The van will bring additional profit. It will help lower purchasing
      costs, by allowing the owners to go to cash and carry warehouses and buy their
      own supplies. They can also add delivery services, increasing their area of
      influence and selling to a market of customers who are impaired from going to
      the store, but still like personalized service. At a cost of 11 % per year on
      the loan, and an investment in profit of 25 %, financially the van seems like a
      good investment. It is also convenient to think of strategies to compete with
      the chains, and this is a good way to compete.

      Credit other valid costs and benefits.

      [5 to 6 marks]
      Costs and benefits are examined in detail and the answer is well balanced.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      Costs and benefits are examined, but the answer lacks detail and/or balance.

      [1 to 2 marks]
      A limited and general response.

2.   (a)   Describe one advantage and one disadvantage of a private limited
           company.                                                                         [4 marks]

           Possible advantages:
           • a private limited company enjoys limited liability for all its shareholders
           • more shareholders could be invited to join and supply more capital
           • a company is a legal entity; therefore its life survives the owners
           • any other appropriate advantage.

           Possible disadvantages:
           • it is more expensive to set up and there is more bureaucracy involved in
              the process
           • if the business venture remains small, the costs might be too high to bear
           • a company has rights and obligations, so it will pay taxes as a legal entity
           • possible limits to the amount of capital available for expansion
           • any other appropriate disadvantage.

           Award up to [2 marks] for each advantage described and up to [2 marks] for
           each disadvantage described.

     (b)   Calculate, showing all your working:
                                                                                            [2 marks]
           (i)    the break-even point per month.

                  Fixed costs = rent + salary + expenses
                  Fixed costs = $ 3000 + $ 1000 + $ 1000 = $ 5000
                  Contribution = selling price – variable cost
                  Contribution = $ 30 – $ 10 = $ 20
                  Break-even = FC/Contribution = $ 5000/$ 20 = 250 garments per month

                  Award [1 mark] for correct break-even point and [1 mark] for
                  appropriate working. Maximum [2 marks]. Award [1 mark] where the
                  working shows a clear understanding of break-even, but the answer is
                  not correct.

           (ii)   the margin of safety at the set target.                                   [1 mark]

                  Margin of safety = set target – break-even point of output
                  Margin of safety = 300 – 250
                  Margin of safety = 50 garments

                  Award [1 mark] for correct margin of safety.

(iii) the profit or loss at 300 garments sold per month.                      [2 marks]

     Output – break-even output = 300 – 250 = 50
     Margin of safety × contribution = 50 × $20 = $1000

     Or

     Total revenue (300) – Total costs (300) = Profit/Loss
           £300 × $30 – [FC + (300 × $10)] = Profit/Loss
                $ 9000 – ($5000 + $3000) = Profit/Loss
                            $ 9000 – $8000 = –$1000

     Award [1 mark] for the correct profit and [1 mark] for the appropriate
     working or method. Maximum [2 marks]. Award [1 mark] where the
     working shows a clear understanding of the method of calculation,
     but the answer is not correct.

(iv) the profit or loss at 200 garments sold per month.                       [1 mark]

     Output – break-even output = 200 – 250 = –50
     (Output – break-even output) × contribution = –50 × $20 = – $1000

     Or

     Total revenue (200) – Total costs (200) = Profit/Loss
            (200 × $30) – [FC + (200 × $10)] = Profit/Loss
                 $6000 – ($5000 + $2000)     = Profit/Loss
                            $6000 – $7000 = –$1000

     Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation of loss.

(d)   Analyse the two growth alternatives.                                               [6 marks]

      Carol wants to grow by franchising because the method has a number
      of advantages. There is less risk involved since the capital needed for the new
      shop(s) is invested by the franchisee. The franchisee will need to find the
      funds to pay a franchise fee and to get started. The franchisor will earn
      royalties and/or sell the supplies to the franchisee. Therefore Patricia and
      Carol will earn revenue that is independent of whether the franchisor is
      profitable or not. Growth can be more rapid – there might be a number of
      franchises opened at the same time. Yet, at the same time, a franchise set up
      is complex. The quality of the service has to be equivalent to the original shop
      to guarantee the same quality to the customers. The image that all the stores
      provide must be the same. This supervision is not always easy to carry out. It
      is costly and time consuming.

      If branches are opened, Carol and Patricia will not need to deal with the owners
      of the franchise, who are entrepreneurs with their own ideas. Yet they will
      need to find their own sources of finance. This is costly and risky. Since the
      growth depends on the capacity to raise finance, the speed at which the growth
      happens is limited and might be slower than growth by franchise. Yet there are
      also benefits: the exclusive characteristics of the shop are kept. They will be
      fully responsible for the image that they transmit to the public. Maybe less
      quantity is sold than with a franchise, but the margin made per unit might
      be higher, perhaps giving a greater level of total profit.

      relevant to the case.

                                              SECTION B

3.   (a)   Define the term takeover.                                                            [2 marks]

           A takeover is a method to achieve the growth objectives of a firm.
           Takeovers occur when one company purchases the majority of the shares of
           another company. Takeovers can be hostile or friendly. Since shares in the
           private sector allow one vote per share to the shareholder, controlling 51 % of
           shares allows for the control of the taken over company. Takeovers usually
           cause the price of shares to go up before the deal is actually closed.

     (b)   (i)   Explain the purpose of a mission statement.                                    [3 marks]

                 The purpose of a mission statement is to give direction to the firm and to
                 allow its strategic planning to have a clear direction. Starting from the
                 mission statement, strategies, objectives and tactics are defined. It serves
                 as a light, and at all times – there is no time frame for it – it allows all
                 stakeholders to have a view and understanding of the essence of the firm.
                 It is also a way of transmitting the ethos, the values and culture to all
                 the stakeholders (including customers, suppliers, employees and owners).

                 [3 marks]

(ii)   Comment on the purpose of Non Government Organizations (NGOs)
       such as animal rights groups.                                                 [3 marks]

       Non Government Organizations are firms that operate in the
       private sector, but are non profit seeking. Their purpose is to achieve the
       benefit of a particular group, which is usually not well represented by the
       profit seeking organizations, or by the public sector. These organizations
       are non profit and are usually run by volunteers who feel very strongly
       about the cause. They are important external stakeholders of the
       profit seeking firms, since their actions can have a serious impact on the
       profit seeking sector.

       Animal rights groups are organizations that seek to defend the rights of
       non-human animals and proclaim that animals should not be used in
       laboratories for testing. The organizations try and impede what they
       consider to be the incorrect use of animals. They aim to influence
       society in such a manner that the firms which use animals in their
       experiments will feel the monetary consequence of selling less,
       or not selling to those people who have been made conscious of the
       animal use (or abuse) by the profit seeking firm. They also lobby for
       humane legislation.

       [2 to 3 marks]
       The purpose of Non Government Organizations is commented on in
       some depth and for [3 marks] reference is made to animal rights groups
       to illustrate the answer.

(c)   Examine the reasons why organizations consider setting ethical objectives.        [5 marks]

      Having ethical objectives, or developing a Corporate and Social Responsibility
      (CSR) policy, can benefit a business in different ways.
      • The most important one is that as consumers become more
         socially responsible they will exercise their purchasing power in a
         discriminating way, and this can result in higher profits for firms that are
         seen as socially responsible and ethical.
      • It can help recruitment and retention (potential employees might be happier
         joining a firm with a CSR policy) and actual employees might feel better
         working in a firm that cares for society and the environment at large.
      • It can help create a brand image adding a distinguishing feature to the
         product and differentiating it from its competitors. Some firms might
         do this to divert the attention from their core business – which might be
         essentially contaminating, such as a tobacco company.

      In the case of The Body Shop the brand is solely and completely built on
      ethical objectives. The firm was born under the premise of never using animals
      for experimental testing. And this has influenced every activity of the firm.
      All its marketing including its colour codes and designs are all based on this
      “birth mark”.

      [4 to 5 marks]
      A detailed examination of at least two reasons for setting ethical objectives.

(d)   Evaluate the decision to accept the takeover of The Body Shop by L’Oreal.                [7 marks]

      All the shareholders of The Body Shop will make a capital gain on the sale of
      their shares to L’Oreal, not just the Roddick’s. If in fact the firm was founded
      by shareholders who wanted to make a capital gain, and a profit, then there is
      no reason for which they should be upset by the takeover (and since the firm is
      a public limited company it is correct to assume profit seeking motives).
      Since the firm essentially sells cosmetics for a profit (it is not a charity), then it
      makes sense to accept the sale willingly.

      If the prime reason to be a shareholder of The Body Shop is of a different kind,
      and capital gains and profits play no role in the business venture, then it might
      be considered quite negative to be purchased by a firm like L’Oreal.

      The success of the takeover will depend on the extent to which The Body Shop
      will be able to maintain its uniqueness and identity by being a part of the
      French multinational, which has explicit differing values.

      For L’Oreal, the purchase satisfies the need to keep growing by diversification.
      It might choose to keep the identity of The Body Shop intact. The reaction
      of consumers to the takeover is hard to predict. Some might not be aware
      of the change of ownership and will therefore keep buying The Body Shop
      products and some might be aware and choose to “punish” the takeover
      by not purchasing their products any more. What L’Oreal does in terms
      of respecting or not the Body Shop brand will be decisive in determining
      the reaction of consumers. The reaction of the activists, such as the
      animal protection groups, will influence the behaviour of the consumers.
      The knowledge and commitment of the consumers will also play a role.

      Internally, the takeover will lead to a certain amount of restructuring.
      This could lead to cultural clashes between both organizations. So a number of
      Body Shop employees might be against the takeover. On the other hand,
      it might open doors for growth and exchange of ideas and different ways
      of thinking. Opportunities for employees to become workers of a much bigger
      organization might be appealing. Some workers might be in favour of
      the takeover.

      So the sale is understandable from a profit seeking, private sector view point,
      but the risk that is run is that the reaction of consumers might be completely
      negative and that The Body Shop will lose its “raison d’etre”. It might very well
      be that L’Oreal decides to embrace the same ethical objectives as
      The Body Shop, in which case the activists and consumers might all end up
      having gained from the situation.

      Since The Body Shop is a plc, unless a majority of shareholders decide against
      the takeover to resist the sale, there is little chance of resistance. Accepting the
      takeover is probably the only reasonable action to take.

      Credit other valid ideas that candidates might include, if well supported.

           Strengths:
           • an old well established and reputable brand
           • a brand that brings images of freedom to the consumer mind
           • a quality product
           • capacity to produce and export motor bikes.

           Weaknesses:
           • a high price relative to current average income
           • a very American firm, that knows little about the Asian market
           • a long distance to cover between the States and China, making the costs of
             transport and insurance high.

           Opportunities:
           • rapid economic growth in China
           • growth in disposable income of Chinese population
           • greater economic freedom in China after joining WTO.

           Threats:
           • probable competition from well established Asian brands (such as Yamaha)
           • government rules and regulations (e.g. ban on the use of motorbikes in
              the city)
           • fluctuations in exchange rates
           • the continuing undervaluation of the Yuan making prices less competitive.

(c)   Analyse the difficulties that Harley-Davidson might encounter when
      entering China.                                                                   [5 marks]

      The difficulties the firm will have to face have to do with issues
      of documentation, shipping, financial, legal, communications, governmental
      regulations, licensing and property rights. The issue of language is an
      important one, since only some people in China will be able to communicate
      in English, but a large number will not and all the support material must
      be translated.

      There is also an issue of different time zones, forcing communications to take
      place during the night in either country. Documentation will be important and
      it may be difficult to get in to a country that has been so impenetrable in
      the past.

      The great distance between the countries increases the travelling time
      making it difficult to increase supply rapidly.

      Financially, it is necessary to have credit to fund the operation, since
      motorbikes will be sold long after they are made (because of geographical
      distance).

      Exchange rates will play a large role in the transactions and any decision from
      the Chinese government to change the exchange rate will affect the business.

      Macroeconomic variables in the USA and China will affect the rate.
      Global issues will do as well. Political stability/instability will also be a
      potential challenge, as the decision to ban motorcycles proves. Success in
      international trade will require that the start-up entrepreneur dedicates time,
      study and investment in order to gain appropriate knowledge and experience on
      these issues.

(d)   Evaluate Harley-Davidson’s decision to team up with local motorcycle
      dealer, Feng Hou Lun.                                                                 [7 marks]

      Doing business in China is not easy. The difficulties are many and varied and
      having a local partner can smooth the process. (In fact its government did not
      grant permission for firms to set up without a domestic partner). The partner
      can be very helpful with local contracts and with local legislation in general.
      It is important to establish a bridge with the culture and the language.
      Locals will have easier access to importing agents, and will deal with the
      placing element more smoothly. Selling motorcycles is not just about bikes,
      it also involves offering an after sales service for the customers to be happy
      with the investment. Feng Hou Lun is a well established dealer, and has all the
      necessary experience in the market. Harley Davidson has cut out a step from
      the introductory process by teaming up with an experienced dealer.
      Market penetration will be easier. The domestic market might be more willing
      to interact with people who are not culturally different.

      On the other hand the partner can also be a risk factor, since it might try to out
      smart the foreign firm. Some partners have walked away with clients, to start
      competing rather than supporting the partnership. The Chinese partner will
      have information that might be valuable and confidential and not treat it
      as such. It is also costly and if the firm could make a go without the
      partner it is possible that profits might be higher. Yet it seems that the risks of
      going alone in an Asian country are too high. The decision to merge with
      Feng Hou Lun is wise and probably necessary.

           Informal communication is the communication that takes place beyond
           formal communications, outside the official channels. It could take place in
           a staff room, or during lunch breaks, or when workers socialize together.
           It is usually believed that when formal communication is poor, informal
           communication flourishes. Yet a certain amount of informal communication is

(b)   Explain the steps that are included in an external recruitment process.           [6 marks]

      External recruitment follows some or all of the following steps:
      • Job analysis: the first thing the employer must know is what exactly the
         job entails. To carefully analyse what the job is about and what the future
         employee will have to do after appointment is called job analysis. This is a
         really important process since the recruitment process will be better the
         clearer the position to be filled is.
      • Job design/description: once analysed, the information is laid down so that
         there is a clear knowledge of what the firm is looking for and for potential
         appointees to be aware of what he or she will be expected to do, and will be
         responsible for.
      • Job profile/worker’s profile: a list of the characters that the potential
         employee should have, including knowledge, skills and experience.
      • Advertising: the job must be advertised, and there are different ways to
         do this, depending on the importance of the appointment and the size and
         nature of the firm. The position can be advertised in the local, regional,
         national or international press. The selection process can also be
         outsourced and delegated to a specialist firm.
      • Reception and selection of curriculum vitaes (CVs): application letters and
         CVs (or resumes) have to be read and a relatively short list chosen.
         A number of people can be involved in the process, so that the decision
         does not fall on one single individual.
      • Interview process: the short listed candidates are interviewed by one or
         more people. The interview process can be long, and involves a number
         of people, who may work for the new appointee(s). These people have the
         responsibility to interview the candidates and express their opinions in the
         decision making process.
      • Decision, offer of pay package and appointment: once the decision is made,
         a pay package is discussed and an offer is made to the selected candidate.
         If the offer is accepted, the appointment is made and an induction and
         training programme are put into practice.
      • Induction and training programme: workers who join firms must be
         shown around, made to feel comfortable, and trained in the new job.

      recruitment process.

(c)   Analyse the possible causes of Rupert's unsuccessful management
      performance.                                                                        [5 marks]

      Rupert is a “laissez faire” leader, very probably because he has moved from
      being a colleague to being a boss, without any relevant or suitable preparation.
      He finds it difficult to show any signs of authority, basically because it is
      difficult and uncomfortable to tell former colleagues what to do. When one is
      used to being a colleague, it is not easy to move to a leadership position.

      Rupert has not established formal ways of communication, being used to
      communicating informally with his former colleagues. In the new situation it
      seems that his former colleagues are using informal ways to complain
      about him, rather than going directly to him with the issues they might have.
      Rupert is doing something similar, complaining at the meetings about his team,
      rather than talking to them.

      It is also true that no one in the firm has prepared Rupert for the big change of
      status that he was asked to go through. Grooming talented personnel with
      individual coaching increases job satisfaction and retention and many large
      firms are preparing potential internal promotions carefully. Alex Bait assumed
      that because Rupert could do the job as a designer, he would do a good job as
      a manager.

      It might also be probable that the workers themselves are theory X
      style workers, who like to be told what to do at all times. Rupert might have
      judged them differently as a colleague.

(d)   Evaluate Alex Bate's idea of dismissing Rupert and recruiting externally.            [7 marks]

      To dismiss Rupert involves:
      Severance pay. This is expensive, since he has been working with the firm for
      five years. Although workers are not happy with his performance, it is still
      important to know that someone can be promoted internally. It means that
      others can be promoted in the future too. It also implies that management has
      to recognize that the decision was a mistake.

      To keep him involves:
      Spending on a training programme, and maybe having sessions with the
      employees to try and come up with a new way of working together. This is
      time consuming and the risk is run of not being able to improve the situation.

      External recruitment is, as mentioned in the case, expensive and also
      time consuming. The benefits are that new blood and hence new ideas are
      brought into the firm. It is a chance to grow and to start doing things
      differently. But there is no guarantee that the new corner will be more efficient
      or qualified than Rupert. The process will take time and changes might not be
      implemented for a long time.

      Theory says that a lot of leadership traits can be learned. It is not all nature,
      but also nurture. Rupert could become a better manager with the right training.
      Workers in his department are not cooperative. The issue might need to be
      discussed more openly, and not on the grape vine. It is important that all the
      information is laid out in the open for all those involved to discuss it.

      It is probably better for the workers and the firm to retrain Rupert, but it might
      also be acceptable to consider outside recruitment if properly supported.

      A balanced and detailed evaluation of the idea to dismiss Rupert and
      recruit externally.

      [4 to 5 marks]
      The idea to dismiss Rupert and recruit externally is analysed but may not be
      fully evaluated. The answer may lack balance.

      [2 to 3 marks]
      The idea to dismiss Rupert and recruit externally is described and any
      evaluation is likely to be superficial and unsupported in nature.
