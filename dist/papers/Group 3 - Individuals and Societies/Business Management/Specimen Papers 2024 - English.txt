This statement, released three months prior to the examination, notifies candidates of topics and
terminology not in the Business management guide that will be in the case study in the final examination.
Candidates are to spend a maximum of five hours researching these topics and learning the terminology.
Topics in this statement build on those contained in the syllabus. The primary aim is to assess
candidates knowledge of important contemporary business topics that could not have been anticipated
when the guide was written.

The case study for the specimen papers is related to:
y precision agriculture
y the use of drones
y software and hardware development and sales.

Candidates are expected to have some basic familiarity with these topics, rather than comprehensive or
exhaustive knowledge.

Additional terminology that candidates may want to know includes:
y aerial mapping
y cloud-based licensed software
y consultant
y hardware
y licensing agreement
y multispectral camera
y patch (a software patch)
y project manager/project management
y software
y software development.

The following page contains the first two paragraphs of the case study. Candidates should familiarize
themselves with the context of the case study before the examination. Candidates will be given the full
version of the case study in the examination, including these first two paragraphs.

                                    Mapping Tech Ltd. (MT)
     Mapping Tech Ltd. (MT ), owned by Jackie Beasley, was founded in 2010. MT originally wrote
     software to help farmers use drones for aerial mapping, which allows for precision agriculture.
     With the information gathered from aerial mapping, farmers can determine which areas of their
     farms need more (or less) human attention, such as more (or less) fertilizer and what types of
 5   fertilizer to use. Through precision agriculture, farmers can increase yields, lower costs and
     reduce the environmental impact of farming. Later, MT began to manufacture hardware related
     to precision agriculture.

     Jackie founded MT when studying computer science at the University of Nebraska (UoN),
     located in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States of America (USA). One major focus of UoN is the
10   use of drones for precision agriculture. Jackie saw the benefits of aerial mapping as well as the
     positive impact that precision agriculture has on the environment: with the world’s population
     growing and humans’ total ecological footprint increasing, she believed that precision agriculture
     could increase the food supply and reduce environmental impact. With her expertise in software
     mapping, Jackie felt a responsibility to advance the field of precision agriculture.

                                        Mapping Tech Ltd. (MT)
     Mapping Tech Ltd. (MT ), owned by Jackie Beasley, was founded in 2010. MT originally wrote
     software to help farmers use drones for aerial mapping, which allows for precision agriculture. With
     the information gathered from aerial mapping, farmers can determine which areas of their farms
     need more (or less) human attention, such as more (or less) fertilizer and what types of fertilizer
 5   to use. Through precision agriculture, farmers can increase yields, lower costs and reduce the
     environmental impact of farming. Later, MT began to manufacture hardware related to precision
     agriculture.

     Jackie founded MT when studying computer science at the University of Nebraska (UoN), located
     in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States of America (USA). One major focus of UoN is the use of
10   drones for precision agriculture. Jackie saw the benefits of aerial mapping as well as the positive
     impact that precision agriculture has on the environment: with the world’s population growing and
     humans’ total ecological footprint increasing, she believed that precision agriculture could increase
     the food supply and reduce environmental impact. With her expertise in software mapping, Jackie
     felt a responsibility to advance the field of precision agriculture.

15   MT ’s vision statement is, “Towards a more sustainable world and reduced hunger through
     drone-assisted precision agriculture”. The company also has four ethical objectives: encouraging
     environmentally friendly practices, treating employees fairly, practicing corporate social
     responsibility (CSR), and being open in sharing information with stakeholders.

     Although large companies created the hardware and software for precision agriculture,
20   Jackie believed that small businesses like MT had advantages in the field. MT grew rapidly in
     the USA and evolved from a software company to both a software and hardware company. This
     shift occurred when MT received a patent for what became its main product, MT Snap, a device
     that attaches to multispectral cameras mounted on drones. The digital data collected with the
     camera and the device are then fed through cloud-based licensed software developed by MT. The
25   software, MT Map, maps the data with coordinates, allowing farmers to identify the exact location
     of the images on the ground. MT Snap costs $6000, a multispectral camera costs $5000, and the
     cloud-based software requires a $3500 annual license fee. The licensing agreement that comes
     with the software gives MT the right to use the data for its own purposes, such as improving its
     devices and software or researching agriculture (comparing data from several farms).

30   MT owns an industrial building, without a mortgage or any other debt, where its workers
     manufacture MT Snap. This building, located in an industrial park, also holds stock of multispectral
     cameras. Software developers work in project teams, and they and other employees are based
     in leased office spaces in the city centre (downtown) of Lincoln. MT ’s salespeople provide a
     personalized service to farm owners, which contributed to the company’s rapid growth, and
35   additional sales are generated from the company’s website. Jackie attends conferences on
     precision agriculture to promote her company’s products. Although the number of MT employees
     has grown every year, Jackie knows each of them individually.

     In 2020 and 2021, MT upgraded MT Map. However, the upgrade was expensive for MT to produce
     and for end-users to buy, and MT hired additional software developers and a full-time licensed
40   project manager, Kumar, to oversee the software upgrade. During 2020 and 2021, despite strong
     revenue growth, MT was running out of cash because of the cost of the software upgrade.
                                                                 SPEC/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS




                                                  –3–                                            0000 – 5001


     Initially, Kumar used democratic leadership to manage his team, but his style changed as the
     deadline that Jackie had set approached. Becoming increasingly autocratic, he pushed his team
     more and started testing the software less frequently. He wanted to meet the deadline, which his
45   team did. However, when the software upgrade was finally released (rolled out), customers almost
     immediately began reporting problems.

     MT decided that it must either:
     y recall (roll back) the software upgrade and have customers use the old software while the new
       software was being fixed
50   y write a patch, which would take 60 days and thus require a shorter-term roll back.
     Jackie contacted a software consultant, who determined that, although a patch could fix most of
     the issues caused by the software upgrade, the software upgrade itself had major problems that
     would take a year to fix. Jackie accepted the consultant’s conclusions, removed Kumar from the
     job, and asked the consultant to manage the repairs to the software upgrade. The consultant
55   agreed.

     Nearly out of cash, MT would now have further expenses from another year’s work on the software
     upgrade. Jackie also knew the entire incident had damaged MT ’s brand.

     At this time, KiltChem (KC), a multinational company (MNC) specializing in chemical fertilizers,
     approached Jackie with a proposition: it wanted to buy MT. KC had three interests:
60   y KC has access to overseas markets and operates in places where regulations regarding drones
        are less strict than in the USA. KC believes farmers around the world would adopt drone-
        assisted precision agriculture.
     y KC predicted some synergy: MT ’s customers could purchase fertilizers from KC, and KC’s
        customers could adopt drone-assisted precision agriculture.
65   y KC wanted access to all the data that MT ’s cloud-based software had collected.
     Jackie allowed KC to see MT ’s annual revenue figures for the past five years, but she did not
     share the full financial statements: KC could not buy MT without her permission, so she would
     only release the full information when KC had made an offer. Jackie also did not tell KC about the
     problem with the newly released software upgrade.

70   Two days later, KC told Jackie it was prepared to pay her $25 million in cash and $20 million in
     KC shares, but KC would have to see five years’ final accounts before finalizing the offer. Jackie
     knew that if the final offer was in the range of the preliminary offer, the sale of MT would make her
     financially secure for life. KC’s only condition was that Jackie remain the Chief Executive Officer
     (CEO) for three years. However, she also has concerns about the damage that KC’s chemical
75   fertilizers have on the environment.

                                              Section A
1.   Define the term democratic leadership (line 42).                                             [2]

     Democratic leadership refers to the type of leadership whereby employees are consulted
     and asked to participate in the decision-making process. Democratic leaders often use
     this approach because they value the ideas of others.

     Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

     Award [1] for partial understanding. Award [2] if the candidate conveys understanding that
     democratic leadership involves consulting employees in decision-making.

2.   Define the term multinational company (MNC) (line 58).                                       [2]

     A multinational company (MNC) is a company that operates in at least one country other
     than its home country or is legally registered in more than one country.

     Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

     Award [1] for partial understanding. Award [2] if the candidate conveys understanding that
     a multinational company operates in two or more countries.

3.   Describe two elements of MT’s marketing mix.                                                 [4]

     •   Price: MT Snap, $6000; multispectral camera, $5000; cloud-based software,
         $3500 per year.
     •   Place: online and through sales representatives
     •   Product: device, camera and software
     •   Promotion: website and promotion at conferences

     The case study addresses in only a limited way, the issue of people and does not at all
     touch on processes and physical evidence. Up to [1] may be awarded for people,
     provided the response includes some application and explanation. Therefore, do not
     accept processes or physical evidence

     Mark as 2+2.

     Award [1] for each element of the marketing mix identified and an additional [1] for a
     description of each marketing mix identified, up to a maximum of [2].

4.   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for MT of being a small business (line 20).           [4]

     One advantage for MT of being small is that it can offer more personalized services than the
     very large firms with which it competes. Because of its personalized service, MT was able to
     grow very rapidly.

     One disadvantage for MT of being small is that it has fewer resources compared to large
     companies. This disadvantage is particularly relevant when it comes to research and
     development (R&D), as MT now finds itself with very little cash.

     Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

     Mark as 2+2.

     Award [1] for a relevant advantage / disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for a
     relevant explanation of that advantage / disadvantage in the context of MT, up to a maximum
     of [2].

5.   Explain why KC could only purchase MT if it had permission from Jackie (line 67).                [2]

     MT is a private limited company owned 100 % by Jackie. In the case of private limited
     companies, shareholders must agree to the sale of shares to anyone not currently an owner.
     In MT’s case, since Jackie owns it 100 % she has complete authority to determine whether
     someone else or some other company may buy all or a portion of MT.

     Award [1] for explaining that with private limited companies all shareholders must agree to
     the sale of shares to outsiders. Award an additional [1] for application to the case study, up
     to a maximum of [2].
                                                  –8–               SPEC/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Explain one way in which Jackie is potentially meeting MT’s ethical objectives
     (lines 16–18) and one way in which she is not.                                                [6]

     Some ways in which Jackie is potentially meeting MT’s ethical objectives are:
     • Her commitment to fostering sustainable agriculture through precision agriculture. A
        university graduate with a degree in computer science, Jackie could find many
        lucrative paths in life, but she has chosen a very specific one because she believed
        she had a responsibility “to advance the field of precision agriculture.”
     • MT’s commitment to increasing food production is a form of corporate social
        responsibility (CSR). MT does not see its purpose being only to enrich shareholders,
        nor does it use its corporate power to do so. Rather, MT is trying to use its corporate
        power to help farmers produce enough food to feed the world’s growing population.
     • Her commitment to her people. If the candidate addresses “gets to know her
        employees” as a matter of management style or Jackie’s personality, do not accept.
        However, if the candidate elaborates and broadens this understanding (a reasonable
        inference) to be fair and inclusive, accept as a way that Jackie is potentially meeting
        MT’s ethical objectives.

     Potential ways in which Jackie is not meeting MT’s ethical objectives:
     • Her serious consideration of selling MT to a major fertilizer company that produces
         chemical fertilizers. Jackie is fully aware that KiltChem’s (KC’s) products damage the
         environment and KC’s main aim is to sell more fertilizer. KC’s offer to purchase MT
         suggests that KC sees MT as a vehicle to sell more chemical fertilizer. The sale to KC
         would contradict one element of MT’s vision of a more sustainable world.
     • Her removal of Kumar from the job. The case study seems to suggest that Jackie
         accepted the consultant’s conclusions and immediately removed Kumar from the job
         without talking to him or the project team first to determine what had gone wrong.
         Possibly the issue was that Jackie had set an unrealistic deadline. Given the scale of
         the project, perhaps Jackie or some other executive should have been monitoring
         progress more closely. Perhaps Kumar should have been removed from the job, but
         Jackie has an ethical obligation to do some fair investigation first.
     • Her encouragement of KC making an offer by revealing data about past revenue
         growth but withholding information about the current problems with the software
         upgrade and the depleted cash position. Jackie was not doing anything illegal, nor
         would a final offer come through without seeing the final accounts; however, by
         withholding the negative information from KC and by showing the rapidly rising sales
         but not the problems, she is creating a misleading picture of MT. Her action is
         somewhat deceptive. Had KC learned of the problems at the beginning of the
         discussion of the sale of the company, KC might have ended those discussions
         immediately.

                                             Section B

7.   Discuss two appropriate sources of finance that MT could use to pay for the fixing of the
     software upgrade.                                                                                [10]

     MT has four appropriate sources of finance for fixing the software upgrade:
     • Sale of shares. This sale could be to family and friends or a business angel. Going
        public would not be desirable at this time, given that the company is having problems
        and thus would not be able to fetch the most advantageous price. In addition, going
        public would not be feasible because of how long it takes and how much money it costs
        to do all of the paperwork and to pay the lawyers and investment bankers. Selling to
        family and friends would be easier, but it may not raise as much capital as MT needs.
        With the right angel investor, MT could probably raise considerable capital, but
        depending on how much capital MT needs, the angel investor may require Jackie to lose
        a greater percentage of ownership than she would like. If she is desperate for capital,
        she might even have to lose majority control. Further, some angel investors may not
        align with MT’s socially responsible sense of vision.
     • Obtain a bank loan or mortgage secured by the industrial building MT owns. The case
        does not indicate how valuable the building is, so some question exists as to whether the
        bank would, with the building as collateral, lend as much money as MT requires. Bank
        loans can usually be obtained fairly quickly, although a bank loan comes with increased
        expenses—namely, interest—and a schedule of principal and interest payments.
     • Sell the building with an agreement to lease it back. With a sale-leaseback, MT would
        obtain funds as if it were selling the building, but this would come without the expense
        and business interruption of relocation. However, finding a buyer is not always easy
        unless MT were to sell the building at a price lower than the building’s true value. In
        addition, MT would now have lease payments, an extra expense.
     • A combination of equity and debt. Jackie could sell some shares to family and friends.
        For any other funds MT requires, it could get a bank loan secured by the industrial
        building.

     N.B. Do not accept any form of short-term finance, as short-term finance is not appropriate in
     this instance. MT requires more working capital, which can only be obtained by increasing
     long-term debt or raising equity capital.

8.   Discuss whether Jackie should accept or reject the KC’s offer to buy MT.                        [10]

     Reasons why Jackie should consider selling the business include:
     • A company like KiltChem (KC) would have the resources to provide finance for MT to
        complete the software upgrade.
     • Being owned by a multinational corporation, MT would have easier access to foreign
        markets, where regulations on the use of drones are less strict than in the USA. Farmers
        in those markets would represent a great opportunity for MT.
     • Domestically, the predicted synergy between KC and MT would probably lift MT’s sales
        and market share.
     • Because the market is highly competitive, with many large companies competing in it,
        being part of a major corporation would give MT some protection. MT would probably
        benefit from at least some of the economies of scale that KC has.
     • KC has said that a condition of the sale is that Jackie stay on as CEO for at least three
        years, which means that, at a minimum, she can continue working for the company that
        she founded and loves for at least three years.
     • Jackie would become independently wealthy by selling her company.

     Reasons why Jackie may not want to sell MT include:
     • She would lose control of the business. Even though she would still be CEO of MT, she
        would not be the owner. KC would be unlikely to allow autonomous corporate
        governance for MT. Thus, regardless of the downstream corporate governance
        structure, an executive at KC would effectively be her boss.
     • A clear misalignment exists between Jackie and MT’s vision and purpose and KC’s
        vision and purpose. Jackie is interested in helping the world create sustainable solutions
        to agriculture, whereas KC wants to sell more fertilizer. If she sells, Jackie may forever
        feel as though she compromised her values.
     • One of the hidden assets of MT is the data it has obtained from its clients. As noted in
        the case study, the licensing agreement allows MT the right to use the data. Jackie’s
        original purpose for this data was to use it to improve hardware and software and
        conduct agricultural research. KC, however, might use that data for more commercial
        purposes, which somewhat contradicts the socially responsible ethos of MT.
     • After three years, KC may no longer want to employ Jackie. Although she would now be
        independently wealthy, MT is her life’s work and she may not want to be separated.

Answer all questions in this section.

1.   Prime Pies (PP)

     Prime Pies (PP ) produces the highest quality luxury pies. The pies contain organic*
     ingredients and are priced at $20 each, which is significantly more expensive than the pies
     of PP ’s competitors. PP ’s profits have fallen, so PP ’s operations manager is looking at
     producing a cheaper pie that is not made from organic ingredients to meet the needs of
     the mass market. To finance the production of this new pie, PP is planning to sell older
     non-current assets rather than increase its long-term liabilities, such as loans.

     Forecasted financial information on the production of the new pie for 2023 is given in Table 1.

              Table 1: Forecasted financial information on the production of PP ’s new pie

                Direct cost of each new pie                                      $4.20

                Dividends to shareholders                                        10 % of profit per period

                Expenses: administration                                         $28 400

                Expenses: marketing                                              20 % of sales revenue

                Forecast sales volume                                            42 000 pies

                Interest on loans                                                10 % of cost of sales

                Price of the new pie                                             $8

                Tax on profits                                                   20 % on profit before tax

2.   Static Force (SF)

     Static Force (SF ) produces disposable watches. It has a unique selling point/proposition
     (USP) and strong brand awareness in the watch market for offering very low prices. However,
     with online competition growing, SF is experiencing falling sales. The Chief Executive Officer
     (CEO) of SF is considering launching a new watch produced from recyclable materials and
     selling it at a much higher price. The CEO is looking to set the price of this new watch at
     $160. SF ’s current watches are usually priced between $42 and $84.

     Financial information on the new watch is shown in Table 2.

Answer one question from this section.

4.   Coco Delight (CD)

     Coco Delight (CD) produces a range of luxury chocolate bars that are sold and manufactured
     in New Zealand. CD has created an overseas supply chain in which all ingredients for its
     chocolate bars are imported to New Zealand.

     (a)      Describe one feature of a supply chain.                                                                                                      [2]

      ��������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������



     CD is aware that overseas suppliers use palm oil* in the production of chocolate bars. Palm
     oil production is damaging to the environment, so CD has decided to produce a new ethical
     chocolate bar that contains only a quarter of the palm oil used in its other chocolate bars.
     These new ethical chocolate bars will be considerably more expensive than the chocolate
     bars in CD ’s current range and will be priced using a premium pricing method. Part of the
     profits from the sales of the new chocolate bars will be used to finance sustainable palm oil
     production to reduce the impact on the environment.

     (b)      Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CD of using a premium pricing
              method for the new ethical chocolate bar.                                                                                                    [4]

(Question 4 continued)

     CD has employed an economics consultancy to review the current and future economic
     situation in each of the three possible target countries in which it wants to launch the new
     ethical chocolate bar. The chocolate bar is expected to be priced higher than the chocolate
     bars of CD ’s competitors in all three countries. No ethical chocolate bars are currently
     produced by these competitors.

     The consultancy:
     y forecasted economic conditions for each possible target country for 2024 and 2028
     y used data from the last six years and estimated the probability of CD ’s success upon entering
       each market based on the experiences of other confectionery manufacturers
     y carried out an extensive STEEPLE analysis for each possible target country.

     A summary of the results of this consultancy review is given in Table 5.

5.   Quick Scoot (QS)

     Quick Scoot (QS) produces a portfolio of electric scooters (e-scooters) that are unlocked for
     use by a mobile phone application. The three different e-scooter models produced by QS are
     called Alpha, Beta and Gamma.

     Users of the e-scooters pay a small fee per kilometer travelled. QS has significant brand
     loyalty and has found that consumer demand for scooters has grown, especially in busy
     cities where transport options are limited. QS is a product-orientated business.

     An increase in congestion has meant that a number of competitors have entered the
     market at a rapid rate. Through secondary market research, QS has found that competition
     has intensified. In 2019, the total profits for all three of QS ’s e-scooters fell. QS ’s newly
     appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO) thinks that each e-scooter model should be
     separated into a profit centre, as shown in Table 6 below.

     QS began to consider introducing a new e-scooter model, Delta. It would be a cheaper
     model targeted at students or people on low income. Production of the new e-scooter
     would be outsourced to a neighbouring country with much lower wage rates and material
     costs. However, there would be language/cultural barriers involved in communicating with
     the outsourced company as well as quality control concerns. Some of QS ’s management
     thought that Delta offered the only chance for QS to maintain its profitability.

(Question 5 continued)

     Delta was introduced in 2020, but the financial situation for QS continued to deteriorate. By
     2022, the market for e-scooters had become saturated. QS had very limited working capital
     to support all four e-scooter models beyond providing some limited above-the-line promotion.

     The CEO of QS has provided customer and market information for all four e-scooter models,
     as shown in Table 7, in order to consider which model should be removed from the portfolio.
     This information was extracted from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix for QS.

                                              Section A

1.   (a)   Define the term mass market                                                                 [2]

           A market for goods that are produced in very large quantities. Because of
           economies of scale, products sold in mass markets are less expensive than goods
           produced for niche or highly specialized markets.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for partial understanding which may include some reference to either an
           undifferentiated market or large volume operations. Award [2] if the candidate
           provides an accurate and clear definition which includes references to products sold
           in large quantities and reference to an undifferentiated market.

     (b)   (i)   Construct a forecasted profit and loss account for the production of PP’s
                 new pie (show all your working).                                                      [4]

     Award [1] for each correct calculation (if any calculations are needed in addition to the
     construction of the P&L). In this question, cost of sales needs to be calculated.

     If the profit and loss account is constructed following the IBO format and is correct in all
     respects with full working shown, award [4]. Apply own figure rule (OFR): if the candidate
     incorrectly calculated cost of sales but otherwise the profit and loss account is constructed
     following the IBO format and is correct in all other respects, award [3] If the answer is
     correct and done according to the IBO format but no working is shown, award [3]

     Award [2] if the candidate produces a profit for period figure (OFR regarding cost of
     sales), but does not follow the IBO format. Award [1] if the candidate shows some
     understanding of what a profit and loss account is, but the actual account constructed is
     not in the IBO format and has numerous errors.

(b)   (ii)   Calculate the forecasted gross profit margin for the new pie.                       [2]

                                   159 600
             Gross profit margin
                             =             × 100
                                              = 47.5 %
                                   336 000


Award [1] for correct working and [1] for a correct answer – allow for own figure rule (OFR).

(c)   Explain one disadvantage for PP of selling older non-current assets to finance the
      production of the new pie.                                                                 [2]

      Selling assets to finance the new pie will reduce PP’s productive capacity. Even though
      sales of their more expensive pies have fallen, PP will still have to produce a
      forecasted 42 000 new pies.

      PP sell the highest quality luxury pies. Reducing productive capacity may impact on
      PP’s ability to continue to sell the highest quality pies.

Award [1] for an explanation of a relevant disadvantage with an additional [1] for application
to PP.

2.   (a)   Define the term brand awareness.                                                          [2]

           Brand awareness refers to the degree to which consumers recognize a
           product by its name and/or special characteristics.
           This recognition could be due to a specific logo or trademark associated with the
           brand.

     Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

     Award [1] for partial understanding concerning recognition. Award [2] if the candidate
     provides an accurate and clear definition with some mention of brand awareness being
     linked to a logo or other form of recognition.

     Award [0] if candidates refer to brand awareness being awareness of a brand or similar
     tautological response.

     (b)   Using information from Table 2:

           (i)     construct a fully labelled break-even chart for SF, to scale, for the new watch
                   (show all your working);                                                          [4]

     Award marks as follows:
     [1] for both appropriately labelled axes – y-axis must include both costs and revenue.
     The x-axis can be any suggestion of quantity: units- new watches.
     [1] for accurately drawn and labelled total cost line.
     [1] for accurately drawn and labelled total revenue line.
     [1] for indication of break-even point. OFR applies from part [x].
     Award a maximum of [2] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight edge, or is not
     to scale.
     If a candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0].

     (b)   (ii)    calculate the margin of safety (show all your working).                            [2]

                   Margin of safety = 88 000 watches − BE point (50 000) watches = 38 000 watches.

     Award [1] if the candidate demonstrates how to calculate the margin of safety but makes
     a mathematical error.

     Award [2] if the candidate demonstrates how to calculate the margin of safety and
     produces the correct answer.

     Accept OFR.

     (c)   Explain one advantage for SF of introducing the new watch.                                 [2]

           The new watch will create a new market opportunity for SF at a time of falling sales due
           to growing online competition. This market opportunity could lead to a new positioning
           of SF’s watches in a higher price bracket and increased sales.

           The new watch will allow SF to use up some of its spare capacity, as the current
           margin of safety is 38 000 watches, and possibly in the future allow the new watch to
           be produced at lower cost, thus reducing its high retail price.

     Award [1] for an advantage, with an additional [1] for application to SF.

3.   (a)   Describe one feature of batch production.                                                  [2]

           •      Involves production of a group of identical products. Products are made as
                  specified groups or amounts within a given time frame.
           •      Customers are offered customized products but using a range of standardized
                  options.
           •      This method of production requires careful planning, as the components for the
                  products need to be interchangeable.

     Accept any other relevant feature.

     Award [1] for a partial description which may refer to the idea that similar items are
     manufactured in groups with some variation. Award an additional [1] to include a full
     description of some reference to the idea that the group of products move through each
     manufacturing stage together until completed.

(b)   (i)    Describe how the mean sales of pairs of shoes per month for FS could have been
             calculated.                                                                        [1]

             The mean sales per month could have been calculated by adding together the
             total sales for the year and dividing by 12.

Award [1] for a correct answer.

Candidates are not expected to word their description exactly as above.

      (ii)   On the graph, plot the mean sales of pairs of shoes per year since 2014
             (show your labelling clearly).                                                     [2]




Award [2] if both axes are clearly labelled, sales data clearly plotted, and line graph drawn
connecting all points as shown in the diagram

Award [1] if one of the above elements is missing.

Award [0] if two of the above are missing or the plotted points on the diagram are so poorly
presented that it is hard to verify accuracy easily

      (iii)   On the graph you plotted in (b)(ii), construct a line of best fit through the
              mean sales data.                                                                 [1]

Award [1] for a correct line of best fit drawn with a ruler.

      (iv)    On the graph you constructed in (b)(iii), draw (extrapolate) a value for
              mean sales in 2022 and 2023 from the line of best fit.                           [2]

              From the graph, the extrapolated value of mean sales for 2022 is 11.7, or 1170
              shoes, while for 2023 it is 13.3, or 1330 shoes.

Award [1] for each correct extrapolated value, up to a maximum of [2].

Allow OFR but note below;
If the extrapolated line is not accurately drawn but is a straight line and the candidate
has correctly and accurately produced an extrapolated value, then apply OFR.

Do not award a mark if the extrapolated value has been created by inaccurate use of
a ruler or the line of best fit has been extended inappropriately.

(c)   Explain one diseconomy of scale that FS could experience.                                [2]

      A possible diseconomy of scale occurs when the unit costs of production increase over
      the long run. Sales at FS are growing at a dramatic rate and, with a small number of
      managers and limited workspace, coordination and communication challenges may
      lead to rising unit costs as the scale and sale of production of shoes increases.

Award [1] for a response which may include an application of a diseconomy of scale
to FS with an additional [1] for a clear theoretical explanation. For [2] there must be
some indication in the theoretical explanation that the diseconomy of scale will lead
to an increase in unit costs.

4.   (a)   Describe one feature of a supply chain.                                                      [2]

           A supply chain illustrates the full production process of a product from the extraction of
           raw materials through manufacturing and eventually to distribution so that it reaches
           the end user. Parts of a supply chain could include extraction to manufacturing. It is
           possible to outsource parts of the supply chain process to a third party.

     Award [1] for a partial description (part of the production process such as extraction of raw
     materials) with an additional [1] to include a full description highlighting two aspects of the
     supply chain process (manufacturing and distribution).

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CD of using a premium pricing
           method for the new ethical chocolate bar.                                                    [4]

           Advantages

           •   An ethical bar will be a new venture for CD. The stimulus indicates the
               possibility for a first mover advantage as there are no existing competitors. A
               premium pricing method under these circumstances could allow CD to earn
               significant profits.

           •   If consumers are influenced by ethical and environmental considerations in their
               purchasing habits then a premium pricing method (with some of the profits
               being used to ensure sustainability of the crops) can be justified and could lead
               to brand loyalty.

           •   CD could become a price leader and influence the prices of its other bars and
               positively impact on positioning.

           Disadvantages

           •   However, given that CD’s current chocolate bar range is priced considerably
               lower, a premium pricing method could discourage existing customers as the
               marketing mix for the new bar is different. Overall sales volumes of CD’s bars
               may fall.

           •   The premium price method will impact negatively on the positioning of CD and
               may cannibalize the sales of its existing bars in its portfolio.

           •   A premium pricing method will require an extension of promotional campaigns
               both below and above the line to convince existing and potential customers that
               the additional mark-up in price is appropriate and justified given the ethical and
               environmental opportunities. This new promotional mix will add to CD’s
               promotional budget and increase total costs.

     Accept any other relevant response.

     Mark as 2+2.

     Award [1] for a relevant advantage/disadvantage, with an additional [1] for application to CD
     and the new ethical chocolate bar. Award up to a maximum of [2].

(c)   (i)    Comment on the market research results in Table 4.                                    [2]

             The results indicate that country X has the highest number of respondents who
             would try or possibly try the new ethical chocolate bar at 92 % and the lowest
             negative response at 8 %

             Country Y has a high level of response rate at 80 % for both try and possibly try
             but has the highest response rate of those who would not try the ethical
             chocolate bar at 20 %

             Country Z has a low negative response (10 %) and a high positive result (90 % for
             those who would try or possibly try). These results are close to that of country X.

             The market research strongly supports launching in country X and Z

Award [1] for a comment in context. An additional [1] if there is some mention of the actual
data in terms of a percentage from the market research

(c)   (ii)   Explain one benefit for CD of collecting market research using random sampling.       [2]

             Random sampling is an unbiased method of market research because
             respondents are equally likely to be chosen in the research process. CD will
             obtain unbiased responses regarding their new brand. These customer
             responses to their new chocolate bar will help CD with more realistic future sales,
             cash flow and profit projections.

Award [1] for a theoretical response, such as reduced bias, with an additional [1] for
application to CD.

(d)   Using the data provided in Table 4 and Table 5, and other information in the stimulus,
      recommend which target country CD should launch its new ethical chocolate bar in.         [10]

      CD have three target countries and will be using a combination of market research and
      information from an economics consultancy. Both agencies provided forecasts and,
      with the launch of the chocolate bar being a new venture for CD, all decisions on which
      country in which to launch the new chocolate bar must be taken in this context.

      Country X seems a strong candidate. Market research indicating that 60 % of
      respondents would try this new bar is the most favorable. The economy seems stable,
      but the probability of success based on the experience of other companies is the
      lowest. The STEEPLE analysis suggests that launching this product into country X will
      be met by a favorable attitude to the business.

      Country Y has a stable economy but with no clear trend in the STEEPLE and limited
      technology; it must therefore be viewed as a less favorable proposition. The market
      research for country Y is also less favorable than for country X: country Y has the
      highest rate of respondents who would not try the new product.

      Country Z clearly represents the biggest challenge and potential opportunity for CD.
      Market research is not conclusive, and the STEEPLE raises concerns for the future.
      Information is lacking about the impact of the declining economy in the short term.

      Basing a judgement on these forecasts alone is not sufficient, and more information
      would be required around the cultural preferences/barriers, consumer confidence and
      the inevitable reaction by competitors. This is a new chocolate ethical bar and it is
      expected that competitors will analyze CD’s success before making a decision, but
      competition is likely. The probability of success for the chocolate bar also has to be
      treated with a note of caution. Country X seems the safest bet, with country Z a close
      second. The company’s attitude to risk will be important in determining the final
      decision.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

Additional guidance:
If the candidate discusses one country only (with balanced and substantiated arguments)
then award a maximum of [5].
If there is no balance, then for a one-sided response where only one country is considered
then award a maximum of [3].
If the candidate makes no reference to the data provided by the STEEPLE or market
research, then the maximum mark to be awarded is [4] even if there is some balance.

5.   (a)    Describe one feature of a product-oriented business.                                          [2]

            An approach by companies that focuses their attention and resources on the product
            that they produce, typically by making the product as high quality or special as
            possible. Product-oriented companies are generally not concerned about the quantity
            of sales or market trends but rather that they are offering the highest quality or most
            special product for its target

     Award [1] for a partial description, which may include reference to not being influenced by
     customer or market trends, with an additional [1] where the description includes reference to
     highest production quality.

     (b)    Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for QS of converting the three
            e-scooters into profit centres in 2019.                                                       [4]

     Advantages

     •     Profit centre conversion will allow QS to develop greater autonomy away from overall
           senior management in terms of tactical and even medium-term decision-making and
           allow each manager for each profit centre to focus on their own e-scooter. An
           individualised focus could boost employee and management motivation and this
           might lead to greater productivity.
     •      ‘Alpha is clearly a ‘star’ and with additional freedom to capitalise on its success may
           even grow further with increased brand loyalty.
     •     Beta has suffered the biggest fall in profitability according to Table 6. The manager of
           this profit centre could be given autonomy and focus their attention to reduce costs.
     •     Gamma has a smaller profit drop but with intensifying competition in the future. The
           manager of the profit centre will need to focus on strategies to enable Gamma to
           thrive in the competitive market space.

     Disadvantages

     •     Profit centres can breed competition between managers which could be motivating
           but QS run the risk of the managers pursuing their individual goals rather than align
           the benefits brought about from the competition with the strategic direction of the
           overall business.
     •     Beta and Gamma may focus on cost minimization, which while useful to return both
           centres to profitability, may undermine Alpha’s brand value as customers may still
           perceive that Beta and Gamma belong with Alpha under the QS family brand.
     •     Individual accountability at the profit centre level will mean that the senior
           management of QS will have to spend additional time and resources monitoring the
           performance of three profit centres.
     •     Overall promotional/advertising costs may rise as each e-scooter is treated as a
           separate brand. Marketing messages will need to be co-ordinated so that consumers
           do not go confused. There is evidence form the stimulus that even without the Delta
           overlapping target markets are evident.

     Award [1] for a relative advantage/disadvantage with an additional [1] for application to QS

     The application can refer to one profit centre. It is not expected that the candidate will provide
     application to all three potential profit centres for any related advantage/disadvantage.

    (c)   Explain one cost and one benefit for QS of outsourcing production of the new
          e-scooter, Delta, to a neighbouring country.                                                  [4]
Costs


• Possible issues with quality control.
• Language/cultural barriers.
• More dependent on other company and QS cannot afford product disruption as the market
  is becoming increasingly competitive.


Benefits

•    Lower wage rates.
•    Reduced material costs and a stronger possibility of reducing price of Delta.
•    If profit centres remain, managers will be able to focus on marketing and financial strategies
     to increase contribution and profitability in Alpha.



    Mark as 2+2.

    Award [1] for an appropriate cost/benefit and an additional [1] for application to QS. Award
    up to a maximum of [2].

    (d)   Using the data provided in Table 7, other information in the stimulus, and a Boston
          Consulting Group (BCG) matrix, recommend to QS which e-scooter model should be
          removed from QS’s portfolio in order for the company to remain profitable.                   [10]

          The information in Table 6 indicates that total profit at QS has fallen from 14 m to 3.2 m
          in only 2 years. Coupled with the stimulus which indicates that competition in this
          sector is likely to intensify from other e-scooter manufacturers, the future of QS does
          not look positive supporting three let alone a fourth e-scooter.

          Given Qs’ limited working capital and investment in Delta it would be unwise of QS not
          to pursue launching Delta. Hence, a decision to withdraw a potential e-scooter falls on
          the analysis of the other three e-scooters from the existing portfolio. To support this
          decision-making process a potential BCG can be created from the information in
          Table 7.

           E-scooter    Current market          Future market            BCG
                        share                   growth                   classification
           Alpha        High                    High                     Star
           Beta         Medium                  Low                      Cash Cow
           Gamma        Declining               Declining                Dog
           Delta        Medium                  Possibly high            Problem child
                                             – 16 –             SPEC/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     Alpha has a strong argument to be retained given its position within the BCG as a clear star
     product. It easily has the greatest contribution to overall profitability. It really does not make
     any sense to withdraw Alpha

     The analysis would seem to boil down to keeping either the Beta or Gamma.

     For Beta – its target market is adult females. This market is also overlapping with Gamma’s
     target customer. As a cash cow, Beta will still generate sales possibly through brand loyalty
     and it does make a contribution to fixed costs which is bigger than Gamma’s. Beta though
     has experienced the biggest fall in profitability from the information in Table 6.

     For Gamma, competition is likely to intensify. It has declining market share and future
     growth. It is not making a contribution to fixed costs. However, if viewed as a ‘dog’ it could
     block outside competitors from entering until Delta establishes itself in an intensifying market.
     Gamma represents a potential ‘watch dog’ characteristic of the BCG and this could allow
     time for Delta to thrive.

     However, as the financial situation is beginning to deteriorate and competition is intensifying,
     it would seem appropriate, based on evidence from stimulus and the BCG matrix to
     withdraw Gamma from the market. The information from Table 6 is particularly worrying even
     if Gamma converts into a profit centre. We have little information from the stimulus of its
     chances of becoming sustainable. Its future looks bleak and all other things being equal it
     should be withdrawn.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

Additional guidance:
If the candidate discusses one scooter only (with balanced and substantiated arguments) then
award a maximum of [5]

To reach the 7–8 mark band, appropriate business language of the BCG matrix (star, cash cow,
dog, problem child) is expected to be used in the analysis.
To reach the top mark band requires that the candidate refers to at least two scooters with a fully
substantiated balanced argument.

                       SML’s promise: you buy one meal, they’ll donate another!

Share My Lunch (SML), a privately owned social enterprise, has just shared its 100 000 th healthy free
meal with local school children.

SML’s vision statement is, “To ensure that no child goes hungry at school by providing healthy free meals
to those in need”. The Global Health Organization’s recent data (Table 1), which is based on schools in
42 countries, provides evidence of the positive impact of healthy meals.

SML was created by a group of students who were volunteering at a shelter providing free breakfasts to
homeless people, during which they realized that many recipients were school-aged children. The central
idea of the enterprise is that, for each lunch produced by SML and purchased by a customer, a free
healthy lunch is donated to a school child in a lower-than-average income area in that community. The
free lunches are delivered to the schools on a daily basis.

As a start-up, SML was financed in 2018 through donations and staffed mostly by volunteers. Today,
it has 10 paid managers and a chief executive officer (CEO). The launch of SML was accompanied by
a significant media event supported by the government and a number of well-known sport and media
celebrities. Now, SML generates 80 % of its revenue through sales of its lunches.

Despite its enormous success, SML has recently had some issues with negative publicity and
uncertainty over its new strategic direction. A number of dissatisfied volunteers have collectively and
anonymously written several negative posts on social media referring to:
y the very high salaries of the CEO, while volunteers receive no pay
y the reduction of the budget for providing healthy free meals to school children, which comes at a
  time when the prices for SML’s paid-for lunches have increased and concerns over food quality
  have arisen
y the poor working conditions and declining motivation of SML’s volunteers.

The management of SML have not replied to media requests to confirm or deny these accusations.

         SML is lying. What happened to their ethical objectives and business transparency*?
         I have just finished a four-hour shift making lunches for school kids and had to eat
         some of the food because I cannot afford to buy my own lunch. Today, I found out
         that the CEO is paid a very high salary. The food I am preparing is increasingly poor
         quality because food costs are rising. I will share some figures in my next post.
         SML’s management do not want you to see these.

Resource 3 – Internal email from SML’s CEO to all managers regarding the enterprise’s
              new strategic direction


          • CEO@sharemylunch.com
          To: volunteers@sharemylunch.com

          Dear all,

          Please note that it is against our company policy for volunteers to post about
          SML on social media, and we will find those responsible for the recent posts.

          Now we must focus on our next strategic direction. It was noted in our last
          meeting that:
          y our food costs are rising and, given our growth, we will have to pay our volunteers
            a wage if we want to increase production
          y if we want to continue to be sustainable and ethical and remain true to our vision,
            we will need to find new sources of finance
          y we have been approached by one of our fast-food competitors, a large publicly
            owned multinational company (MNC), about a possible joint venture. We would
            benefit from significant internal and external economies of scale if we partnered
            with this company.

          A possible way forward is to use Porter’s generic strategies, adopting either a cost
          focus strategy (if we stay in our narrow market) or a differentiation strategy (if we
          decide to try and increase market growth). Other strategies could also be used.
          However, we need to make a quick decision, as this will affect SML for the next five
          years at least.

          CEO, Share My Lunch

     meets by donating free healthy lunches to school children.                                     [2]

     The human needs that SML meets by donating free healthy lunches to school children
     include:
     • physiological needs being met from feeding the children
     • security/safety needs being met as children’s behaviour improves
     • cognitive needs due to improved opportunities for learning for the children.

     Reference to the impact on other stakeholders should be rewarded.

2.   Explain two possible challenges facing SML.                                                    [6]

     SML faces a number of challenges:
     • The volunteer workforce – if the social media post is representative of a wider human-
        resource issue, the volunteers are finding that their goodwill is being undermined due
        to some confusion over ethical objectives and poor working conditions. An internal
        email has indicated that volunteers will need to be paid if the growth of SML’s
        business operations is to be sustained. This will raise costs. In the case study, it is
        implied that there may be motivation challenges also.
     • SML’s ethical objectives are under threat due to a perceived high management salary
        when volunteers are not being paid. The perceived high price for meals is not being
        transferred into high-quality free meals for the school children who receive a donated
        meal. The lack of transparency that is vital for social enterprises needs to be explored
        to illustrate the impact SML is having on its communities.
     • The long-term sustainability of the business is under threat from new competition and
        the internal problems being experienced. There is a clear need to redefine SML’s
        strategic direction. The tempting offer from the fast-food competitor of a possible joint
        venture could allow for some new innovations in terms of service or products.
        However, whilst positive in financial terms, this offer may undermine SML’s ethical
        USP.

     Mark as [3+3].

     Award [1] for identification of a challenge, [1] for explanation and [1] for application to
     SML.

3.   Using all the resources provided and your knowledge of business management,
     recommend a possible plan of action to ensure the sustainability of SML for the next five
     years.                                                                                            [17]

     SML has clearly had a very significant impact on its community, with 100 000 free meals
     donated. The impact on external stakeholders has been very positive (Resource 1) and
     the enterprise has created a USP in an increasingly competitive fast-food market by using
     a premium pricing model. The positive word-of-mouth promotion from celebrities and
     support from the government has created great publicity. The offer from the fast-food
     company for a possible joint venture will bring capital and fresh thinking into their business
     decision making and could be part of a cost focus strategy if SML remains in its current
     narrow market.

     The joint venture could also lead to a differentiation strategy, as the joint venture will lead
     to SML being able to compete in a broader marketplace. A new potential range of
     products or services could be created.

     However, the long-term sustainability of SML is being challenged unless greater
     transparency around costs and ethical objectives is addressed. SML could easily undo all
     of the positive word-of-mouth promotion and goodwill it has generated. Resource 2(a) and
     2(b) represent one of the several dissatisfied volunteers, but there could be many more.
     SML will have to pay particular attention to its human-resource issues regarding its
     volunteers. The offer from the competitor, whilst tempting, will be viewed by some as a
     possible betrayal of the enterprise’s ethical objectives. Will SML cut costs further by using
     the materials from the fast-food company? The success of the business has been based
     on people coming forward to support SML’s vision (Resource 1).

     What will happen to the culture when paid volunteers become the norm (Resource 3)?
     How will SML be able to motivate volunteers if they perceive that managers are being paid
     very high salaries? SML will need to consider motivation theories, such as Herzberg’s
     two-factor theory or Adams’ equity theory.

     SML may have to introduce a piece-rate system or look at motivating volunteers beyond
     working for a social enterprise with a strong ethical vision. Issues of fairness abound in
     this social enterprise. Resource 3 points to a number of financial issues around financing
     increased capacity. The offer of a joint venture from the fast-food competitor may further
     damage SML’s brand image.

     Either strategy carries risks in terms of undermining SML’s social enterprise vision and
     goodwill on the part of the volunteers.

     SML is at a critical point in its development. Its business model and ethical objectives
     have been brought into question. Its expansion plans may be thwarted by human-
     resource challenges and a lack of finance. Long-term sustainability is under threat. An
     important feature of a social enterprise is to be open and transparent with its operations
     so that stakeholders can regard the impact and vision of the organization as being
     credible. SML will need to address its short-term concerns, and quickly, before planning
     for future growth.

     Marks should be allocated according to the assessment criteria on pages 7–8.

        0
                  below.
                  The response makes limited reference to the resource materials
        1         provided or the resources identified have been used ineffectively to
                  support the recommended plan of action.
                  The response makes some reference to the resource materials provided
        2         or the resources identified have been used in a superficial way to
                  support the recommended plan of action.

      3–4         some reference to the relevant areas of the business. There is some
                  evidence of evaluation but it is not sustained.
                  The student effectively evaluates the expected impact of their plan of
      5–6         action on the relevant areas of the business and considers the trade-offs
                  between those areas.

Criterion D: Sequencing of ideas and plan of action

To what extent are the student’s ideas and plan of action sequenced in a clear and coherent manner?

     Marks        Level descriptor
                  The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors
        0
                  below.

1.    Galileo Manufacturing Ltd. (GM)

      Galileo Manufacturing Ltd. (GM ) is a private limited company that operates a manufacturing
      facility on the International Space Station. Using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, GM
      manufactures parts and tools for use by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
      (NASA) of the United States (US) government. NASA is GM ’s sole customer. Soon, GM will
      expand its manufacturing capacity to make large items, such as satellites, that NASA can
      then put into orbit.

      A new manufacturing facility with increased capacity will cost $40 million. Expected profit

2.   Design by Elaine (DBE)

     Elaine, an artist and designer, operates as a sole trader under the name Design by Elaine
     (DBE ). To improve brand awareness, she opened a four-month pop-up shop* in a shopping
     centre. DBE ’s estimated cash inflows, outflows and opening cash balance for the four
     months are shown in Table 2. Elaine sold existing stock (inventory).

                Table 2: Selected financial information for DBE ’s four-month pop-up store

                   Estimated revenue per month                                   $2000 for the first month, increasing
                                                                                 by 10 % each following month

                   Monthly rent                                                  $1000

                   Opening cash balance                                          $500

                   Electricity cost per month                                    $200

                   Elaine’s monthly salary                                       $500

                   Promotional expenses                                          $200 in the first and third month


     The pop-up shop performed less well than Elaine had forecasted. Revenue peaked in the
     third month but fell in the fourth. Her closing cash balance was $1800. Towards the end of
     the fourth month, the shopping centre owner, Jack, asked Elaine whether she would like to
     continue operating the pop-up shop. He offered her a two-year lease on the shop, with a
     monthly rental of $1400. Elaine’s existing stock was almost depleted.

3.   Beacon Meals Enterprises (BME)

     Yimin Xie founded Beacon Meals Enterprises (BME ) in 1993. BME is a non-profit social
     enterprise that operates in the San Francisco Bay area of the United States of America
     (USA). Because of a large number of billionaires in the San Francisco Bay area, housing
     prices are very high. As a result, the area has one of the highest rates of homelessness in
     the USA.

     BME operates four restaurants in the area. All meals are free, although BME accepts
     donations from customers. Almost all the customers are homeless.

(Question 3 continued)

     Most of the ingredients BME ’s restaurant’s use are donated, typically right before their
     expiration date. As such, they must be used the same day. BME ’s preparation of meals relies
     heavily on donated food for two reasons:
     y Food wastage contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, which cause
       global warming.
     y It is cheaper than buying food, which means BME can produce more meals for its customers.

     By 2021, BME ’s restaurants were so well known that large groups of homeless people would
     gather around them. People living in the neighbourhoods in which BME ’s restaurants were
     located began to complain. While these people felt concern for the homeless, they also
     thought that groups of homeless people made their neighbourhoods less attractive and less
     safe. Yimin feared his life’s work might fall apart.

     (d)     Using the information in the stimulus, discuss the rewards and challenges Yimin might
             experience while running BME.[10]

4.   Waldo Manufacturing PLC (WM)

     Waldo Manufacturing PLC (WM ), a public limited company, manufactures premium lighting
     fixtures for residences. In January 2020, the company increased its number of shares
     from 1 million to 1.2 million by selling 200 000 shares at $50 per share. WM also borrowed
     $20 million in the form of a bank loan.

     The funds from both sources were used to shift from a mass production process to a mass
     customization process. The change in how WM manufactured its products also had a
     significant impact on its marketing strategy.

     Employee reaction to the shift in processes was largely supportive, although employees were
     also nervous about the impact the shift might have on the profit-sharing bonuses at the end
     of the year.

     The CFO’s financial forecasts proved very accurate. At the annual shareholders’ meeting
     at the end of 2022, the shareholders were divided: some were pleased by the results of the
     first two years of mass customization, while others were dissatisfied. The dissatisfied group
     became even angrier when the CFO announced that the company was to issue another
     200 000 shares at $40 per share. The $8 million that would be raised by the sale of the
     shares was necessary to support WM ’s increased working capital requirements.

     At the annual general meeting, the head of the Human Resources Department reported that
     the number of WM ’s employees had increased significantly over the past two years. In 2020,
     the year before shifting to mass customization, WM employed 1200 people; by the end of
     2022, WM employed 1500 people.

     (e)     Using the information in the stimulus, evaluate WM’s decision to shift from mass
             production to mass customization.                                                                                                            [10]

                                                 Section A

1.   (a)   State two advantages of a private limited company.                                    [2]

           Advantages of a private limited company include:
           • limited liability for the shareholders
           • easier to raise capital than it is for a sole trader or partnership
           • business continues to exist when a shareholder dies
           • cannot lose control, as sale of shares must be approved by all shareholders.

     Accept any other relevant advantage.

     Award [1] for each advantage stated, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   For the new manufacturing facility:

           (i)   calculate the payback period (show all your working);                           [2]

                 All figures below are in millions.

                 Profit is $8 + $12 + $16 + $16 = $52

                 In the first three years, the profit is $8 + $12 + $16 = $36

                 $40 [total cost] − $36 (profit in first three years) = $4

                 Divide $4 by $16 (profit in the fourth year) and then multiply by 12 months
                    $4
                 =      × 12 months = 3 months
                   $16

                 The payback period is 3 years and 3 months.

                 Accept 3.25 years or 3 1/4 years.

     If a candidate says something like “the payback is in the fourth year,” award [1].

     Allow for own figure rule (OFR).

     Award [1] for the correct answer and [1] for correct workings, up to a maximum of [2].
                                                  –7–          SPEC/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     (ii)    calculate the average rate of return (ARR) (show all your working);                [2]

              Year                            0         1     2        3        4
              Forecasted annual profit                  $8   $12      $16     $16
              (in millions of dollars)

             All figures below are in millions.

             $8 + $12 + $16 + ($16 + $2.5[residual value]) = $54.5
             $54.5 [total profit] − $40 [initial cost] = $14.5
             $14.5
                    years = $3.625
               4

             $3.625
                    × 100 = 9.0625 %
              $40

Accept 9.06 %.

Allow for own figure rule (OFR).

Award [1] for the correct answer and [1] for correct workings, up to a maximum of [2].

     (iii)   Comment on your answer from either b(i) or b(ii).                                  [2]

             Candidates may make any accurate commentary, as long as it reflects
             information in the responses to either of the two investment appraisal
             calculations. Examples include:
             • The payback period was well short of the contract period. Thus, if GM runs
                  into unanticipated expenses, the company has some margin of error to
                  receive full payback on its funds.
             • Whereas no industry averages are provided (they are not available, as GM is
                  sui generis), the average rate of return is a respectable 9.06 %. This
                  investment is on a government contract. GM has no competition, and the risk
                  of being in space (very risky) is presumably built into its existing return
                  consideration. For this marginal investment, the 9.06 % represents a
                  respectable return.
             • Even if some dissatisfaction exists among GM’s shareholders about the
                  investment yield (ARR of 9.06 %), GM may well be wise to make the
                  investment and accept the contract in order to position itself as the first
                  manufacturer in outer space and to secure its place with NASA and the US
                  government.

Accept any other relevant commentary.

Award [1] for a basic commentary that is largely descriptive. Award an additional [1] if the
candidate offers some reasonable explanation, up to a maximum of [2].

(c)   Explain one reason for GM manufacturing on the International Space Station.           [2]

      •   The proposed investment is profitable and, presumably, has acceptable return
          rates for GM.
      •   Infrastructure availability: GM is ready to expand capacity, from tool
          manufacturing to satellite manufacturing. Space exists on the space station.
      •   Proximity to the market: satellites are bulky and heavy items, so being
          manufactured in space should bring transportation costs down.
      •   Development of expertise: no one else is manufacturing in outer space, and this
          would give GM a chance to develop its expertise in this area.

Accept any other relevant reason.

Award [1] for identification of a reason and an additional [1] for explanation and
application, up to a maximum of [2].

2.   (a)   State two advantages of operating as a sole trader.                                      [2]

           Advantages of operating as a sole trader include:
           • easy and inexpensive to set up
           • owner is in complete control
           • owner keeps all profits
           • flexibility in terms of working hours.

     Accept any other relevant advantage.

     Award [1] for each advantage stated, up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Using Table 2, prepare a cash-flow forecast for DBE for the four months of
           operation of its pop-up shop.                                                            [6]

     Accept slightly different headings / format.

     N.B. Allow candidate own figure rule (OFR): if a candidate makes an error in one row and
     carries it through the remainder of the forecast that is only one error. This provision
     includes both mathematical errors and conceptual errors (for example, if a candidate has
     the interest in the incorrect month then candidates should only lose [1] for that error.

     If a candidate misclassifies an item, like salary, as an inflow, consider that as one error.

     Award [1] if the candidate conveys some understanding of what a cash flow forecast is,
     but otherwise the forecast is largely inaccurate, incomplete, or illegible.

Award a maximum of [5] if otherwise fully correct. Deduct any further marks according to the
guidance above for mathematical and conceptual errors.

Award [2–3] if a cash flow forecast is drawn, but either it is not in a generally accepted format
or it is untidy, and/or the forecast contains three or more errors, which could include, in
addition to number placement problems and mathematical errors, conceptual errors (using
the word “profit” rather than “net cash flow”) or omissions, such as not having a line like
“closing balance” or totals.

Award [4–5] if the cash flow forecast is drawn essentially correctly and neatly in a generally
accepted format, but there is one error for [5] or two errors for [4].

Award [6] if the cash flow forecast is drawn accurately and neatly in a generally accepted
format and is error free. If the candidate provides a heading of total cash inflow/total cash
outflow without using another heading above of cash inflow or cash outflow – do not penalize
as an omission.

If the candidate omitted both headings of cash outflow/cash inflow that is one error, using the
term “net profit in the cash flow forecast” instead of “net cash flow” is inaccurate and [1]
should be deducted. If the candidate has only one row for all cash outflows, deduct [1] from
the total mark awarded.

Full working is not expected.

(c)   Comment on whether Elaine should continue to operate her pop-up shop for
      two more years.                                                                              [2]

      Had Elaine been paying $1400 a month from inception, her cash balance at the end of
      month four would have been only $982. This situation means, given that she had an
      opening balance of $500, her pop-up shop actually had a net cash inflow of $482 over
      the four-month period.

      In addition, the fact that sales revenue peaked in the third month and then fell gives
      some reason to believe that the product life cycle of her pop-up shop has reached the
      decline stage.

      The presence of the pop-up shop probably enhanced Elaine’s brand, but it appears
      that barely sufficient demand exists in her current cost structure. Closing the shop after
      four months will lower her costs considerably. She should probably consider closing the
      shop, operating her design business out of her home, and generating sales online.

Award [1] if the candidate calculates the financial impact, had Elaine been paying $1400 a
month for the first four months or provides a contextualized response based upon the
cashflow showing some understanding of cash flow challenges the business would face if it
extended the lease and an additional [1] for another relevant comment, such as:
 • Actual cash flow in the first four months was barely positive.
 • Evidence suggests that the life cycle of her pop-up is in the decline phase.
 • An e-business might better support her, as it would mean substantially lower costs.

Accept any other relevant comment.

3.   (a)   State two features of a social enterprise.                                                  [2]

           Features of a social enterprise include:
           • Social enterprises have a clear public mission, that is, a mission to perform some
               social good.
           • Social enterprises engage in business-like activities to generate funds to cover
               expenses.
           • Social enterprises are mostly not for profit or, if for profit, retain most earnings to
               further support the public mission of the enterprise.
           • Most social enterprises are socially progressive, not just in economic matters but
               also in matters of diversity, inclusion and social justice.

     Accept any other relevant feature.

     Candidates are not expected to word their responses exactly as above.

     Award [1] for each feature identified up to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Comment on one of the three data sets in Figure 1.                                          [2]

           Set 1: 58 % of the homeless population is unsheltered, suggesting that a majority have
           limited connection to social services.

           Set 2: Over two thirds of homeless people in the area are between 25 and 60 years old
           and very few are under 18 years old or over 60 years old. The young still have the
           protective care of their parents and people over sixty have either found resolution to
           their previous homeless predicament or have died.

           Set 3: Homelessness affects virtually all races/ethnicities. Thus, the social and
           economic forces driving homelessness touch on all races and ethnicities.

           The stimulus has three different sets of data (sheltered versus unsheltered, age and
           race/ethnicity).

     Award [1] if a candidate restates a data set in words (“58 % of the population is
     unsheltered”). Award an additional [1] if the candidate provides some reasonable
     interpretation, that is, the candidate goes beyond restating the data set in words.

     A candidate might note, if they have some understanding of the demographics of San
     Francisco, that homelessness in San Francisco disproportionally affects black Americans,
     who only make up 6 %+/- of the city’s population yet 34 % of the homeless population.
     However, examiners cannot expect candidates to have any demographic or sociological
     knowledge about the United States other than the data in the exam.

     Here, it is important to see if candidates can draw some reasonable inference from the data.

(c)   Using Table 3, calculate:

      (i)     BME’s total liabilities as at the end of 2021 (show all your working).                  [2]

              Total liabilities were
              Creditors + short-term loans + Long-term debt

              $30 000 + $12 000 + $220 000 = $262 000

              Total liabilities were $262 000

Award [1] for correct working and [1] for a correct answer.

      (ii)    BME’s working capital as at the end of 2021 (show all your working).                    [2]

              Working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets.

              Current assets − current liabilities = working capital
              (Cash + stock) − (Creditors + short-term loans) = working capital
              ($22 000 + $5000) − ($30 000 + $12 000) = −$15 000

              Working capital was −$15 000

Award [1] for correct working and [1] for a correct answer.

(d)   Using the information in the stimulus, discuss the rewards and challenges Yimin
      might experience while running BME.                                                        [10]

      Yimin probably enjoys a number of rewards in running the social enterprise.
      • Most importantly, he is providing decent food to people who otherwise might not
          be able to purchase food and, even if they could, may have no place to store or
          cook it. People properly fed are healthier and have more energy, which might
          be important for them as they try to get out of their current situation of
          homelessness.
      • Yimin probably also enjoys the fact that people donate food that otherwise
          would become waste. In reducing waste, BME is making its contribution,
          however small, to reducing greenhouse gases and improving the environment.
      • Finally, Yimin probably feels greatly rewarded by the fact that BME has grown
          into a small chain of four restaurants. Social entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs,
          and seeing this organization survive and grow is probably a source of pride.

      BME, however, faces several challenges, including the usual business challenges
      as well as challenges that are unique to many social enterprises:
      • Reliance on donations of cash, food and government grants for revenue. If ever
          one of these sources of revenue fell significantly, BME, which operates on very
          thin margins, would operate at a loss.
      • Use of donated food typically right before its spoilage means that the
          restaurants have to make food-preparation and menu decisions every day.
          Whether BME has enough of the right ingredients could also mean having to
          produce different menu items over the course of the day.
      • Other than the CEO and COO, BME relies entirely on a volunteer labour force.
          Because they are volunteers, BME has less ability than most businesses to
          require people to come to work on specific days, making scheduling
          challenging.
      • The business has only four vehicles for four restaurants. If any one of the
          vehicles is under repair, a restaurant will not have a lorry, which could hinder its
          ability to procure low-cost supplies.
      • BME has very thin margins. Any major unexpected cash outflow would probably
          mean negative cash flow.

      Another challenge now facing BME is the rising number of complaints in the
      neighbourhoods where BME operates. Here, BME’s success – homeless people
      knowing that BME’s restaurants are reliable places to get a meal and thus gathering
      there – is causing a conflict with another stakeholder, the neighbourhood
      communities.

      We cannot expect candidates to have any knowledge, other than from the data in
      the exam, about homeless populations. However, a candidate might also say
      something along the following lines, which should be accepted: Homeless
      populations have higher rates of mental illness than the general population. For
      BME, this situation means that some of its customers may suffer from mental illness
      and might be more prone to unruly or difficult behaviour, which an all-volunteer staff
      has to manage.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 5.

4.   (a)   Define the term mass customization.                                                         [2]

           Mass customization is a relatively new mass manufacturing technique that has the
           flexibility of personalization of products but also has the low unit cost typically
           associated with mass production. Usually used in retail settings, mass customization
           allows a customer to choose certain features or to modify certain features of the
           product that they want.

     Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

     Award [1] for partial understanding. Award [2] if the candidate conveys understanding that
     mass customization offers both flexibility and low cost.

     (b)   Using Table 4, comment on:

           (i)    WM’s sales revenue data;                                                             [2]

                  Customers like the fact that they can now customize their purchases. Sales grew at
                  a rate of almost 19 % in 2021 compared to a sales growth rate of 1.67 % in 2020.

     Award [1] for a basic explanation and an additional [1] for a full explanation of the
     candidate’s interpretation including direct reference to the data, up to a maximum of [2].

     A basic explanation might be a response such as, “sales revenue is increasing year on
     year” or “sales revenue went up more in the second year”.

           (ii)   WM’s gross profit margin and profit margin.                                          [2]

                  WM has not been able to pass on fully the costs of mass customization to its
                  customers. Both the gross profit margin and the profit margin are lower in 2021
                  than in the previous two years.

     Award [1] for a basic explanation and an additional [1] for a full explanation of the
     candidate’s interpretation including direct reference to the data, up to a maximum of [2].

     A basic response would be something like, “The gross profit margin and the profit margin
     are lower”.

     (c)   Based on the data in Table 4 and Table 5, calculate the forecasted sales revenue for
           2022 (no working required).                                                                 [1]

           $145 000 000 × 1.2 = $174 000 000.

           Forecasted sales revenue for 2022 is $174 000 000.

     Award [1] for the correct answer.

     (d)   Based on the information in Table 5, calculate:

           (i)    the forecasted contribution per unit for 2022 (no working required);                 [1]

                  $1000 − $600 = $400.

                  The forecasted contribution is $400.

     Award [1] for the correct answer.

       (ii)   the forecasted profit margin for 2022 (show all your working).                         [2]

              Forecasted sales revenue                    $174 000 000
              Forecasted variable costs                  ($104 400 000)
              Forecasted Fixed costs                      ($ 66 120 000)
              Forecasted profit before tax                    $3 480 000

               $3 480 000
                           × 100 = 2 %
              $174 000 000

              The forecasted profit margin for 2022 is 2 %.

Award [1] if the candidate demonstrates how to calculate the profit margin but makes a
mathematical error.

Award [2] if the candidate demonstrates how to calculate the profit margin and produces the
correct answer.

If the candidate produces the correct answer but does not show workings, award [1].

Apply the own figure rule (OFR).

(e)    Using the information in the stimulus, evaluate WM’s decision to shift from mass
       production to mass customization.                                                            [10]

       WM only recently switched to mass customization. The switch has produced both
       positive and negative indicators.

       On the positive side, sales at the company have grown considerably, indicating that
       customers like the fact that they can customize their purchases. Further, mass
       customization is a general trend in the manufacture of retail products. Although WM
       may not have been a first mover in regard to mass customization in the premium
       lighting fixture market, the strong surge in sales suggests it was a fairly early adopter,
       meaning it has the opportunity to build some brand identity around customization
       before everyone is doing it.

       However, WM has not been able to pass on all of its costs to customers, as the gross
       profit margin and the profit margin have contracted considerably. WM projects that the
       profit margin will remain at 2 % in 2022. While the company is enjoying some benefit
       from mass customization, increased sales, its profit margin, at 2 %, is still well below
       the profit margin of 5 % that the company had prior to 2021.

       A challenge that WM faces with rapidly rising sales is working capital adequacy. WM is
       to issue and sell 200 000 shares of stock to raise $8 million in working capital. Probably
       the lower profit margin and the dilution that will come with issuing extra shares explain
       the fall in stock price to $40 from the $50 it was prior to the introduction of mass
       customization. Some shareholders are justifiably unhappy.

       WM probably thought that it had to issue shares rather than take on additional debt.
       First, banks are wary of making long-term loans to fund current assets. Further, WM
       already had considerable debt – the $20 million it borrowed to convert to mass
       customization and, probably, other debt (as virtually all businesses rely on leverage).

     To support the growth in sales, WM has expanded its workforce by 300 people. Prior to
     mass customization, WM averaged $101 667 in sales revenue per employee. By the
     end of 2022, WM is projected to average $116 000 in sales for each employee. Thus,
     even though the productivity per employee has increased, the prospects of diminished
     bonuses exists, as the company has lower margins. This situation could take a toll on
     employee morale.

     The big question is whether WM will start to enjoy economies of scale that will offset
     the high costs that it incurred with mass customization and which, at least initially,
     could not be passed on to customers.
