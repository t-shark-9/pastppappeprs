                                             Section A

Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Explain how one hormone may influence one human behaviour.                                       [9]

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account including reasons
     and causes of how one hormone influences a chosen human behaviour.

     Responses should make a clear link between the function of the hormone and human behaviour.

     A number of different hormones may include chosen, including: adrenaline, cortisol, melatonin,
     testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin.

     Any aspect of human behaviour (eg aggression, depression, stress, attachment) is acceptable
     as long as the response focuses on how the hormone influences the particular behaviour.

     Examples of how hormones influence human behaviour could be but are not limited to:
      the influence of cortisol on recall
      oxytocin on attachment
      testosterone on aggression
      melatonin on sleep patterns

     Responses that address the influence of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA
     and acetylcholine should not be awarded any marks. Where a neurotransmitter and hormone
     are chemically the same (eg noradrenaline) answers should make it clear that they are
     explaining the hormonal function.

     Responses should address just one hormone’s influence, and where candidates have provided
     more than one example, credit should be given only to the first response.
                                              –5–                 SPEC/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   Outline one study investigating schema processing.                                     [9]

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account or summary of
     one study investigating schema processing.

     The outline of the study could include aim, method, results of the chosen study
     to support the response on how the study investigated schema processing.

     The research studies chosen to investigate schema processing may include, but are
     not limited to:
      Loftus and Palmer (1974) on schema processing as a consequence of
        leading questions
      Anderson and Pichert’s (1978) study on the effect of schema processing on memory
        encoding and retrieval
      Wynn and Logie’s (1998) study using real-life experiences in schema processing
      Brewer and Treyen’s (1981) “office schema” study
      Bartlett’s (1932) seminal study (“War of the Ghosts”)

Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   With reference to a study investigating acculturation, outline one strength and one
     limitation
     of a research method used in the study.                                                           [9]

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of one strength and one
     limitation of a method used in the chosen study [18 marks].

     One definition of acculturation is Berry’s (2005) in that “acculturation is the dual process of
     cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between two or more
     cultural groups and their individual members".

     Candidates should support their response on the basis of a specific research study. Research
     studies may include, but are not limited to:
      Schwartz et al., (2010) “The acculturation of Sudanese adolescents”
      Ernest (2006) “Acculturaion of adolescents and young refugees”
      Rogler et al., (1991) “Acculturation and mental health issues among Hispanics”
      Pantiru and Barley (2014) “Acculturation of Romanian immigrants in the UK”

     Candidates should state the research method used in the study and outline one strength and one
     limitation of the research method.


Section A markbands

     Marks      Level descriptor

     0          The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

     1 to 3     The response is of limited relevance to or only rephrases the question.
                Knowledge and understanding is mostly inaccurate or not relevant to
                the question.
                The research supporting the response is mostly not relevant to the question and

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1             Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

2             Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas
of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
              Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

3 to 4        The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
              Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

5 to 6        The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
              Psychological terminology is used appropriately.


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such, it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research
              selected serves to repeat points already made.

3 to 4        Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly
              explained. Research selected partially develops the argument.

5 to 6        Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
              explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                –8–                 SPEC/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an enquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking on the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
 research design and methodologies
 triangulation
 assumptions and biases
 contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
 areas of uncertainty.
These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation
              and/or discussion, if present, is superficial.

3 to 4        The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation and/or
              discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

5 to 6        The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking.
              Evaluation and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.


E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1             The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
              throughout the response.

2             The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                              Section B

4.   Discuss ethical considerations linked to genetic research into human behaviour.                [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of ethical issues linked to genetics in human behaviour.

     Possible ethical considerations could be but are not limited to:
      possible misuse of genetic data
      anonymity and confidentiality
      informed consent and right to withdraw data
      ownership of genetic data

     Possible research studies linked to ethical research may include, but are not limited to:
      Bouchard (1990) “Minnesota Twin Study”
      Plomin and Petrill’s (1997) study on IQ
      Caspi et al., (2003) on genes and depression

     Areas of possible discussion could be, but are not limited to:
      how the research studies included in the response have been conducted in terms of
        ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, psychological harm, right to
        withdraw and deception
      how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied, including the possible
        abuse of findings
      whether genetic research is ever ethically neutral
      implications of the findings for individuals and groups of individuals
      genetic predisposition does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease
        or a disorder.

     Candidates may discuss a relatively small number of ethical considerations in greater
     depth or a greater number in less depth, thereby demonstrating a breadth of
     understanding. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses referring to research conducted on animals as long as they are linked to
     human behaviour are acceptable.

5.   To what extent do findings from two or more psychological studies related to schema
     theory support the understanding of memory processes?                                              [22]

     To what extent do findings from two or more psychological studies related to schema theory
     support the understanding of memory processes?

     The command term to what extent asks candidates to consider the usefulness of psychological
     studies related to schema theory in supporting the understanding of memory processes.

     Candidates may refer to a smaller number of studies in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may refer to a larger number of studies in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Psychological studies investigating schema theory include but are not limited to:
      Anderson and Pichert’s (1978) study on the effect of schema processing on memory
       encoding and retrieval
      Bartlett’s (1932) seminal study (“War of the Ghosts”)
      Loftus and Palmer (1974) on reconstructive memory
      Brewer and Treyens (1981) role of office schemas in remembering objects in a room
      Bransford and Johnson (1972) on contextual conditions for understanding and remembering.

     Candidates may address the question by explaining schema theory as well as the theory's
     underlying assumptions. In addition, it would be appropriate to link this expanation to specific
     studies that investigate how cognitive schemas may affect memory processes to finally assess
     the usefulness of the theory in relation of the findings of the studies.
                                              – 11 –               SPEC/3/PSYCH/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss how stereotypes may arise and affect human behaviour.                                   [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of how stereotypes may arise and affect human behaviour.

     A link should be made between how a stereotype may arise and affect human
     behaviour with reference to research studies and theories.

     Candidates may address the question by first explaining how stereotypes arise and
     focus on the effect of stereotypes of behaviour. Although the response needs to
     include reference to both the rise and the effect of stereotypes on behaviour, a
     balanced approach is not necessary.

     Explanations for how stereotypes may arise include but are not limited to:
      Stereotypes arise and are learned in a social and cultural setting (Princeton Trilogy)
      Stereotypes may be shared by social groups as social representations
      Stereotypes may arise as part of social categorisation (social identity theory).

     Effects may include, but are not limited to:
      stereotypes may be internalized as templates and affect individual behaviour eg in relation to
        intellectual performance (stereotype threat), Steele and Aronson’s study (1995)
      stereotypes may lead to prejudice and discrimination against individuals as demonstrated in
        studies such as Gibbins (1969), Buckhout (1974), Duncan (1976)
      stereotypes often lead to selective attention and information processing so that the stereotype is
        confirmed (confirmation bias)
      misdiagnosis in mental health due to gender and cultural bias (Zhang, 1998)

                                            Section A

Biological approach to understanding behaviour

1.   Explain how one hormone may influence one human behaviour.                                    [9]

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account including reasons
     and causes of how one hormone influences a chosen human behaviour.

     Responses should make a clear link between the function of the hormone and human behaviour.

     A number of different hormones could be chosen, including: adrenaline, cortisol, melatonin,
     testosterone, oestrogen, oxytocin.
     Any aspect of human behaviour (eg aggression, depression, stress, attachment) is acceptable
     as long as the response focuses on how the hormone influences the particular behaviour.

     Examples of how hormones influence human behaviour may include, but are not limited to:
      the influence of cortisol on recall
      oxytocin on attachment
      testosterone on aggression
      melatonin on sleep patterns.

     Responses that address the influence of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, GABA
     and acetylcholine should not be awarded any marks. Where a neurotransmitter and hormone
     are chemically the same (eg noradrenaline) answers should make it clear that they are
     explaining the hormonal function.

     Responses should address just one hormone’s influence, and where candidates have provided
     more than one example, credit should be given only to the first response.

Cognitive approach to understanding behaviour

2.   Outline one study investigating schema.                                                [9]

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account or summary of
     one study investigating schema processing.

     The outline of the study could include aim, method, results of the chosen study
     to support the response on how the study investigated schema processing.

     The research studies chosen to investigate schema processing may include, but are
     not limited to:
      Loftus and Palmer (1974) on schema processing as a consequence of
        leading questions
      Anderson and Pichert’s (1978) study on the effect of schema processing on memory
        encoding and retrieval
      Wynn and Logie’s (1998) study using real-life experiences in schema processing
      Brewer and Treyen’s (1981) “office schema” study
      Bartlett’s (1932) seminal study (“War of the Ghosts”)

Sociocultural approach to understanding behaviour

3.   With reference to a study investigating acculturation outline one strength and one limitation of
     a research method used in the study.                                                                     [9]

     The command term “outline” requires candidates to give a brief account of one strength and one
     limitation of a method used in the chosen study.

     One definition of acculturation is Berry (2005) it that "acculturation is the dual process of cultural
     and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between two or more cultural
     groups and their individual members”.

     Candidates should support their response on the basis of a specific research study.
     Research studies may include but are not limited to:
      Schwartz et al., (2010) “The acculturation of Sudanese adolescents”
      Ernest (2006) “Acculturation of adolescents and young refugees”
      Rogler et al., (1991) “Acculturation and mental health issues among Hispanics”
      Pantiru and Barley (2014) “Acculturation of Romanian immigrants in the UK”

     Candidates should state the research method method used in the study and outline one
     strength and one limitation of the research method.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1             Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

2             Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.


B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
              Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

3 to 4        The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
              Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

5 to 6        The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
              Psychological terminology is used appropriately.


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant
and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the
answer is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected
              serves to repeat points already made.

3 to 4        Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly
              explained. Research selected partially develops the argument.

5 to 6        Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thouroughly
              explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                –8–                 SPEC/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical
thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to
support that knowledge and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
 research design and methodologies
 triangulation
 assumptions and biases
 contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
 areas of uncertainty
These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation
              or discussion, if present, is superficial.

3 to 4        The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or
              discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

5 to 6        The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking.
              Evaluation and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.


E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought
underpinning the argument.

Marks         Level descriptor

0             Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

1             The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
              throughout the response.

2             The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.
                                               –9–                  SPEC/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              Section B

4.   Discuss ethical considerations linked to genetic research into human behaviour.                [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of ethical issues linked to genetics in human behaviour.

     Possible ethical considerations could be but are not limited to:
      possible misuse of genetic data
      anonymity and confidentiality
      informed consent and right to withdraw data
      ownership of genetic data

     Possible research studies linked to ethical research may include, but are not limited to:
      Bouchard (1990), “Minnesota Twin Study”
      Plomin and Petrill’s (1997) study on IQ
      Caspi et al., (2003) on genes and depression.

     Areas of possible discussion could be, but are not limited to:
      how the research studies included in the response have been conducted in terms of
        ethical issues such as informed consent, confidentiality, psychological harm, right to
        withdraw and deception
      how the findings of research have been interpreted and applied, including the possible
        abuse of findings
      whether genetic research is ever ethically neutral
      implications of the findings for individuals and groups of individuals
      genetic predisposition does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop a disease
        or a disorder

     Candidates may discuss a relatively small number of ethical considerations in greater
     depth or a greater number in less depth, thereby demonstrating a breadth of
     understanding. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses referring to research conducted on animals as long as they are linked to
     human behaviour are acceptable.
                                              – 10 –               SPEC/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Discuss how the use of digital technology affects one cognitive process.                         [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review of
     how the use of digital technology affects one cognitive process.

     A link should be made between how the use of digital technology may affect a specific cognitive
     process with reference to research studies and theories.

     Candidates may address the question by giving examples of the controversy on the use of
     digital technology, for example by referring to “the myth of multitasking”, and its possible
     influence on cognitive processes in general as long as the main focus is on how the use of
     digital technology affects one cognitive process.

     Research studies relevant to answering this question could be, but are not limited to:
      Sparrow, Liu and Wegner (2011) “Google effects on memory: Cognitive consequences of
       having information at our fingertips”
      Kaspersky Lab's international survey (2015) indicating a possible link between having data
       available at the click of a button and a failure to commit that data to memory. Kaspersky lab
       has termed this phenomenon Digital Amnesia, ie the experience of forgetting information that
       you trust a digital device to store and remember for you.
      Wood et al., (2011) study on the impact of four digitally-based multi-tasking activities on
       memory and learning compared to control groups using a sample of college students
      Roediger and Karpicke (2006) on the role of testing to improve learning and memory as part
       of the argument demonstrating that rehearsal and revision strengthen a memory

     If responses discuss more than one cognitive process in relation to the use of digital technology,
     credit should be given only to the first cognitive process.
                                              – 11 –               SPEC/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss how stereotypes may arise and affect human behaviour.                                   [22]

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of how stereotypes may arise and affect human behaviour.

     A link should be made between how a stereotype may arise and affect human
     behaviour with reference to research studies and theories.

     Candidates may address the question by first explaining how stereotypes arise and
     focus on the effect of stereotypes on behaviour. Although the response needs to
     include reference to both the rise and the effect of stereotypes on behaviour, a
     balanced approach is not necessary.

     Explanations for how stereotypes may arise include, but are not limited to:
      stereotypes arise and are learned in a social and cultural setting (Princeton Trilogy)
      stereotypes may be shared by social groups as social representations
      stereotypes may arise as part of social categorization (social identity theory)

     Effects may include, but are not limited to:
      stereotypes may be internalized as templates and affect individual behaviour eg in relation to
        intellectual performance (stereotype threat), Steele and Aronson’s study (1995)
      stereotypes may lead to prejudice and discrimination against individuals as demonstrated in
        studies such as Gibbins (1969), Buckhout (1974), Duncan (1976)
      stereotypes often lead to selective attention and information processing so that the stereotype is
        confirmed (confirmation bias)
      misdiagnosis in mental health due to gender and cultural bias (Zhang, 1998)

Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss the role of culture in diagnosis.

     Refer to the Paper 2 Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate theories and/or studies.

     Diagnosis refers to the identification of the nature of a disorder by examination of the
     symptoms. Diagnosis may be affected by one of several cultural considerations.

     Discussions may include the following factors related to culture and diagnosis, but are not
     limited to:
     • prevalence rates for various disorders within and between cultures
     • under-detection of symptoms due to culture blindness and culture bias
     • different classification systems (DSM, ICD, CCMD) used in different cultures
     • somatic vs affective displays of disorders – different manifestation of symptoms in
        different cultures
     • cultural knowledge and sensitivity of the clinician
     • emic and etic approaches in diagnosing disorders
     • the extent to which cultural factors contribute to an understanding of the diagnostic
        process
     • culture bound syndromes.

     Studies referencing the role of culture may include, but are not limited to:
     • Bhugra et al (1997) study on how a group of Punjabi women in London described
        their symptoms
     • Kirmeyer and Young (1998) on culture and somatization
     • Kleinman (1984) on displays of symptoms of depression in China and the West.

     Candidates may discuss one cultural factor in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge, or a
     greater number of cultural factors in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches
     are equally acceptable.

     Also, candidates may discuss the role of culture in diagnosis of one specific disorder or choose to
     discuss the role of culture in general.

2.   Discuss one or more etiologies of one disorder.

     Refer to the Psychology Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate theories and/or studies.

     Candidates should address one disorder only from the categories presented in the psychology
     guide and discuss the etiology or etiologies to that disorder throughout the response.
     Etiology refers to the cause(s) or origins of one disorder.

     Although etiologies in principle are useful in terms of understanding the possible cause of a
     disorder, it is not as easy to establish etiology of a psychological as a somatic disorder. This is
     partly because participants in studies may not all have the same type or severity of the disorder –
     or they may suffer from more than one disorder at the same time. This creates a problem with
     construct validity in the studies – the variables being studied have not been carefully and
     consistently defined.

     Examples of how candidates may show evidence of discussion could include, but are not limited to:
     • strengths and limitations of explanations offered for the disorder
     • a comparison between an etiology and an alternative one
     • questioning cause and effect
     • prevalence rates of the disorder according to the selected etiology or etiologies
     • strengths and limitations of research methods used in studying the prevalence of the
       chosen disorder
     • a discussion of the possible interaction between biological, cognitive and
       sociocultural factors and the issue of multi-causality with reference to specific
       theories and studies
     • address the issue of universality versus cultural differences in explanations of the disorder
     • applicability: does the explanation help psychologists understand the disorder as it
       appears in everyday life and does it help psychologists to develop effective treatments.

     If more than one etiology is evaluated, these could come from the same approach (for example,
     two from the biological approach) or from different approaches.

     If a candidate discusses etiologies of more than one disorder, credit should be given only to the
     first disorder.
                                                  –8–               SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Discuss the use of one or more biological treatment(s) for one psychological disorder.

     Refer to the Psychology Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate theories and/or studies.

     Biological approaches to treatment could include, but are not limited to:
     • drug therapy
     • electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
     • psychosurgery
     • brain stimulation.

     Responses should provide an accurate and well-organized description of one or more examples of
     a biological approach (biomedical) to treatment of the chosen disorder.

     Examples of how candidates may show evidence of discussion could include, but are not limited to:
     • the effectiveness of the chosen treatment(s)
     • the assumptions about etiology upon which the biological approach to treatment is
       based with regard to the chosen disorder
     • culture, gender, ethical, or practical considerations related to the use of biological
       treatment of one disorder.

     Responses should be focused on biomedical approaches to treatment of one specific disorder in
     order to demonstrate detailed knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. However the
     response may also refer to alternative approaches to treatment in order to demonstrate some
     relevant differences between approaches to treatment and highlight specific aspects of the
     biological approach to treatment which are not present or different in other approaches. Also, it is
     acceptable to make reference to the potential benefit of using an eclectic approach that combines
     a biomedical approach to treatment of one disorder with a treatment that is not biomedical.

     If a candidate discusses the use of biomedical approaches to treatment for more than one disorder,
     credit should be given only to the part of the response relevant to the first disorder discussed.

Developmental psychology

4.   Discuss the influence of poverty/socioeconomic status on cognitive development.

     Refer to the Psychology Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate theories and/or studies.

     Candidates may address the influence of poverty/socioeconomic status by referring to specific
     social and environmental variables known to affect cognitive development such as living in polluted
     areas, nutrition and quality of parenting.

     Research studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Farah et al (2008) longitudinal study on the correlation between environmental
       stimulation and parental nurturance on cognitive development
     • Bhoomika et al (2008) research on the effect of malnutrition on cognitive
       performance in Indian children
     • Wertheimer (2003) research on the correlation between academic achievement and
       living in poor families
     • Schoon (2002) longitudinal study investigating the long-term effect of poverty on
       academic achievement and attainment in adult life.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological and cultural consideration, eg difficulties establishing cause-effect
        relationships between variables
     • the extent to which detrimental effects of poverty on cognitive development
        are reversible
     • how protective factors may reduce the impact of poverty or socioeconomic status
     • biological, cognitive, or other sociocultural factors in relation to the effects of
        poverty/socioeconomic status on cognitive development.

     Candidates may discuss one or a small number of potential effects of poverty/socioeconomic
     status in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge or may discuss a larger number of potential
     effects of poverty/socioeconomic status in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                – 10 –            SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Discuss the role of attachment on development.

     Refer to the Paper 2 Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
     presented clearly and supported by appropriate theories or studies.

     Responses might discuss the role of attachment on the developing child and/or the role of
     childhood attachment patterns on relationships, for example friendships or romantic relationships.
     Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses might focus on attachment theory and related research investigating the possibility of
     continuity between attachment styles in childhood and later development, examining the evidence.

     Relevant theories and studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Bowlby (1951) theory of attachment
     • Ainsworth (1970) research paradigm “the strange situation”
     • Hazan and Shaver (1987) on continuity of attachment styles into adult romantic
       love relationships
     • Hammond and Fletcher (1991) on attachment styles and relationship satisfaction in
       close relationships.

     Responses referring to research with animals, such as Harlow’s experiments with rhesus
     monkeys, are relevant but must be linked to attachment in human children and its role on
     later development.
                                                 – 11 –             SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   To what extent do biological factors influence cognitive development?

     Refer to the Psychology Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of
     biological factors influencing cognitive development. Conclusions should be presented clearly and
     supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

     Candidates may discuss, but such discussion is not limited to:
     • brain development and neuroplasticity
     • synaptic growth and brain chemistry
     • brain changes during childhood and adolescence.

     Relevant theories or studies may include but are not limited to:
     • Chugani (1999) study with PET scans investigating glucose metabolism in newborn
       human babies to see when brain areas mature
     • Chugani et al (2001) study on institutionalized Romanian children indicating
       correlation between deficits in cognitive task dependent on the prefrontal cortex
     • Goldman-Rakic (1987) animal study on development of cortical circuitry and
       cognitive function
     • Giedd (2004) longitudinal study using MRI scans investigating brain maturation in
       healthy children.

     Candidates could choose to provide a general response to which biological factors
     influence cognitive development or they could provide a response discussing the extent to
     which biological factors influence one specific element of cognitive development.

     Candidates may examine one biological factor in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may examine a number of biological factors in order to demonstrate
     breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address cognitive and/or sociocultural factors
     in order to respond to the command term “to what extent”.

     Responses referring to research with animals are relevant but must be linked to the effect
     of a biological factor on human children and its relation to cognitive development.

Health psychology

7.   Discuss the influence of health beliefs on health-related behaviour.

     Refer to the Paper 2 Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate theories and studies.

     Candidates may examine the influence of health beliefs in relation to specific health beliefs (for
     example stress, addiction, obesity, chronic pain or sexual health) or health beliefs in general. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.

     Candidates may examine the positive influences of health beliefs (for example, optimistic
     attributional style) as well as negative factors (for example, pessimistic attributional style).

     Theories and models related to health beliefs may include, but are not limited to:
     • Attributional/explanatory style (Kamen and Seligman, 1987)
     • Optimism bias/unrealistic optimism (Weinstein, 1987)
     • False hope syndrome (Polivy, 2001)
     • The health belief model (Becker et al., 1977)
     • Self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura).

     Studies related to health beliefs and health related behaviour may include, but are not limited to:
     • Weinberger et al (1981) on health beliefs and smoking behaviour
     • Wang and Coups (2010) survey investigating causal beliefs about obesity and
        associated health behaviours

8.   With the use of suitable examples, discuss prevalence rates of one or more health problems and
     associated health risks.

     Refer to the Paper 2 Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Conclusions should be presented clearly
     and supported by appropriate theories and studies related to prevalence rates of health problems
     and associated health risks.

     The chosen health problem(s) should be taken from the guide, ie stress, addiction, obesity, chronic
     pain and sexual health.

     Approaches to how candidates could discuss prevalence rates of the chosen health problem(s)
     may include, but are not limited to:
     • lifestyle and health beliefs
     • sociocultural context
     • social and cultural norms
     • availability of health institutions
     • socioeconomic status
     • gender and age differences.

     Candidates may discuss prevalence rates of one health problem in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of health problems in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Examples of studies investigating prevalence of specific health problems could be but are not
     limited to:
     • Gang et al (2012) prevalence and correlates of tobacco smoking, awareness of
        hazards, and quitting behaviour in India
     • Ogden et al (2010) survey on the correlation between obesity and socioeconomic
        status in adults
     • Barbeau et al (2004) investigation of relationship between race/ethnicity, gender and
        socioeconomic status on smoking

9.   Discuss the effectiveness of one or more health promotion programmes.

     Refer to the Psychology Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
     includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses relevant for the effectiveness of one or more
     health promotion programme. Conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate theories or studies.

     There is no explicit reference to a specific area of health promotion within health psychology in the
     question so candidates may choose any relevant area studied within health psychology.

     It is appropriate within this question for candidates to address models and theories of health
     promotion such as the health belief model, stages of change model, theory of reasoned action,
     self-efficacy beliefs etc, as a part of their discussion of a health promotion programme.

     Relevant health promotion strategies may include, but are not limited to:
     • The Victoria (Australia) campaign, “Go for your life” promoting healthy eating and
       exercise in schools (2004)
     • The Florida (US) campaign, “TRUTH” an anti-smoking campaign arranged by and
       aimed at adolescents (1998–1999)
     • The Canadian community-based peer intervention programme to prevent pregnant
       mothers from drinking alcohol (Carr, 1994)
     • Social Cognitive Theory (for example, the Sabido method to encourage safe
       sex practices)
     • Project SMART (US), promoting positive health decisions in middle school-aged children.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • cultural and ethical considerations in programme implementation
     • conditions under which the programme may be employed and may be successful
     • empirical evidence of programme success or failure
     • methodological concerns in measuring outcomes of the programme.

     Candidates may evaluate one health promotion programme in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge, or may evaluate the effectiveness of more than one health promotion programme
     in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   To what extent do sociocultural factors explain why relationships change or end?

      Refer to the Psychology Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contributions and merits of
      sociocultural factors in explaining why relationships change or end. Conclusions should be
      presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include (but are not limited to) these sociocultural factors explaining why
      relationships change or end:
      • age difference between partners
      • parenting issues
      • financial issues
      • socioeconomic and educational status
      • increase in the level of general dissatisfaction and frustration with the relationship
      • cultural norms.

      Theories explaining why relationships change or end could include, but are not limited to:
      • social exchange theory
      • equity theory
      • patterns of accommodation

      Studies could include, but are not limited to:
      • Flora and Seagrin (2003), on the role of perception of the relationship
      • Duck et al (1988), on the role of age differences in couples
      • Duck (1992), on the role of socioeconomic differences in couples
      • Matsumoto (2004), on the reason for US divorce rates
      • Levince (1995), on the correlation of the disappearance of love and the dissolution
         of marriage.

      Candidates may discuss a smaller number of factors in order to demonstrate depth of knowledge,
      or may discuss a larger number of theories and/or studies in order to demonstrate breadth of
      knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

      It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address cognitive and/or biological factors in order to
      respond to the command term “to what extent”.

11.   Discuss one or more studies related to prejudice and/or discrimination.

      Refer to the Paper 2 Marking Rubric when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses relevant for the study or studies related to
      prejudice and or discrimination.

      Candidates may discuss studies that attempt to explain prejudice, discrimination, or both. Also,
      candidates may discuss studies focusing on:
      • the origins of prejudice and/or discrimination
      • development of prejudice and/or discrimination
      • the effects of prejudice and/or discrimination
      • assessing the effectiveness of efforts to reduce prejudice and/or discrimination.

      Candidates may discuss studies from the biological, cognitive, or sociocultural levels of analysis, or
      studies that look at a combination of the three.

      Relevant studies include, but are not limited to:

The stimulus material below is based on a study on the influences on young people’s use of drugs.

                The aim of this study was to investigate processes involved in drug-related decision-making
                in an adolescent sample. According to the researchers, the identification of important factors
                in decisions to use drugs could potentially help to develop and inform new approaches to
                prevention and education.

      5         A purposive sample was recruited through advertising in youth clubs, nightclubs, shelters and
                schools. The sample was multi-ethnic and consisted of 30 participants (age range 16 to 21)
                including both males and females. Most of the participants lived with their parents, some were
                homeless and some lived with friends.

                Before the semi-structured interview, the participants signed an informed consent where they
     10         also gave consent to videotape the interviews for later transcription and inductive content
                analysis of the qualitative data. They were also assured anonymity. The interview guide
                prepared by the researchers included topics such as drug use of friends, personal drug use
                experience, and reasons for using as well as not using drugs.

                The results showed that reasons for using drugs ranged from the desire to relax and decrease
     15         inhibition to increase energy, relieve boredom and depressive thoughts, and increase motivation
                to get things done. Some participants reported that media coverage of specific drugs influenced
                their decision of whether or not to use drugs. For example, news stories about ecstasy-related
                deaths had made them decide that the benefits of using that drug were not worth the risk of
                negative effects. The data also suggested that the decision to use drugs was rather through
     20         personal choice than social pressure.

                The researchers concluded that prevention strategies should take into account that
                decision-making in drug use is complex and therefore multiple influences should be addressed
                in the design of future prevention programmes. They also recommend that further research
                is needed to decide on the relative importance of the different factors that influence different
     25         people’s choice of drugs.

1.   (a)   Identify the research method used and outline two characteristics of the method.    [3]

            semi-structured interviews

           Answers related to characteristics of the method may include two of the following
           characteristics: ([1] per relevant point. Maximum of [2])

            Interview guide with topics to explore: specific topics or themes were decided
             before the interview and noted in the interview guide so that the researcher is
             certain that these will be dealt with.
            Open-ended and closed questions: open ended questions allow the
             respondent to elaborate, for example, on reasons for taking drugs that may
             come up during the interview. Closed questions invite brief and precise
             answers that must be dealt with in the study. There is no possibility
             of elaboration.
            Informal and conversational in nature: the face-to-face situation and the open-
             ended questions could resemble a normal conversation. Semi-structured
             interviews facilitate a rapport between the interviewer and the respondent,
             useful in this study with a socially sensitive topic on how adolescents made
             decisions about taking drugs.


     (b)   Describe the sampling method used in the study.                                     [3]

            purposive sampling [1]

           Description of the sampling method may include two of the following
           characteristics: ([1] per relevant point. Maximum of [2])
            Participants are chosen because they possess characteristics salient to the
             research study. In the study the characteristic needed was some experience
             with taking drugs.
            Recruited through advertising, places where participants with the selected
             criteria can be found (for example, in schools or dance halls in the study).
            May include snowballing.


     (c)   Suggest an alternative or additional research method giving one reason for your
           choice.                                                                             [3]

           [1] for naming an additional/alternative method
           [2] for reason with rationale

            Focus group interviews: A focus group interview with 6–7 people could be
             used as an alternative method to collect data before a further exploration of
             the topic, for example with semi-structured interviews.
             ‒ a group of people with the relevant characteristics
             ‒ the facilitator interacts with the participants
            A quantitative survey:
             ‒ questions designed to elicit the required data
             ‒ can be quantified to make comparisons
             ‒ larger samples size.

           Any other suitable method stated with reasons.
                                                  –5–               SPEC/3/PSYCH/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Describe the ethical considerations in reporting the results and explain additional
     ethical considerations that could be taken into account when applying the findings of
     the study.                                                                                 [6]

     Ethical considerations when reporting the findings:
      Researchers should inform participants about the findings of the study and how they intend to
        use the results. They should explicitly state that they are planning to use the results of the
        study to design prevention programs. For example, adolescents have revealed that they use
        drugs like ecstasy, which can have fatal consequences. Knowing this might prevent them from
        taking the drug and would be information essential to designing future programs.
      Parental consent is not mentioned in the stimulus material. Since some of the participants are
        minors it would be ethically correct to include parental consent if the results of the study are to
        be applied in the design of future prevention programmes. The researchers should request
        permission from an ethical committee before the study begins. The ethical committee should
        also give permission to apply the results.
      Anonymity should be guaranteed especially given the sensitive nature of the subject matter.
     • It is important that the researchers do not exploit or harm the participants, especially those who
        may be vulnerable like the homeless adolescents in the sample. Therefore, it could be an
        important ethical consideration before applying the results to provide some support to the most
        vulnerable participants. Researchers should be conscious about legal issues surrounding the
        use minors or vulnerable people in this type of research. Any reasonable alternative point/s
        with explanation.
      Participants should be debriefed. This is especially important given the sensitive nature of the
        questioning and subject matter.
      The study needs to be cleared by an ethic committee prior to ensure all appropriate measures
        are put in place before the start of the investigation.

     Any other relevant point.

     [1 mark] per relevant point made with a maximum of [3 marks].

     Ethical considerations that could be taken into account when applying the findings of the study: ([1]
     per relevant point, max [2] marks).

      Consideration of the scope and extent of the generalisability of the study to other contexts is
       important as these findings could be limited to a specific context resulting in inappropriate
       information in a generalised health campaign or prevention strategy.
      Awareness of researchers’ own biases and expectations (reflexivity) which could skew the
       findings and influence the relevance of the findings for health campaigns.
      Replication of the findings by an independent researcher to test the reliability. If the results
       cannot be replicated the use of the findings in a health campaign could be at best pointless and
       at worst harmful.

     Any other relevant point.
     [1 mark] per relevant point made with a maximum of [3 marks].

3.   Discuss the possibility of generalizing the findings of the study.                               [9]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced
     review of the possibility of generalizing the findings of the study in the stimulus
     material. Conclusions should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     knowledge of generalization in qualitative research as the study in the stimulus material
     is qualitative.

     The aim of the study was to find factors that influenced decision making in relation to
     drug use and the inductive content analysis revealed a number of factors such as
     “desire to relax”, “decrease inhibition”, “increase energy” or “increase motivation and
     get things done”.

     Candidates could argue that generalization in this study could be a possibility
     depending on the richness of the collected data but that generalization overall could
     only happen to some extent. Possible parts of an argument could include but are not
     limited to:
      Generalization in qualitative research is not based on statistical representation as in
        quantitative research. The study in the stimulus question is based on a rather small
        purposive sample, that is the participants are selected based on the salient
        characteristics of having experience with drug use. If the data is sufficiently rich and
        perhaps corroborated by other similar studies it may be possible to generalize the
        findings to similar populations. However, as the participants came from very
        different backgrounds and the only thing they had in common was that they used
        drugs (the selection criteria) it is perhaps not a possibility after all.
      If theoretical concepts are developed based on the study these could be used to
        develop further theory. It seems that this could be a possibility in this study because
        the findings that “social pressure” is not the main factor in the decision to use drugs
        may be contrary to traditional theory related to drug use.
      The inductive content analysis revealed a number of factors such as “desire to
        relax”, “decrease inhibition”, “increase energy” or “increase motivation and get things
        done”. The findings also indicated that media messages played a role and that drug
        use was decided rather by personal choice than social pressure. The researchers
        argue that future research should take into account the relative importance of each
        factor found in this study using a quantitative approach to research. This indicates
        that the various factors identified in this study could be transferred to another study
        and form the basis of a quantitative study, for example a survey.

     Candidates may, in their discussion of generalization of findings from this qualitative
     research, briefly refer to statistical generalization (quantitative research) as part of their
     argument. This should be given credit as long as the main focus is on generalization from
     this qualitative research study.

     Marks should be awarded according to the descriptors in the mark bands. Each level of the
     mark band corresponds to a range of marks to differentiate candidates' performance.
     A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which particular mark to use from the possible range
     for each level descriptor.
