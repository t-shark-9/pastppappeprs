Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Outline two principles that define the cognitive level of analysis.                          [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     In a broad sense these principles suggest the nature of basic psychological processes and
     they provide information that is important to consider critically the viewpoint of the
     level of analysis within psychology as a whole. There are a number of principles that
     are common to theorists from the cognitive level of analysis. Examples include the
     principle proposing that unobservable mental processes can explain observable
     behaviour; that models of psychological functions can be scientifically studied; or that
     cognitive processes actively organize and manipulate information. All of these would
     be appropriate choices.

     Another relevant principle for the cognitive level of analysis is the principle that
     cognitive processes are influenced by social and cultural factors. According to Bartlett,
     memories are organized within the historical and cultural frameworks (which Bartlett
     called “schemata”) of the individual, and the process of remembering involves the
     retrieval of information which has been unknowingly altered in order that it is
     compatible with pre-existing knowledge. Participants omitted information they
     regarded as irrelevant, changed the emphasis to points they considered to be significant,
     and rationalized the parts that did not make sense in order to make the story more
     comprehensible.

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of
              marginal relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used
              in the response.

4 to 6        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
              question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in the
              response.

7 to 9        The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding
              relevant to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in
              support of the response.

4.   To what extent does genetic inheritance influence behaviour?              Use relevant
     research studies in your response.                                                        [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires the candidate to consider the merits or
     otherwise of an argument regarding the influence of genetics on behaviour. The aim of
     the essay is to produce an informed conclusion, whereby opinions and judgments are
     presented clearly and supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.
     Candidates may include issues regarding the methods used to investigate genetic
     influences, i.e. family resemblance correlations, molecular genetics, etc. The debate
     regarding how genes specifically express their influence on behaviour is also likely to
     be raised, including the impact of the environment on the genes themselves and/or the
     fact that some genes have a more direct effect than others, such as Huntingdon’s
     disease.

     Responses omitting relevant research studies will not attract marks.
                                                  –7–             SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Discuss the use of one research method (e.g. experiments, case studies) in the
     cognitive level of analysis. Use relevant research studies in your response.   [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The methods of investigation undertaken by cognitive psychologists range from
     laboratory experiments to interviews in everyday situations. They have in common the
     aim of obtaining relevant information on mental processes used to acquire, store,
     retrieve and apply knowledge about the world.

     The two examples provided in the question should hopefully prevent candidates from
     giving material that is not relevant to research methods. The experimental method
     should be well known but it needs to be presented as an explicit method for the
     cognitive level of analysis. Examples of research studies should be used to illustrate
     how the experimental method relates to the cognitive level of analysis. Experiments
     may be exemplified by the work of Bartlett, Bandura or Elizabeth Loftus. Discussion of
     the experimental method could be provided especially in terms of validity and
     reliability, sample choice and generalizability of findings, etc. Cultural, ethical and
     gender evaluation may provide useful arguments, as in, for example, gender variation in
     rates of susceptibility to biased questioning in eye-witness testimonies: Stern’s study in
     1904 provided evidence that women’s eyewitness testimony was less accurate and less
     resistant to the influence of misleading information than men’s; however, Stern’s two
     groups were not comparable in age. Other studies by Bringmann and colleagues in
     1986 did not replicate Stern’s findings using comparable age groups.

     The case study method is often used in the cognitive level of analysis as it may provide
     new and rich information about mediating processes which might otherwise not be
     discovered. For example, the case of S.B., a blind man given sight in adulthood, gave
     researchers a particularly detailed insight into the processes and experiences of
     perception, highlighting aspects of the experience which had not previously been
     suspected.

     Other examples of case studies in the cognitive level of analysis are the case of Clive
     Wearing, or Luria’s research on the exceptional memory of S.V.

     Award high marks for clear discussion of the chosen examples of an appropriate
     research method. The presentation should include an evaluation that illustrates a
     balance of advantageous and disadvantageous aspects of the method employed.
     Limited responses may try to bring general knowledge of research methods to this
     question without much understanding of their specific use for the cognitive level of
     analysis.

     When presenting research studies candidates should focus more on information that is
     important to methodology, rather than just memorizing the details of what happened
     during the procedure or providing an explanation of the findings. The question requires
     candidates to be selective about the knowledge they offer. The abilities to filter content
     and provide focused responses are characteristic of responses earning highest marks.
                                                 –8–             SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Evaluate the role that one cultural dimension (e.g. individualism/collectivism,
     power distance) may have on behaviour.                                          [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Cultural dimensions are descriptive continuums that help to describe some of the more
     commonly shared characteristics of individuals within a particular culture. The guide
     includes several that are based on the work of Geert Hofstede, including:
     individualism/collectivism, masculinity/femininity, and power distance. There are also
     non-Western dimensions such as Confucian Dynamism that have extended or modified
     this original work. Responses may clearly define each dimension so as to make
     intelligible the characteristics of each that make them different.

     It should be noted that each of these dimensions is continuous with varying levels of
     each of the poles spread between. Responses earning higher marks should make clear
     that these are not each sets of polar opposites with no intermediary steps. Additionally,
     candidates should understand that there would be normal variation within a culture as to
     the extent to which and the manifestation of each dimension. Discussion of normal
     variance and distribution should be apparent in the higher scoring responses.

Abnormal psychology

1.   “There are controversies surrounding the concept of abnormality.”

     With reference to this statement, discuss the concepts of normality and abnormality.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The use of different concepts of abnormality tends to mirror dominant cultural standards, social
     values and political views as well as scientific knowledge. Popular conceptions of normality and
     abnormality may include the following: the mental health criterion, abnormality as personal
     distress, the statistical criterion, abnormality as mental illness, etc. Also, the psychoanalytic,
     learning, cognitive and/or humanistic notion of the concept of abnormality may be discussed.
     Currently there is a tendency towards integration of different explanations offered by different
     levels of analysis in order to provide a satisfactory explanation of abnormality.
     Viewed conceptually, abnormality involves three aspects: diagnosis, understanding the cause of the
     problem and therapy to treat the problem. These three elements are closely intertwined in theory
     and practice, making it hard to assess one element independently of the others. These different
     approaches have their own interpretation of the origins of abnormality and currently the primary
     way of evaluating these various explanations is by examining the efficacy of the therapies proposed
     by these explanations.

     Candidates may refer to cross-cultural issues, gender biases and research findings when examining
     how to define abnormality – e.g. research on cross-cultural differences in concepts of abnormality,
     labeling and marginalization as well as gender bias in certain psychological disorders.
                                                  –4–              SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



2.   Describe the symptoms and prevalence of one psychological disorder.

     Discuss cultural and/or gender variations in the prevalence of one psychological disorder.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     A clear account of both symptoms and the prevalence for one psychological disorder should be
     provided. Since the option is focusing on three groups of disorders (anxiety, affective disorders,
     eating disorders) candidates should choose one psychological disorder from any of these groups.

     Diagnosis is often based on deviation from social norms (cultural standards of acceptable
     behaviour). For example, among some cultural groups, perceiving visions or voices of religious
     figures might be part of normal religious experience on some occasions and aberrant social
     functioning on other occasions. The interaction between clinician and patient is rife with
     possibilities for miscommunication and misunderstanding when they are from different cultures.
     Responses may refer to a range of types of psychological disorders which may be unique to a
     particular culture. For example, the Chinese Classificatory system offers “neurasthenia” – a
     psychological disorder that is not present in DSM or ICD. On the other hand, depression and
     anxiety disorders are not extensively diagnosed there. In past research, there has been an effort to
     fit culture-bound syndromes into variants of DSM diagnoses. Rather than assume that DSM
     diagnostic entities or culture-bound syndromes are the basic patterns of illness, current investigators
     in cultural psychiatry are interested in examining how the social, cultural, and biological contexts
     interact to shape illnesses and reactions to them.

     Gender differences occur particularly in the rates of common mental disorders – depression, anxiety
     and somatic complaints. Unipolar depression, predicted to be the second leading cause of global
     disability burden by 2020, is twice as common in women. Also, depression, anxiety, somatic
     symptoms and high rates of comorbidity are significantly related to interconnected and co-occurrent
     risk factors such as gender based roles, stressors and negative life experiences and events. Gender
     bias occurs in the treatment of psychological disorders. Doctors are more likely to diagnose
     depression in women compared with men.
     Gender differences also exist in patterns of help-seeking for psychological disorder.

3.   Discuss how

          biological, or
          cognitive, or
          socio-cultural

     factors influence psychological disorders.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Candidates can mention the following biological factors in abnormality: role of genes, biochemistry
     of the nervous system, injury or brain damage. Biological explanations of abnormality share certain
     assumptions: abnormal behavior results from an underlying physical condition, such as damage to
     the brain or malfunction of neural processes. This explanation implies that treatment should be
     aimed at controlling the underlying disease by changing the individual’s biochemistry or removing
     toxic substances. Also, the strongest support for the relevance of biological factors comes from
     psychopharmacology. Currently a large and growing range of drugs have been developed to deal
     with many forms of psychological disorders. Although these drugs are beneficial, it is not clear if
     they address the root of such disorders or simply mask the symptoms.

     Some cognitive factors in abnormality are symbolic mediation of conditioning (e.g. observational
     learning) and the influence of faulty cognitions. In certain disorders these cognitive factors are
     believed to play a direct causal role in dysfunctional behaviour. For example irrational beliefs
     about personal vulnerability are believed to put people at risk of anxiety. In other disorders
     cognitive factors may not be the cause of the disorder, but are themselves the results of neurological
     factors.

     Socio-cultural factors in abnormality that could be presented are: effects of urban/rural dwelling,
     gender and minority status on state of mind. Social factors may partially cause or trigger a
     predisposition to a psychological disorder (e.g. depression is linked to poor family relationships).
     Also, the actual process of diagnosis is rooted in social processes.

     No single approach can explain the etiology of all psychological disorders, nor can it offer a
     complete therapy. For this reason, there is growing support for the biopsychosocial approach,
     which, as the name implies, takes account of biological, psychological, and social factors in the
     etiology and treatment of psychological disorders.
                                                  –6–             SPEC/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Developmental psychology

4.   Discuss potential effects of deprivation or trauma in childhood on later development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The focus here may be on the consequences of deprivation of contacts and affection during the
     critical period of attachment in reference to research such as Robertson and Bowlby’s study (1952)
     on short-term effects or Cockett and Tripp’s study (1994) on long-term attachment deprivation
     effects. However, it would also be appropriate to focus on the consequences of trauma such as
     childhood physical, emotional or sexual abuse including prolonged or extreme neglect or
     interactions that are experienced as psychological “attacks”.

     Whichever approach is selected, answers should describe and evaluate the effects of such
     experiences on child development and should refer to appropriate psychological research. For
     instance, according to Bowlby (1951), maternal deprivation may cause physical, mental and
     emotional growth retardation. However, studies such as Rutter’s (1981) showed that the
     consequences of deprivation vary with the severity and duration of the depriving experience, the
     age of the child at which the deprivation occurs and the adequacy of restitutive measures. The
     impact of traumas is also uneven, depending on children’s history, their environment, risk factors
     and protective factors. For instance, adaptation to a trauma may cause a loss of part of child
     personality, emotional freezing, psychogenic amnesia, sleeping and eating disorders. However,
     how severe these symptoms are depends on the person, the type of trauma involved and the
     emotional support the child receives from others. According to Tedeschi and Calhoun (2004)
     trauma experiences may even have positive aspects, leading to growth emerging from the struggle
     with trauma. Responses referring to resilience in the face of trauma or deprivation are also relevant.

     Higher band answers should offer a thorough and clear description of potential effects of
     deprivation or trauma on child development with reference to appropriate research and should
     present an evaluative judgment on this issue.

     Middle band answers may present a limited portrait of the effects of deprivation or trauma with
     occasional reference to appropriate research or may offer an accurate and clear description of these
     effects without reference to appropriate psychological research. The evaluation may be appropriate
     but limited or only implicitly linked to the question.

     Lower band answers may present a minimal description of the effects of deprivation or trauma on
     child development with little or no reference to psychological research. There may be an attempt to
     present an evaluation that is of marginal relevance.

5.   Define resilience.

     Describe and evaluate one strategy to build resilience.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Answers should provide a clear definition of “resilience”, for example: resilience is the ability to
     overcome adversity. There are many definitions of resilience: clear and relevant definitions should
     be accepted. Many studies, such as Cyrulnik’s (1999) show that an important factor in resilience is
     having caring and supportive relationships within the family. Support from people outside the
     family can also be decisive in building resilience. In addition, environmental factors such as good
     nutrition and education can play an important role. Several additional factors are also associated
     with resilience such as the capacity to make realistic plans and take steps to carry them out, or skills
     in communication and problem solving.

     All of these are factors that people can develop in themselves and several strategies for building
     resilience may be discussed. For instance, learning to think positively and in perspective means
     children cannot only cope with problems and setbacks, but they also have opportunities to learn
     how to build strengths that protect and promote well-being. Some social programs for youth have
     shown to promote resilience such as Head Start or the Big Brothers Big Sisters Programme.
     Programmes dealing with parental education and food programmes are also relevant to building
     resilience in developed and developing countries. Whichever strategy is described, an evaluation of
     it should be offered. Relevant evaluation may highlight that resilience is a complex concept and
     that it is important to put forward multiple ways of promoting it. Developing resilience is a
     personal journey and people do not all react the same to traumatic and stressful life events. A
     child’s ability to build resilience is also dependent on their age and stage of development: babies
     and toddlers have limited physical and emotional competence compared with eight year olds. Some
     variation may reflect cultural differences: a person’s culture might have an impact on how he or she
     communicates feelings and deals with adversity. Furthermore, being resilient does not guarantee
     that young people will always have happy and productive lives.

6.   Outline physical changes in adolescence.

     Discuss how such physical changes during adolescence relate to development of identity.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Answers should give a clear outline of the physical changes in adolescence such as rapid growth in
     height and weight, changes in body proportions and form and attainment of sexual maturity. The
     main points may be summarized with respect to primary and secondary sexual characteristics.

     Responses should then, discuss how these physical changes have psychological ramifications and
     contribute to a new sense of self. Relevant content may recall that adolescents are preoccupied with
     their bodies and develop individual images of what their bodies are like. They find themselves the
     unwitting inhabitants of new adultlike bodies. However, it is hard to generalize about the
     psychological effects of physical changes because they depend on the timing of puberty, they differ
     in boys and girls and they depend on how the adolescent and other people in his or her world
     interpret the accompanying changes as well as the culture of the adolescent. Furthermore, some
     researchers such as Block (1992) have expressed doubt that puberty’s effects on development are as
     strong as once believed. In brief, answers should highlight that adolescent development of identity
     is influenced by an interaction of biological, cognitive and social factors rather than being
     dominated by biology. The culture is also a strong determinant in conceptualisations of self
     perception and body shapes e.g. The Cultural Ideal Hypothesis indicates that there are gender
     differences in coming to terms with your body when you reach adolescence.

Health psychology

7.   Discuss two aspects of stress (physiological, psychological, or social).

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Many aspects of stress may be used. Responses can include causes of stress, measurement of stress,
     the effects of stress and coping with stress. The quantity of relevant studies available is substantial,
     but the application of its findings or criticism of its methods still needs to be made explicit by the
     candidate. Responses can focus on the interaction of physiological aspects with psychological
     aspects, e.g. The Transactional Model of Stress (Lazarus), Models of Hardiness. Each aspect could
     also be discussed separately, aspects do not need to be inter-related.

     Physiological aspects could include increase in stress hormones: adrenaline, cortisol and the effect
     of these hormones on the body. Psychological aspects could include ways in which these
     physiological aspects are interpreted by the individual, e.g. cognitive appraisal. Social aspects of
     stress could include the role of social support in dealing with stress and could also include stressful
     relationships creating stress and lifestyle factors, e.g. living in big cities, poverty and
     unemployment. Cultured stress could relate to pressure on the individual to succeed, gender roles.

8.   Outline two factors related to the development of substance abuse or addictive behaviour.

     Evaluate one prevention strategy for either substance abuse or addictive behaviour.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Factors related to development of substance abuse or addictive behaviour could include parental or
     peer influence, culture, genetic factors, social factors. Factors could include those to do with
     alcohol, tobacco or other drugs that may have been prescribed originally for a medical condition or
     where drugs have been taken for recreation or stimulation; drugs may also include those taken to
     enhance sport performance such as the anabolic steroids taken by weight lifters to increase muscle
     bulk. Addictive behavior could also include gambling, shopping, internet addiction.

     Research studies have focused on prevention strategies, particularly on alcohol and tobacco. The
     task for the candidate is not merely to identify the prevention strategy but also to evaluate the extent
     to which such strategy is effective.

9.   Discuss health promotion strategies and their effectiveness.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     Health promotion strategies take many forms and examiners should be flexible in the way that they
     interpret this term. Health promotion strategies can be seen in the major initiatives taken by
     governments on matters such as disease prevention, including improvements to the environment.
     But promotion strategies may also occur in less explicit ways such as health warnings on cigarette
     packets, or the list of ingredients on food packaging. Whichever examples are taken it is imperative
     that candidates relate their selection to psychological research.

     The psychological research that is presented needs to be discussed in terms of effectiveness for
     health promotion. For example, health promotion that deals with monitoring and subsequent
     treatment of breast cancer in women has been highly successful in many developed cultures.
     Promotions targeting obesity, e.g. promoting healthy food and exercise, have been set up in many
     countries: success of these promotions depends upon factors such as social support, environment.
     Health promotion strategies’ work to raise issues associated with prostate cancer in men has had a
     much lower impact on the health of men, and this factor is common to all cultures.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   Evaluate two research studies investigating the role of communication in maintaining
      relationships.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of something by weighing
      up the strengths and the limitations: in this case, two research studies which investigate the role of
      communication in maintaining relationships. This could be Tannen (1990) which deals with gender
      differences in communication or Bradbury & Fincham (1992) who studied attributions made by
      men and women in relationships and how these were related to behaviour.

      Communication in relationships is important both in terms of maintaining and break-up. A good
      answer may deal with issues in relation to, for example, non-verbal communication, gender or
      cultural differences in communication patterns which could affect a relationship. It could also be
      attributional style or the value of disclosure for maintaining a relationship. It is possible to use
      research addressing a number of different relationships but it will most likely be friendship or a love
      relationship between partners or spouses since these are the most commonly addressed in
      psychology text books. No matter the choice, the answer should clearly identify and evaluate two
      relevant research studies to gain high marks and the research studies included in the answer should
      explicitly focus on the role of communication in maintaining a relationship.

      Evaluation relates to critical thinking and could include an examination of the evidence to evaluate
      a theory; evaluation related to methodology, gender or culture is equally relevant and a good answer
      could include some of these considerations in relation to the role of communication in maintaining
      relationships. There is a cultural bias in the study of human relationships in that most research has
      been conducted in the West. However, there may be research that takes a cross-cultural or cultural
      approach that can be used for comparison in the evaluation.

11.   Discuss one strategy for reducing violence that addresses biological or cognitive or
      sociocultural factors.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review
      including different arguments or factors backed up by appropriate evidence to support the argument.

      There are many ways to address this question depending on what has been studied in the course. A
      response may address different causes of violent behaviour such as sociocultural factors as an
      introduction in order to lay the ground for a strategy for reducing violence but the focus in this
      question is on a method to reduce violence.

      One sort of violence that could be used in a response could be bullying but many other sorts of
      violence could be used, for example mob violence or school violence. Candidates may also have
      studied violence in the community or refer to local programmes that are backed up by research.
      Examples of such strategies could be gun control and censorship of television to restrict violent
      scenes, which have been applied successfully in Jamaica according to Diner & Crandell (1979).
      There are also many research studies on how to reduce bullying and many schools have adopted
      anti-bullying measures based on these. One strategy to reduce bullying is teaching social skills.
      This has proven effective in terms of reducing the likelihood of a person being either the source of
      or the target of bullying (Toch, 1980). Aronson (1979) introduced the “jigsaw classroom” to teach
      cooperative learning and positive social interactions to reduce violence and bullying. These
      strategies address sociocultural factors and teach children how to interact in a positive way.
      Candidates could also include Olweus (1972) who is the father of anti-bullying programmes.
      Another strategy which is often used in combination with social skills training is teaching ways to
      be aware of other person’s feelings, i.e. empathy training (e.g. Feshbach & Feshbach, 1982).
      Recently computer games have been used to do the same (for example, Figueiredo et al. 2007).
      These strategies address cognitive factors in that they aim to change “violent thinking” and
      encouraging “empathic thinking”.

      The response is required to discuss the chosen method which means that it is not only a description
      of it. There should be a balanced and reasoned argument as to why a specific strategy is chosen to
      reduce violence and this must be backed up by evidence.

12.   Examine one short-term and one long-term effect of exposure to violence.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      Responses will probably focus on how an individual reacts to violence short-term and long-term but
      it could also be groups of people, for example a case study of survivors of genocide or community
      violence. Depending on the focus, a response could address different causes of violent behaviour
      such as bullying, street gangs or genocide and this introduction will lay the ground for describing
      the effects of exposure to violence. The response needs to take both one short-term and one long-
      term effect into consideration.

      If the candidate has chosen to deal with genocide a possible short-term consequence could be
      immediate stress reactions and shock whereas long-term consequences could be post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Since survivors of genocide have often lost their relatives
      there are issues of not only losing social support but also losing trust in other people. If the
      candidate has studied domestic violence, there could be a focus on physical and psychological
      effects of being the victim of violence. It is likely that short-term consequences could deal with
      stress reactions and long-term effects could deal with depression and effects on self-esteem.
      Suicide attempts may also be likely consequences of domestic violence and it has been found that
      battered women are at a greater risk for suicide attempts in both Caucasian women, where
      25 percent of the suicide attempts were linked to prior domestic violence, and for African American
      women, where it was up to 50 percent of the suicide attempts that were preceded by domestic
      violence (according to Fischbach & Herbert, 1997).

      Another sort of violence that could be used in a response could be bullying, which is also likely to
      be known to students because of school programmes to prevent bullying. A response may address
      the short-term effects of victimization.

Sport psychology

13.   To what extent do biological factors influence behaviour in sport?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      An argument as to what extent biological factors may influence behaviour in sport can be made
      from any topic area in the guide, or from any other relevant area of sport psychology. Arousal,
      anxiety, injury, drug use and burnout may all be made relevant in response to this question. In all
      cases, the argument should provide a response as to how much of an influence biological factors
      have on behaviour in sport. Responses may include reference to some sort of discussion or
      standpoint on how other factors (possibly cognitive or sociocultural) may also influence sport
      behaviour and/or performance. Behaviour may be interpreted to include starting to participate in
      sport, continuing participation, training and skill development, competition and/or ending
      participation.

14.   Describe one reason why an athlete might use drugs in sport.

      Discuss effects of using drugs in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The justification for use of drugs in sport is very personal and unique to each athlete. Research has
      shown that there are a number of reasons why an individual might use drugs in sport. These
      include, but are not limited to: stress relief from the pressure of competition, performance
      enhancement, and socialization/relaxation. Responses are likely to address the use of performance
      enhancing drugs such as anabolic-androgenic steroids, stimulants, endurance-enhancing chemicals
      (Shermer, 2008). There are many high profile cases of athletes using drugs and while these may be
      brought in to the response, they should only serve as examples of a larger argument the candidate is
      trying to make. Anecdotal evidence should not be awarded marks.

      There may be short term positive effects of the use of drugs in sport e.g. performance enhancement,
      stress relief. Long-term effects are often negative such as the negative physical and psychological
      effects of anabolic stereoids e.g. the case of East German shot put champion Heidi Krieger.

      Cases of sports people and the consequences of use of drugs can be used as relevant supportive

15.   Evaluate one theory of motivation in sport.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      Various theories of motivation have been investigated in sport. Discussion of extrinsic and intrinsic
      motivational theories could be made relevant to this question if it focuses on the impact of extrinsic
      and intrinsic motivation on sport behaviour or performance. More specific theories such as self-
      efficacy theories relating to goal-setting, achievement motivation and cognitive evaluation theory
      (Deci, 1975) could also be included in a response to this question.

The stimulus material below is based on a research article.

        Anxiety is frequently experienced by athletes before they take part in a competitive event. Research
        findings by Hanton and Jones (1999) show that in swimming competitions, boys perceived these
        anxieties negatively. The boys felt sick, tired or nervous just before their race. However when
        Hanton and Jones used semi-structured interviews to investigate the anxieties expressed by ten elite
    5   male swimmers, aged between 19 and 27 years, they found very different views were expressed
        now they were adults, compared to how they felt as children.

        These older swimmers recalled how they had felt as boys, when they were entered into swimming
        competitions. Several of the feelings they had are listed in the first column in Figure 1. These
        were regarded as early unwanted feelings at that time, but now as adults they had gradually been
   10   able to adapt their unwanted or negative feelings into something far more positive and helpful
        to their swimming performances. The swimmers had learned to use imagery, self-talk and other
        positive strategies to enhance their performance.

        Hanton and Jones used inductive content analysis with the interview transcripts obtained from
        the adult swimmers. They listed the raw data from the ten transcripts into themes that had similar
   15   meanings, as shown in Figure 1.

        In summary what the researchers did was to:

           • Read and re-read the transcripts several times
           • Identify raw data themes and list them into groups shown in the first column of Figure 1
           • Draw out (or induce) meanings from the themes and name these, as shown in the second
   20        column of Figure 1. These are called higher order sub-themes
           • Decide on a further refinement of the second column themes in order to turn these into higher
             order themes
           • Identify the “dimension” – a final phrase that is the “essence” of the preceding columns.

Answer all of the following three questions.

1.   The study outlined above uses the phrase “inductive content analysis”. Explain the
     advantages and disadvantages of using this research strategy in the context of this
     specific study.                                                                         [10 marks]

2.   Just ten elite swimmers were used in this research. To what extent could the findings
     of the research be generalized from this study?                                         [10 marks]

3.   Interviews are a major research factor in this study. Discuss ways in which you, as
     a researcher in this study, would prepare for the interviews and the post interview
     information that you would give to each of the ten participants.                        [10 marks]

0          The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3     There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
           understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
           question. The response makes no direct reference to the stimulus
           material or relies too heavily on quotations from the text.

4 to 7     The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
           accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
           addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
           question. The response makes limited use of the stimulus material.

8 to 10    The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
           the demands of the command term. The answer is supported by
           appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of qualitative
           research methodology.       The response demonstrates a critical
           understanding of qualitative research methodology applied to the
           stimulus material.

1.   The study outlined above uses the phrase “inductive content analysis”. Explain the
     advantages and disadvantages of using this research strategy in the context of this
     specific study.                                                                     [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     Inductive content analysis arrives at meanings that are drawn out of the data that is
     provided by the interviewee. It differs markedly from a deductive approach where the
     researcher is likely to have a more prepared idea of what is to be expected from the
     interviewee.

     Advantages of the inductive method include the concept that since the raw data comes
     directly from the interviewee it is likely to be more accurate and dependable than
     observations made by the researchers. The interviewees, in this case, identify what their
     specific anxieties were as boys just before a swimming competition, e.g. they were
     “… worried about performing poorly, or had doubts if they had trained enough, or had
     pins and needles in hands.”

     Disadvantages could include the notion that since the answers depended upon memories
     from several years previously, when the athletes were boys, it may be that they lacked
     accuracy. It may also be that answers were provided in a way that the swimmers
     thought that the researchers would like to hear. Also since a major task for the
     researchers is to interpret the responses produced by the interviewees, then such
     interpretation may itself be inaccurate.

     There are several other advantages and disadvantages that candidates may explain and
     these could earn up to full marks, provided they are relevant. Examiners should use
     their own judgements on the qualities of these answers. Marks should not be awarded
     to answers that focus on quantitative content analysis since this is irrelevant in
     answering a question on inductive content analysis.

2.   Just ten elite swimmers were used in this research. To what extent could the
     findings of the research be generalized from this study?                     [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     Although the number of swimmers in the sample was small, sufficient data has been
     produced to make some limited generalization possible. The sample indicates that the
     swimmers were all males, aged between 19 and 27, and that they had competed at an
     elite level. Their responses were sufficiently similar for the researchers to identify raw
     data themes that were common to their swimmers.

     The extent to which generalization occurs needs to be justified by the candidate. For
     example it would be legitimate to claim that findings from this study could be applied to
     the population of elite swimmers from which the sample was selected. The sample and
     this population would have similar characteristics.

     Candidates may well provide other relevant arguments for the extent to which
     generalizations are possible and these could be awarded high marks. No marks should
     be awarded where the candidate claims that no way of generalization is possible since
     the numbers involved are too small, or the claim that it is only when verbal responses
     are converted to numbers that generalization can occur.

3.   Interviews are a major research factor in this study. Discuss ways in which you, as
     a researcher in this study, would prepare for the interviews and the post interview
     information that you would give to each of the ten participants.                    [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     Interviews need to be prepared in several ways. In this case the interviewer should
     research ways in which other elite swimmers prepare themselves for swimming
     competitions, what their motives are for competing, what their feelings are now
     compared to what their pre-race feelings were as boys. This type of information helps
     to equip the researchers to frame suitable open questions and to anticipate responses
     from interviewees.

     Other research preparation should include wording a clear aim for the interview,
     consideration of ethical issues, checking on audio equipment to record the interview,
     piloting of the interview questions, anticipation of potential responses and a follow-up
     question that would be needed. The subsequent ownership of the recording and
     transcript should also be made clear and a document signed to this effect.

     Post interview considerations should include thanks to the interviewees, an invitation to
     listen to the audio recording and to read the transcript should they so wish. The
     interviewees should also be allowed to make amendments to their own comments or to
     have them deleted or have additions made to them.
