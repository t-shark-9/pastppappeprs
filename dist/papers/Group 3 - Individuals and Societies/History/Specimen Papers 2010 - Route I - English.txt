Prescribed Subject 1	The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These sources relate to the development of Islamic rule under the early caliphs.

SOURCE A               Extract from Islamic History: A Framework for Inquiry by R Stephen Humphreys,
                       London, 1995.

The sources that we have from this period – for example, documents, archaeology, and Christian writings
– are problematic because they are fragmentary or else they represent very specific or even eccentric
perspectives. An adequate and convincing reconstruction of Islam’s first century from these materials alone
is simply not possible. That leaves us with the Muslim Arabic literary sources. If our goal is to comprehend
the way in which Muslims of the late eighth and ninth centuries CE understood the origins of their society,
then we are very well off indeed. But if our aim is to find out “what really happened” – to develop reliably
documented answers to modern questions about the earliest decades of Islamic society – then we are in
trouble.


SOURCE B               Extract from A Survey of Islamic History by B G Weiss and A H Green,
                       Cairo, 1990.

Among the factors contributing to “state-consciousness” was the awareness, following the first waves of
conquest, that a great empire had fallen and another had retreated from much of its territory, and that the
Arabs had filled this vacuum. The Arabs were quick to regard their commonwealth as a greater empire
than those which it had replaced. The Arabs, as Muslims, had entered into the mainstream of world history,
and they knew it. In the course of the conquests, the Arabs became increasingly aware that they were
different from their new subjects and, in time, a system of society emerged which served to preserve this
distinctiveness. The system embraced two units which were, in theory, interrelated: it comprised of an Arab
aristocracy on the one hand, and a non-Arab subject population on the other hand. The Arabs were viewed
as a military caste maintained by the taxes of the subject population. Both parties were viewed as religious
groups who lived in accordance with the will of God as expressed in religious scriptures.

SOURCE C                 Extract from A History of the Arab Peoples by A Hourani, London, 1991.

As the conquered area expanded, the way in which it was ruled had to change. The conquerors exercised
their authority from armed camps where the Arabian soldiers were placed. Being centres of power, these
camps attracted immigrants from Arabia and the conquered lands. The camps grew into cities with a
governor’s palace, a place of public assembly, and a mosque at the centre. Power was in the hands of the
new ruling group: some of its members were Companions of the Prophet (early and devoted followers), but
a large element came from Meccan families and, as the conquests continued, others came from the leading
families of Bedouin nomad tribes. The Caliph Umar created a system of payments and pensions for those
who had fought in the cause of Islam, regulated according to date of conversion and length of service.
This reinforced the cohesion of the ruling elite, or at least their separation from those they ruled. Between the
newly wealthy members of the elite and the poorer people, there were signs of tension from early times.


SOURCE D                 Extract from A History of Islamic Societies by I Lapidus, Cambridge, 2002.

At the very beginning of the Islamic era, the Arab-Muslim elite assumed that they would form a dual society
in which the conquerors would constitute an aristocracy and the conquered peoples a subject population:
the former Muslim, the latter not. Thus, the early Muslim regime was not only tolerant of the non-Muslim
populations, but actually helped reorganize Christian churches which resumed their roles in the educational,
judicial, and even political administration of the Christian population: Christian scribes served in the
administration of both Iraq and Egypt. For the sake of political inclusiveness and effective administration,
the empire collaborated with non-Muslim elites, permitted them partial access to power, and protected them
against disruptive social and economic changes.

Prescribed Subject 2	The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These sources relate to the struggle for control of the kingdom of Sicily

SOURCE A                Extract from Roger II of Sicily, A Ruler Between West and East
                        by Hubert Houben, Germany, 1997.

Tancred of Lecce – an illegitimate son of Duke Roger, Roger II’s eldest son who died young – was elected
as king … This action was unlawful, for the Kingdom of Sicily was not an elective monarchy, rather the
king had the right to designate [choose] his own successor – something which up to then had always been
the case, and a right which the Papacy had recognized, the last time as recently as 1188. Assemblies of
nobles served merely to ratify decisions which had already been taken. There had simply been no case up
to then of female succession. …

To avoid any possible difficulties which might arise, William II had arranged for the great men of the
kingdom to confirm on oath his designation [choice] of Constance as the heir, should he die without children,
during an assembly held at Troia in 1185. Hence, legal right undoubtedly rested with her. …

Tancred had proved himself in the service of William II, was commander of the fleet and “viceroy” for the
mainland, the latter with the title of “Great Constable and Master Justiciar of the whole of Apulia”.


SOURCE B                Extract from “Norman Sicily in the Twelfth Century” by Graham Loud, taken from
                        The New Cambridge Medieval History IV, Cambridge, 1999.

Tancred was crowned king on 18 January 1190, a move which had the covert [secret] support of the pope who
was anxious to avoid the union of Sicily and the Holy Roman Empire. Although hampered by the Muslim
rebellion, Tancred was from the beginning in control of Sicily and Calabria. He faced widespread opposition
from the mainland nobility … However despite this he also had a number of advantages. Henry VI was
preoccupied with domestic affairs in Germany, and this gave him time to establish his rule. Most of the
higher clergy (apart from those in the Principality of Capua) and the more important towns supported him …
His brother-in-law, Count Richard of Acerra, proved an able lieutenant on the mainland, and his support
gave Tancred immediate control of much of the principality of Salerno.

SOURCE C                Extract from The chronicle of Richard of St Germano, written in Italy at Montecassino,
                        c.1216. Emperor Henry VI has invaded the Kingdom of Sicily in 1194.
                        URL: www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/medievalTexts.htm

After raising an army, the emperor entered Italy in the month of June. He prepared a fleet at Pisa and
Genoa, and having sent it out, he descended into the kingdom. Everywhere surrendered to him except
Atina and Roccaguglielmo. The Capuans and Aversans neither surrendered to him nor were besieged.
The Neapolitans had already surrendered by agreement with the Pisans. The emperor marched on and
stormed Salerno. In revenge for his injury he put some of the inhabitants to the sword, and condemned
others to prison or exile, for reasons published and agreed publicly by his army. Then he marched into
Apulia, and meeting no resistance came through Calabria to Messina. The new little king, William III,
left the palace with his mother and took refuge in a fortified castle called Caltabellotta. On seeing this,
the people of Palermo acclaimed the emperor. The emperor sent messengers to the queen and came to an
agreement that she could have the County of Lecce and her son the Principality of Taranto.


SOURCE D                Extract from The Chronicle of Otto of St Blasien, written in the Black Forest in
                        Germany, c.1210. The city of Palermo has just surrendered to Emperor Henry VI
                        in 1194.
                        URL: www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/medievalTexts.htm

The emperor meanwhile, with no small effort, drew up his army in the proper military manner. He absolutely
forbade all indiscipline among the Germans, threatening that those who disobeyed him would have their
hands cut off. He paraded his troops with their armour glittering superbly, slowly marching two by two
along the road towards the city [Palermo]. He himself then made a glorious state entry into the city, followed
by the princes, with everyone properly acclaiming him with praise; and when the crowd who stood in the
squares saw the emperor then, as is the custom of that land, they prostrated themselves face downwards on
the ground in front of him. So he was received as king and established his peace. He was given many gifts
by the citizens: most excellent horses with golden saddles, and reins and trappings and other things of gold,
silver, silk and jewels, with all of which he generously rewarded his army. First he gave royal gifts to the
princes, then he showed himself most generous to the knights who deserved reward, and thus he bound all
of them in a variety of ways to his service.

Prescribed Subject 1         The origins and rise of Islam c500–661

These questions relate to the development of Islamic rule under the early caliphs.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source B, changed when the Muslims “entered into the
           mainstream of world history” by conquering new lands and peoples?       [3 marks]

           The first mark should be awarded for the general observation that the conquests had
           introduced important new changes both for the Arab-Muslim rulers and also those over whom
           they now ruled. The other two marks should be awarded for any comments that support the
           above statement.

           Some suggestions are:
             the awareness of the problems of having conquered new lands and peoples
             the development of the Arab-Muslims as a distinctive new ruling class
             their efforts to maintain and develop an Arab-Muslim identity
             the introduction of a new system of governance and control
             the perception of the new rulers as a military elite by the conquered peoples.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What message is conveyed by Source E?                                              [2 marks]

           In the absence of their own coinage, the early Muslims adopted some of the coinage of the
           conquered Persian regime (along with its un-Islamic, figurative art and reference to
           Zoroastrianism). Only later, did Islamic models of coinage emerge.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           N.B. Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for
           a final mark out of [5 marks].

2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed about the relationships of the early
     Arab-Muslim rulers over their conquered peoples in Sources C and D.           [6 marks]

     For comparison:
       Both sources highlight how power had come to be concentrated in the hands of a new ruling elite.
       Both relate how the expansion had taken place into areas outside the Arabian Peninsula.
       Both deal with the distinctive identity of this class relative to the conquered peoples.
       Both mention how this identity was both ethnic (because the conquering people were Arabs) and
       religious (because they were also Muslims).

     For contrast:
       Source C points to some areas of potential conflict and socio-economic tension whereas
       Source D highlights areas of co-operation and collaboration.
       Source D highlights the protection of the local people and the ways in which they might
       participate in power, whereas Source C draws attention to the ways in which the imposition of
       their rule had begun to lead to divisive tensions.
       Source C comments from a socio-economic perspective; Source D focuses on governance and
       administration.
       Source D points to the continuity of administration and the efficiency which results from this,
       whereas Source C highlights the separation of the new rulers from their conquered people.
       The administrative initiative in Source C is the stipend system of payments to the Arab-Muslim
       army, whereas Source D places greater emphasis on the use of local scribes to manage their own
       peoples.
       Source C points to the tribal composition of the new Arab-Muslim rulers while Source D speaks
       of the composition and religion of their new administrators.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed
     separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For maximum [6 marks] expect
     a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origins and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
     Source A and Source E for historians studying the development of Islamic rule
     under the early caliphs.                                                          [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        Extract from a modern reader dealing with approaches to Islamic history.

     Purpose:       To highlight the problems of primary source materials in the study of early Islam and
                    Islamic historiography.

     Value:         Provides a clear and concise critique of the basic issues. It accords equal weight to a
                    wide range of greatly varying primary sources.

     Limitation:    The author takes a narrow view of what can be achieved given the available sources.
                    His scepticism about the value of these arguably does not allow much history to be
                    written at all. Some might object to his implicit rejection of the standard history,
                    including the traditional Muslim accounts.

     Source E
     Origin:        Two Muslim coins from the seventh century.

     Purpose:       As a fixed unit of currency designed to facilitate various payment transactions.
                    However, such coins and their images also served to transmit a powerful, visual
                    sense of authority and identity of the issuing source.

     Value:         Material evidence which appears to provide an indication of an initial uncertainty
                    surrounding the lengthy transformation from a fledging Islamic Empire into one with
                    a more clearly defined ideology over the course of the seventh century.
                    Such materials allow and invite comparisons and contrasts to be made with the
                    development described in historical narratives.

     Limitations:   Such archaeological finds are open to multiple interpretations since they served
                    several functions and a wide constituency. Without corroborating evidence from
                    other sources these coins tell us relatively little by themselves.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance between
     the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 mark] split. If only
     one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] candidates must refer to
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using these sources and your own knowledge, analyse how the Arab-Muslims
     controlled the lands and people they had conquered.                      [8 marks]

     Source A: Suggests that we actually know very little about this since all our sources are unreliable
               in one way or another.

     Source B: By fostering a sense of state-consciousness in the wake of the military victories which
               set the Arab-Muslims above the conquered people.

     Source C: By the successful expansion of the ruling groups from authority wielded in army
               encampments into more sophisticated forms of government which gave them new,
               distinctive and prestigious socio-economic advantages over those they ruled.

     Source D: Although the Arab-Muslims had always imposed a two-tier society in the new empire,
               it was also one which included significant degrees of religious toleration, political inclusion
               and socio-economic security.

     Source E: Coins that included symbols of the defeated Persian Empire were once employed by the
               early Muslims, but were later discontinued in favour of more appropriate and standard
               Islamic models. Such a slow transition could be interpreted as the accommodation of
               the defeated into a gradually evolving Islamic polity.

     Own knowledge could include:
       development of any of the above points
       the observation that the Muslims had conducted military campaigns which had been short and
       successful
       the depopulation and weakness of the Byzantine Empire due to the plague of Justinian in 541
       the local population who were unhappy after long periods of warfare, high taxation and religious
       antagonism within the Byzantine Empire
       the Muslims’ belief that religiously inspired warfare would result in a successful expansion
       which was determined, and therefore guaranteed, by God.

     Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only own
     knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a maximum
     [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
     to the sources used.

Prescribed Subject 2          The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

These questions relate to the struggle for control of the kingdom of Sicily.

5.    (a)   Who, according to Source B, supported Tancred and what advantages did
            he have?                                                              [3 marks]

            The first mark should be awarded for identifying that most of the higher churchmen and the
            towns supported Tancred. The second mark should be awarded for noting the importance of
            Count Richard of Acerra. The final mark should be awarded for awareness of Henry VI’s
            preoccupation with events in Germany.

               His main supporters were the higher clergy, main towns.
               He was also supported by his powerful brother-in-law.
               He was advantaged because his rival was preoccupied by events in Germany.

            Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)   What message is conveyed by Source E?                                              [2 marks]

            Source E shows the succession to the kingdom of Sicily in the twelfth century. It reveals the
            crisis that followed the death of William II in 1189, as there were two rival claimants:
            Tancred, the illegitimate grandson of King Roger II; and Henry VI of Germany, the husband
            of Roger II’s daughter, Constance. Ultimately, Henry VI gained the crown of Sicily, which
            passed to his Hohenstaufen descendants.

            Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

            N.B. Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for
            a final mark out of [5 marks].
                                              –7–             SPEC/3/HIST1/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Compare and contrast the views expressed about the strengths of the rival claims
     to the throne of Sicily in Sources A and B.                                      [6 marks]

     For comparison:
       Both sources state that Tancred was experienced in war and governance.
       Both sources mention support for Tancred. Source A refers to him being elected as king and
       Source B refers to specific supporters.

     For contrast:
       Source A states that the election of Tancred as king was “unlawful”.
       Source A states that “legal right undoubtedly rested with her [Constance]”.
       Source A does not mention Henry VI and only mentions Constance, whereas Source B does not
       mention Constance but only mentions Henry VI.
       Source B mentions the importance of Richard of Acerra.
       Source B mentions the opposition of Sicily’s Muslims to Tancred’s succession.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed
     separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks]
     expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

7.   With reference to their origins and purpose, discuss the value and limitations
     of Source C and Source D for historians studying how Emperor Henry VI
     conquered Sicily.                                                              [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origins:       An early thirteenth century chronicle written at Monte Cassino in Italy.

     Purpose:       To compile a record of the main political events of the age.

     Value:         A near-contemporary chronicle that gives an Italian perspective of the take-over of
                    the kingdom of Sicily by the Hohenstaufen dynasty.

     Limitations:   This is an Italian source that is unsympathetic to Sicily falling under German rule.

     Source D
     Origins:       An early thirteenth century chronicle written at St Blasien in Germany.

     Purpose:       To compile a record of the main political events of the age.

     Value:         A near-contemporary chronicle that gives a German perspective of the take-over of
                    the Kingdom of Sicily by the Hohenstaufen dynasty.

     Limitations:   This is a German source that is naturally sympathetic to the actions of the emperor,
                    and seeks to justify them.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance between
     the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 mark] split. If only
     one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] candidates must refer to
     origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

8.   Using these sources and your own knowledge, analyse how and why Henry VI
     became King of Sicily in December 1194.                                  [8 marks]

     Source A: Shows Henry VI and Constance had the laws of Sicily on their side, as William II’s
               designation of her as his successor was entirely legal. The election of the illegitimate
               Tancred as King had no legal basis.

     Source B: Shows Henry VI’s rival, Tancred, lacked support from the key noblemen of mainland
               southern Italy, and was openly opposed by the Muslims when he became king in 1190.
               However Tancred did enjoy the support of the Papacy, and the church and towns
               of Sicily.

     Source C: Shows Henry VI’s use of military force, including the navies of Pisa and Genoa, which
               were used to transport his army to Sicily. It also shows that he used violence when he
               captured Salerno.

     Source D: Shows the welcome that Henry VI received in Sicily and the discipline that he imposed
               upon his army. The people of Sicily, upon his arrival, submitted to him and accepted
               his rule. This is evident from the many gifts that he was given.

     Source E: Shows the candidates to succeed William II and emphasises the illegitimate birth of
               Tancred, and the eventual succession of Constance and her husband Henry VI.

     Own knowledge:
     Could include a reference to Tancred’s death in February 1194, which left his infant son William III
     as Henry VI’s only male rival. Also, the ransom paid by Richard I of England to Henry VI in 1194
     gave him the resources to employ a larger army and navy than those with which he had failed to
     conquer Sicily in 1191. Finally, the Sicilians were divided in their loyalties, as many of them
     accepted Henry VI as their king by right of his wife, Constance. Many of those Sicilian barons who
     had opposed Henry VI in 1191–1193 were already defeated and imprisoned, or had accepted his
     rule by 1194.

     Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only own
     knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a maximum
     [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
     to the sources used.

markbands found in the guide.


    0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.


    1–3:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
            appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.


    4–5:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are
            mainly inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are
            barely understood and there is minimal focus on the task.


    6–7:    Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
            limited in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will
            understanding of historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only
            partially addressed.


    8–9:    The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is
            present but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive
            in nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation.
            Critical commentary may be present. There is an attempt to place events in historical
            context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a
            structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.


    10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are
           considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present.
           Events are generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes,
           such as comparison and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different
           approaches and interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical
           knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.


    13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
           applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
           produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
           understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
           different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.


    16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of
           the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is
           used as evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as
           comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
           interpretations are used appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1   Dynasties and rulers

1.   Examine the effects of invasions by one Islamic dynasty.

     This question requires candidates to discuss the effects both positive and negative, on the countries
     that they invaded. The invasions terrorized the invaded lands, with death and destruction.
     Agriculture was harmed, and towns and villages destroyed. Trade was interrupted and many
     people were destitute. But after the initial terror, many invaders settled in the conquered lands,
     integrated, and contributed to their development. However, an example of a more positive invasion
     by an Islamic dynasty would be that of the Muslim invasion of Spain. The conquerors were
     welcomed by the citizens of whom the majority lived in poverty under a feudal system imposed by
     the Visigoths of Spain. They saw the invaders as liberators who brought with them the knowledge
     and expertise of administration, trade and government. Soon al-Andalus flourished. Mention could
     be made of the eventual breakdown of Arab rule in Spain as a result of the continued succession
     problems and the establishment of the party kings.


2.   Why was Charlemagne crowned emperor in 800?

     Charlemagne (c742–814) became King of the Franks in 768. Most of his early reign was spent
     fighting in Italy, Bavaria and the Danube area, especially against the pagan Saxons.
     He supported the Church and was a patron of scholars. He also imposed law and order, and an
     administrative system. He was a friend of popes, and his coronation in 800, by Leo III, was mainly
     a result of his strength as King of the Franks, his religious policies, and especially his support for
     Leo III and the papacy against the Lombards and Romans.
                                                 –4–              SPEC/3/HIST1/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Analyse the reasons for (a) the rise and (b) the decline of either the Ummayad or the
     Abbasid dynasty.

     The answer requires candidates to analyse the factors within the Muslims world at the time that had
     given rise to the dynasty, as well as show how some of these factors and others contributed to
     its decline.

     (a)   For the rise of the Umayyad Dynasty, candidates could include:
             the struggle between Mua‟wiya and Ali, and how it indirectly placed Mua‟wiya in a
             position for succession
             after the assassination of Ali, how Mua‟wiya managed to secure for himself the role of
             caliph – Mua‟wiya being the strongest candidate militarily
             for the first time the position of caliph became hereditary instead of elective
             the shift of the capital from Medina to Damascus – reasons for and consequences.

     (b)   For the decline of the Umayyad Dynasty, candidates could include:
             the unhappiness of the inhabitants with the move of the capital
             the loss of religious focus of the later caliphs
             the fighting within the ruling family regarding succession
             the challenge by the Abbasids and the Umayyads inability to deal with it.


     (a)   For the rise of the Abbasid Empire, candidates could include:
             their claim as descendants of the Prophet Mohammed and its consequences to both the
             Abbasids and the Umayyad
             the move of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad; focusing on the reasons for and
             subsequent outcomes of this move.

     (b)   For the decline of the Abbasid Empire, candidates could include:
             an analysis of the consequences of the move to Baghdad and the isolation of Arab support
             an understanding of the implementation of a new political system, giving more power to
             the vizier and local emirs, and its consequences for the caliph and old Arab aristocracy
             the challenges of al-Andalus and „Abd al-Rahman III of Spain
             the eventual rift with their Shi‟a support base.

     N.B. If only the rise or only the decline is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


4.   In what ways, and with what success, did Louis VI (1108–1137) seek to extend royal power
     in France?

     When Louis VI became king, he inherited little beyond the Isle de France, and throughout his reign
     (1108–1137) he sought to develop the French monarchy, by the following means: opposition to
     Henry II, of England and the English lands in France; fighting independent and unruly
     French nobles; strengthening the Isle de France, and imposing a measure of authority, law and order
     there; building new towns on the royal demesne, and gaining support by offering land there.
     He was able to begin organizing government and royal finance. Although the monarchy still lacked
     much authority, Louis VI must be credited for laying the foundations.

5.   Explain the aims, and the achievements of either one Islamic ruler or one medieval
     European ruler.

     Candidates can use any Islamic or medieval European ruler. It is important that examiners check
     the accuracy of any material presented.

     This question requires candidates to illustrate their understanding of the aims of a ruler as well as
     his achievements. The answer depends on the ruler chosen which would then determine the focus
     and presentation of the answer. Rulers can be chosen from any of the dynasties/period studied but
     an analysis of the aims and the achievements of that leader is required. The circumstances and
     conditions under which the ruler reigned, may be mentioned to illustrate an understanding of how
     the aims and achievement manifested itself. Further analysis of the consequences of the
     achievements may be mentioned.


6.   Discuss social and economic change under either one medieval European ruler or one
     Islamic ruler.

     Candidates can use any Islamic or medieval European ruler. It is important that examiners check
     the accuracy of any material presented.

     Social and economic change under either a medieval European or Islamic ruler, could include:
     social groups and the ruler‟s attitude to them; family structure and daily life; religion and its effects
     on social customs and daily life; education, learning, literature and other arts; agriculture;
     manufacturing, crafts and trade (internal and external); taxes and financial management.
     Specific details will depend on the date/era chosen, as social and economic policies changed
     considerably between the dates of this syllabus, as well as whether the chosen ruler was European
     or Islamic.

Topic 2   Society and economy

7.   Evaluate the nature and importance of slavery in the Islamic world.

     This is an open-ended question and candidates should understand and show the change in the
     treatment and rights of slaves with the coming of Islam and through the Islamic eras; as well as an
     explanation of how Islam ensured the rights of slaves and others‟ responsibility towards slaves.
     Candidates need to show how individual slaves took up important positions in the army and
     government and how this contributed to the stability and development of the dynasty.

     Students should be aware of:
        Islamic tradition regarding the capture and treatment of slaves; in many instances an
        improvement of conditions if implemented accordingly
        prisoners of war were captured during times of war and periods of expansion and enslaved;
        thus slaves came from different regions at different periods in Islamic history
        the slave trade and the Muslim world – the capture of slaves for the specific purpose of trade.
        Trade routes in East Africa
        the recruitment of slaves into the army, as administrators, as commanders of armies and, even in
        some cases, ruled over Muslim areas or took the role of vizir (al-Rumi in Egypt).

8.   Explain why, and how, one city developed in either the Islamic world, or in medieval Europe.

     Candidates can use any Islamic or medieval European city. It is important that examiners check the
     accuracy of any material presented.

     “Why” demands the reasons for the growth of the chosen city, geographical and historical.
     For example, the site, for defence, on water, good communications, access for food supplies, etc.
     and as far as is known the actual historical circumstances that led to the foundations. “How” should
     cover the foundation and growth/development, historically, politically, and architecturally.

     Some material for Paris: it was a Gallic village, conquered by Julius Caesar in 52 BCE, and because
     of its natural advantages, developed as a Roman city. It was the capital of the Merovingian kings,
     e.g. Clovis I, and continued in importance when Hugh Capet, Duke of Paris, became king of France
     in 987. As a capital city it flourished as a centre for trade, culture and learning and religion.

     Some material for Venice: it was first settled in fifth century by refugees fleeing from northern
     invaders. The first doge was appointed in 697. Its site was ideal for trade and defence. By the
     tenth century it was an important commercial and cultural centre. It formed trading colonies in the
     eastern Mediterranean, and became even more powerful and prosperous after its defeat of its chief
     rival Genoa.

     Some material for Cairo: students need to be aware of the process of invasion of Egypt by the
     Fatimids and that their main focus is believed to be the trade routes through Africa and the
     Mediterranean. Elaboration of the situation in Egypt at the time of conquest is important as it gives
     an understanding of the reason behind the establishment of the city of Cairo as the administrative
     capital of the Fatimid dynasty while Fustat remained the main economic centre. Further discussion
     could lead to mentioning the administrative functions and changes brought about in Cairo as
     compared to those made to the already established city of Fustat. Cairo also served as the
     intellectual centre of the Fatimids with the establishment of universities and other places of study.


9.   Discuss the effects of the manorial system on peasants and manorial lords.

     The manorial system was a social, economic and administrative system that emerged after the
     collapse of the Roman Empire, as a form of protection, and gradually evolved into a system of
     obligation and service.

     Peasants, which were both free and unfree. In return for various services – week work or boon
     work – or payments, they received land to cultivate, meadow for grazing, access to woodland.
     They were subject to the Lord‟s court, and their rights and duties varied according to their status,
     the century, and the locality.

     Feudal lords owned one or more manors. The manor might or might not consist of the whole
     village, but it contained demesne land for the private use of the lord, and the tenants‟ holdings.
     Where the lord owned more than one manor he appointed a steward to oversee work, and manors
     also had a reeve, elected annually from the peasants, to enforce rules for working and collect dues.
     The lord presided over the manorial court or courts. By the fourteenth century lords received 90 %
     of their dues in cash, although in times of plague and labour shortage, many lords tried to reinforce
     labour dues.
                                                   –8–              SPEC/3/HIST1/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


10.   Compare and contrast the lives of women from two different social groups. The social groups
      chosen can be from either medieval Europe or the Islamic world.

      Candidates can use any Islamic or medieval European social groups. It is important that examiners
      check the accuracy of any material presented.

      Social groups for medieval Europe could include: peasants, both free and unfree, and their life and
      work in agriculture and the home; townswomen, including artisans, working wives and housewives
      with no outside employment, and wealthy businesswomen; women in religious institutions, such as
      nuns in convents and anchorites; noble women including members of a royal family, heiresses,
      abbesses and prioresses.

      Social groups within which medieval Muslim women found themselves are closely related to the
      role of women in Islam at the time. The society itself was based on the rights of women and the
      responsibility and rights of men towards women. Women in the Islamic world formed part of the
      peasantry in urban and rural areas; often involved in different forms of labour, while others may
      form part of the upper crust and have different rights and responsibilities associated with them.
      Women who may have been captured after a war/expedition may have found themselves in the
      position of concubines in a harem or even as slaves to a family. What is important in the
      comparison and contrast of the lives of the women in the Islamic world, is to illustrate that women
      found themselves in various social groups and that this would have determined their status,
      duties and rights within what is permitted by Islamic law.

      N.B. If only one social group is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


11.   In what ways did the growth of trade have an influence on medieval European society?

      This is a broad question which indicates the very significant influence of trade on medieval society.
      Some of the most important influences would involve the evolution of towns and cities.
      These grew up as commercial centres and began to challenge the authority of the nobles and the
      feudal system. This occurred in all parts of Europe: Italy, Low Countries, and northern areas.
      Towns encouraged the emergence of new social classes: the mercantile classes and the
      urban proletariat. These groups struggled to gain influence and modify medieval society.
      New associations of merchants, craftsmen and bankers agitated for change in the political and
      legal structures. Towns became independent of kings and nobles and devised their own
      governments which changed ideas of government.

      The wealth produced by trade encouraged more progressive attitudes as universities were founded,
      art and culture and literacy expanded. Communication, transportation, technology and science were
      all expanded due to commerce.

      The power of nobles declined as kings used the middle class as officials and undermined the nobles.
      The manorial system declined as lords converted their land to commercial agriculture in pursuit
      of cash. Many serfs were evicted and moved to towns.

12.   Examine the extent to which religion influenced life in either medieval Europe or the
      Islamic world.

      Candidates can use religion in either Islamic or medieval European society. It is important that
      examiners check the accuracy of any material presented.

      Life in medieval Europe was greatly affected by religion, usually in the form of
      religious institutions, such as monasteries and churches. These buildings were the most prestigious
      in the town or village, so their very existence influenced life. There were some differences in time,
      (there were fewer monasteries and churches before c1050) and locality, (whether in towns or
      villages) or in which European country, but the following points would have applied to most
      medieval Europeans.

      The Parish Church was important: all people were expected to attend mass on Sundays and great
      feast days. They also attended for sacraments, such as baptism. The church and churchyard also
      served as a social centre; for games, plays etc. Many churches especially in towns, had a school,
      and there are examples of peasant boys who studied there and became important scholars
      and statesmen. Sometimes courts were held in the church. Monasteries were also very significant.
      Many lay men and women worked there and monasteries also had schools and hospitals.
      Visits from the itinerant orders also affected daily lives, and anchorites and pilgrimages also
      influenced many. Christianity in medieval Europe was a living and strong influence on the daily
      lives of the vast majority.

      Life in the Islamic world was greatly affected by religion on a daily basis and in other ways.
      The five times daily prayer and its timings had a huge influence on the working day as did the
      Friday prayer.      The pilgrimage (Hajj) to Mecca is one of the five pillars of Islam.
      The establishment and building of mosques in various places and their use for religious practise as
      well as a range of other social gatherings and often, centres of learning made them a focal point for
      the community. Candidates might also mention the split in Islam during the later part of the
      “Rightly Guided Caliphs” and the effects it had on people‟s lives. Government and administration
      of Muslim areas might also be considered. The building and use of places of learning also
      influenced life as did Muslim art and architecture.

Topic 3    Wars and warfare

13.   Select one war that took place between 600 and 1450 and evaluate the reasons for its outcome.

      Candidates can use any Islamic or medieval European war. It is important that examiners check the
      accuracy of any material presented.

      This question requires candidates to select one war between 600 and 1450, either in medieval
      Europe or the Islamic world, and explain which side won and why victory/defeat was the outcome
      for the different sides. Social, economic and political factors could be considered, as well as
      support, weapons, tactics, leadership, terrain, logistics etc. Outcome could also cover immediate
      results for both sides, such as position of the state, its government, social and economic gains or
      losses, devastation, prestige.


14.   For what reasons, and in what ways, was sea power important in warfare?

      Candidates can use sea power in either Islamic or medieval European warfare. It is important that
      examiners check the accuracy of any material presented.

      Material/details will depend on era and area chosen.

      The Mediterranean:
      Sea power allowed the Byzantine Empire to dominate the Eastern Mediterranean until the seventh
      century and protected Constantinople from attack by Muslims and Vikings in the ninth and
      tenth centuries. The lack of sea power by Christian states in the Mediterranean allowed the Muslim
      conquest of Spain, Sicily and coastal regions.

      The emergence of the sea power of the Italian cities: Genoa, Pisa et al allowed them to support the
      Crusades and recover territory from the Muslims. They were able to increase their trade and
      commercial wealth which helped expand European commerce. The Normans used their sea power
      to reconquer Sicily in the eleventh century.

      Northern Europe and Russia:
      Sea power allowed the Vikings to conquer territory in England, Normandy and Sicily as well as
      establish themselves in Russia. The lack of sea power by most medieval kingdoms made them
      vulnerable to Viking attack. The Vikings expanded trade in Northern Europe and Russia through
      their control of the seas. They improved communication in the medieval world.

      France and England – Hundred Years War:
         Both countries built navies to protect trade.
         English command of the sea crucial for the invasion of France (Battle of Sluys).
         Both required naval power to protect trade, suppress piracy, and prevent invasion.

15.   Analyse the outcome, and the impact of, either the Battle of al-Qadisiyya (636–637), or the
      Battle of Poitiers (1356).

      Al-Qadisiyya:
      Candidates should place the situation of the Islamic world or dynasty in perspective, relating the
      reasons for and preparation for the battle to the circumstances under which it occurred. Some may
      relate the events and chronology of events within the battle but more focus should be given to
      the result, impact and outcome of the battle; both to the Muslims and their opponents.

      Poitiers:
      This was a major victory for the English at the end of the first part of the Hundred Years War.
      Edward the Black prince was raiding in central France when his force of 7000 was intercepted by a
      16 000 strong French army commanded by King John II. English archers and lightly equipped
      infantrymen out manoeuvred the superior French force. John II was captured and 2000 French
      knights killed. The French signed the Treaty of Brétigny (1360) and ended the first part of the
      Hundred Years War. The king was ransomed for three million gold coins, and lands ceded
      to England. The battle showed the superiority of English weapons and tactics, but their superiority
      was short lived.


16.   Compare and contrast two of the following military leaders: Khalid ibn al-Walid, Nur al-Din,
      Salah al-Din.

      Candidates need to trace the role played by the two chosen figures against the Crusades from the
      time they took power. Mention should be made about their military successes against the Crusades
      and also their attempts at unifying the Muslims in facing their enemy. Candidates should evaluate
      the successes and failures in terms of the situation they faced and how it can be viewed as a
      stepping stone for other leaders against the Crusades.

      N.B. If only one leader is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


17.   “The Norman invasion of England in 1066 was planned like a business enterprise.” To what
      extent was William I’s success as a military leader in this campaign due to planning, and to
      what extent was it due to other factors?

      There is no doubt that the Norman invasion was well planned politically and militarily in order to
      gain support from the pope, the French king, and some English nobles. William I also used the
      political situation in England and exploited Harold‟s difficulties. He put much thought and effort
      into military planning, gathering resources and men, and gained supporters by promising land in
      England if and when he had conquered it. Other factors could include actual fighting methods
      and tactics, brutality, revenge and terror, as well as the weakness of his opponents.

18.   Discuss the social and economic effects of warfare in Europe during the fourteenth and
      fifteenth centuries.

      The constant warfare in medieval Europe led to the manorial system as leaders gave land to their
      followers in exchange for military service. This created the professional military class of knights
      and nobles which ruled Europe. Charlemagne would be a relevant example of this process.
      Serfdom also emerged as ordinary people surrendered their independence in exchange for
      protection in this violent period.

      Social effects: Constant warfare elevated the military man to the top of the social and political
      pyramid, and created an agricultural society designed to support the knights. This was a hereditary
      class which evolved its own customs, rituals and laws which allowed it to dominate feudal society.
      Warfare created the need for permanent military forces to protect castles, guard against
      invasions etc. The manorial system could not provide this, as service was limited to 40 days.
      Kings began to ask for money instead of service from their vassals. The vassals converted their
      landholdings to commercial operations. Serfdom was abolished as serfs were evicted and some
      became tenants.

      Economic effects: Warfare led to the development of certain trades and technology associated
      with war: metallurgy, armaments, castle building. This led to the evolution of new classes of
      skilled workers. Castles with garrisons became centres of activity, markets grew up which
      encouraged trade. Kings in search of revenues for armies encouraged trade and the development
      of towns. War encouraged violence in society, caused physical destruction and lawlessness by
      armed knights who robbed and persecuted the weak. Lower classes and minorities had no defence
      against abuse. Invasions by Muslims, Vikings devastated wide areas, interrupted trade.

Topic 4    Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   In what ways did centres of learning in the Islamic world contribute to the spread
      of knowledge?

      This is an open-ended question and candidates could focus on two or more centres of learning in
      answering the question. Candidates need to show and evaluate the contribution made by centres of
      learning while also placing the period into perspective by mentioning the situation within the
      Islamic world and other areas in terms of intellectual development. The achievements of its
      scholars and their impact on learning need to be highlighted, thus showing how centres of learning
      could have contributed to the spread of knowledge.


20.   For what reasons, and in what ways, were monasteries important for the development of
      Christian scholarship in medieval Europe?

      Monasticism began as a means for participants to worship God in an ordered community in order to
      save their own souls, but due to many features of medieval Europe monasteries became important
      features for the development of Christian scholarship. Reasons for this could include: monks had to
      be literate in order to take part in the divine office and other liturgical ceremonies; time and
      opportunities were available for reading and study; monasteries usually had schools
      and libraries; they were relatively safe havens in turbulent times; scribes were available for
      copying manuscripts, originally these were for the liturgy, but soon developed in a wider area;
      scholars were attracted to and appointed to high positions. Ways included, teaching, study,
      copying, collecting books and manuscripts, and gaining a reputation and thus attracting
      interested scholars. Monastic scholars included Bede, Gildas, Bruno, Bernard, and if friaries are
      included, Dominic Guzman and Thomas Aquinas.

21.   Discuss the artistic and architectural significance of either one cathedral or one large
      urban mosque.

      Candidates can use either a medieval European cathedral or a large urban mosque. It is important
      that examiners check the accuracy of any material presented.

      The Great Mosque of Cordoba:
        It was built in 785 after „Abd al-Rahman I came to power and made Cordoba the capital
        of al-Andalus.
        It was situated near the residence of „Abd al-Rahman I – making the city of Cordoba the
        religious and administrative capital of al-Andalus.
        The mosque reflected the ambition of the Umayyads to make al-Andalus, and the city of
        Cordoba, the wealthiest and most refined in Europe.
        The artistic and architectural features reflect that of the Islamic world in that it did not use any
        human image and that it comprised of a prayer hall with the mihrab, facing the direction of
        Mecca; it also comprised of a mosque courtyard, which was used in the event that the prayer hall
        was full.
        It is believed that the inner-structure is similar to that of the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which
        was built at around 50 years before and it is believed to have been used as a basis for the Great
        Mosque in Cordoba, which was common during the Umayyad period in the East.
        The size of the mosque‟s prayer hall is significant in that it reflects the size of the city and its
        Muslim inhabitants.
        The intricate interior is made up of a large number of low round arches built from alternating
        red/black and white stones; this gives the mosque its unique features and links it to the Moorish
        architectural style.
        The original building did not have any minarets and these were later added during the reigns of
        Hisham I and „Abd al-Rahman III.
        To accommodate the increasing Muslim population, the mosque was extended many times.
        Presently it houses a cathedral that was built inside the mosques after the Reconquista.
        The Great Mosque of Cordoba, although no longer used for the purpose of Muslim prayer, is a
        reminder of a period of greatness in the history of Spain.

22.   Analyse the origin and impact of the twelfth century renaissance in Europe.

      The “origins” may include: the impact of the influx of Arabic and classical scholarship after the fall
      of Toledo in 1085. This included material in science, politics, philosophy and law, and introduced
      new ways of seeking knowledge. In Italy the surviving influence of Roman law and literature was
      used to revise canon law and encourage new scholarship. Roman historical writing styles were used
      to provide analysis and emphasize secular logic over supernatural explanations. The work of
      Adelard of Bath who emphasized the investigative secular approach of Arab science inspired others
      to go to Spain to translate and bring back more secular knowledge. This included Aristotle who
      explained the universe by logic and said that God did not intervene.

      “Impact” may include: this led to the development of universities which taught law, medicine and
      philosophy based on the new knowledge. The emergence of the idea that man was capable of
      understanding the universe developed. Peter Abelard developed logic to show inconsistencies in
      the Bible. This introduced objectivity and logic to the medieval mind that had relied on faith
      and doctrine. Aristotle posed a challenge to the established church and its doctrines. This led to the
      work of Thomas Aquinas in an attempt to reconcile faith and the new knowledge. There was a
      great expansion in humanism and man‟s self-confidence. This led to the fifteenth Renaissance.


23.   “Islamic scholars were not only translators and compilers of existing scientific knowledge, but
      contributed much new scientific knowledge.” With reference to Ibn Sina (Avicenna)
      980–1037, and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) 1126–1198, to what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      Candidates need to be familiar with the fields of study of these scholars. They need to show the
      stage of development in scientific knowledge at the time and how the scholars contributed to its
      development and further understanding. Candidates may discuss how the contributions of these
      Muslim scholars have led to improvements in their respective fields and how this information was
      passed on and used by Western Europe.

      The following could be added for Ibn Sina: known for his contribution to medicine, he wrote
      The Canon of Medicine which was used as a standard of practicing medicine as late as the
      eighteenth century. He was also known for his discovery and treatment of infectious diseases,
      his introduction of a systematic sequence of experimentation in physiology and his description
      and treatment of viral and bacterial diseases. He was the first to assert that tuberculosis was
      infectious and he was the first to document correctly the structure of the inner eye.
      Other contributions include: physics, his theory on motion and optics, philosophy, chemistry,
      astronomy, aromatherapy, etc.

      The following could be added for Ibn Rushd: known for his contributions in the field of
      philosophy, astronomy, psychology, medicine, logic and physics. He criticized and improved on
      many of the works based on Ptolemy, Aristotle and Plato‟s theories, often proving them incorrect.
      He was the first to define and measure force, while in medicine he contributed to the discussion on
      dissection and autopsy.

24.   Evaluate the contribution to medieval European scholarship of one of the following:
      Peter Abelard (1079–1142), Roger Bacon (1220–1292), Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274).

      These individuals all made very significant contributions to medieval European intellectual life.
      They were all churchmen.

      Peter Abelard:
      Abelard was the most skilled logician of his time and was a major figure in the rise
      of scholasticism. This was based on the systematic application of reason to questions of philosophy
      and theology. His most influential work was Sic et Non a series of questions with conflicting
      answers from different authorities. He set out guidelines for comparison, logical scrutiny
      and synthesis. His objective and rigorous dialectical method was the basis of scholasticism.
      He also did important work in ethics which contributed to the development of moral philosophy.
      He applied dialectical skills to theology and was accused of substituting reason for faith.
      His emphasis in debate was for rational argument rather than appeals to a learned authority.

      Roger Bacon:
      An important proponent of medieval science.               Lectured extensively on Aristotle at
      Oxford University. Advanced early scientific thought by advocating mathematics as the paradigm
      for scientific knowledge. He attacked the scholastics as ignorant conservatives. Wrote a number of
      encyclopaedias which advocated studying science based on observation and measurement.
      Described the making of gunpowder but was more an advocate of the scientific method than
      a practitioner. Imprisoned for heresy but his writings were influential. Contributed to the
      development of the fifteenth century renaissance.

      Thomas Aquinas:
      The leading theologian of the Middle Ages. He created a theological system which incorporated
      both Christian and Aristotelian beliefs. This was crucial as Aristotle‟s philosophy had arrived in
      Europe and provided an alternate philosophical system which might replace or undermine
      Christianity. Christianity had to resolve the conflicts between Aristotle‟s views and its own if it
      were to avoid loss of influence. Aquinas created the Thomist synthesis regarded as the most
      important achievement of medieval thought. This continues to influence modern philosophy
      and theology. He was a forward thinker who challenged conservative church ideas and opened the
      door for further scientific inquiry in the medieval period.

Topic 5     Religion and the state

25.   Analyse the reasons for, and impact of, the Sunni/Shia divide.

      Candidates should discuss the basis/origin of the Shia/Sunni split and how it influenced a further
      divide over time; culminating in the Muslim world being ruled by a different Islamic perspective
      at different periods in Islamic history. Showing understanding of the impact of the split and
      relating its effect through the eras and even to the present Muslim world is possible.


26.   For what reasons, and with what results, were there disputes between secular and religious
      leaders in either medieval Europe or the Islamic world?

      Medieval Europe:
      One of the main problems and causes of disputes in medieval Europe was that the boundaries of the
      spiritual and temporal world were often unclear. Churchmen were generally the best educated and
      sometimes the only literate persons, so they were in demand as royal officials and administrators.
      Their loyalty was thus divided. Also emerging monarchies and states did not have a financial
      system for administration, but the monarch usually had the right to appoint to high
      ecclesiastical office, thus royal servants were rewarded, or rather paid, by being given an important
      and lucrative benefice, for example a bishopric. This led to absenteeism and became a matter for
      reform, and popes tried to remove clerical appointments. However the pope was also a
      temporal ruler, and this led to disputes between pope and emperor, as did the claim by both to have
      suzerainty over the other. Finance and taxation and the popes‟ right to excommunicate
      those – usually rulers – who disobeyed papal commands also led to disputes. Famous disputes
      include Henry II of England and Thomas Becket, and the Investiture Contest.

      Islamic world:
      Often in the medieval Islamic world, the office and duty of the spiritual leader and that of the
      secular leader is combined in the form and position of the caliph. However, the caliph may have
      had the absolute power, but there was often the requirement for consultation with high
      ranking officials. The caliph was responsible for the appointment of officials to various important
      positions and this may obviously have made support for decisions relatively easier.
      However, religious institutions, which played a major role in the lives of the people under
      Muslim rule, were separated from military, administrative, financial and other institutions, so as not
      to corrupt responsibility. An example of the “dispute” between the secular leader and the religious
      institution can be seen in the non-committal approach of the Malikite jurists of al-Andalus to the
      call for jihad, against the advancing Christian kingdoms, made by the Berber Almoravids who were
      followers of the Kharijite doctrine of Islam. This attitude was a contributing factor in the success of
      the Reconquista in Spain.
                                                 – 18 –            SPEC/3/HIST1/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


27.   Evaluate the role played by religious institutions in the economic development of
      medieval Europe.

      Candidates need to explain how religious institutions affected the economy, and then evaluate
      their importance. The most important religious institutions for the economy were monasteries.
      They gave alms and food to the poor, refuge to travellers, provided homes for widows and
      unmarried daughters, used their medical and herbal knowledge, and provided employment both to
      servants and agricultural workers. The most important order for the European economy was the
      Cistercian order, as it was a later foundation. Most of the best agricultural land was already
      occupied, so large grants of uncultivated land was given, cleared, and used mainly for
      sheep farming. Cistercian wool was much sought after. Minerals were also extracted. Churches
      and cathedrals were often rich and always needed such items as candles, candlesticks, censers etc.,
      thus they provided employment for craftsmen. Although usury was forbidden by the Church,
      in times of need institutions were allowed to sell some treasure for “loans of consumption”.
      Religious institutions were most important for the development of medieval Europe.
      Without them there would have been much more poverty and unemployment.


28.   Discuss the importance of Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153).

      Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153) was a Cistercian monk, mystic and scholar. He was one of the
      most influential churchmen in twelfth century Europe. His importance lay in the following areas: as
      a monk he founded the Abbey of Clairvaux in 1115, became its first abbot and remained in that
      position until his death, he popularised the Cistercian order, and influenced monastic reform; as a
      theologian, scholar, writer and preacher, he opposed Abelard, but supported other scholars such as
      Peter Lombard, preached and supported the Second Crusade, and supported the Templars; he was
      an adviser, supporter and friend of popes, in spiritual and temporal matters. Bernard was also
      an ascetic, for whom penance was important. His influence touched many people and embraced all
      facets of Christianity.
                                                 – 19 –            SPEC/3/HIST1/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


29.   Compare and contrast anti–Semitism in two of the following countries: England,
      France, Germany.

      Accusations of ritual-murder and the desecration of the Christian Eucharist were the main causes of
      anti-Semitism throughout medieval Europe. The most infamous ritual-murder cases were of
      St William of Norwich (1144) and Little St Hugh of Lincoln (1255) both boys allegedly having
      been murdered by Jews to collect their blood for magical purposes. Similar allegations were made
      in Germany in the later middle ages. The supposed desecration of the Eucharist was another
      common cause of anti-Semitism, an allegation particularly prevalent in late medieval Germany.
      The protected status of Jews as money-lenders, such as in England before 1290, exposed them to
      popular hatred. The calling of the Crusades, from 1095, also heightened anti-Semitism as Jews
      were portrayed as an enemy within Christendom. The advent of the Black Death in Europe in 1348
      was also blamed on the poisoning of wells by Jews.

      These factors led to pogroms of Jews across medieval Europe. Notable instances included the
      massacres of Jews in London and York in 1189–1190, and throughout Germany in 1348. Jews also
      suffered expulsions, as in England in 1290, limitations on where they could live, their economic
      lives, and on their clothing. Jewish communities were repeatedly uprooted and resettled due to
      pogroms, expulsions or the withdrawal of government protection.

      N.B. If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


30.   Examine the role of the ulama (Islamic religious scholars) in Islamic dynastic government and
      administration.

      Candidates need to show an understanding of the concept of the ulama through the periods;
      their role and its development related to the different views shared by Shiaism and Sunnism.
      A distinction needs to be made between government/state, and implementation, judiciary of
      shariah law, as related to the ulama. An awareness of the appointment and independence of the
      ulama from the caliph/dynasty, although, in many instances they are appointed by him.
      The influence and impact of the ulama on government and administration in different periods could
      be discussed and elaborated.

Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide.

      0:    Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no
            evidence of appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported
            generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present
            but the detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely
            understood and there are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge
           is limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may
           be present but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth,
           historical knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is
           narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited argument that requires
           further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
           place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
           processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or
           thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications
           considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be
           present. Events are generally placed in context, and historical processes, such
           as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
           structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply
           summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-
           depth knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary
           are used to indicate some in-depth understanding but is not consistent
           throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of
           historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
           approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is
           present but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the
           demands of the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and
           detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to support critical
           commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing
           events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
           and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
           well developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the
           question and may challenge it successfully.            Knowledge is extensive,
           accurately applied and there may be a high level of conceptual ability.
           Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
           historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
           Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and
           well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Evaluate the impact and importance for Christianity of the life and work of Benedict of Nursia.

     Candidates should be able to give a brief account of Christianity before Benedict, explain his work
     and assess his importance in the development of Christianity, especially as the founder of the
     Benedictine order. Impact and importance should first focus on the period of Benedict’s life, and a
     few years following his death but it could continue throughout the whole medieval period with the
     rule and way of life in Benedictine monasteries, and their influence on later monastic orders.
     Benedict founded his monastery c529 at Monte Cassino, in Italy, and wrote the rule for
     Monte Cassino and other monasteries soon after its foundation. It provided direction for a practical,
     well-balanced communal life, stressing prayer, communal worship, study and manual labour.
     It spread throughout Western Europe, and dominated monasticism until the twelfth century.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the life and work of Benedict.

     [9 to 11 marks] some understanding is shown of impact and importance through a narrative account
     of Benedict’s life and work.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is analysis of Benedict’s importance and impact based on specific evidence
     of his life and work.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension is added, such as perceptive assessment of Christianity before
     and after Benedict’s monastic rule.


2.   In what ways, and with what results, did the actions of one medieval pope affect religious and
     political developments in Europe?

     The three popes named in the History Guide in Section 1 are Gregory VII (1073–1085), Urban II
     (1088–1099), and Innocent III (1198–1216), but any medieval pope that has been studied could
     be used. “In what ways” would cover the chosen pope’s policies and how they were developed to
     control all aspects of religious life for clergy and laity, his position and power as a temporal ruler of
     Rome and the papal states, as well as his claims to suzerainty over lay rulers, and where relevant,
     his attitude to Crusades. “Results” would cover the success of papal policies, and their impact on
     clergy and laity from peasants to kings and emperors.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of one pope and his actions or policies.

     [9 to 11 marks] a narrative of a chosen pope shows some understanding of the effect on religious
     and political developments in Europe.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is balanced analysis of the actions of one pope, how the policies helped to
     develop papal power, and how they affected religious and political developments.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as different interpretations of one pope’s actions and
     their effects.

3.   Examine the factors which led to the establishment of Fatimid rule in North Africa.

     Candidates could mention and elaborate on:
       the situation among the Berber tribes at the time of the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty or
       the period just prior to it
       the fighting for dominance of the region between the main tribes i.e. Aghlabids and the
       Rustimids and how this managed to further divide and gain support of smaller tribes
       the tribes of Ifriqiya were Muslim and not foreign to the concept of the Mahdi – thus they would
       easily have been able to associate and accept the teachings of Abu Abdullah, the Ismaili
       missionary who laid the base for Ubaidullah’s claim as the Mahdi
       the interaction between the Fatimids and the Berber tribes.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the reasons that led to Fatimid rule in North Africa.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is narrative which shows some understanding of the factors that led to Fatimid
     rule in North Africa.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is balanced analysis of the reasons why the Fatimids were able to establish
     their rule in North Africa.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as different interpretations of the factors that led to
     Fatimid rule is present.


4.   Discuss Fatimid ideology and its historical impact on other religions.

     The Fatimid rulers followed the Ismaili branch of Shiaism. Their religious ideology was based on
     the concept of the Ismaili Imamate. They were renowned for practicing religious tolerance and
     received acceptance among the Berber tribes of North Africa during their establishment phase.
     They were able to harness the concept of the imam, together with the support of the tribe
     of Kutama, managed to win over the already Muslim Berbers. After establishing themselves in
     North Africa, they focused on expanding their influence to the West, with the specific aim of
     conquering Egypt. This was achieved during the rule of al-Mu’izz who managed to acquire the
     support of the diverse religious groups in Egypt (Muslims, Christians and Coptics) by allowing
     freedom of religion and not enforcing Ismaili religious conversion on the citizens. Later rulers
     maintained this policy and even appointed many non-Ismaili Muslims and non-Muslims to high
     positions in government based on their ability rather than religious doctrine. (Al-Hakim was one
     ruler who did not practise such a level of tolerance.) The Fatimid ideology allowed them to focus
     on the development of the dynasty and the further establishment of trade links in the Mediterranean
     and the Indian Ocean.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Fatimid ideology and its historical impact on
     other religions.

     [9 to 11 marks] the description of Fatimid ideology and its impact gives evidence of some
     understanding of the question.

     [12 to 17 marks] the answer consists of an analysis of Fatimid ideology and its impact on
     other religions.

     [18 to 20 marks] excellent depth and detail provides an extra dimension.
                                                  –5–              SPEC/3/HIST1/HP3/ENG/TZ0/ME/M


5.   To what extent was William I‟s conquest and rule of England due to force?

     This question has two main requirements, the first is to analyse the significance of William I’s
     military successes, especially his victory at Hastings in 1066 and the destruction of the
     English forces, his subsequent harrying of the north, and his defeat of the earls’ rebellion in 1075.
     The second requirement is to examine the significance of these successes with the other facets of
     his rule. These included the creation of a new ruling elite through the establishment of
     military tenancies, the building of castles, the imposition of taxation and royal law, and the
     intensification of administrative control, e.g. the Domesday Survey. Answers might also consider
     the church’s support for William I.

     It is doubtful whether candidates will consider all of these factors, but the better responses will
     cover several of them, force should be the main focus of the answer.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the part played by force in William I’s conquest and rule
     of England.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is some understanding of the importance of force in William I’s conquest and
     rule of England.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is focused analysis of the importance of force in relation to other methods, in

6.   Discuss the successes and failures of Henry II as king of England, and as ruler of the Angevin
     Commonwealth.

     As King of England and ruler of extensive territories in France, Henry II faced massive demands on
     his time and energies. He successfully established control of the kingdom following the death of
     King Stephen in 1154, and allowed his noblemen to extend English lordship into parts of Wales
     and Ireland. One of his greatest successes was the defeat and capture of William the Lion, King of
     Scots, in 1174, resulting in the end of Scottish rule in Northumbria and submission of the Scottish
     crown to English overlordship. However, his attempts to tighten royal control of the church
     through the Constitutions of Clarendon of 1164 led to the bitter dispute with his Chancellor,
     Archbishop Thomas Becket, resulting in the latter’s exile and eventual murder in 1170. His final
     years were troubled by the combination of his estrangement from his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine,
     the ambitions and rivalries of his sons, and the success of Kings Louis VII and Philip II of France in
     manipulating these difficulties. These challenges imposed a gruelling itinerary, and much of his
     time was spent “fire-fighting”. At the time of his death in 1189, Henry was at war with his own son
     and successor, Richard I.

     Candidates need to analyse at least some of the above to assess successes and failures in order to
     reach an overall conclusion.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Henry II’s rule of England or the Angevin Commonwealth.

     [9 to 11 marks] the narrative account of Henry II’s rule shows some understanding of its successes
     and failures.

7.   “A popular vehicle for spiritual advancement and material gain.” To what extent does this
     quotation explain why Christians took part in the Crusades?

     Candidates should acknowledge that both motives were powerful incentives for the Crusades.

     On the material side, desire for land which was unavailable in Europe especially to younger sons of
     knights and nobles, desire to gain a reputation as a warrior to bolster status or power at home,
     a chance to acquire the wealth of the Islamic Empire, a chance to establish a kingdom or
     principality of one’s own could be included in the material motives. A desire by the Roman
     Catholic Church to establish primacy over the Eastern Orthodox Church was also important.

     On the spiritual side the following could be included: a desire to rescue the holy land from
     the infidel, a continuation of the tradition of pilgrimage, the pope’s grant of salvation to all those
     who participated, religious fervour inspired by inspirational preachers.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge or understanding of why Christians took part in
     the Crusades.

     [9 to 11 marks] the description of motives for taking part in the Crusades shows some
     understanding of spiritual and material reasons.

     Other reasons are briefly and concisely mentioned.

     [18 to 20 marks] another dimension such as pertinent treatment of the quotation is added.


8.   Evaluate the use of jihad by Salah al-Din (Saladin) during the period of the Crusades.

     Candidates need to place the concept and role of jihad into perspective by explaining exactly what it
     means and how it was used by Salah al-Din during the Crusades. Students may also place the
     position of both the Crusades and jihad in perspective and evaluate the impact of other factors
     which could have contributed to the Muslim success and the Crusaders failure. Mention could also
     be made of the success of Salah al-Din as a military leader.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little understanding of jihad or its use by Salah al-Din during the Crusades.

9.    Analyse the reasons for the success of the Mongol invasion of the Islamic world.

      Candidates could focus on two main aspects which contributed to the Mongol success:

         The military strategies and tactics, background and training as well as the philosophy of the
         Mongols as a people. Emphasis should be placed on how these factors contributed to the success
         of the campaigns.
         The situation within the Muslim world at the time of the Mongol invasions and the response of
         the Muslims at the time of the onslaught.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of why the Mongols were successful in their conquests in
      the Islamic world.

      [9 to 11 marks] the narrative/descriptive account shows some understanding of the reasons for
      Mongol success.

      [12 to 17 marks] the reasons for Mongol success addresses both Mongol strength and
      Islamic weakness.

      [18 to 20 marks] excellent depth of analysis based on finely detailed specific evidence could be an
      extra dimension.


10.   Explain the importance of the Battle of „Ayn Jalut.

      Candidates should identify the importance of the battle in terms of it being the first time in the
      Mongol advance that they were defeated and in which they were unable to respond or retaliate.
      Mention should be made of the impact of this battle for both the Mamluks and the Mongols and
      how this could have led to the defeat of the Mongols in other battles to follow; thus emphasizing
      why it is considered a turning point.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the battle.

11.   “The success of the Reconquista in Spain was the result of Muslim weakness rather than
      Christian strength.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The nature of Muslim weakness may be shown through the civil wars which developed after the
      collapse of the Andalusian Caliphate. Muslim states were in a constant state of civil war.
      They hired Christian mercenaries and had to pay them large sums which undermined
      them financially. Muslim states raised taxes which caused discontent. The loss of the city of
      Toledo undermined Muslim morale. Wars between the Almoravids and the Almohads weakened
      the Muslim ability to resist Christian incursions. Some Muslim states allied with Christians to
      maintain their independence.

      Christians were not strong for much of the period as they fought with each other, preferred to trade
      with Muslims rather than fight and accepted bribes to protect Muslim states. Only when their
      disunity was overcome in late twelfth century did they begin to defeat the Muslims. The Crusading
      spirit came to Spain and re-invigorated Christian assaults on Islam. Other reasons for an increase in
      Christian strength may be offered, such as inspirational leaders.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the Reconquista.

      [9 to 11 marks] the descriptive account of the Reconquista gives some understanding of why it
      was successful.

      [12 to 17 marks] Muslim weakness and Christian strength are both analysed in order to explain the
      success of the Reconquista.

      [18 to 20 marks] answers may show a depth of understanding of both sides.


12.   Explain the significance of the contributions made by al-Andalus to the Islamic world between
      the eighth and the twelfth centuries.

      Candidates may include the following in this answer:
        The establishment of the Malikite jurists in al-Andalus and their contribution to Islamic
        religious science.
        The contribution of biographical works and historiographies.
        Poetry and the development of new forms of poetry with its influences from the east and west
        but unique to the poet’s exposure to various influences of al-Andalus (Ibn Zaydun).
        The uniqueness of al-Andalusian art and architecture, its influences and contributions to the
        Islamic world. See the Great Mosque of Cordoba and Madinat al-Zahra as examples.
        Other contributions such as in the field of science, medicine, astronomy, geography, philosophy,
        literature and language, translations, mathematics, etc. could be mentioned.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the contributions of al-Andalus to the Islamic world.

13.   “Stupor Mundi” (Wonder of the World): to what extent did the Emperor Frederick II deserve
      this title?

      The title “Stupor Mundi” should suggest the great impact of the person, power and policies of
      Frederick II (1198–1250), on medieval Europe and beyond. He was crowned King of the Germans
      in 1215 and Holy Roman Emperor in 1220. His reign was dominated by a long struggle with the
      Papacy during which he was twice excommunicated. He led a successful Crusade, devolved power
      on the German princes to obtain their support, and concentrated on building a power base in Sicily.
      He was intellectually, administratively and militarily impressive, but in the end he was facing defeat,
      and left an impossible situation for his heirs.

      [0 to 8 marks] little knowledge is shown on the life and rule of Frederick II.

      [9 to 11 marks] some aspects of Frederick’s life are described, showing signs of his greatness.

      [12 to 17 marks] important areas of Frederick’s rule, policies and battles, as well as his intellect, are
      examined in relation to his title of “Stupor Mundi”.

      [18 to 20 marks] different interpretations of Frederick as “Stupor Mundi” are examined.


14.   Compare and contrast the policies of Louis IX and Philip IV in the development of royal
      power and influence in France.

      Louis IX was King of France between 1226 and 1270, although his mother was regent until 1234;
      Philip IV reigned from 1285 to 1314. Both kings were regarded as successful monarchs, continued
      to increase and exercise royal authority, and raised the profile of France. But they were very
      different monarchs, and candidates will probably find more to contrast. Louis IX was
      very religious, and was canonized after his death. He was highly regarded by the Papacy, a patron
      of religious institutions and a builder of churches. He went on two Crusades, and died on the
      second one. Philip IV taxed the clergy, persecuted the Templars and confiscated their wealth,
      opposed Pope Boniface VIII, and was responsible, at least in part, for the Avignon Papacy.
      Their foreign policies also differed: Louis sought peace and reconciliation, and was highly regarded
      as a conciliator in Europe. Philip IV engaged in wars, including one with England (1294–1303),
      and with Flanders (1302–1304).

      [0 to 8 marks] little is known about Louis IX or Philip IV, and/or they are not compared
      and contrasted.

      [12 to 17 marks] the contributions and success of the two kings in developing royal power in
      France are analysed in a clear, balanced comparative structure.

15.   Discuss the final phase of the Hundred Years War between England and France (1415–1453).

      The long-term goals of the English crown for the recovery of French territories – including
      Normandy and most of Aquitaine – lost over the previous two centuries, lay at the heart of the
      resumption of fighting in the final phase of the Hundred Years War. Henry V’s sustained conquest
      of Normandy in the period 1417–1421 confirms the recovery of that duchy as one of his
      prime aims. The resumption of fighting also needs to be seen in the context of the civil war that had
      been raging between the Orléanist and Burgundian factions in France during the mental incapacity
      of King Charles VI. The murder of Duke John the Fearless in 1419, and the determination of the
      Burgundians to avenge his death through the debarring of the Dauphin from the royal succession,
      opened up the prospect of Henry V acquiring the French crown through his marriage to Katherine,
      daughter of Charles VI. Historians continue to disagree as to whether becoming King of France had
      been an initial war aim of Henry V, or whether he was exploiting circumstances that arose
      following his invasion.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the final phase of the Hundred Years War.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a narrative of some causes of final phase of the Hundred Years War,
      which shows some understanding of the situation.

      [18 to 20 marks] there is an extra dimension such as perceptive treatment of the causes.

16.   Examine the political crises faced by either one English king or one French king between 1300
      and 1485.

      Candidates may choose from a broad range of French or English kings. Obvious examples of
      English kings facing political difficulties include Edward II and Richard II for their
      foreign policies, relations with favourites, unjust financial policies and the persecution of their
      opponents; also Henry IV, Edward IV, Richard III and Henry VII on the grounds of their weak titles
      to rule, and opposition arising from this. Candidates might also consider the range of personal,
      governmental and foreign policy failings under Henry VI, which led to both popular insurrection
      and a dynastic challenge.

      From the French kings, candidates might choose Charles V, who faced crises resulting from
      mercenary bands of soldiers and the popular resistance “Jacquerie” that they provoked, as well as
      the revolt of Etienne Marcel, Provost of the Merchants. The reign of Charles VI witnessed
      significant internal consequences, largely as a result of his mental incapacity, which was exploited
      by his brother, the Duke of Orléans, and his uncle, the Duke of Burgundy. The assassinations
      of Orléans in 1407, and of John of Burgundy in 1420, marked the descent of France into civil war,
      which was exploited by Henry V of England. The reign of Louis XI of France was also marked by
      internal political conflict, notably the War of the Public Weal, which pitted the king against
      his brother, Charles of Berri. Louis XI’s later years were dominated by his rivalry with
      Charles the Rash, Duke of Burgundy, whose death in battle in 1477 resulted in a strengthening of
      the power of the French crown.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of political crises faced by one English or French king.

      [9 to 11 marks] the political crises of one English or French king are described, and some

17.   “Although most contemporary accounts of the Black Death are exaggerated, the plague
      caused universal bewilderment and terror.” To what extent do you agree with this assertion?

      Contemporary accounts reveal the strongly religious response to the Black Death, and the belief that
      it was divine punishment for social evils. Religious responses ranged from the extreme, such as
      flagellant movements, to reflective, such as the growing belief in purgatory and prayers for
      the dead. Candidates might also focus on other explanations, whether political, astronomical
      and environmental. Candidates might also note that while terror and bewilderment were common,
      medical treatises show that efforts were made to understand the plague using rudimentary
      scientific ideas. Efforts were also made to clean cities and limit pollution from human and
      animal waste. Survivors often exploited changed conditions to draw economic benefits from the
      scarcity of labour.

      Candidates are not expected to analyse all of these responses but the better answers will
      address several.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the effects of the Black Death.

18.   Analyse the causes of popular insurrection in fourteenth century Western Europe.

      Candidates might be expected to analyse a range of causes – economic, social, political
      and military. Economic and social causes were very important. The increasing value of labour
      after the Black Death was met with official attempts to impose maximum wage restraints in 1349
      and 1350. Those seeking higher wages or attempting to migrate internally were vulnerable to
      prosecution by royal commissions. The continuing practice of serfdom remained an issue,
      as tenants holding land in this way were often liable to costly financial and labour dues. There is
      some evidence that radical preachers such as John Ball used egalitarian arguments to
      stimulate insurrection. The three poll taxes of 1377, 1379 and 1380, and the aggressive methods
      used to enforce their collection, were also key shorter term causes of the revolt. The unpopularity
      of taxation was part of broader popular resentment against bad government, especially in London,
      and perceptions of excessive power enjoyed by the King’s Uncle, John of Gaunt. England was also
      losing the war with France – resulting in failed expeditions, un-paid soldiers, and Franco-Castilian
      attacks on England’s southern coastline.

      Candidates are not expected to analyse all of these causes, but the better answers will
      address several.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the 1381 popular insurrection in England.

19.   Compare and contrast the effects of Ottoman conquest on two countries which can be either
      Christian or Islamic or one of each.

      The fall of Constantinople in 1453 marked the significant extension of Ottoman power. Mehmet II
      also succeeded in making the Khanate of the Crimea into a vassal state, and by his death in 1481 he
      controlled the Black Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean, while his armies were active in Egypt and
      Southern Italy. Bayezid II’s failure to defeat the Mamluks in 1485–1491 revealed the limitations of
      Ottoman military power. Moreover, the enduring strength of the Safavid Persian state, and the
      potential for rebellion among the Sultan’s Shi’ite subjects, highlighted the tensions that
      accompanied the military expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The exploitation of territories for
      slaves, commodities and usual resources aroused opposition, but also impelled further expansion.
      The widespread use of the devshirme system for conscripting boys into civil and military service
      extended the reach of Ottoman power across the conquered territories. Throughout this period the
      Janissaries were a significant force in the political and military structure of the Ottoman state.

      Candidates are not expected to analyse all of these topics, but the better answers will
      mention several.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of how the Ottoman conquests affected the government of
      their empire.

      [9 to 11 marks] a description of Ottoman conquests shows some understanding of how they

      in their empire is perceptively analysed, and focused.

20.   Compare and contrast the policies of two of the following: Mehmet II, Selim I and
      Suleiman the Magnificent.

      Both Selim I and his son, Suleiman the Magnificent, continued the military expansion of the
      Ottoman Empire. Selim enforced religious orthodoxy and tried to destroy the followers of Shah
      Ismai’l in 1514. The main focus of Selim I’s campaigning was firstly in Anatolia where he gained
      mastery of the Turcoman and Kurdish peoples in 1516, and secondly against the Mamluks, whom
      he considered to be heretics. In addition to the Holy Cities, he also conquered Egypt,
      Syria and Palestine. His son, Suleiman the Magnificent, successfully exploited the divisions among
      the European princes in order to expand Ottoman rule to the west. The Habsburgs were his
      main enemy, and he manipulated the rivalry between Charles V and Francis I, and the internal
      difficulties of the Habsburg Empire, to conquer Belgrade in 1521 and Hungary in 1526. He had no
      religious scruples about allying with Francis I in 1531, and following the division of Europe in
      the Reformation, he assisted the Protestants against the Catholic and Habsburg forces.
      During Suleiman’s lifetime, the Ottomans became the dominant naval power in the eastern
      Mediterranean, diminishing the economic and political power of the Italian states.

      Mehmet II can be compared to either Selim I or Suleiman the Magnificent on the following basis:
        Mehmet II’s rule is known for the continued expansion and the conquest of Constantinople
        (1453) and the downfall and end of the Byzantine Empire.
        He focused on Anatolia and also managed to gain control over other Turkish states. He was
        involved in battles such as Battle of Otlukbeli, in which the Ottomans gained a decisive victory.
        Mehmet II advanced and captured Belgrade (1456) and part of Italy (1480), with the intention of
        capturing Rome and to re-unify the whole of the Roman Empire.
        Militarily, Mehmet II was a force to be dealt with as he employed the latest technology of the
        period which made his advance effective and successful.
        He was religiously tolerant towards those conquered, and even appointed former patriarchs as
        governors, which gave the conquered citizens some sort of autonomous rule.
        He founded many universities and colleges, built mosques (Fatih Mosque) and the
        Topkapi Palace and promoted science and art.
        It was during his reign that the Ottomans nearly conquered much of Europe.

21.   Why were Italian cities powerful, prosperous and progressive in the late middle ages?

      There is a wide range of evidence to include in answers to this question. Some of the most
      important reasons might include: their geographic location and lack of resources encouraged them
      to develop industry, shipping and trade networks from an early period. Their location gave them
      access to the markets of the Mediterranean and central Europe. This produced great wealth.
      They also maintained trade links with the Byzantine Empire, which gave them access to oriental
      goods e.g. spices. They made huge profits in shipping and trade during the Crusades and developed
      trade with the Islamic Empire, which added further wealth. Their development of banking gave
      them wealth and political influence with many governments. Their city governments were not
      feudal and were free from many medieval regulations. The commercial classes had a high status,
      which added to their progressive atmosphere. Their connections to Roman culture and scholarship
      led to the founding of universities and the development of art and culture which their great wealth
      was able to support beyond any other part of Europe.

      In general their great commercial wealth allowed them to develop sophisticated, progressive,
      urban societies. However candidates can challenge the question, pointing to cities (especially in
      the south), that were not powerful, prosperous and progressive; as well as denying that the cities in
      the north retained these attributes.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of why Italian cities were so powerful, prosperous
      and progressive.

      [9 to 11 marks] some indication of the wealth and importance of Italian cities is implicit in the
      description of two or three cities, or a generalized account of the features of several cities.

      [12 to 17 marks] reasons for the power, prosperity and progressive nature of Italian cities are
      analysed in a thematically structured answer.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as in depth analysis of detailed specific knowledge raises
      the answer to the top band.

22.   Analyse the impact of either Ludovico Sforza or Lorenzo de Medici on the political and
      artistic development of his state.

      Ludovico Sforza (c1452–1508) usurped the Milanese government in 1480 from his nephew after
      acting as regent for him. In his search for domination among Italian city states, he helped
      Charles VIII to invade Naples, but was driven out of the duchy of Milan by Louis II of France,
      in 1499, and died as a prisoner in France. His ambition to also dominate Italian art was
      more successful. He and his wife attracted artists, poets, writers, architects and musicians, etc. to
      their brilliant court. His artistic ambition reached its culmination in his patronage of
      Leonardo da Vinci.

      Lorenzo de Medici (1449–1492) became joint ruler of Florence with his brother Giuliano in 1469.
      In 1478 the brothers became the target of a plot organized by the rival Pazzi family and the Pope.
      Giuliano was killed, and Lorenzo became the successful but autocratic ruler of one of the strongest
      Italian states, and one of the most artistic ones. His second son became Pope Leo X. Lorenzo was
      a writer and a great collector of art and antiquities, and the first patron of Michelangelo.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the political or artistic development of the chosen state.

      [9 to 11 marks] a narrative account of the chosen ruler suggests some understanding of political and
      artistic development.

      [12 to 17 marks] political and artistic development in either Milan under Ludovico Sforza or
      Florence under Lorenzo de Medici is clearly examined and analysed in a focused structure.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as different interpretations of the state and its ruler
      is present.


23.   Why was patronage an important factor in European overseas exploration between
      1400 and 1550?

      The increasing wealth and secularization of western society combined with new technological and
      scientific advances in ship-building and navigation, led to the growth of long-distance
      overseas travel. It also coincided with nationalism and centralization of western European states,
      and the knowledge that prestige and wealth could be obtained by overseas exploration trade
      and settlement. Both the expense of outfitting ships for long-distance travel, and the desire of
      monarchs and merchants for gain, led to involvement and patronage. Some of the most well known
      patrons of explorers were Henry the Navigator of Portugal, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain,
      and Henry VII of England.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of why patronage was important for overseas exploration,
      1400–1550.

      [9 to 11 marks] descriptions of patrons and patronage for exploration show some understanding of
      its importance.

      [12 to 17 marks] reasons for the importance of patronage for overseas exploration are evaluated in a
      focused and structured answer.

      [18 to 20 marks] different interpretations of patronage, and the reasons for it, are analysed in depth.

24.   Analyse the importance of ship-building, cartography and navigation on travel and
      exploration between 1400 and 1550.

      Travel and exploration in and from Europe and the Islamic world increased considerably between
      1400 and 1550. The use of the astrolabe, and later the compass, enabled mariners to navigate over
      great distances, such as from the Mediterranean to the North Sea. Developments in ship design,
      especially the Portuguese caravel, opened up new and more distant trade routes from the middle of
      the fifteenth century. The increasing use of the carrack, with multiple masts and sails,
      enabled explorers to travel over much greater distances. The voyages of Henry the Navigator in the
      fifteenth century resulted in the extensive mapping of Africa’s coastlines. The expeditions
      of Columbus, Magellan, Vespucci and da Gama stimulated a major interest in cartography.
      Illustrations that were more artistic than detailed in chronicles and travellers’ guides were
      superseded by scaled and systematic projections by cartographers such as Martin Waldseemüller
      and Gerardus Mercator, which could be replicated en masse through printing. Intensive exploration
      by Spanish and Portuguese mariners, combined with the imperial ambitions of their monarchs,
      resulted in their domination over the New World in the first half of the sixteenth century.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of ship-building, cartography and navigation.

      [9 to 11 marks] narrative of some explorers and their voyages shows some understanding of the
      importance of ship-building, cartography and navigation.

      [12 to 17 marks] the importance of the above factors are analysed in depth.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as perceptive appreciation of the above for ship-building
      are examined for different interpretations.
