Prescribed Subject 1       Peacemaking, peacekeeping – international relations 1918–36

These sources relate to the Locarno Conference, 1925.

SOURCE A	               Extract from a speech by Gustav Stresemann after the signing of the Locarno Treaty,
                        16 October 1925.
                        URL: http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERstresemann.htm

We have undertaken the responsibility of initialling the treaties because we live in the belief that only
by peaceful cooperation of states and peoples can that development be secured, which is nowhere more
important than for that great civilized land of Europe whose peoples have suffered so bitterly in the years
that lie behind us. We have more especially undertaken it because we are justified in the confidence that
the political effects of the treaties will prove to our particular advantage, in relieving the conditions of our
political life. But great as is the importance of the agreements that are signed here, the treaties of Locarno
will only achieve their profoundest importance in the development of the nations if Locarno is not to be the
end, but the beginning of confident cooperation among the nations.


SOURCE B                Extract from a speech by James Maxwell Garnett to the Empire Club of Canada,
                        26 November 1925. Garnett was the Secretary of League of Nations’ Union of
                        Great Britain.

But while the Locarno treaties have increased security along the frontier they have added considerably to
general security among the nations, I want you to reflect what this means. Every nation in Europe can feel
that not only the British Foreign Secretary and the French Foreign Office, but the German Foreign Minister
too, will be present within a few hours to quench the smouldering fires of war wherever they appear in the
future. Then, after disarmament and security and arbitration, the Locarno agreements are largely concerned
with the provision of means for a peaceful settlement of international disputes between Germany and her
enemy neighbours … We think that Locarno, reinforced by Geneva, gives us good means for believing
that we are not now far from agreements between governments to get rid of war – that is to say, nearly all
agreements except the Soviet Republics, United States of America, and Mexico and Turkey.

Locarno represented a defeat for those in France who had hoped for a revived alliance with Great Britain.
Along with Italy, Britain had guaranteed a frontier rather than an ally, and henceforth was, in theory
at least, committed as much to Germany as to France and Belgium. The obligation to give immediate
military assistance in the event of a “flagrant” [serious] violation of the treaty was also both ambiguous
in its wording and likely to be impracticable in its application. As had already been evident before 1914,
the speed of modern warfare had made joint contingency planning an essential prerequisite [requirement]
for the rendering of such aid. This was a point that Poincaré had made during the discussions for an
Anglo‑French guarantee treaty in 1922. But Locarno seemed to preclude [make impossible] any joint
military talks between Britain and France. After all, if the British military authorities engaged in planning
with their opposite numbers in France, the Germans might quite reasonably claim that they had an equal
right to be consulted. Yet for Britain to join in bilateral [two-way] discussions with both powers with a view
to assisting either in the event of a Franco-German war would clearly be ludicrous [ridiculous].

Stresemann’s initiative was therefore successful, but his difficulties were just beginning. In the negotiations
that resulted, in October 1925, in the conclusion of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee [Locarno], by which the
states bordering on the Rhine abjured [gave up] the use of force in their mutual relations and, together with
Britain and Italy, guaranteed the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the existing western frontiers, and
in the parallel negotiations agreed upon on the terms for Germany’s admission to the League of Nations.
Stresemann’s view was that the Rhineland Pact and Germany’s willingness to enter the League were positive
contributions to European security and that their logical consequence should be the evacuation of the whole
of the Rhineland before 1930, the date set by the treaty.

Prescribed Subject 2       The Arab-Israeli conflict 1945–79

These sources relate to the Suez Crisis of 1956.

SOURCE A	               Extract from a telegram from British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to American
                        President Dwight Eisenhower, 5 August 1956. Taken from The Suez Crisis
                        by Anthony Gorst, London, 1997.

Nasser has embarked [started] on a course which is unpleasantly familiar. His seizure of the Canal was
undoubtedly designed to impress opinion not only in Egypt but in the Arab world and in all of Africa too.
By this assertion of his power he seeks to further his ambitions from Morocco to the Persian Gulf …

I have never thought Nasser a Hitler, he has no warlike people behind him. But the parallel with Mussolini
is close. Neither of us can forget the lives and treasure he cost before he was finally dealt with.

The removal of Nasser and the installation in Egypt of a regime less hostile to the West must therefore, also,
rank high among our objectives. Moreover, if Nasser is compelled to disgorge his spoils, it is improbable
that he will be able to maintain his internal position. We should therefore have achieved our secondary
objective.


SOURCE B                President Eisenhower cautions Prime Minister Eden against the use of force,
                        3 September 1956. Taken from The Suez Crisis by Anthony Gorst, London, 1997.

I must tell you frankly that American public opinion flatly rejects the thought of using force, particularly
when it does not seem that every possible peaceful means of protecting interests has been exhausted
without result. I really do not see how a successful result could be achieved by forcible means. The use
of force would, it seems to me, vastly increase the area of jeopardy [danger]. Also, the peoples of the
Near East and North Africa and, to some extent, of all of Asia and Africa would be consolidated against
the West to a degree which, I fear, could not be overcome in a generation, particularly having in mind the
capacity of the Russians to make mischief.

One week has passed already since the armed forces of Britain, France and – obedient to the will of external
forces – Israel, without any reason attacked Egypt. Inhuman bombardment by the British and French
against Egyptian airfields, ports, installations and towns is taking place. Anglo-French troops have landed
on Egyptian territory.

An aggressive war against Egypt, against the Arab peoples, whose sole fault is that they upheld their
freedom and independence, is unfolding before the eyes of the world. The situation in Egypt calls for
immediate action on the part of the UN. In the event such action is not undertaken, the UN will lose
prestige and fall apart.

The Soviet Union and the United States are permanent members of the Security Council and the two
great powers which possess all modern types of arms, including atomic and hydrogen weapons. We bear
particular responsibility for stopping war and re-establishing peace in the Middle East.

The aggression against Egypt has not been committed for the sake of free navigation along the Suez Canal,
which was safeguarded. The piratical war was launched with the aim of restoring colonial order in the East,
an order which had been overthrown by the people. If this war is not stopped, it carries the danger of
turning into a third world war.

In October the crisis took a new turn, unexpected by the United States. Unknown to American officials,
France and Britain colluded [secretly cooperated] with Israel in an elaborate scheme to launch a secretly
coordinated war on Egypt. Under the ruse [deception], Israel would invade the Sinai Peninsula, Britain
and France would issue ultimatums ordering Egyptian and Israeli troops to withdraw from the Suez Canal
Zone, and when Nasser (as expected) rejected the ultimatums, the European powers would bomb Egyptian
airfields within 48 hours, occupy the Canal Zone and depose Nasser. American officials failed to anticipate
the collusion scheme, in part because they were distracted by a war scare between Israel and Jordan as well
as by anti-Soviet unrest in Hungary, in part because they were preoccupied by the impending US presidential
election, and in part because they believed the denials of their friends in the colluding governments who
assured them that no attack was imminent. Yet war erupted on October 29 when Israel launched a frontal
assault on Egyptian forces in the Sinai. Within days Israeli forces approached the Suez Canal.

Prescribed Subject 3       Communism in crisis 1976–89

These sources relate to the defeat of the Gang of Four and the re-emergence of Deng Xiaoping
(Teng Hsiao-p’ing).

SOURCE A                Extract from Modern China by Edwin E Moise, London, 1994.

Zhou Enlai died in January 1976. He quickly became a greater symbol of resistance to radical policies than
he had ever been in life. His enemies on the left, the Gang of Four, cut the mourning ceremonies to only
a few days, but later many cities saw public demonstrations in honour of Zhou’s memory. Some of these
included attacks on leftists, including one held in Tiananmen, in the centre of Beijing, on the traditional
festival for the dead, Qing Ming. Thousands of people brought wreaths for Zhou, many with political
poems attached, and presented them at the Monument to the Heroes of the People. When radicals removed
the wreaths, the demonstration became a riot. The radicals blamed Deng Xiaoping, and he was purged for
a second time.

The position of the Gang of Four was secure only as long as Mao was available to support them …

Mao died in September 1976. The Gang of Four were under arrest in less than a month. There were two
main factions among the winners of the struggle. One was the less extreme Maoists who wished to preserve
many of Mao’s policies but understood the need to cooperate with more conservative elements. The other
main group was made up of right-wing leaders, including Deng.


SOURCE B                Extract from an official broadcast in Tiananmen Square by the Mayor of
                        Beijing, 5 April 1976, taken from China since 1919: Revolution and Reform
                        by Alan Lawrance, London, 2004.

A handful of bad elements have, for ulterior motives, made use of the Qing Ming festival to create a political
incident, directing their spearhead at Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in a vain attempt to
change the direction of the struggle to criticise the unrepentant revisionist line of the capitalist‑roader,
Deng Xiaoping.

Revolutionary masses and cadres of Beijing must support the class struggle and act to defend Chairman
Mao and the Party Central Committee …

Today there are bad elements carrying out disruption and engaging in counter-revolutionary sabotage in
Tiananmen Square. Revolutionary masses must leave the square at once, and not be duped by them.

SOURCE D                Extract from a speech taken from The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,

                        of agriculture, industry, defence, science and technology.

We have waged a bitter struggle against the Gang of Four over the question of whether the four modernizations
are needed or not. The Gang made the senseless statement that “the day the four modernizations programme
is realized will mark the day of capitalist restoration”. Their sabotage (of modernization) brought the
Chinese economy to the brink of collapse. Their misdeeds make us realise that even though we have a
dictatorship of the proletariat, unless we modernize, raise our scientific and technological level, develop
industry and agriculture, and thus strengthen our country, and improve the material and cultural life of our
people, there can be no guarantee of China’s security.

On 6 October 1976, under orders from Hua Guofeng, the palace guard unit of the People’s Liberation
Army arrested all four in a moment of drama rare even by the standard of China’s history. The four were
denounced, accused of numerous crimes and vilified in a flood of anti-Gang propaganda that struck deep
chords among a population brutalised and exhausted by events of the preceding decade. As the campaign
unfolded, Deng Xiaoping, one of the Gang’s chief foes, gained the upper hand …

At the close of 1980, members of the Gang, their faces pale in the glare of the television lights, were placed
in the dock and presented with evidence of their crimes. Together with their accomplices, they were said to
have persecuted more than 700 000 people, almost 35 000 of whom had died as a result.

Prescribed Subject 1        Peacemaking, peacekeeping – international relations 1918–36

These questions relate to the Locarno Conference, 1925.

1.   (a)   What, according to Source E, was the significance of the Locarno Conference?      [3 marks]

              Countries bordering the Rhine would give up the use of force.
              The Rhineland would be demilitarized and the whole of the Rhineland would be evacuated
              by 1930.
              Germany would be admitted into the League of Nations.
              European security would be ensured.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What message is conveyed by Source D?                                             [2 marks]

              The leaders of France, Britain and Germany are standing on a draft of the Locarno Treaty
              and their handshake indicates that Germany has been welcomed back into the fold
              of Europe.
              However, the expressions on the face of Britain and Germany, which indicate the serious
              nature of the agreement, contrast with the sly smile on the face of Briand who, with a
              boxing glove behind his back, is indicating that he hopes that France will be able to use
              force at a later date.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     N.B. Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
     final mark out of [5 marks].


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed about the Locarno Conference in
     Sources B and C.                                                         [6 marks]

     For comparison:
       they both discuss the securing of a frontier or border
       they both discuss the roles of Britain, Germany and France.

     For contrast:
       Source C mentions the roles of Italy and Belgium
       Source B is very optimistic, whereas Source C is far more pessimistic
       Source B sees Britain, Germany and France as cooperating together, whereas Source C maintains
       that Locarno will have the opposite effect
       Source B mentions the effect of Locarno on countries outside of Europe, Source C does not.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed
     separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks]
     expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
     Source A and Source C for historians studying the 1925 Locarno Conference.       [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        A speech by Gustav Stresemann, the German Foreign Minister, on 16 October 1925.

     Purpose:       To explain to the world community the reasons why Germany has signed the
                    Locarno Treaty.

     Value:         It’s recorded at the time it was made and shows the views of a representative of the
                    German government, who signed the Locarno Treaty. This speech should be seen as
                    being representative of the German government’s public position at this point
                    in time.

     Limitations:   It is a speech, which is explaining why Germany wishes to be welcomed back into
                    the world community, but may merely be a justification to the world as to why
                    Germany should be accepted back after its treatment in the Treaty of Versailles.
                    The speech can not necessarily be accepted at face value as there may be ulterior
                    reasons behind the German government’s signing of the Locarno Treaty.

     Source C
     Origin:        It is an extract from the Official History of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
                    published in 2006.

     Purpose:       To give an account of the reactions to the signing of the Locarno Treaty from the
                    British government’s point of view.

     Value:         It will have access to all the official papers and documents, which relate to the
                    signing of the Locarno Treaty and is written with the benefit of hindsight. It will
                    give the official British government’s view on Locarno.

     Limitations:   It is an official history and therefore may not be totally objective. It has been written
                    in 2006 and is a compilation of other material, which means that a selection process
                    has taken place, which may have omitted other details. It is not written by any single
                    person, or there is no way of determining this.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance between
     the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 mark] split. If only
     one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] candidates must refer to
     both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using these sources and your own knowledge, analyse the importance of the
     Locarno Conference for international relations between 1925 and 1936.     [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A: Clearly indicates that Germany is willing to work together with other European nations
               and will do so in the future. It shows a change in government policy.

     Source B: Indicates the viewpoint of someone supportive of the League of Nations who regards
               the signing of the Locarno Treaty as a major step forward to world peace through
               disarmament by all nations.

     Source C: Warns that, despite the optimistic claims for Locarno of guaranteeing the Rhineland
               frontier through an agreement signed by Belgium, Italy, France, Germany and Britain,
               it sowed the seeds for later disagreements and split the alliance between Britain
               and France.

     Source D: Clearly shows the intention, by France, not to abide by the Locarno Treaties in the future.

     Source E: Shows how the Rhineland frontier was to be guaranteed and demilitarized, as a result of
               which Germany would be admitted into the League of Nations. It also shows that
               Locarno was seen as the basis for the beginning of European security.

     Own knowledge that could be used:
     Own knowledge could include the signing of the Kellog-Briand Treaty of 1928, and the effect that
     the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee had on Europe through the “Locarno Honeymoon”. Mention could
     also be made of the effect of the rise to power of Hitler on Europe with regard to Versailles,
     the Geneva Disarmament Conference, the Four Power Pact, the Stresa Conference, Abyssinia,
     Mussolini’s change of sides to support Hitler after the Hoare-Laval incident, the invasion of the
     Rhineland, the Spanish Civil War and the Rome-Berlin Axis.

     Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only own
     knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a maximum
     [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
     to the sources used.

Prescribed Subject 2         The Arab-Israeli conflict 1945–79

These questions relate to the Suez Crisis of 1956.

5.   (a)   What, according to Source A, were the aims of Nasser in seizing the canal?         [3 marks]

           Eden identifies Nasser’s aims as being:
             to impress opinion in Egypt and the Arab world and all Africa
             to further his ambitions from Morocco to the Persian Gulf
             to increase his credentials as an Arab nationalist.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What message is conveyed by the political cartoon in Source D?                     [2 marks]

           A British cartoon showing the three Western leaders as archaeologists opening an Egyptian
           mummy labelled Nasser. Eden and Mollet are dressed in an army uniform and that of a
           gendarme (policeman), with US President Eisenhower looking on more as an observer.
           Soviet leader Khrushchev is inside the sarcophagus carrying a sub-machine gun with hand
           grenades and other weaponry around him. The message of the cartoon is that the Soviets
           were hidden from view and stirring up Nasser in confronting the West.

           The Western allies – or at least Britain and France – were united in acting in Egypt.
           Perhaps Eisenhower’s civilian clothing and position in the cartoon suggests a slight distance
           from the others?

           Note the date of the cartoon is one week after the Anglo-French military invasion of the Suez
           Canal Zone during which time the Soviets had threatened action.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     N.B. Do not enter half marks or + and – but compensate between (a) and (b) if necessary for a
     final mark out of [5 marks].

6.   Compare and contrast the views about the impact of Nasser’s taking the canal and
     the reaction to it expressed in Sources B and C.                                 [6 marks]

     For comparison:
       both Sources B and C are hostile to the use of force as a solution
       both see the use of force as increasing the dangers of widening the war, “vastly increase the area
       of jeopardy” (Source B) and “carries the danger of turning into a third world war” (Source C).

     For contrast:
       the use of force would, according to Source B, increase the dangers in the area and would unite
       the Near East, Africa and Asia against the West; whereas Source C sees it as having a
       detrimental impact on the prestige of the UN
       Source B sees the need for every possible peaceful means of protecting interests to be exhausted
       before force is resorted to. Source C sees war launched with the aim of restoring the
       colonial order
       Source C sees the need for reaction from the USSR and the USA, whereas Source B sees the
       opportunity for the USSR to “make mischief” in the area.

     If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed
     separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks]
     expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

7.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
     Source C and Source D for historians studying the reasons for the conflict in the
     Middle East.                                                                      [6 marks]

     Source C
     Origins:       A Soviet document from one of the members of the Politburo to US President
                    Eisenhower.

     Purpose:       To condemn the actions of the Western allies of the USA; to remind the USA
                    that they, and the USSR, are responsible and permanent members of the UN
                    Security Council; and to warn of the danger of the conflict spreading into a third
                    world war. There is implicit threat in the language and the reminder that both the
                    USSR and the USA possess “atomic and hydrogen weapons”.

     Value:         No indication of it being a private message and therefore secret. High value in the
                    source – a high ranking member of the Soviet government and indicating possible
                    action which could be taken.

     Limitations:   Translation from an original probably; if made for public viewing, then of less value
                    in that it takes an aggressive stance by the Soviet government to show the world their
                    support for colonial struggles for independence.

     Source D
     Origins:       Source D is a political cartoon from a British newspaper the Evening Standard dated
                    November 12 1956.

     Purpose:       The aim of the cartoonist was to suggest that behind Nasser’s actions lies
                    Khrushchev and the USSR, stirring up trouble and spreading the Cold War in the
                    Middle East.

     Value:         Shows the position of a British cartoonist at the time and probably reflects the
                    majority opinion of the British government and public.

     Limitations:   The cartoon is possibly the cartoonist’s view and may not reflect the government’s
                    position or that of public opinion. It is dated one week after the withdrawal of the
                    British and French from Suez and may be seeking to shift the blame onto the Soviets
                    for causing the crisis to begin with.

     Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance between
     the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 mark] split. If only
     one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] candidates must refer to
     both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

8.   Using these sources and your own knowledge, to what extent do you agree with the
     view that Israel and the West bear the largest responsibility for the conflict
     in 1956?                                                                         [8 marks]

     Source material that could be used:
     Source A: Eden blames Nasser and Egypt for seizure of the Suez Canal in a move designed to
               impress the region and the world. The West must react – can’t appease as the West did
               before the Second World War. Not West’s fault – reacting to events.

     Source B: Eisenhower rejects the use of force – must use “every possible peaceful means” to
               protect interests. Warns that if force is used, it will be detrimental, but implicit
               recognition of responsibility here.

     Source C: Clear recognition that the armed forces of Britain, France and Israel have attacked
               Egypt and thus bear responsibility for the conflict. “Aggressive war”; the term “war” is
               mentioned five times in the extract.

     Source D: Western cartoon – shows that the Soviets were behind Nasser’s actions, armed and
               dangerous; so the West was not responsible.

     Source E: Clear indication of covert preparation for conflict, following Nasser’s taking of the
               Canal Zone. Israel to begin hostilities, Western powers France and Britain to intervene
               and temporarily occupy Canal Zone. US officials were misled by many other issues.

     Own knowledge that could be used:
     Candidates should be able to indicate that foreign powers were involved right from the start in the
     creation of the state of Israel, eight years earlier, in 1948. The origins of the conflict in 1956 can be
     traced back to the result of the division of Palestine and the creation of Israel in 1948, the result of
     the war in that year, and the expulsion of the Palestinians. Pro-Arab viewpoints could see both
     Israel and the Western powers as therefore causing the conflict from 1948 onwards.

        Cancellation of Aswan High Dam loans by World Bank; Dulles forced Egypt to seek solution to
        problem thus nationalizing the Suez Canal.
        The launching of the war on October 29 by the Israeli forces is clearly seen as pre-planned and
        sponsored by Western powers in Source D. The quick response and launching of attacks by the
        British and French from Cyprus, Malta and the French fleet clearly show that the plan to attack
        and occupy the Suez Canal was planned, therefore making the West and Israel responsible.
        Alternatively, one might argue that Nasser’s seizure of the Canal Zone in July 1956 precipitated
        the crisis and that without this, conflict may not have occurred.
        The recognition by Egypt of the People’s Republic of China – drift towards Communist camp.
        The establishment of relations with the USSR and the buying of weapons from the Soviets
        (Czechs, in Sept 1955) alienated the West and they were obliged to respond.
        Continued raids by Fedayeen into Israeli territory are blamed on Egypt.
        Signing of military agreements amongst Arab states against Israel provoked Israel into action to
        defend itself.
        Nasser’s refusal to accept the Suez Canal Zone international supervision proposal in September 1956.

     Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only own
     knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a maximum
     [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
     to the sources used.

These questions relate to the defeat of the Gang of Four and the re-emergence of Deng Xiaoping
(Teng Hsiao-p’ing).

9.    (a)   What, according to Source A, was the significance of the demonstration at

              It was to honour Zhou Enlai, who had died.
              It was to protest against the cutting short of his mourning ceremonies.
              It was to express opposition to the Gang of Four.

            Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

      (b)   What message is conveyed by Source C?                                               [2 marks]

              The actions of the children suggest that they are carrying out the instructions to defeat
              the Gang of Four.
              The expressions on the faces of the children suggest that they are determined to rid China of
              an evil.

      For comparison:
        both suggest that the Gang of Four committed crimes, misdeeds in D and numerous crimes in E
        both suggested that the people of China had been harmed by them, their policy of frustrating
        modernization harmed the material and cultural life of the people in D, and in E the population
        had been brutalised and exhausted
        both indicate that Deng was a critic and enemy of the Gang of Four.

      For contrast:
        Source D goes into details about the Gang of Four’s policy of opposition to the “four
        modernizations”, E does not
        Source E gives statistics of numbers persecuted and killed by the Gang of Four, D does not
        Source E mentions Mao’s support and their arrest and trial, D does not.

      If only one source is discussed award a maximum of [2 marks]. If the two sources are discussed
      separately award [3 marks] or with excellent linkage [4–5 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks]
      expect a detailed running comparison/contrast.

11.   With reference to their origin and purpose, discuss the value and limitations of
      Source A and Source B for historians studying the defeat of the Gang of Four and
      the re-emergence of Deng Xiaoping.                                               [6 marks]

      Source A
      Origin:        An extract from Modern China by Edwin Moise, published in London in 1994.

      Purpose:       To analyse the recent history of China.

      Value:         The book was written in the last decade of the twentieth century, when there was
                     reasonable access to China, and published in London, thus there would be no
                     censorship or fear of reprisal for criticising any aspect of Chinese history.
                     The author should have been free from any influence to make him subjective.

      Limitations:   The date is almost 20 years after the events in this extract took place, and published a
                     great distance from them. References would have to be checked to see how the
                     information was obtained.

      Source B
      Origin:        This is part of a warning by the Mayor of Beijing exhorting the crowd in Tiananmen
                     Square to disperse. The speech was made on 5 April, 1976.

      Purpose:       To get the crowd, who were demonstrating in Tiananmen Square, to disperse.

      Value:         The speech was delivered by a Communist official, and shows that he and the party
                     feared and distrusted the actions of the crowd. He indicated that the demonstration
                     was directed against Mao and the Central Committee, and had been orchestrated by
                     Deng, who was suspected of being an opposition leader. This shows that there was
                     some opposition to Mao’s government.

      Limitations:   The mayor may have overestimated the nature of the demonstration in order to
                     frighten the participants, and used Deng’s name and supposed involvement to
                     weaken him.

      Do not expect all the above and allow other valid points. Ideally there will be a balance between
      the two sources, and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 mark] split. If only
      one source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum [6 marks] candidates must refer to
      both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.
                                                   – 11 –            SPEC/3/HIST2/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   Using these sources and your own knowledge, analyse the opposition to the Gang
      of Four.                                                                       [8 marks]

      The focus of this question should be how and why the death of Mao led to changes and
      modernization through the imprisonment of the Gang of Four, the rise of Deng, and his emphasis
      on modernization.

      Source material could include:
      Source A: Gang of Four’s unpopularity after curtailing mourning ceremonies for Zhou Enlai;
                demonstrations in Tiananmen Square; re-educating senior scientists with manual labour,
                wasting their expertise; their arrest after Mao’s death.

      Source B: Demonstration, with implicit understanding that it was against the Gang of Four.

      Source C: The poster shows opposition to the Gang of Four and urges even children to oppose and
                attack them. Source C is a propaganda poster, thus it shows that opposition to the Gang
                of Four was acceptable/encouraged.

      Source D: Gang of Four’s opposition to modernization harmed the economy and people’s lives.

      Source E: Arrest of the Gang of Four, denunciation of their crimes, etc. led to “flood” of
                propaganda against them; they were said to have been responsible for persecution of
                700 000 and death of 35 000.

      Own knowledge that could be used:
        development of any of the above
        their relations with and protection by Mao
        Jiang Qing’s position and actions as Mao’s wife
        part played by the Cultural Revolution, especially the persecution of artists and intellectuals.

      Do not expect all the above and credit other relevant material. If only source material or only own
      knowledge is used, the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For a maximum
      [8 marks], expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as references
      to the sources used.

The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 2 published in the History guide on
pages 71–74. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction with the full
markbands found in the guide.


     0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.


    1–3:      Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
              appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.


    4–5:      There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are
              mainly inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are
              barely understood and there is minimal focus on the task.


    6–7:      Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
              limited in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will
              understanding of historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only
              partially addressed.


    8–9:      The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is
              present but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in
              nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
              commentary may be present. There is an attempt to place events in historical context
              and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured
              approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.


   10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are considered.
          Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
          generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as
          comparison and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different approaches
          and interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a
          clear attempt at a structured approach.


   13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
          applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
          produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
          understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
          different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.


    16–20:    Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
              question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
              evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as
              comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
              interpretations are used appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1    Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   Select two causes of the Second World War and show (a) how, and (b) why, they led to the
     outbreak of war in 1939.

     It is intended that the wording of this question will avoid candidates writing long narratives of the
     causes of the Second World War. Some suggested causes are: Hitler’s aggressive policies;
     appeasement; failure of the League of Nations; failure of the Treaty of Versailles. Others, perhaps
     the Nazi/Soviet Pact could be used, and how and why can be addressed separately or together.
     Mark as a whole whichever form is used.

     Hitler’s policies could include: his failure to observe the Treaty of Versailles; his wish to obtain
     living space; the absorption of Austria in the Anchluss; the occupation of Czechoslovakia;
     the invasion of Poland. “How” would include explaining the ways in which they led to opposition
     and finally war, and “why” an analysis of them as causes, for example Hitler believing he
     would not be opposed, and those against it regarding Poland as a step too far after his previous
     aggressive movements.

     Appeasement suggests the attempts made by the British and French governments to avoid an
     unpopular war by satisfying Hitler’s demands between 1936 and 1939. This policy permitted Hitler
     to send troops into the demilitarised Rhineland, allow the Anchluss, and acquire the Sudeten areas
     of Czechoslovakia in the Munich Agreement. Hitler’s defiance of the terms of the Munich
     Agreement by occupying the rest of Czechoslovakia, and then the invasion of Poland, led to war.
     An analysis of the above, and its effects on Hitler and Britain and France, could provide an answer
     to “why”.

     Probably the two above causes will be the most popular; candidates should be able to explain the
     decline/failure of the League of Nations, using the weaknesses in its foundation and constitution,
     the failure of many nations to join, and the failure of some of its actions and policies, led to states
     ignoring and acting outside it. It is hoped that not that many will use Versailles as a cause.
     This rarely obtains balance, and consists of criticism and how it upset Germany and caused the rise
     of Hitler. It is also 20 years before the war, but it is a legitimate cause, as would be the Wall Street
     Crash and Depression.


2.   What do you understand by the term “limited war”? Explain in what ways one twentieth
     century war could be called a limited war.

     In this context candidates could explain a “limited war”, as one in which all a nation’s resources are
     not mobilised in its efforts to win, its geographical area is limited, perhaps to one country, it did not
     lead to a world war, and as far as wars in the Cold War era, it did not lead to fighting on a large
     scale between East and West. As the question included the whole of the century, candidates could
     argue that in some aspects the First World War, was a limited war. It is probable that the Korean
     War (1950–1953), and the Vietnam War (1965–1973) will be used. Both of these wars offer many
     points to analyse, such as territorial aspect, tactics and fighting methods, resources put into the war,
     to what extent the war was part of the Cold War, and had support from the Cold War superpowers.

     The definition of “limited war”, could be worth up to about [5 marks], but mark as a whole, and
     expect discussion of some at least of the areas noted above, and some depth of analysis for the
     top bands.
                                                 –4–              SPEC/3/HIST2/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Assess the importance of air power in two wars, each chosen from a different region.

     Here are some of the ways that air power has been deployed in twentieth century wars: for general
     reconnaissance; for spying/espionage, that is both from the aircraft taking photographs etc.
     on reconnaissance, and for dropping spies behind enemy lines; for moving troops, equipment, etc.;
     for bombing: this will probably be the area that is most analysed, including dropping atomic bombs;
     for intercepting bombers and protecting the country being attacked.

     Candidates need to give specific examples of their use in their chosen specific wars, and reach a
     conclusion on the overall effect and use of air power in the two wars, each from a different region,
     that they have chosen. The different types of aircraft, fighter, bombers, troop carriers etc. could
     be assessed.

     N.B. If only one war or one region is discussed mark out of [12 marks].


4.   “Those who can win a war well can rarely make a good peace.” Select one peace treaty and
     by examining its clauses, explain how the winners treated the losers, and if you agree with
     the quotation.

     It is likely that most candidates will see this question as yet another for which they could use the
     Treaty of Versailles and they will agree with the quotation. More thoughtful candidates could argue
     that the allies perhaps did not win the war well, in that Germany was not invaded. Apart from those
     who do use Versailles, this will probably not be a popular question


5.   What were the main results of two of the following: Iran–Iraq war, Falklands/Malvinas war,
     Nigerian Civil War, Spanish Civil War?

     The Iran–Iraq War, 1980–1988, caused about 1.5 million deaths and on the whole neither side
     gained anything. It caused problems, social, economic and political for both countries, the region
     and international relations.

     The Falklands/Malvinas war (1982) resulted in the downfall of General Galtieri’s government in
     Argentina and increased support for Margaret Thatcher in Britain.

     The Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970) led to the defeat of Biafra and the end of its attempt to form a
     separate state.

     The Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) resulted in victory for the Nationalists and Franco, Franco’s
     rule of Spain until his death in 1975, and had some impact on Nazi Germany, Italy, and Europe
     in general.

     Candidates can select any two wars to compare and contrast, they do not have to select two civil or
     two non-civil wars.

6.   In what ways, and with what results, did the status of women change during, and in the
     decade [ten years] following, one twentieth century war?

     Candidates would probably choose the decade following one of the World Wars, but any war would
     be acceptable.

     Factors to address could include: education; employment; health care; position in the family; voting
     rights; equality; participation in local and national government; sport and leisure activities.

     Results could analyse how the changes affected the lives and status of both men and women.

Topic 2   Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   To what extent did each of the following contribute towards the collapse of Weimar democracy:
     a weak constitution, economic crises, and political extremism of the left and the right?

     The question requires candidates to identify and critically assess the role of each of the three
     elements in explaining the failure of democracy in Germany. Other elements/reasons may be
     included but the main focus should be on the above. It is not simply an essay on the rise of the
     Nazis/Hitler.

     For weaknesses in terms of the constitution many will no doubt emphasise the issues of
     proportional representation (with the corresponding coalition governments) and the use/abuse of
     Article 48 by 1930. Some candidates may argue the merits of the constitution and attribute its
     problems not to the structure/provisions but to the unwillingness of parties/individuals to work the
     constitution in the spirit of democracy – pointing out for example the circumstances in which the
     new system was inaugurated.

     For economic crises the impact of the hyperinflationary period (1923) and the depression years
     from 1929 should be well known. Links should be made between the crises and the effects upon
     the stability/progress of the republic.

     For political extremism (left- and right-wing) candidates could refer to the actions of the
     Spartacists/KPD during Weimar's existence (and the real or perceived threats these constituted) and
     the activities of rightist extremists ranging from the Freikorps/Kapp Putschists of the early period
     through to the attempts (parliamentary and extra-parliamentary) of the National Socialists and their
     associates to undermine/overthrow the Weimar democratic system.

     N.B. If only one of the required areas is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [8 marks]. If only
     two of the areas are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 –7–              SPEC/3/HIST2/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.   Compare and contrast the methods used, and the level of success achieved, by civil rights
     movements in two different democratic states.

     Civil rights movements are understood to mean those movements that have sought to challenge
     discrimination against sections of society based on race, religion, gender, etc.; or to redress
     historical grievance – for example in relation to questions of land ownership (aboriginal rights).

     Popular choices are likely to be movements in the Americas and Australasia.

     It is neither necessary nor desirable to produce long descriptive accounts of such movements and
     their struggles. The emphasis is on methods and assessment of success.

     Approaches to this type of question are likely to be end-on/sequential treatments with a conclusion
     where an explicit attempt is made to deal with similarities and differences; or take a thematic
     approach. The latter approach is likely to produce a better response.

     For methods, depending on the examples chosen, candidates could examine the use of: civil
     disobedience/passive resistance (essentially pacifist approaches for the most part); lobbying;
     propaganda; the use of violence to further claims for civil equality; hunger strikes intended to
     influence domestic and possibly foreign opinion.

     With regard to the level of success judgment needs to be made regarding the nature and extent of
     success (or non-success depending on the examples selected) in both democratic states.
     Success should be considered in relation to the original goals/aims of the movements – whether
     these be economic, educational, political, social, religious, etc.

9.   “De Gaulle rescued France from political crisis but his leadership plunged the democratic state
     into chaos by 1968.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates may of course accept, fully or partly, the statement – or not at all. Candidates could
     identify the circumstances in which de Gaulle came to power as first president of the Fifth Republic
     and the nature and extent of the “political crisis” which threatened the Fourth Republic. Areas for
     consideration could include: the period of “immobilism” in domestic affairs linked to the failure of
     coalition politics in the period 1946–1958 (22 administrations between 1946 and 1958) due to
     suspicion/ideological differences between socialists, communists and conservatives; the rise of
     Poujade and a populism based on extreme rightist policies; foreign policy failures in relation to a
     bloody and expensive decolonization process in Indochina and Algeria; domestic repercussions of
     the Algerian issue – the divisions in metropolitan France over the future of Algeria; army/settler
     revolt of May 1958.

     De Gaulle, with a new constitution emphasising stronger presidential power and with provision for
     government by decree in exceptional circumstances, presided over the Fifth Republic until 1969 and
     his retirement. Often lauded as a “saviour” of France, he extricated the nation from Algerian
     entanglements by 1962 in the face of militant opposition from sections of the armed forces,
     recognized independence for French West African colonies, aimed to rebuild France’s status as a
     leading power in Europe and attempted to project the image of a France free from Anglo-American
     influence in pursuit of his “politics of grandeur” for France.

     By 1968 though, a state of crisis in the Fifth Republic was evidenced by events in France.
     Despite the popularity of de Gaulle's foreign policy and his advocacy of an independent role for
     France in world affairs (the Union pour la Nouvelle République (UNR) – later the Union des
     Démocrates pour la République (UDR) obtained 35.5 % of the national vote in 1962) student
     protests over poor working, living and teaching conditions catalysed a “revolt” in May 1968.
     Candidates should identify the areas of discontent/frustration which produced the “events” of 1968
     and link such frustrations to the nature of political/economic policies during the period.

     Some 10 million workers joined in the student initiated protests because of grievances over low
     wages and the increasing gap between the income of workers and management, unemployment
     especially amongst youth and the unskilled, heavy-handed treatment of strikers in earlier industrial
     disputes by riot police, the lack of “participation” in the management of the workplace.
     Protests spread to the professions with criticism of antiquated structures and rigid hierarchy
     in medicine, the arts and broadcasting.

     Conservative counter-demonstrations occurred and the crisis was resolved when an election in June
     produced a victory for the Gaullist UDR. In 1969 however a referendum on the issue of regional
     reform and curbing of the power of the Senate led to a virtual “vote of no confidence” in de Gaulle.
     He resigned.

10.   With reference to two democratic states examine the claim that coalition government failed
      to provide the basis for economic and political stability.

      A popular choice here is likely to be Weimar Germany. Other examples could be drawn from the
      experience of democracy in the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy (pre-First World War until
      1922, or post-Second World War), France and the trials and tribulations of the Fourth Republic
      1946–1958.

      Depending on the examples chosen, candidates could point out the ways in which coalitions have
      proved a hindrance to the maintenance of stability in the state selected – or arguably that
      coalitions have proved successful in permitting governments to articulate and implement a wider
      set of policies than a government based on a party with absolute majority could offer.
      Consensual democracy (in the sense of coalitions) rather than majoritarian democracy makes
      possible, in theory, the representation of wider sectional interests in a population.

      Specific examples with regard to economic policies/programmes are required to substantiate the
      claims made.

      N.B. If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

11.   Identify the major challenges faced by Trudeau in Canada (1968–1984), and assess the extent to
      which the challenges were successfully dealt with.

      Following the retirement of Lester Pearson in 1968 Trudeau, the former Minister of Justice,
      succeeded him as leader of the Liberal Party and was elected prime minister in the election
      that year.   Candidates could identify the major issues facing Canada in the period:
      Quebec nationalism/separatism and the threat to the unity of federal state; the need to address the
      aspirations of French-Canadians regarding the issue of the official language of the nation; the
      question of “patriation” – Britain’s right to amend Canada’s constitution dating back to the Statute
      of Westminster; the building of a “Just Society” through extension of unemployment insurance;
      basic income support for those in need, provision of universal health care.

      Extremism in relation to Quebec separatism was met with a temporary application of War Measures
      Act (martial law) in 1970. Later, in 1980, Trudeau spearheaded the successful campaign against the
      issue of Quebec sovereignty.

      1969 saw the passing of the Official Languages Act making French and English official languages
      in the fields of federal government services, documents and broadcasting. “Official bilingualism”
      by 1984.

      Large deficits accrued (1968 national debt = $18 billion, 1984 national debt = $200 billion) due to
      his funding of projects to achieve the “Just Society” leading to a decline in support for the Liberals
      and a close run election in 1972 which required Trudeau to rely on support from the
      New Democratic Party (NDP) in order to remain in office. In 1974 the Liberals were returned with
      140 seats to the 95 of the Conservatives and 16 of the NDP.

      Economic and language policies were not always welcomed by the Western Canadian
      provinces (e.g. National Energy Policy 1980) leading to claims that Trudeau was responsible for
      “Western alienation”.

      By 1982 the Canadian House of Commons had approved constitutional changes regarding
      patriation as did 9 out of 10 provinces (Quebec being the exception). Great Britain gave up its right
      to legislate for Canada in 1982.

      An amendment introduced the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which were to form the
      basis for individual rights and the pursuit of advances relating to female equality, aboriginal
      rights, etc.

12.   In what ways, and with what results, did pressure groups in two democratic states affect
      government policy making?

      Pressure groups – also known as “interest groups” or “lobby groups” – seek to influence
      government policy (in regards to implementation/amendment/scrapping of legislation) by seeking to
      influence those in a position to make decisions/laws. Groups have adopted a variety of methods:
      petitioning, publicising of issues, funding of sympathetic candidates in elections, and in some cases
      the use of more extreme methods to attract attention to the issue(s) involved.

      Candidates may select from a variety of different types of “pressure” or “interest/lobby groups”:
      sectional groups, which essentially represent particular groups in a society such as the professions,
      trade unions, senior citizens, etc.; or “promotional” (or “cause/single issue”) groups campaigning
      for issues which include ecological/environmental programmes, anti-war movements, nuclear
      disarmament campaigns, gun control (pro- and anti-), pro- and anti-abortion, animal rights, etc.

      Whichever groups are selected it is important that specific detail is provided as to the methods by
      which such groups sought to achieve their goals and the extent to which democratic governments
      have been influenced by this activity which is often seen as a necessary supplement to electoral
      democracy by supporters and a danger to the functioning of accountable government by others.

Topic 3    Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   Select two leaders of single-party states, each chosen from a different region, and explain how
      and why the conditions of their state helped them to rise to power.

      Candidates are used to questions about conditions which tend to help the rise of authoritarian rulers.
      These could include: war and its aftermath, such as unpopular treaties and post-war economic and
      social problems; unpopular rulers; poor social and economic conditions, including poverty resulting
      from the greed and oppression of the current ruler; lack of law and order within the state; loss of
      national pride and prestige; lack of constitutional rights, etc. How the aspiring leader related to,
      and used these conditions should be explained. Candidates have to choose two leaders, each
      chosen from a different region. No doubt Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, and Castro would all be
      popular choices.

      N.B. If only one leader, or one region is addressed mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


14.   Analyse the ideology of (a) one right-wing ruler, and (b) one left-wing ruler.

      Candidates can either answer the two parts of this question separately, as (a) and (b), or in
      one essay.

      (a) Examples of right-wing rulers and their ideologies that should be known by IB candidates are,
      Mussolini, Hitler and Peron with Fascism, Nazism, Peronism. The most popular would probably
      be Hitler. It is difficult to divide ideology from policies, but probably most would agree that Nazi
      ideology included opposition to democracy, a belief in the one-party state, the purity of the Aryan
      race, and following from that Anti-Semitism. Many would include extreme nationalism.

      (b) The choice of a left-wing ruler would probably be one of Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Castro, all of
      whom adopted a Communist/Marxist ideology. Communism was a social system in which property
      is communally owned, functioning on the principle “from each according to his ability”.
      The political system would ideally be non-hierarchical and people would work according to their
      ability and suitability. The exponents of modern Communism were Marx (1818–1883) and Engels
      (1820–1895). In theory the party was supreme. Communist rulers declared their belief and
      adherence to the Communist Manifesto, but it is doubtful if a truly Communist society has
      ever existed.

      In both (a) and (b), candidates need to analyse to what extent their chosen rulers adhered to their
      ideology, and what changes were made, for example with the development of Marxism-Leninism
      in (b).

      N.B. If only one ruler is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks], and do not
      demand an exact balance between the two. Accept other ideologies, for example socialism for a
      left-wing ideology.
                                                 – 13 –           SPEC/3/HIST2/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


15.   Compare and contrast the religious policies of Hitler and Peron.

      Both Hitler and Peron used religion for their own ends and support, both sought the support of the
      Catholic Church in the early stages of their rule, and both were opposed by it later.

      Hitler also had to deal with the Protestant Lutheran Church, which split between those who
      supported the Nazis (the Reich Church) and those who opposed them (the Confessional Church).
      Hitler persecuted the Protestant opposition. Many including Pastor Niemoller, were arrested
      as were prominent Catholic Church leaders. The greatest religious persecution was of Jews.
      Peron did not go to such lengths in his disagreements with the Church.

      N.B. If only Hitler or only Peron is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


16.   In 1952 Kenyatta said, “God said this is our land, land in which we flourish as a people”.
      In what ways did the people of Kenya (a) benefit, and (b) suffer from Kenyatta’s policies?

      Jomo Kenyatta (c. 1897–1978) was an early advocate for Kenyan independence, for which he
      suffered imprisonment in 1953–1959, for supporting the Mau Mau organisation, which he had
      denounced in 1952. After his release he was at first exiled, but finally freed in 1961 he entered
      parliament as leader of the Kenya African National Union (KANU). He won a decisive victory for
      his party in 1963, and led his country to independence in the same year, becoming prime minister.

      Kenyatta benefited his people by helping to achieve independence, by reconciling Asians and
      European by liberal polices and economic common sense. He encouraged private enterprise and
      foreign investment. Under his rule an African middle class emerged and most agricultural land was
      in African hands. He promoted local self-help groups such as Harambee, who built and maintained
      schools and hospitals. But later he caused some suffering by being intolerant of opposition
      and outlawing opposition parties. In spite of his land transfer programme, land hunger and
      poverty remained. Kenyatta was never greatly criticised. But his family “the royal family” as they
      were called were strongly resented.

      N.B. Mark as a whole but both parts must be addressed for [12+ marks].

17.   To what extent were the social and economic policies of one of the following successful:
      Mao, Nasser, Stalin?

      Candidates must choose one of the three rulers and analyse his social and economic policies
      to decide how successful these policies were.

      Social and economic policies could include: education; religion; culture, including the arts;
      health care; employment; agriculture; trade and industry; transport.

      Mao (1893–1976) was the ruler of China from 1949 until his death. He is especially associated
      with the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.

      Nasser (1918–1970). He became prime minister of Egypt in 1954 and President in 1956 until
      his death. Policies associated with him are the building of the Aswan Dam, socialism,
      nationalisation, over ambitious economic plans, inflation.

      Stalin (1879–1953) was in control after a power struggle, by 1928, and ruled USSR until his death.
      Social and economic policies associated with him include collectivisation, removal of the Kulaks,
      industrialisation, Magnitogorsk.


18.   Select one leader of a single-party state, and explain why there was opposition to his rule, and
      why the opposition succeeded or failed.

      Reasons for opposition could include: attempts of a rival and his supporters to overthrow the ruler;
      opposition to his autocratic rule and tyranny; ideology; poor state of the country; demand for
      political rights; foreign interference.

      Most attempts to overthrow a twentieth century ruler of a single-party state failed because
      through tight control, censorship, terror, secret police etc. this position was practically invulnerable.
      There were attempts on the lives of, for example, Hitler and Stalin, but they failed.

Topic 4    Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
           Eastern European states

19.   Analyse the impact of either the First World War or the Second World War on the
      development of nationalism in one Asian or African colonial state.

      Both world wars proved important in hastening the process of decolonization – the catalytic nature
      of each conflict in doing so varies according to the Asian or African colonial state selected.

      Areas of investigation for the wars could include:
      First World War: the destruction or diminution of empires and metropolitan power – for example
      the Ottoman and German empires; establishment of the mandate system; the touting of the principle
      of self-determination which was subsequently selectively applied; the ending of the myth of
      European supremacy and “superior civilization”; the weakening of colonial powers which may have
      been forced to offer concessions to satisfy nascent nationalist movements (India and the system of
      dyarchy for example); the growth of movements linked to left-wing anti-colonial forces encouraged
      by the Russian experience of 1917 and later.

      Second World War: the inability of European powers to maintain hold of imperial possessions
      (South East Asia in particular) which accelerated the smashing of the aura of imperial power;
      the role of nations such as Japan in encouraging Asian nationalist movements albeit for their own
      ends; the pressure upon colonial powers to make concessions/promises for change in order to rally
      the war effort; the entry of the USA (and even before that the issuing of the Atlantic Charter) as
      elements intensifying the drive for self-determination; the loss of economic power – and arguably
      willpower – in some cases to resist the growing challenges militarily in the immediate
      post-1945 period; the influence of the newly instituted United Nations Organization and
      commitment to decolonization.

      Whichever war is chosen there should be sound and accurate historical substantiation/detailed
      knowledge shown of the significance (political, economic and social) of the effects of the conflict
      upon the colonial state – and presumably the metropolitan state which controlled it.
                                                  – 16 –            SPEC/3/HIST2/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



20.   Evaluate the importance of Gandhi’s leadership and methods in the struggle for Indian
      independence.

      The nature of Gandhi’s leadership in the attempt to build a mass nationalist movement
      incorporating a broad base of support (economic, political and religious) could be identified and
      commented upon. This could include reference to his dealings with organizations such as the
      Khilafat Movement, the Muslim League, the Untouchables (Harijans), etc.; his stance at the Round
      Table Conference in London, as well as his relationship with Indian big business and the more
      obviously secular wing of the Indian National Congress represented by Nehru which often found
      itself at variance with other leaders such as Patel.

      Methods will probably be better known by candidates: the hartals, the Swadeshi movement,
      the tactics of non-violent resistance, civil disobedience, fasts undertaken to apply pressure upon
      opponents, Quit India Movement, etc.

      “Evaluate” also provides the opportunity to comment upon other factors which may be considered
      as significant contributory factors to independence – international public opinion, the effects of war
      in weakening the power of Britain, etc. Some candidates may point out that what was achieved was
      an independence which was, even in Gandhi’s opinion, one that fell short of his goal. Partition, or
      the “vivisection” of India, was counted by Gandhi as a major failure.


21.   With reference to either Hungary or Czechoslovakia examine the reasons for the failure to
      challenge Soviet control successfully.

      The time span covers the post-1945 period in both cases and requires examination of those factors
      which prevented a successful challenge to Soviet control during the period up to and including the
      events of the given dates: the failed rising in the case of Hungary 1956, and the crushing of the
      Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

      While the events surrounding 1956 and 1968 are likely to be the central areas of coverage, some
      candidates may consider the earlier purges of politicians in both states on the charges of “Titoism”
      and “rootless cosmopolitanism” in the late 1940s and early 1950s in Hungary and Czechoslovakia
      respectively. Moscow’s fear of divergence from control extended to cleansing the parties in both
      cases because of their supposed disloyalty to the Moscow brand of socialism.

      Reasons the challenges did not succeed could include consideration of the nature and extent of
      Soviet control in terms of physical presence in either state; the strength of support for the
      Soviet Union and the Soviet style regime within the satellite states; the failure of opposition to
      effectively organize; the lack of help (and why) for opposition movements from external sources;
      the encouragement for intervention by other East bloc satellites worried by the possible “contagion”
      from Budapest or Prague; the use of force by the Warsaw Pact states acting “fraternally” to
      eliminate what was branded as anti-Socialist agitation – subsequently enshrined in the
      Brezhnev Doctrine.

22.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of one African and one Asian leader in the ten
      years after independence.

      Content obviously depends upon the examples selected for comparison/contrast. Note however that
      Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) is not an acceptable example for this question. Popular choices could
      be Nkrumah, Nehru, Sukarno, etc., but the important point is the reference to independence – i.e. a
      new state emerging as a result of the end of colonial rule, whether peacefully or as a result
      of conflict.

      Note also the reference to “ten years” in the question. The emphasis is on the early period
      following independence: the question is not an invitation to write an extended history of the trials,
      tribulations and progress of an ex-colonial state since independence.

      Answers are likely to take the form of either end-on/sequential accounts with a concluding paragraph
      in which similarities and differences may be dealt with explicitly – or a thematic treatment. The latter
      approach is likely to produce a better result.

      Areas for investigation (in either thematic or end-on accounts) could include: economic
      policies/programmes undertaken in agrarian and industrial spheres and examination/assessment of
      their aims/methods/progress (or lack thereof); social policies including educational developments,
      health care, role and status of women; the situation and treatment of minorities (if applicable) within
      the new nation; the political structure adopted in the state and whether it was representative of the
      will of the people or not; the treatment of opposition (political, religious for example) in the
      new state; the question of civil liberties and the extent to which they were implemented – or not.

      N.B. If only one example is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


23.   “The greatest challenge faced by post-colonial nations or new states in Central and Eastern
      Europe was economic.” With reference to either one post-colonial nation or one new state in
      Central or Eastern Europe, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Neither China under Mao nor Cuba under Castro is an appropriate choice.

      The task offers a wide range of possibilities for candidates to choose an appropriate example
      for investigation. The quotation stresses the economic challenge presented to newly emerging
      post-colonial states or new/re-emerging states in Central and Eastern Europe. Candidates could
      identify the nature of such challenges/problems; whether, for example, over-reliance on
      monocultural production as a result of the economics of colonialism, or the problems faced by
      economic clientship in the former Sovietized satellite states. Problems of restructuring of
      economies to compete in regional and global markets, problems of unemployment and insufficient
      investment to update infrastructure and to train workers could be noted.

      Neo-colonialism could also be profitably examined in the context of outside interference/
      involvement in the economic development of new states.

      Other challenges could be considered by candidates as being as (or more) significant in terms of
      challenges to the survival and progress of the new state: tribal or ethnic problems, political
      instability, hostile neighbours, a restless military with political ambitions of its own, superpower
      interference and use of the state as a surrogate/proxy in the Cold War era, etc.

24.   Account for the dissolution of the former Republic of Yugoslavia, and analyse the
      consequences for one successor state in the ten years after the break-up.

      Yugoslavia emerged as a sovereign state following the Paris Peace Settlement after the
      First World War. Though seen as a triumph of self-determination by some, it was in many ways a
      “Greater Serbia”. Linguistic, religious and ethnic groups were to be found in the many nationalities
      composing the state: Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins, Macedonians, Slovenians, Bosnians, Albanians
      and Magyars. Tensions between nationalities existed from 1920 but despite bitterness and ethnic
      conflict – e.g. Croatian nationalism in the years of the Second World War which was responsible
      for the deaths of approximately 700 000 Serbs at the hands of the Croatian Ustashe – the Yugoslav
      state survived under the leadership of Tito as a federal state, albeit with tight control from
      the centre.

      Tito died in 1980 and existing tensions re-emerged with more intensity. The six republics constituting
      the Federal Republic (and the two autonomous states within the Serbian Republic) faced a variety
      of problems. Economic problems included inflation, unemployment, resentment by some republics
      (especially Slovenia) at the disproportionate contribution made to the federal budget.
      Political problems caused by the revival of nationalism; Greater Serbian nationalism as witnessed in
      the case of Milosevic, Croatian nationalism in the case of Tudjman and the resurgence of separatist
      movements amongst Kosovars and Magyars (the former encouraged by neighbouring Albania).
      Resentment at the domination of Serbs in the party and the Yugoslav People’s Army had also
      produced tensions.

      For consequences, candidates should choose one of the successor states and identify the main
      challenges faced by that state. This could include: the violence associated with civil war as
      different nationalities/groups fought for territory and for ethnic cleansing of that territory; economic
      problems associated with independence (or in some cases economic progress and examples of
      such success); political (in)stability and governmental structures in the successor states; the
      continued struggle by minorities which felt themselves still trapped due to the failure to achieve
      self-determination.

Topic 5     The Cold War

25.   Why did the end of the Second World War lead to the development of two superpowers and
      how did this development help to cause the Cold War?

      For the first part of this question candidates could analyse the rivalry between the Soviet Union and
      the West that was latent against the common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis, but even emerged during
      the later stages of the war. Relations deteriorated during the conferences, in which it was clear that
      the USA and USSR were the two important powers. Britain and France had lost too much to be
      able to return to their pre-war position and status, so it was left to the USA and the USSR to show
      their strength, and in doing so they increasingly developed their rivalry, so both tried to exert their
      strength and thus became known as superpowers.

      The emergence of these two superpowers could be said to have laid the foundation of the
      Cold War, and their development and determination to show their strength led to the Cold War.
      The USSR felt vulnerable enough to seek a buffer state between herself and Germany and strong
      enough to overturn Eastern Europe and succeed in her demands to turn it into a sphere of influence.
      The USA felt strong enough to retain the West’s position in Berlin, and launch the Truman Doctrine
      and the Marshall Plan. Thus the Cold War came into existence.


26.   What do you understand by the term “spheres of influence”? In what ways did spheres of
      influence affect the development of the Cold War?

      “Spheres of influence” were countries that were regarded by the superpowers, as being under their
      protection, and largely carrying out their wishes. In the Cold War, both East and West sought
      spheres of interest in order to have allies and thus strengthen their position.

      Spheres of interest helped to develop the Cold War as each side sought both to enlarge their allies
      and to prevent the other side gaining more allies and spheres of interest. Cuba was a good example
      of this. The USA tried to keep all the American nations from falling under Communist control, and
      both sides sought to influence Asian countries. Thus the Cold War developed and spread.

      Some of the points above should be developed and analysed, in order to answer the question.
                                                  – 20 –            SPEC/3/HIST2/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


27.   In what ways, and with what results, was Berlin the centre of Cold War crises between 1946
      and 1961?

      Although Berlin was in the eastern part of Germany when Germany was divided between the East
      and West powers, because it was the capital it too was divided into sectors, with a Russian,
      American, British and French sector. The Russians objected, and aimed to take complete control of
      the city. Soviet fears between 1946 and 1961 were based on citizens of the Eastern sector seeing
      the increased prosperity of the Western sector, and making unfavourable comparisons, and as this
      became more apparent, an increasing number of East Germans fled to the West via Berlin.

      The ways in which Berlin was the centre of the Cold War were: the joining of the western sectors
      into one; the issuing of a new currency in West Germany which the Russians refused to accept; the
      Berlin blockade and airlift 1948–1949; Khrushchev’s demands that allied forces should leave
      Berlin, 1958; the building of the Berlin Wall.

      The main results of these crises were: increased tension; western success in forcing the lifting of
      the blockade; Western determination not to allow Berlin to be completely incorporated into
      East Germany; large numbers of fugitives fleeing from East Germany; increased bloodshed and
      deaths after the wall was built and many Germans still tried to get from the east to the west.

      Balanced treatment of both parts of the question is needed for high marks.


28.   For what reasons, and in what ways, did either Korea or the Congo become part of the
      Cold War?

      Candidates need to explain how and why either Korea or the Congo (later Zaire) became involved
      in the Cold War. Korea will probably be the more popular choice, as it is usually studied in relation
      to the spread of the Cold War from Europe into Asia.

      In the Yalta Conference in 1945 the division of Korea along the latitude 38 parallel, with US and
      USSR allowed within each part, until a unified Korea was agreed. Thus Soviet forces occupied the
      North and US troops the south. The Korean People’s Democratic Republic was proclaimed in the
      North, in September 1948, and US troops left the South, proclaimed as the Republic of Korea,
      in June 1949. In 1950 the North invaded the South, and during the subsequent Korean War,
      1950–1953, Cold War enemies were increasingly involved and they remained so in the efforts to
      solve the situation after the war.

      The Congo became drawn into the Cold War, when Belgium granted independence to the Belgian
      Congo, before the country was ready for self-government. This precipitate act left the Congolese
      politicians dependent on tribal rather than national Support. When the Congo Republic was
      established in June 1960 there was chaos, and Cold war antagonists, especially the Chinese sought
      to gain from it. The Congo problem remained a matter of deep concern for the United Nations
      between 1960 and 1965, whilst a civil war was raging.
                                                  – 21 –            SPEC/3/HIST2/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


29.   Compare and contrast the parts played by Cuba and Vietnam in the Cold War.

      Some of the following points could be used for comparison; both Cuba and Vietnam were important
      strategically and geographically; both had suffered from unpopular earlier regimes; both were part
      in the globalisation of the Cold War; the rulers of Cuba and northern Vietnam were strong forceful
      characters, Castro and Ho Chi Minh.

      For contrast: Cuba was an island and one state, Vietnam was divided after the Second World War;
      Cuba was geographically close to the USA, Vietnam was not; Vietnam was a “hot” war in the
      Cold War, the missile crisis in Cuba did not turn into a war; US policy toward Cuba, at least in the
      missile crisis could be said to have been successful and popular, whereas US policy towards
      Vietnam was unpopular and could be judged unsuccessful; USSR policy towards Cuba was
      generally open, but it was not so towards Vietnam; China was active in Vietnam, but it was the
      USSR in Cuba; the war in Vietnam lasted longer than the missile crisis but there was less danger in
      it turning into a third world war.

      Other factors could be mentioned, so mark what is there and do not expect all the above material.

      N.B. If only Cuba or only Vietnam is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7marks].


30.   Examine the ways in which the arms race (a) caused tension in the Cold War, and (b) helped
      to end the Cold War.

      This question can be answered in two parts, (a) and (b), or as one essay.

      (a) The term “arms race” applies to the continuous competition between the Western powers,
      especially the USA, and the USSR, to establish technical and numerical supremacy in
      arms production. It applies particularly to atomic and nuclear weapons, and could be said to have
      begun with the USA dropping the two atomic bombs on Japan at the end of the Second World War.
      It caused tension because both sides feared that the other was stronger in their production of
      weapons. The Cuban missile crisis reflected the aim of the USSR to place missiles that could reach
      the USA who had weapons which could reach Soviet territory, placed in Turkey. Tension was also
      caused by the cost of the arms race, especially in the Eastern bloc, where the standard of living
      was low. However, fear was the real product of the arms race which caused tension.

      (b) The arms race also helped to end the Cold War, because the main protagonists realised that
      using the destructive weapons would wipe out both sides. Thus both sides did seek and sign arms
      limitation treaties; a hot line was established between Washington and Kremlin after the missile
      crisis, and the cost became too great for the USSR, and was one of the causes of the ending of the
      Cold War. Some of the Test Ban treaties and other agreements could be discussed and analysed.

      Balanced essays which address both parts well are needed for high marks.

Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide.

      0:    Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no
            evidence of appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported
            generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present
            but the detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely
            understood and there are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge
           is limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may
           be present but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth,
           historical knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is
           narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited argument that requires
           further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
           place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
           processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or
           thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications
           considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be
           present. Events are generally placed in context, and historical processes, such
           as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
           structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply
           summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-
           depth knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary
           are used to indicate some in-depth understanding but is not consistent
           throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of
           historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
           approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is
           present but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the
           demands of the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and
           detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to support critical
           commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing
           events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
           and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
           well developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the
           question and may challenge it successfully.            Knowledge is extensive,
           accurately applied and there may be a high level of conceptual ability.
           Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
           historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
           Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and
           well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Why was Yohannis IV more successful than Tewodros II in reuniting Ethiopia?

     Tewodros II began the process of reuniting Ethiopia but a major problem was his inability to carry
     his people along with him. This problem was made worse by his emotional instability and
     outbursts of cruelty and violence. He created a standing army and carried out far-reaching
     administrative reforms. He tried to impose a highly centralized system on the great feudal nobles
     without the means to do so. The emperor’s attack on the privileges of the church turned them
     against him and towards his political enemies and alienated the mass of the Amhara-Tigre people.
     As his reign progressed, Tewodros II reacted more violently to the opposition but his
     harshness merely increased disloyalty. By his death Ethiopia had broken up once more into
     warring provinces. Only a federal system could have worked, with the provincial nobles attached to
     the emperor by military and marriage alliance. Yohannis IV learned from Tewodros II’s failure and
     strengthened the central power by diplomacy rather than war. He created a federation rather than a
     strongly centralized state but this at least was attainable and proved acceptable to the
     provincial rulers. In 1878 Yohannis IV made an agreement with Menelik of Shewa and Menelik’s
     daughter married Yohannis IV’s son. Menelik paid tribute to Yohannis IV and dropped his claim to
     the imperial title. Constant external threats prevented Yohannis IV from fully uniting the country.
     He never really established his authority over either the King of Gojjam or over Menelik, who
     refused to fight with him against the Mahdist invaders. Yohannis IV was more successful because
     his aims were more limited and realistic and he avoided making enemies.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Tewodros II or Yohannis IV and their contribution to the
     reunification of Ethiopia.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level there is some understanding of the contribution of Tewodros II and
     Yohannis IV to Ethiopian unification.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is a balanced comparative analysis of the methods of the two rulers focused
     on unification.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as insight into the reasons why Yohannis IV was
     more successful.

2.   Discuss the achievement of Mzilikazi as founder of the Ndebele state.

     In about 1840 Mzilikazi conquered the Rozwi Empire and set up a new Ndebele Kingdom with its
     capital near Bulawayo. With superior military methods he conquered and absorbed the divided
     Shona-speaking peoples. The boundaries of the state were marked by the farthest extent of
     Ndebele raids. Distant areas only paid tribute when forced to do so by Ndebele regiments.

     Mzilikazi developed a strong central government. In its early years it was a military state but it
     gradually became more civil as regiments became territorial administrative systems. Indunas took
     on civil as well as military duties as territorial chiefs. Mzilikazi used marriage to several hundred
     wives from different sections of the nation and Sindebele as a common language to promote
     national unity, but Ndebele society remained divided into three castes. The upper caste consisted of
     the original Nguni warriors and their descendants. Marriage between one caste and another was
     virtually forbidden. Though the Rozwi Empire collapsed under the impact of the Ndebele invasion
     the Shona never came completely under Ndebele rule and their strength revived in the 1870s.
     They were not, however, constantly at war with each other. The old Shona trading system survived
     and the Ndebele used it to export ivory to the coast.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Mzilikazi or the Ndebele state.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level there is narration or description of Mzilikazi’s organization of
     the Ndebele state.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is balanced, focused and structured analysis of the economic and social
     organization of the Ndebele state under Mzilikazi.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as insight into Mzilikazi’s relationship with
     the Shona.

3.   Compare and contrast the policies and impact in Southern Africa of Shaka and Mosheshwe.

     There is a clear contrast between the policies of Shaka as an aggressive nation builder and
     Mosheshwe who stands out as a leader who built a new state for defence. The two were similar in
     being helped by, or taking advantage of, the Mfecane and relations with foreign traders
     and/or missionaries. Both relied on military strength.

     Shaka turned a small chiefdom into a nation, imposing Zulu customs and his will on all the territory
     from the Drakensberg to the sea. He subdued neighbouring tribes, jettisoned customs, reorganized
     the army, adapted the age-grade system for military purposes and perfected Dingiswayo’s
     military tactics. He used a short stabbing spear for close combat and maintained a well-drilled and
     disciplined standing army which was merciless with the enemy.

     Mosheshwe used traditional Sotho techniques to gather the Sotho communities into one nation.
     He resorted to war only in self-defence and under severe provocation. From 1822 to 1836, when
     the Sotho-Tswana lands were ravaged by the Mfecane, Mosheshwe gathered a band of refugees on
     the mountain fortress of Thaba Bosiu. Mosheshwe loaned cattle under the mafisa system, had a
     federal system of government and used the pitso to solve disputes.

     Shaka had the greater impact on Southern Africa. His kingdom was later destroyed by the British
     but millions of Africans are still proud of their Zulu identity. Mosheshwe offered his country to the
     British as a protectorate in 1868 and thus preserved the identity of his nation but not
     its independence. Shaka’s wars contributed to a period of upheaval and prolonged warfare
     and migration. His actions made the Mfecane more intense. It led to the emergence of new states,
     some with aggressive and others with defensive policies. It also led to the depopulation of
     large areas, facilitated the Great Trek and made some states more vulnerable to Boer incursions.
     Mosheshwe, in contrast, offered a refuge to many of the tribes terrorized by and fleeing from Shaka.
     After the Great Trek the Boers occupied much of the land round the Sotho, who had to keep
     together to resist them.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the policies or impact of Shaka or Mosheshwe.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level knowledge of Shaka and Mosheshwe is used to compare their policies
     and impact in Southern Africa.

     [12 to 17 marks] the policies and impact of Shaka and Mosheshwe are analysed in a clear, balanced
     and comparative structure.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as insight into the contrasting personalities of the
     two rulers.

     N.B. If only one leader is discussed mark out of [7 marks].

4.   Examine the methods used by Samori Toure in establishing the Mandinka Empire by 1884.

     Samori founded an empire in the western Sudan through trade, sound administration, military
     strength and later Islamization. He rose to power in the highlands of Eastern Guinea at a time when
     they were torn apart by the ambitions of rival Dyula clans. Samori’s experience as a Dyula trader
     was invaluable in his rise to power. He then built up his own army. Through his brilliant gifts as a
     military strategist, he won the devotion of his soldiers and founded a small state in Konyan and then
     an empire with its capital at Bissandugu. He was aware of the importance of a flourishing
     economy. The state controlled markets and trade and organized agriculture. By 1882 he had built
     up a powerful professional, well trained and disciplined army. His experience as a successful trader
     enabled him to ensure a regular supply of food and equipment for his army of 30 000 men,
     mostly foot soldiery but with an elite cavalry corps. They were well armed with muskets and rifles,
     imported through Freetown through the sale of gold and ivory or manufactured and repaired by his
     own metalworkers. His small units of riflemen were trained to shoot accurately.

     His soldiers were united with him in Mandinka nationalism and Islamic faith. He won the support
     of the Dyula by keeping their trade routes open and opposing the exactions of local chiefs. He won
     the support of some African chiefs through marriage alliances. As his state expanded, he identified
     increasingly with Islam, seeing it as a unifying ideology for his new empire and in 1884 took the
     title of Almami. His empire was divided into six sections: the central section, almost half of the
     whole, which was ruled by Samori himself and five provinces ruled by governors.

5.   To what extent did the activities of Leopold II of Belgium in the Congo and the British
     occupation of Egypt contribute to the European partition of Africa up to 1900?

     Leopold hosted an international conference on Africa in Brussels in 1876. It became apparent that
     he aimed to make massive trading profits for himself and establish a political empire in the
     Congo region. His agent, Henry Morton Stanley, began to set up trading settlements in the Congo
     in 1879. Stanley’s activities stimulated French activity in the Congo region and indirectly led to the
     De Brazza-Makoko treaty. Leopold and Stanley stepped up their activities in the Congo and the
     Congo Free State was established in 1884. Rivalry over the Congo was an important reason for
     calling the Berlin West Africa Conference, which met at the end of 1884.

     In 1882, Gladstone sent the British fleet to bomb Alexandria and defeat the nationalist revolution
     led by Urabi and then appointed Lord Cromer to administer Egypt until Egyptian debts to Europe
     had been paid. This occupation contributed to the speeding up of European imperial activities all
     over Africa. The French, who had joint supervision with the British over Egyptian finances since
     1878, resented British control of Egypt, and looked for compensation elsewhere which provoked
     Anglo-French rivalry in West Africa and contributed to a spread of British influence in the interior
     in Uganda and the Sudan.

     Candidates can argue either that Leopold’s activities or the British occupation of Egypt was
     more important. Those who link rivalry over the Congo to the Berlin West Africa Conference and
     its impact on partition, for example, could attribute greater importance to Leopold.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is a generalized account of the partition with little knowledge of Leopold
     or Egypt.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level there is narrative of the activities of Leopold and the British occupation
     related to the partition.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is a clear balanced analysis of the extent to which the two factors hastened
     the partition.

     importance of the British occupation of Egypt.

6.   To what extent was European imperial aggression encouraged by military and political
     weaknesses in Africa up to 1900?

     Military and political weaknesses in Africa certainly facilitated European colonial expansion
     in Africa. African armies did inflict heavy defeats on European armies, e.g. the Zulu victory at the
     battle of Isandhlwana and the Ethiopian victory at Adowa. There was also prolonged resistance to
     the initial attempts to impose colonial rule by Samori Toure against the French in West Africa and
     the Nandi against the British in East Africa. But these examples are very exceptional.
     African states were mostly organized in small political units based on clans. These small states
     were often at war with their neighbours, as a result of trade rivalries or the slave trade or religious
     differences. Very few states allied against the European invaders, and the alliances came too late to
     offer effective resistance. There were frequent civil wars caused by succession disputes.
     European countries were encouraged to make colonies in Africa and were able to defeat African
     states in war, because of their vastly superior military technology. The decisive European weapon
     was the machine gun, especially the Maxim gun, which had a devastating effect against African
     soldiers armed with spears or muzzle-loading muskets. African armies lacked training, ammunition
     and experience of effective tactics. The European armies consisted of African soldiers under
     European leadership, who knew how to survive in tropical conditions.

     These weaknesses were a facilitating factor in European imperial expansion along with others such
     as the use of steamships, railways and the telegraph and the discovery of quinine to treat malaria.
     They do not explain the European decisions to colonize Africa, which relate more to political and
     strategic factors involving national rivalry and prestige, and economic factors such as the demand
     for raw materials and the search for new markets.

     [0 to 8 marks] there are vague generalizations about the European imperial aggression but little
     specific knowledge of African military and political weakness.

     [9 to 11 marks] African political and military weakness is shown to facilitate European aggression.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is well supported analysis of political and military weaknesses with some
     analysis of other factors.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as awareness of effective African resistance or insight
     into the complex causes involved in European imperial expansion in Africa.

7.   Compare and contrast the relationship of Kabaka Mwanga and Apolo Kagwa with colonial
     rulers in Buganda up to 1900.

     Mwanga sometimes cooperated with the British with varying degrees of reluctance and at other
     times resisted them. His katikiro (prime minister) Apolo Kagwa consistently cooperated with them.
     Mwanga’s first years as Kabaka from 1884 were stormy and led to a civil war and an uncertain
     political situation which coincided with the arrival of the agents of British imperialism. Mwanga
     had accepted the offer of a German protectorate but the Anglo-German agreement of 1890
     recognised Buganda as a British sphere of influence. Lugard as agent of the Imperial British East
     Africa Company (IBEAC) sought to make this a practical reality by establishing some control over
     the country. In December 1890 Mwanga reluctantly signed a protection treaty with the company.
     Lugard supported the Protestant Christians, converts of mostly English CMS missionaries, in their
     struggle for power over the Catholic party. This brought him into conflict with Mwanga at the
     battle of Mengo in 1892. Mwanga fled to an island in Lake Victoria but returned as Kabaka to sign,
     even more reluctantly than before, a new treaty with IBEAC which further reduced his powers.
     In 1894 the British Government took over from the IBEAC and Mwanga’s resentment of British
     rule increased. Angered by loss of political power, interference with Kiganda traditions and with
     his right to appoint his own servants, Mwanga left the capital, Kampala, and raised the standard of
     revolt against British rule in Buddu County. The leading Protestant and Catholic chiefs supported
     the British against Mwanga. They agreed to his deposition and replacement in 1897 by his one year
     old son Daudi Chwa and in 1899 helped to capture Mwanga who was deported to the Seychelles.

     From 1890 Apolo Kagwa had led the Protestant chiefs in consistent support of the British.
     Lugard backed them at Mengo Hill and they welcomed the protectorate. Kagwa resolutely opposed
     Mwanga’s rebellion and became the senior regent as well as Katikiro when Mwanga was deposed.
     Kagwa was the leading negotiator with Sir Harry Johnston of the Uganda Agreement of 1900 which
     defined the basis of the British colonial system in Buganda and rewarded the senior Christian
     leaders for their loyalty to the British by a new system of land tenure. The Agreement represented a
     blow to traditional political forces in Buganda and completed the revolution of Christian chiefs in
     Buganda which Kagwa had led since 1887.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Mwanga and Kagwa and their relationship with
     the British.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level knowledge of Mwanga and Kagwa is used to compare their relationship
     with the British.

     [12 to 17 marks] the relationship between the British and Mwanga and Kagwa is analysed in a
     clear, balanced comparative structure.

     [18 to 20 marks] there is a well supported contrast between Mwanga’s change from reluctant
     cooperation to outright resistance, and the consistent and willing cooperation of Kagwa.

     N.B. If only one leader is discussed mark out of [7 marks].

8.   Analyse the causes and effects of the Ndebele-Shona rising of 1896 to 1897.

     The question focuses on the two communities which had been enemies and responded differently to
     British imperialism. Rhodes and the British South Africa Company acted as if the Africans were
     not a factor in the local balance of power. The Ndebele objected to their loss of independence and
     being given only the same rights as the other African peoples whom they had conquered in the past.
     They resented the loss of most of their cattle, which had either been confiscated by the Company or
     died in a rinderpest epidemic. They also resented forced labour and mistreatment by the
     Company police. The Shona also resented Company rule, loss of freedom, forced labour and police
     brutality. They were forced to buy goods from the Company at a higher price than they were
     previously paying to the Portuguese. The Ndebele began the revolt in March 1896 and were joined
     by the Shona in June. They attacked isolated European farms at a time when many of the Company
     police were interned in the Transvaal after the defeat of the Jameson Raid. The Ndebele were soon
     defeated with help from neighbouring African rulers, Khama and Lewanika. The Shona fought on
     but their resistance was overcome in 1897 by much better armed British troops. Many Ndebele and
     Shona were killed, and trade and agriculture were disrupted. Rhodes recognized the Ndebele
     indunas as salaried officials and spokesmen for their people in the colonial administration.
     The Company and the British government became more sensitive to African grievances.
     The struggle for freedom of the 1890s was an important inspiration for a later generation of
     African nationalists.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of either the causes or effects of the rising.

     [9 to 11 marks] the knowledge of the rising indicates some causes and effects.

     and of Shona resistance.

9.   For what reasons did Khama collaborate with the British and why did the Herero and Nama
     resist German rule?

     Khama became an ally of Britain during the scramble for Africa. He became a Christian in 1862
     and ruler of the Ngwato ten years later. He welcomed missionaries and had for long been a close
     associate of the LMS missionary John Mackenzie. He was ready to heed his advice in 1885 to
     accept British rule. They both wanted Britain to protect the Ngwato from occupation by the
     Transvaal Boers and realized that the British protectorate would not interfere with his traditional
     powers and he was allowed to rule as a king up to his death in 1923. He saw himself as an ally of
     the British, who protected the Ngwato from the Boers and the British South Africa Company,
     helped him against internal rivals and supported his aims of spreading Christianity and developing
     agriculture and trade.

     The Herero and Nama, in contrast, resisted the Germans until 1894. They then negotiated treaties
     with the Germans but the Germans did not honour the terms of the treaties and allowed German
     settler farmers to alienate African land. By 1904 the Herero were feeling the full effects of more
     direct German occupation as they lost land to settlers and railway companies. Many of their cattle
     died in the rinderpest epidemic of 1897 and the rest were being lost to German traders. The 1903
     Credit Ordinance allowed creditors to seize African cattle in payment of debt. All these grievances
     provoked Samuel Maherero into leading a rising against the Germans in January 1904. The Nama
     did not rise in revolt until October, as a result of extreme German provocation. They had also lost
     land and cattle but their resort to armed resistance was a response to the German plan to disarm and
     disperse their community.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of either Khama or the Nama and Herero.

     [9 to 11 marks] the knowledge of Khama indicates some reasons for collaboration with the British,
     and that of the Nama and Herero indicates some reasons why they resisted.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is balanced analysis of the reasons for Khama’s collaboration and for
     resistance of the Nama and the Herero.

     Nama resistance.

10.   “Cetshwayo was responsible for the conquest and destruction of the Zulu kingdom.” To what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      Cetshwayo succeeded his father Mpande in 1873 when Zulu military strength was at its height.
      Despite the territorial dispute with them over land on his northern border, he did not at first want to
      fight the Boers. He favoured an anti-Boer alliance with the British, but they did not want a strong
      Zulu nation on their Natal border. They also wanted to persuade the Boer authorities in the
      Transvaal to join them in a confederation partly to guard against a possible African victory over a
      white state. After the Transvaal had been defeated by the Bapedi, the British annexed it. Frere, the
      British High commissioner at the Cape, decided that the Zulu must be crushed to remove the
      continuing threat on Natal’s border. He sent an ultimatum to Cetshwayo, who accepted all but the
      disbandment of the Zulu army. The British invaded Zululand early in 1879 and were defeated
      at Isandhlwana. Cetshwayo knew the victory would provoke British retaliation and ordered his
      troops to retreat and wage a guerrilla war. They ignored his orders and were defeated at Ulundi.
      Cetshwayo, who opposed Boer claims to his land, ended up being forced against his wishes to fight
      the British.

      The Anglo-Zulu war resulted in the conquest and destruction of the Zulu kingdom. Cetshwayo was
      captured and exiled. Zululand was destroyed as a united state when the British divided it into
      thirteen small provinces which fought each other. Cetshwayo was recalled from exile in 1883 to
      restore law and order but was forced to flee during civil war and died in 1884.

      Zululand, unlike Botswana or Lesotho, lost its separate identity. The quotation blaming Cetshwayo
      for the destruction of the kingdom cannot be easily defended. Cetshwayo did not want to fight
      either the British or the Boers but resisted Boer claims to some of Zululand and ended up resisting
      British aggression.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Cetshwayo or of the conquest and destruction of the
      Zulu kingdom.

      [9 to 11 marks] Cetshwayo is discussed in the context of the conquest and destruction of the
      Zulu kingdom.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is supported analysis of the extent to which Cetshwayo’s policies may have
      contributed to the destruction of the Zulu kingdom.

      [18 to 20 marks] the essay might include a confident, detailed rebuttal of the statement, ascribing
      responsibility instead to the British and/or the Boers.

11.   To what extent did the victory of the Nationalist Party in the 1948 elections represent a
      turning point in South African history?

      The Nationalist Party won the 1948 election and its leader Dr Malan became prime minister. It was
      a momentous victory since the party was to stay in power for the next 46 years and, through its
      apartheid policies, oppressed the black majority throughout the period. The party secured most of
      the votes of the Afrikaners, who outnumbered the English by three to one, were generally less rich
      and more threatened by black labour. In the next two decades many laws were passed to make
      segregation more far-reaching and harmful to the black majority. This led to an unprecedented
      degree of black resistance and violent suppression of that resistance. Before 1948, black resistance
      had been less effective and entirely moderate and non-violent.

      The 1948 election was therefore a turning point in bringing to power a new government with
      particularly racist policies. Also new was the confidence this government had in its policies and its
      ruthlessness in carrying them out.

      On the other hand, even if Smuts and the United Party had won and attempted to put into effect
      policies more favourable to the black majority, there is little evidence to suggest that they would
      have carried their party and white opinion with them. Apartheid contained few really new policies.
      It made the old segregation laws such as the Land Acts of 1912 and 1936 more systematic. It also
      made impossible the political and economic reforms necessary to make the blacks feel that they
      really were citizens of their own country. 1948 was, therefore, a turning point but not such a sharp
      one as it may have appeared at the time.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Nationalist Party policies after 1948 or of their
      historical context.

      [9 to 11 marks] knowledge of apartheid policies after 1948 is used to indicate a turning point.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is focused analysis of the extent of change in government policy after 1948.

      [18 to 20 marks] the essay may stress the element of continuity in the apartheid laws which made
      existing legislation more systematic.

12.   Compare and contrast the contributions of De Klerk and Mandela to the achievement of
      majority rule in South Africa.

      In his first major speech as President of South Africa in 1990, De Klerk amazed his country and the
      world by setting his ruling National Party on an entirely new course. Political parties like the ANC
      were unbanned and Mandela was released from prison. The government agreed to hold a
      Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) to work out with other parties a new
      constitution which would give democratic rights to all citizens. The discussions were slow
      and complicated. De Klerk held a whites-only referendum which supported his CODESA
      negotiations. Talks broke down for over a year and South Africa moved towards a civil war.
      But Mandela contacted De Klerk and they signed a Record of Understanding. Agreement was
      reached in November 1993 which paved the way for a one-person one-vote election in April 1994.
      There would be a government of national unity for five years. Mandela had been on the national
      executive of the ANC since 1949 and led resistance to apartheid until his arrest in 1962. In his
      speech at his trial, he outlined his ideal of a free and democratic society in which all persons would
      live in harmony. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was the undisputed leader of the
      political prisoners on Robben Island. The longer he stayed in prison, the more he became an
      international hero and symbol for human rights. In the late 1980s, he began to talk informally with
      Botha and De Klerk about the future of South Africa. He refused to do anything for his personal
      advantage and insisted on the release of the other ANC prisoners and their right to restart their
      political activities. After his release from prison in February 1990, he was elected Deputy President
      of the ANC and led the CODESA negotiations. He insisted on a multi-racial, one-person one-vote
      democracy. He used his authority to prevent major unrest. He got most of what he wanted in the
      constitutional agreement, and in the run-up to elections the ANC made much of Mandela’s fitness
      to be the new nation’s first president. The ANC had a clear victory. Mandela became president and
      De Klerk deputy president.

13.   Discuss the achievements of British colonial rule in Kenya up to 1950.

      Candidates should focus on successes and failures. It is possible to approach the question through
      advantages and disadvantages of colonial rule in Kenya.

      Kenya became a British colony when it became the East African Protectorate in 1895.
      The protectorate was divided into four, then six provinces and further divided into districts.
      There were not many communities with a centralized system of governance making it difficult for
      the British to use the local citizenry. The Wanga kingdom had a system of governance but this was
      based on clan elders or age set systems.

      Colonial economic development started in Kenya with the building of the Uganda railway.
      This opened up the colony to various political and economic activities. It brought under British
      administration the entire area the railway passed through. The present Kenya-Uganda border came
      into being after it was moved from Naivasha to Kisumu. The railway greatly improved
      communication with the hinterland making many forms of trade possible. Cotton and coffee
      growing and trading were started. The development of white settler agriculture was encouraged
      with serious consequences. The white highland and the low lying land in the west of the country
      and to the north of Lake Victoria were to be exploited to make the country pay for its
      administration costs. Cash crop growing was therefore started by white settlers and became their
      preserve as no African was allowed to grow them. Land was made very cheap for white settler
      farmers with 100 acres going for 50 Indian rupees for a 99 year lease. The settlers were to occupy
      land in the vicinity of the railway line to transport their produce. The occupation of land in the
      central and white highlands displaced the previous owners and caused resentment. To protect
      their interests, it was necessary for the settler community to engage in political activity; thereby
      denying Africans representation. Lord Delamere and Sir Charles Eliot were the champions of
      settler interests. Plantation agriculture required labour which in turn caused resentment from
      Kenyans forced to work on white settler farms. Taxation was introduced by the colonial
      government to force Africans to offer their labour to white settlers for a wage. This enabled
      Africans to pay tax, but it denied them their freedom. It led to the rise of a squatter system since
      many had been forced off their land. The Indian immigrants, who had come to build the railways
      and ended up being traders, were not given all rights by the colonial government. They also started
      agitation for more rights. There was obviously development of infrastructure: roads, railways, and
      telecommunications. Education was initially in the hands of missionaries but progressively came to
      be controlled by the government. Health facilities were built in all districts during colonial rule
      with the same missionaries offering health services. Christianity spread as did Islam with more
      colonial government control over the East African protectorate. Urbanization and growth of
      processing industries became a priority for colonial administrators.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of British colonial rule in Kenya.

14.   Analyse the distinctive features of French administration in Senegal.

      In only four communes of Senegal, St Louis, Dakar, Goree and Rufisque, the French practised
      assimilation, where citizenship was granted to all Africans since the early nineteenth century on the
      principle that Africans could be partners in government. The French did not apply it in the
      Senegalese hinterland or in any other part of their African territories. After 1900 the French
      showed much less enthusiasm even in the four communes.

      Outside the four communes, the Senegalese lived by African law and custom and remained
      French subjects. Association, or paternalism, was the dominant French colonial philosophy and
      practice. Another major feature of French colonial administration in Dakar was federalism.
      This was possible because French conquests in West Africa were linked in a continuous block
      of land. The threat of Samori Toure had shown the need for a united military command. The desire
      to subordinate Senegal and other colonies closely to a metropolitan government made
      federation desirable. French West Africa became one federal administrative unit under a Governor.
      By 1904 it comprised seven territories with a federal capital in St Louis.

      Senegalese representatives had the right to sit in the French National Assembly in Paris, an
      indication of their political equality but not of their right to self-government. There was no parity of
      representation and Blaise Diagne of Senegal came to serve French rather than African interests.

      Senegal was administered by decree of the French president. There was highly centralized despotic
      administration by the French government and local administrators. French administrators had far
      greater judicial power than the British colonial officers and could punish African subjects, though
      not citizens, without a trial. Forced labour was used in Senegal as in other French colonies.

15.   Compare and contrast the organization and appeal of Christian Missions and the African
      Independent Churches in the colonial period.

      The mission churches in Africa were staffed by members of missionary societies such as the
      Catholic White Fathers, or Holy Ghost Fathers and the Church Missionary Society, linked to the
      Anglican Church. They were funded by the metropolitan churches and in the case of Catholic
      missions were part of a worldwide centralized organization with its headquarters in Rome.
      The Pope was responsible for the appointment of bishops throughout the church. Though quite a
      number of Africans were trained as pastors or ordained as priests, after Crowther no Africans were
      appointed bishops until the Second World War.

      The Independent Churches, as the name implies, were African-led. Men like Wade Harris in
      Liberia and Agbebi in Nigeria led flourishing churches. The issue of leadership was the major
      cause of the earliest independent churches which broke away from the European-dominated
      Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, Presbyterian and Catholic Churches. These churches appealed to
      those who sought the opportunity to preserve some of their own culture and traditions in a Christian
      context and who wished to develop an African Christian theology, incorporating African
      spiritual values. They also appealed to those who had little or no other opportunity to express their
      political or social opinions. The independent churches in South Africa, for example, were strongly
      influenced by conditions of life there including the colour bar, alienation of land and problems of a
      migrant labour economy. They also drew inspiration from African Americans and from Ethiopia as
      an African Christian empire. The independent churches were small-scale organizations and
      although they emphasized education, they did not have the resources to build as many schools and
      hospitals as the missionaries did.

      The educational and medical skills and facilities provided by the missionaries were a significant
      part of their appeal. Christianity also presented itself as a new and revolutionary social ethic.
      Christianity had a greater appeal to some African communities than others, e.g. to the Igbo,
      the Baganda and the Basotho, for specific social and political reasons.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of either the Christian missions or of the African
      Independent Churches.

      [9 to 11 marks] the description of the missions and Independent Churches indicates some
      understanding of organization and appeal.

16.   Explain when and why the slave trade began to decline in either East Africa or West Africa
      before 1880.

      This question refers both to the trans-Atlantic slave trade or the slave trade from East Africa.
      Although the British Parliament resolved to abolish the Atlantic slave trade in 1807 and although
      Britain signed agreements with Sultan Seyyid Said in 1822 and 1845 limiting the slave trade, it was
      still flourishing in both West and East Africa. More slaves were exported from West Africa in the
      1820s and 1830s than in any other decade except the 1780s. The slave trade in East Africa grew
      throughout the reign of Sultan Seyyid Said of Oman and Zanzibar (1804–1856). The best answers
      will be aware that passing laws and signing treaties against the slave trade did not automatically
      lead to a decline in the trade.

      The campaign for the abolition of the slave trade started in Europe partly on humanitarian grounds
      and was spearheaded by Britain after parliamentary debates led by William Wilberforce.
      The humanitarian factor was important in moving people to take steps to stop the slave trade and
      abolish slavery. But the success of these measures depended on economic factors. The slave trade
      was less important for the industrial economy of the nineteenth century when Britain required the
      raw material and markets of the Far East and Africa more than the sugar plantations of the
      West Indies.

      Britain could enforce abolition on its citizens but it took time to get other nations to make laws
      prohibiting the slave trade and to sign bilateral treaties so that the navies of each country had the
      right to search and seize the merchant ships of the other nations if they were caught in the
      slave trade. France did not agree to stop the trade until the 1830s and the US only in the second half
      of the nineteenth century.

      It was thus not until after 1845, when Britain signed a treaty with Portugal and Brazil, giving them
      the right to stop Brazilian slave ships that the Atlantic slave trade began to decline. Even then it
      required the American abolition of slavery during the Civil War (1861–1865) and action by the
      Spanish rulers of Cuba to end slave imports in 1866, to bring an effective end to the Atlantic
      slave trade. It took longer to end the Zanzibar-based slave trade which declined only after threats of
      naval blockade by the British in the 1870s.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the slave trade or its decline in either East or West Africa.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some understanding of the reasons for and the timing of the decline of the
      slave trade in East or West Africa.

17.   “The peaceful and non-confrontational campaign by Nyerere earned earlier independence for
      Tanganyika than for Kenya.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates need to highlight the unique non-ethnic nature of Tanganyika’s rapid progress towards
      independence. It lay in a number of factors that include communities that were not in competition
      with each other, the unifying role of Kiswahili as the common language, and the impact of
      inter-ethnic resistance to colonial rule in the Maji Maji revolt of 1905–1907. The failure of violent
      resistance was a lesson that led to a realization that a peaceful form of nationalism would
      achieve more. Other factors include the establishment of the urban-based and non-ethnic
      Tanganyika African Association (TAA) in the 1930s. It campaigned for the welfare of the African.
      After the Second World War it became more nationalist, demanding independence as it transformed
      itself into the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU). Its expansion and popularity was due
      to discontent at the slow pace of Africanisation, the able leadership of Julius Nyerere and the
      post-war threat to African economic and social progress. The Nyerere led TANU was boosted by
      the UN Trusteeship status and the UN visiting mission in 1951.

      In contrast, Kenya had densely populated and centralized ethnic groups that were in competition for
      economic as well as political power. Negative factors included a large white settler community,
      the violent Mau Mau revolt and the British reaction to it. The Kenya African Union which
      transformed itself into the Kenya African National Union (KANU) was not really effective as it was
      composed of the two largest ethnic communities, which made other smaller ethnic communities feel
      marginalized. The arrest of Jomo Kenyatta and his subsequent detention as a member of the
      Mau Mau leadership threw the push for independence off-course for several years. KANU did not
      become effective until Kenyatta’s release from prison. His attempt to bring warring political
      interests together failed. Ethnic-based political parties emerged and further complicated the quest
      for independence. These differences delayed the granting of independence.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the path to independence of either Tanganyika or Kenya.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some understanding of the nationalist movements in both countries and why
      Tanganyika achieved independence earlier than Kenya.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is a balanced analysis of the path to independence in both countries focused
      on the factors making Tanganyika’s path smoother and faster.

      [18 to 20 marks] there may be insight and depth of understanding into the different historical
      contexts of the two countries.

18.   Why did Ian Smith make the Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965, and why was
      minority rule replaced by majority rule in Zimbabwe in 1980?

      After the break-up of the Central African Federation, Zambia and Malawi became independent
      under majority rule in 1964. Southern Rhodesia was dominated by its large white settler
      population, and had been self-governing for 40 years.        In 1964, the ultra-conservative
      Rhodesian Front Party won the election and Smith became prime minister. His party wanted
      independence from Britain under white rule. He rightly concluded that Britain would not use
      military force against its own “kith and kin”.

      African nationalist movements launched guerrilla warfare against the Smith government. The UN
      applied sanctions but these were not well supported and were evaded with the help of South Africa
      and Portuguese-ruled Mozambique. It was difficult for Britain to negotiate with African leaders
      until legality was restored. A new constitution in 1970 dealt a blow to prospects of this, and the
      British government broke off all diplomatic relations with Rhodesia. The situation was also
      complicated by the existence of rival nationalist movements under different leaders.

      Portuguese decolonization and the independence of Mozambique in 1975 transformed the situation.
      ZANU and ZAPU united in the Patriotic Front in 1976 and could now operate from bases in
      Zambia and Mozambique, though they remained under separate command. Smith came under
      increasing pressure from South Africa and the US to reach an accommodation with the African
      nationalist leaders and move towards majority rule. As guerrilla war intensified, Smith tried to
      reach an internal settlement and made a deal with Bishop Muzorewa’s new party, the United
      African National Congress. His efforts were rebuffed by the Commonwealth, and the 1979
      elections were boycotted by the Patriotic Front. He could never defeat the Patriotic Front through
      military means. When even the Thatcher government began to insist on all-party elections, Smith
      gave in. Britain organized a conference at Lancaster House and sent a governor to Rhodesia.
      A ceasefire was signed, and elections held in February 1980 and monitored by the
      Commonwealth led to a decisive victory for ZANU-PF. Mugabe became the first Prime Minister of
      independent Zimbabwe.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the history of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe up to 1980.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some understanding of the reasons for UDI in 1965 and for the achievement

19.   In what ways, and to what extent, did regional rivalry affect the struggle for independence
      in Nigeria?

      Regional rivalry was a major factor in the struggle for independence in Nigeria; a vast, very diverse
      country which contained almost a quarter of Africa’s population. The British had solved their
      administrative problems in two ways. In the south, they encouraged the spread of Christian
      education; and they created a network of educated Yorubas in the west, and Igbos in the east,
      who acted as intermediaries between the local people and foreign economic interests. In the north,
      Islam remained supreme and the Hausa emirs ruled their kingdoms on behalf of Britain. Britain had
      three sets of officials in the east, west and north, directly or indirectly responsible for order,
      revenue, communications and the free flow of trade.

      It was very difficult to find a post-colonial structure that would satisfy the ambitions of rival
      politicians in Nigeria. Controversy raged over how many seats to give each of the three regions in a
      central parliament where no one had been able to conduct a generally acceptable census.
      A compromise was eventually reached that gave considerable powers to the prime ministers of the
      three regions and somewhat limited power to the federal government. The first federal government
      was a coalition of north and east with an eastern president and a northern federal prime minister,
      which caused political disruption in the west where politicians rightly felt that they had lost access
      to patronage and the award of contracts. The decolonization of Nigeria involved a lengthy process
      of trial and error beset by regional rivalry which still bedevils Nigerian politics.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the struggle for independence in Nigeria.

20.   “Kwame Nkrumah was the architect of Ghana’s independence.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      In 1947 J B Danquah and others founded the moderate United Gold Coast Convention.
      They invited Kwame Nkrumah to be the full-time organizer. In 1948 riots broke out when police
      fired on demonstrators and Nkrumah and others were imprisoned. But as a result of this a
      committee of Africans – the Coussey Committee – was appointed to advise on political changes.
      The resulting constitution had many more elected members in the legislative council.
      Nevertheless, Nkrumah was critical of this new constitution. He founded his own party known as
      the Convention People’s Party and this won the election of 1951.

      Nkrumah left prison in 1951 to become leader of government business and in 1952 prime minister.
      From 1951 to 1957 Nkrumah governed the country in cooperation with the British.
      Further elections were held in 1954 and 1956, which confirmed his party’s position. Ghana became
      independent in 1957.

      Nkrumah succeeded partly because of the economic and social position of the Gold Coast:
      its relative prosperity, its network of schools and number of graduates, its professional middle class
      and businessmen. The British were ready to initiate a policy of decolonization in the absence of a
      settler community needing protection. The African cocoa farmers could be expected to continue to
      trade with Britain and there was a generally good relationship between African and expatriate
      civil servants. Another key factor was the charisma and energy of Nkrumah. He was a brilliant
      speaker and tireless campaigner and party organizer, with a radical agenda demanding freedom now
      and justice with equality for all. Nkrumah was helped by the lack of appeal of the moderate UGCC
      and the fragmented opposition which played on the ethnic fears of the Asante and Ewe in trying to
      promote devolution. The organization and national appeal of the CPP also contributed to
      Nkrumah’s success as did his relationship with the governor, Sir Charles Arden Clarke.
      An important contribution to the speed of change was made by market women, wage-workers,
      war-pensioners and ambitious young school leavers.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Nkrumah or the Gold Coast’s path to independence.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a narrative of the path to independence which shows understanding of
      Nkrumah’s role.

21.   With reference to two countries, discuss the extent of ethnicity as a major cause of civil wars
      in Africa since independence.

      Candidates should focus on the many countries that have gone through civil strife and violent
      change of government with ethnicity being a major factor.

      There are a large number of countries to choose from: Angola, Rwanda, Burundi, Chad, Congo,
      Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Liberia and Mozambique.

      Candidates should link closely the specific history of the country to the cause of ethnicity.
      The extent to which ethnicity was central should be emphasized. For example, Congo had two
      civil wars, soon after independence and one more recently. It is also vital for candidates to note that
      in countries like Somalia, those fighting each other were all Somalis but the distinction is clan based
      or religious-sect based. Power hungry leaders, e.g. Charles Taylor in Liberia, Jonas Savimbi in
      Angola and Milton Obote in Uganda, exploited ethnic differences for their own personal gain.
      Secessionist civil wars in Nigeria (the Biafra war) and in Congo’s Katanga province were
      ethnic based. In Rwanda and Burundi, the Hutu and Tutsi had ethnic civil wars which became a
      genocidal conflict in 1994. Other factors should also be considered including external intervention
      and conflicts over resources such as oil or what have become known as “conflict diamonds”.

22.   Discuss the extent to which two countries in Africa have succeeded in overcoming social and
      economic challenges in the period from independence to 2000.

      The social and economic challenges are many. They include the provision of healthcare and
      combating the AIDS pandemic and the reduction of infant mortality. Another major challenge has
      been the provision of primary, secondary and tertiary education and the development of
      relevant curricula.

      Urbanization has had a major economic and social impact since independence. Migration to
      towns was accelerated by education, population growth and employment opportunities.
      Housing provision lost all contact with need and there was a rapid growth of slums.
      Urban unemployment rose in many countries with the social consequences of rising crime rates,
      and problems like street children, prostitution and drug abuse. The public and private sectors
      contributed to job creation but economic development involved many challenges. Government had
      to overcome poverty and sustain growth rates with limited financial resources. Some governments
      coped well with the challenges while others aggravated the problems by pervasive official
      corruption which discouraged foreign investment and donor funding. Maintaining roads and
      adequate supplies of clean water and electricity were constant problems. The challenges were often
      aggravated by political instability, drought and flooding. Countries adopted very different
      strategies, e.g. Kenya and Tanzania.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge of economic and social problems, or of policies to

23.   Analyse the impact of the Cold War on two countries in Africa.

      Egypt, the Congo, Angola and Namibia would be the most suitable choices. Egypt was a focus of
      Cold War tension, especially in the early years of Nasser’s presidency. America withdrew offers of
      aid when it realized that Nasser was doing business with its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.
      The events that led to the Suez Crisis in 1956 and its outcome can be linked to the impact of the
      Cold War.

      In the Congo crisis, the Soviets backed Lumumba whereas the Americans supported and largely
      financed the UN peacekeeping force which restored public order and ended the secession
      of Katanga. America was suspected of complicity in the murder of Lumumba and later gave
      support to Mobutu, which helped maintain him in power until the end of the Cold War.

      Angola became the focus of the most active Cold War confrontation between the superpowers.
      The Soviet Union sold military equipment and Cuba provided soldiers to the MPLA in the Angolan
      Civil War, while South Africa supplied weapons to UNITA, which was also backed by American
      business interests. America and the Soviet Union were fighting a destructive proxy war in Angola.
      Their involvement did much to prolong a war which inflicted incalculable suffering on the
      Angola people.

      Namibia only achieved independence after the end of the Cold War and the withdrawal of Cuban
      troops from Angola. The Cold War helped to prolong South African rule in the country at a time
      when the South African government was also paranoid about communism and the Soviet Union,
      and presented itself as a bastion of “Christian civilization” against it.

      Ethiopia and Somalia could be mentioned. Ethiopia under Mengistu was supported by the
      Soviet Union. Cold War rivalry was partly responsible for the outbreak of the Ogaden war in 1977.
      The massive military aid given by Warsaw Pact and NATO countries encouraged Ethiopia and
      Somalia to settle their differences on the battlefield. The Cold War intensified conflict within and
      between countries. In Namibia it delayed independence, whereas in the Congo, Cold War conflict
      resulted from developments just after independence. In the Congo, America was on the winning
      side, but in Angola the reverse was true.

24.   How and why was it difficult for the Organization of African Unity to achieve its objectives?

      The main objectives of the OAU since its formation in 1963 were to promote economic and
      political cooperation among member states, to help speed the decolonization of the rest of Africa,
      to mediate in conflicts between member states and to avoid interference from outside the continent.
      The OAU generally found it difficult to achieve these objectives. One major weakness was that it
      had no legal sanctions to enforce its resolutions. It was often criticized as a “talking-shop”. It did
      not prevent conflicts breaking out within and between member states such as disputes between
      Ethiopia and its neighbours, Eritrea, Somalia and Kenya; nor did it prevent civil wars breaking out
      in Liberia, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, Congo, Angola, Mozambique and Sierra Leone. It played a
      part in the resolution of some disputes, e.g. between Morocco and Algeria and encouraged regional
      peace-keeping, e.g. by ECOMOG.

      Africa’s general poverty prevented any significant progress in social and economic cooperation.
      The African Development Bank, which grew out of the OAU, helped mobilize finance for African
      development projects. But African development was hampered by corruption and poor leadership,
      the burden of debt, adverse terms of trade, lack of intra-African trade and lack of
      foreign investment.

      During the Cold War, rival power blocs carried their rivalry into the continent in a number of areas,
      e.g. Angola and Zaire. On the positive side, the regular meetings of ministers and heads of state
      helped generate awareness of other countries’ problems and the OAU survived without any
      permanent split. The OAU’s greatest success was its contribution to freeing the continent of
      colonial rule. There was general agreement on bringing pressure on colonial powers and giving
      support and shelter to nationalist organizations in exile, notably by Egypt and Tanzania.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the OAU.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is general description of the OAU’s aims and activities with some
      understanding of difficulties.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is a structured analysis of the objectives and activities focused on the factors
      which constrained the OAU.

      [18 to 20 marks] there may be insight into the complex reasons for the lack of economic progress
      and for the outbreak of civil wars in many parts of Africa; and why the OAU could not be a more
      effective peacekeeper.

Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide.

      0:    Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no
            evidence of appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported
            generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present
            but the detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely
            understood and there are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge
           is limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may
           be present but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth,
           historical knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is
           narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited argument that requires
           further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
           place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
           processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or
           thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications
           considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be
           present. Events are generally placed in context, and historical processes, such
           as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
           structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply
           summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-
           depth knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary
           are used to indicate some in-depth understanding but is not consistent
           throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of
           historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
           approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is
           present but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the
           demands of the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and
           detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to support critical
           commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing
           events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
           and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
           well developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the
           question and may challenge it successfully.            Knowledge is extensive,
           accurately applied and there may be a high level of conceptual ability.
           Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
           historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
           Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and
           well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Analyse the reasons why the thirteen American colonies were able to win their independence
     from the British.

     Some of the reasons that might be discussed are:
       The Americans were fighting on their own soil, for their own homes, and for freedom.
       The British forces, consisting of British soldiers and Hessian mercenaries, were far from home
       and in enemy territory.
       The Americans were superior wilderness fighters.
       The role of leadership was very significant, i.e. George Washington. The British forces,
       although superior in numbers and equipment, were led by generals who were often
       overconfident, i.e. General William Howe.
       The Americans were aided by notable foreign volunteers: i.e. the Marquis de Lafayette and
       Baron de Kalb.
       As the revolution progressed, other nations entered the struggle against Britain: i.e. France, Spain
       and Holland.
       Public opinion in Britain was divided over the war against the colonists. Such attitude in Britain
       did not encourage wholehearted prosecution of the war.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little relevant knowledge of the reasons why the thirteen American colonies
     were able to win their independence from the British.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the reasons why the thirteen American colonies
     were able to win their independence from the British. Analysis is not fully developed.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is a balanced analysis of reasons why the thirteen American colonies were
     able to win their independence from the British. Critical assessment is applied consistently.

     [18 to 20 marks] answer is well structured and clearly expressed, balanced, and provides a well
     sustained argument. Synthesis is highly developed with knowledge of the reasons why the thirteen
     American colonies were able to win their independence from the British. Critical commentary fully
     and effectively integrated.
                                                   –4–              SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


2.   Compare and contrast the role of leadership in the independence movements of two
     Latin American countries.

     This question gives candidates the opportunity of writing about two leaders of their choice.
     It is expected that candidates would explore leadership skills, military tactics and strategies, nature
     and form that the leaders expected the governments should take; their abilities and shortcomings.
     The core of the answers, however, would be to explore how all the above mentioned abilities shaped
     the movements and their outcomes. The choices are many, but probably Bolivar, San Martin,
     Don Pedro, Father Hidalgo, O’Higgins or Toussaint Louverture would be popular choices to
     compare and contrast.

     [0 to 8 marks] at the lower end there is little knowledge of the two selected leaders and no attempt
     has been made to compare them; only one of them might be mentioned. At the top end there could
     be sequential accounts of both, or an attempt at comparative structure.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level there is satisfactory knowledge of the role of leadership of the two
     selected countries that is applied and interpreted correctly to compare and contrast their role.
     Analysis is not fully developed.

     [12 to 17 marks] for this band a critical assessment of both leaders’ role in the movement of
     independence has been applied and demonstrated in a structured comparative framework.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as pointing out different interpretations of the leaders’
     role is present.

     N.B. If only one country is discussed mark out of [7 marks].

3.   Discuss the impact of the War of 1812 on British North America.

     Candidates should indicate that this was a very important event for British North America; with
     Britain involved in a European conflict their military contribution was more limited. British North
     America was outnumbered in population 10 to 1 and most of the conflict occurred on her soil.
     The Maritimes were kept secure by British sea power and the fact that New England was not as
     supportive of the war due to the war’s negative influence on trade. The major involvement in the
     conflict by the Maritimes was privateering against US ships. Attempts at taking Montreal by the
     US were unsuccessful and their major effort was against Upper Canada.

       United States action against British North America made them seem more like invaders than
       liberators. By the end of the war most inhabitants, even those who had not been supporters of
       the British were emphatically loyal due to numerous invasions and the defence of their territory.
       The Treaty of Ghent (1814) simply stopped the war, restored pre-war boundaries and said little
       about problems causing the conflict.
       Right of search ended with the Napoleonic Wars.
       Indian problems declined as US settlement filled in the Northwest Territory.
       American “war hawks” concluded that BNA would not be easy to bring into the Union and
       turned their attention to the south to expand.
       Agreements in the late 1810s between Britain and the United States defined the border and
       relationship between BNA and the US. These include the Rush-Bagot Agreement of 1817 and
       the Convention of 1818.
       Growth of the colony had continued.
       A trade increase occurred and continued in the Maritimes with increased prosperity for the fur
       trade along the St Lawrence.
       Pride in their successful defence against invasion plants the roots of Canadian nationalism.
       British and French Canadians had contributed fully in the defence which began to foster unity
       in BNA.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the impact of the War of 1812 on British North America.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the impact of the War of 1812 on British North
     America, which is applied and interpreted correctly. Approach might be descriptive and/or narrative.

     [12 to 17 marks] a critical analysis of impact of the War of 1812 on British North America has been
     applied and demonstrated in a well structured essay.

     [18 to 20 marks] for answers which might reveal a high level of conceptual ability.
                                                  –6–              SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AM/M


4.   In what ways, and for what reasons, did caudillos consolidate themselves in the nineteenth
     century in two countries of the region?

     Although the question does not demand a definition of “caudillo”, candidates must demonstrate an
     understanding of the term, particularly in relation to the conditions in which a specific caudillo
     emerged as well as the methods used to consolidate power. Answers should be supported by
     examples drawn from one caudillo in the region. Some candidates might argue that Bolivar was the
     first caudillo and this is acceptable. A similar suggestion is applied to Porfirio Díaz in Mexico
     although the answer should be based on the existing conditions and methods used in the nineteenth
     century. Valid examples include Santa Anna; Juárez; Rosas among others. Twentieth century
     leaders, such as Vargas, Castro or Perón, are not to be accepted as valid examples.

     Ways: Caudillos coexisted alongside governmental institutions, manipulating them but without
     completely controlling them. Multi-class alliances linking the rural population with national
     political ideologies and events; the use of local militia; the granting of favours/land to different
     sectors; acts of pillage and looting to obtain resources were also methods used by some caudillos.

     Reasons: Difficulties in imposing a centralized power to rule at a national level which led to
     political instability after the wars of independence; a tradition of autonomy in the regions which
     favoured competition among regional leaders as well as their ideological divergence; the absence of
     a social class to be the consolidating factor of the construction of a national state; problems of
     communication as a consequence of geographical factors as well as of the slow integration of
     internal markets; absence of a military force at a national level – all these impeded the formation of
     a ruling class capable of replacing the king’s legitimacy with a constitution and favoured the
     emergence of caudillos.

      [0 to 8 marks] the lower end of this shows a lack of knowledge about what caudillo entails, or the
     reasons and ways in which it was consolidated. The top end of this mark describes or narrates what
     caudillo is about and indicates an understanding and knowledge of the reasons and ways in which it
     is consolidated.

     [9 to 11 marks] at this level understanding of the reasons for the caudillo’s consolidation (such as
     lack of central power) and of the ways (such as class alliances) are evident.

     [12 to 17 marks] for this band a clear understanding and knowledge about caudillo is presented in a
     credible way and the arguments are supported with relevant evidence.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as an evaluation of different interpretations about the
     topic or a critical commentary which is fully integrated within the essay.

     N.B. If only one country is addressed mark out of [12 marks].

5.   In what ways, and with what effects, did westward expansion intensify sectionalism in the
     United States between 1845 and 1860?

     Candidates should address the basic sectional issues that are connected with westward expansion,
     examples could include the expansion of slavery, the inexpensive sale of public land (leading to a
     division of the population and political power), internal improvements at federal expense, protective
     tariffs and the conflict they cause between agricultural and industrial sections of the country, etc.

     Examples of the issues that could be developed showing ways with effects include the
     Mexican Cession lands and the resulting Wilmot Proviso and Compromise of 1850, the
     Kansas-Nebraska Act, Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry and the development of popular sovereignty.
     The best candidates will connect the sectional issues with the ways and through the use of specific
     events or issues they will demonstrate the effects.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the impact of westward expansion on sectionalism in the
     United States between 1845 and 1860.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the impact of westward expansion on
     sectionalism in the United States. The balance between the “ways” and “effects” is limited but
     is implicit.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is a critical analysis of how westward expansion intensified sectionalism in
     the United States. Balanced and explicit application of the “ways” and “effects” is achieved.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as an awareness of different interpretations of the
     impact of westward expansion on sectionalism in the United States or answers might reveal a high
     level of conceptual ability.

6.   Evaluate the economic, social and political successes and failures of the Reconstruction.

     Successes:
       radical republicans passed the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
       African-Americans gained some political power for the first time
       Congress passed laws to help improve the lives of former slaves.

     Failures:
       Reconstruction did not end racial aggressions
       it did not prevent racists whites from taking away blacks’ voting rights and civil rights
       it failed to revive or even significantly transform the southern economy.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little relevant knowledge of the economic, social and political successes and
     failures of the Reconstruction.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the economic, social and political successes and
     failures of the Reconstruction. Assessment is not fully developed, answer is not balanced.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is a critical assessment and analysis of the economic, social and political
     successes and failures of the Reconstruction.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as discussion of different interpretations of the
     significance of the economic, social and political successes and failures of the Reconstruction.

7.   For what reasons, and with what results, did railroads develop in one country of the region
     between 1860 and 1929? Support your answers with examples.

     Candidates are asked to analyse the factors contributing to the development of the railroads as well
     as to assess their impact using examples from one American country. It is important that they
     demonstrate knowledge of specific regional cases.

     Reasons: as a consequence of the growth of export economies which demanded a transportation
     system that was fast and could carry large quantities; to complement steam navigation
     (Río Magdalena in Colombia; Buenos Aires – Rosario in Argentina); to connect producing regions
     to ports (São Paulo line in Brazil); to connect relatively important economic areas (Lima and
     Callao; Petropolis and Rio); the role played by foreign companies looking for investment
     opportunities and greater integration of the local economies.

     Results: the railroad lines were not designed following the population pattern of a country or region
     but rather responded to economic interests. As a result, some regions developed more than others
     as a consequence of the presence of the railroads (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos in detriment
     of Catamarca in Argentina); made the transportation of workers during harvest times easier;
     emergence of new towns around the stations; expansion of arable areas (the coffee frontier in
     São Paulo); social and cultural impact (newspapers, books; news).

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little relevant knowledge of reasons and results of railroad development
     between 1860 and 1929.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the reasons and results of railroad development.
     Assessment is not fully developed and/or there is no balance between the reasons and results.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is a critical assessment of the reasons and results of railroad developments in
     one country of the region. Specific examples are applied to well constructed arguments.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as discussion of different interpretations of the
     reasons and results of railroad developments in the selected country.

8.   Examine the impact of Marcus Garvey on the development of African-American society.

     Candidates might begin by identifying Garvey’s background and his geographical area of influence
     in the United States. They should then examine his ideas and the organizations that he founded and
     his impact. The answer should be focused on Garvey alone although his relationship with
     Booker T Washington and Du Bois might be used to illustrate similarities and/or differences with them.

     Marcus Garvey (1887–1940) was a Jamaican political thinker and activist. He formed the
     Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1914 and moved to the United States
     in 1916, where he established branches in New York and other northern cities. He was an early
     advocator of black nationalism and led a “back to Africa” movement for black Americans to
     establish a black-governed country in Africa. Garvey created a mass following and laid the
     foundations for the black nationalism of 1960s, which would be associated with the nation of Islam
     and the Black Panthers. The cult of Rastafarianism is based largely on his ideas.

10.   Examine the impact of the First World War on Canadian politics.

      Candidates may address the initial political unity as Canada enters the war but will most likely
      address the split between English and French Canadians over the issue of conscription. This takes
      place during the conflict and its impact should be extended to the post-war era. In 1920 Robert
      Borden retired and he was replaced by one of his lieutenants, Arthur Meighen, as prime minister.
      Meighen had imperialist leanings and was a strong conscriptionist during the conscription crisis
      which left him with many opponents in French Canada. This led to Meighen and the Conservatives
      losing in the first post-war election in 1921. Mackenzie King became the new Liberal leader and
      prime minister.

      Conditions occurring during the First World War led to decisions and conditions that in the
      post-war era set the stage for the development of new political parties:
        High prices for wheat during the war, due to wartime demand, dropped sharply after the war but
        farmers still had debts to be paid which were at a high interest rate. Western farmers felt that
        they were at the mercy of eastern business and these grievances grew, leading to the
        development of political parties founded to oppose eastern influence. They were joined by
        eastern farmers in this effort.
        The close of the First World War led to a growing demand for new goals in politics with an
        upsurge of democratic feeling after participating in the “war to make the world safe for
        democracy”.
        Desire for broad government policies that would improve the welfare of the people.
        The growth of industry during the First World War led to a growth in union membership.
        Unemployment rose as the nation shifted from a war to peace time economy, working class
        discontent also grew with the removal of price controls and an increase in living expenses. The
        development of One Big Union, and the Winnipeg Strike in 1919 are examples of this which led
        to the election of Labor members to provincial legislatures and a more prominent role in politics.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little relevant knowledge of the political impact of the First World War on
      post-war Canada.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the political impact of the First World War on

11.   Compare and contrast the participation and importance of Emiliano Zapata and
      Francisco “Pancho” Villa in the course of the Mexican Revolution between 1910 and 1919.

      They were both regional leaders, but neither could form a revolutionary movement of a
      national level. Zapata was of native descent and occupied a social position between the peon and
      the ranchero, while Villa was the son of a labourer who he became a bandit in his youth – this led
      to differences in ideas and methods. Zapata seized land by force, supported by natives recruited
      from plantations and villages and formulated the Ayala Plan; whereas it is claimed that Villa was
      more of an opportunist. They both initially supported Madero against Porfirio Diaz. After the
      overthrow of Madero, Zapata in the south, and Villa in the north, led the fight against Huerta.
      When Carranza seized the executive power, Zapata and Villa both opposed him. Their forces
      occupied Mexico City in 1914. Both leaders were assassinated.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little relevant knowledge of the participation and importance of Zapata and
      “Pancho” Villa in the course of the Mexican Revolution.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a satisfactory knowledge of both Zapata and Villa which is applied and

      participation and importance of Zapata and “Pancho” Villa in the course of the Mexican Revolution
      or a critical commentary which is fully integrated within the essay.

12.   Explain the impact of the Mexican Revolution on the arts.

      Candidates are required to explain the themes, techniques and imagery of revolutionary Mexican art
      and assess the contributions of the revolution to its transformation. It is expected that candidates
      make references to specific artists and/or works to illustrate main ideas, emphasizing how these
      reflected the values and ideas of the Mexican Revolution.

      It is no surprise that the revolution in the arts began at the end of the Mexican Revolution’s most
      violent period, in 1921. José Vasconcelos, a philosopher who had been friends with Villa and
      Zapata, was appointed Minister of Education by President Obregon. Vasconcelos subsidized the
      arts in many forms, leading to the emergence of many innovations as well as the rescue of
      traditional themes and imagery.

      Nationalism as a value of the Mexican Revolution was present in the revolutionary art by a shift to
      more native and Indian themes influenced by Mayan and Aztec art. Frida Kahlo’s use of many
      native Mexican elements shows an influence rooted in the tradition of Mexican religious
      folk culture.

      On the other hand, art gained social meaning and function under muralists such as Siqueiros,
      Orozco and Rivera. As artists were inspired by the revolution, they rejected Mexican realism –
      which they saw as a reflection of positivism under Diaz – and any other form of art which they felt
      to be ultra-intellectual. In an attempt to make art “public property” they changed the canvas for
      murals painted on the walls of Mexico’s buildings. Colour was widely used and most themes
      reflected human activity. Rather than portraying important people, they chose to paint the everyday
      lives of their contemporaries. Their art was nationalist, anti-colonial and, especially in the case of
      Rivera, explicitly Marxist. The founding of the Syndicate of Painters and Sculptors can also
      be examined.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little relevant knowledge of the impact of the Mexican Revolution on the arts.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a satisfactory knowledge of the impact of the Mexican Revolution on
      the arts, which is applied and interpreted correctly.

13.   Discuss Hoover’s response to the Great Depression.

        Initially downplayed the Wall Street Crash and subsequent Great Depression as part of “a natural
        economic cycle, the terrible effects of which would simply have to be borne until better
        times arrived”.
        Believed that the federal government shouldn’t intervene with the economy (laissez-faire).
        To ease the suffering faced by many Americans he sponsored the “voluntarism approach”:
                  business leaders pledged to maintain wages and employment
                  called on municipal and state governments to create public works projects
                  established the Emergency Committee for Employment to coordinate voluntary relief
                  agencies
                  persuaded the nation’s largest bankers to establish the National Credit Corporation to
                  lend money to smaller banks and business
                  cut taxes at home.
        By 1932 changed tactics and used more decisive intervention measures and approved Congress’
        Reconstruction Finance Corporation to provide loans to large economic organizations such as
        railroads and insurance companies.
        Signed the Glass-Steagall Act and authorized legislation to provide federal money to state and
        local governments for public works programs.

17.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Lyndon B Johnson’s Great Society.

      Candidates might begin by identifying Johnson’s (1963–1968) aims and ideals about United States’
      society. They could explain and take into account the circumstances in which he came to power.

      The list of Johnson’s legislative reforms in 1965 and 1966 is long and included new programs
      that would affect US society to the end of the century, some of issues to be considered are:
      Medicare, Medicaid, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a new immigration act, National
      Foundation on the Arts and Humanities, VISTA, Head Start, and Community Action programs.
      Johnson’s Great Society has been criticized for its unrealistic promises to eradicate poverty and for
      creating a centralized welfare state that was inefficient and very costly. On the other hand, defenders of
      his domestic policies point out that it gave assistance vitally needed by millions of Americans who had
      previously been forgotten – the poor, the elderly and the disabled. It is the task of the candidate to
      assess it.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of Johnson’s Great Society.

18.   Analyse the long-term and short-term causes of the Cuban Revolution (1959).

      Candidates are asked to explain why the Revolution triumphed in 1959 by discussing the influence
      of long-term and short-term causes. They are expected to differentiate between long-term and
      short-term causes, but allow latitude in deciding where the boundary lies between the two.
      Candidates should stop in 1959, but need to assess all causes identified in order to score well. It is
      important that candidates establish a link between each cause and their contribution to the
      atmosphere in which the revolution triumphed. Better candidates will additionally provide an
      assessment of the relative importance of some of the causes discussed.

      Long-term causes:
      Socio-economic grievances such as the effects of the economic crisis of the 1950s and of the sugar
      price fluctuation; the effects of the reciprocity treaty (1934) which impeded local industrial
      development; impact of foreign capital on the national economy and on society; unemployment
      and underemployment; uneven social and economic development; poverty; little opportunity to
      access land. Politically, Fidel Castro’s earlier contributions from Moncada onwards. For details of
      political causes, candidates will focus on the many weaknesses of the Batista regime but are not
      required to go farther back.

      Short-term causes:
      The success of rebel operations as from 1957; the growth of Civic Resistance Movements and their
      use of sabotage and terror in the cities, popular opposition to Batista and his use of force; the effects
      of US’s arms embargo on Batista’s government; the lack of support of the Armed Forces,
      foreign and domestic economic elites to the regime; fraud in the 1958 elections; the decisive
      assistance local populations gave to the rebel forces; the role of Fidel Castro and other leaders after
      their return in 1956.

19.   In what ways, and for what reasons, did President Truman (1945–1953) apply the policy of
      containment in the region?

      In what ways:
      Alliances: the Rio Pact signed Rio de Janeiro 1947:
            The pact was an achievement in regional security (including Argentina) that confirmed the
            Act of Chapultepec (without Argentina in 1945) that had multilateralized the
            Monroe Doctrine. An attack on one was an attack on all, and with a 2/3 vote, all would join
            the defence (but each nation must consent to the use of its armed forces).
            The pact created a security zone around the hemisphere, continuing the “safety belt” idea of
            the 1940 Panama Pact.
            The pact reaffirmed the principle of non-intervention “for any reason whatever” against
            each other.
            It was the most significant inter-American agreement to date. It was also the first regional
            defence pact, as envisioned by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. As such, it served as
            both a model and a precedent for the multi-power North Atlantic Treaty of 1949.
            The Bogotá Charter of 1948 at the 9th International Conference of American States created
            the Organization of American States, fulfilling the second goal of Chapultepec.

      Interventions: In 1946 the United States interfered in the internal political affairs of three countries:
            Argentina: against Perón but this intervention ensured his election
            Chile: forced the government to oust the Communist members of its coalition government
            Bolivia: helped to undermine a revolutionary government that was accused of fascist
            tendencies.

      Economic ties and trade agreements:
           Candidates might select and discuss any agreement with any country and its implications.

      For what reasons:
      After the Second World War the United States’ containment policy was more geared to prevent
      the expansion of communism in Europe and the Americas was not one of its main priorities.
      However the perception of a world divided in two camps, one committed to the United States and
      its free enterprise system and the other loyal to communism, which directed the Truman
      administration to take some measures with regard to the area.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the reasons how and why, President Truman applied the
      policy of containment in the region.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is satisfactory knowledge of the reasons for, and ways in which,

20.   Compare and contrast the impact of the Cold War on the foreign policy of Canada and one
      Latin American country.

      Candidates will use Canada and a Latin American country of their choice to answer this question.
      The direction of their essay will depend upon the Latin American nation selected. In most
      situations the influence of the United States will be addressed with policies often being devised that
      reflect the differing nations’ relationship with the United States. Examples of possible areas of
      discussion could include:
         influence of superpower’s Cold War policies
         attempts to remain independent in foreign policy
         utilization of the United Nations
         involvement with the non-aligned nations.

      Depending upon the nation chosen discussions could include items such as the development

      require knowledge and understanding of the civil rights conditions of the Native Americans before
      the 1960s; the circumstances that prompted the change; the qualitative and quantitative changes that
      occurred (i.e. from passive to active; from moderated to radical); and its achievements and/or lack
      of them. Candidates could select any two countries of the Americas, but probably popular choices
      would be: United States, Canada, Guatemala and Mexico.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the ways in which the Civil Rights Movements of
      Native Americans changed in the 1960s. Maybe only one example is selected.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a satisfactory knowledge of the ways in which the Civil Rights Movements
      of Native Americans changed in the 1960s. Not all the issues are considered and balance of
      information is limited.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is critical examination and analysis of the ways in which the Civil Rights
      Movements of Native Americans changed in the 1960s. Explicit links are established between the
      previous conditions and assessment is well applied.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as an evaluation of different interpretations of the
      ways in which the Civil Rights Movements of Native Americans changed in the 1960s.

      N.B. If only one country is selected mark out of [12 marks].

22.   How did Malcolm X and the Black Panthers affect the goals of the Civil Rights Movement?

      Some of the following issues could be discussed:
      Malcolm X: voice of Nation of Islam in the 1950s and early 1960s initially proposed militant
      tactics as opposed to King’s strategy of non-violence but later changed his views and worked with
      non-violent organizations. His emphasis on self-sufficiency and armed defence was a call to other
      activists dissatisfied with the non-violence approach.

      One of these groups was the Black Panthers Party for Self-Defence. Unlike previous civil rights
      organizations, the Black Panthers demanded immediate equality for all blacks, including increased
      and fair employment opportunities, exemption from military service in Vietnam, health care and
      educational services. Whereas Malcolm X had merely preached revolution, the Black Panthers
      prepared for war. Their extremism and willingness to use violence alienated and threatened many
      moderate whites in the North. The federal government also perceived the Panthers as a threat and
      cracked down on the group between 1968 and 1969, effectively dissolving the organization.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of how Malcolm X and the Black Panthers affected the goals
      of the Civil Rights Movement.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a satisfactory knowledge of how Malcolm X and the Black Panthers
      affected the goals of the Civil Rights Movement. Answer shows some unbalance between the
      knowledge about Malcolm X and the Black Panthers and the approach is narrative/descriptive.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is a critical assessment and analysis of how Malcolm X and the Black
      Panthers affected the goals of the Civil Rights Movement that has been applied and demonstrated in
      a structured essay.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as an evaluation of different interpretations of how
      Malcolm X and the Black Panthers affected the goals of the Civil Rights Movement.

23.   Discuss the reasons for the re-establishment of democracy in one Latin American country
      after 1980.

      Answers will vary according to the country selected. Candidates are expected to identify the main
      factors leading to the end of military dictatorships and the reintroduction to democracy in any
      country of their choice. This is an opportunity for many candidates to explore their national history;
      however answers should provide detail as well as an explicit link between the problems of the
      military governments and the reintroduction of democracy.

      Reasons may include: economic and social crises, foreign debt, the influence of other countries,
      loss of prestige of the armed forces, the role of political parties and leaders.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge of the reasons for the return of democracy in the
      selected country.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a satisfactory knowledge of the reasons for the return of democracy in
      the country. Not all the issues are considered.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is critical examination and analysis of the reasons for the return of
      democracy in the country. Explicit links are established between the previous conditions (such as
      the problems of the military governments) and assessment is well applied.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as an evaluation of different interpretations or
      historical events explaining the reasons for the return of democracy.

24.   “The domination of the United States over the international order in the 1990s was only
      temporary.” To what extent do you agree with this view?

      This question gives the opportunity for thoughtful candidates to write an original essay. It is
      expected that a brief explanation of to what extent domination was temporary (was it a moment or a
      permanent trend?) and then the reasons would be given: the collapse of the Soviet Union and the
      end of the Cold War; entrepreneurs based in the US dominated the “new global economy” and its
      most obvious by-product, the internet. The US projected its economic power onto the world driving
      forward the process of globalization; in international trade it played a key role sponsoring the
      change of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1995 into a permanent institution
      that would work for the progressive lowering of tariffs, the World Trade Organization (WTO).
      It also persuaded the newly industrialized countries, such as those of Southeast Asia, to liberalize
      their economy and open themselves up to international investment. Behind this transformation of
      the global economy was the sense that the US victory in the Cold War had proved the superiority of
      its neo-liberal economic model and democratic system. So dominant was this perception that some
      enthusiasts proclaimed the end of the twentieth century’s competition between different social
      systems; the world has come to the “end of history”.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is no or little knowledge about the domination of the United States over the
      international order in the 1990s.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is a satisfactory knowledge and understanding of the domination of the United
      States over the international order; temporary domination has been identified and assessment and
      reasons are provided although not in a very analytical manner.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is a balanced analysis of the quotation and a critical assessment of the
      domination of the United States over the international order.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as the evaluation of different interpretations of the
      domination of the United States over the international order in the 1990s.

Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide.

      0:    Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no
            evidence of appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported
            generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present
            but the detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely
            understood and there are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge
           is limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may
           be present but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth,
           historical knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is
           narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited argument that requires
           further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
           place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
           processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or
           thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications
           considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be
           present. Events are generally placed in context, and historical processes, such
           as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
           structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply
           summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-
           depth knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary
           are used to indicate some in-depth understanding but is not consistent
           throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of
           historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
           approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is
           present but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the
           demands of the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and
           detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to support critical
           commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing
           events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
           and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
           well developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the
           question and may challenge it successfully.            Knowledge is extensive,
           accurately applied and there may be a high level of conceptual ability.
           Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
           historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
           Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and
           well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   Compare and contrast the political structure of the Dutch and the French colonial systems in
     Southeast Asia in the period from the late eighteenth century to the mid nineteenth century.

     Candidates may identify what they consider to be the features of the political structure of the Dutch
     and French in Southeast Asia, e.g. the type of rule, direct or indirect; the structure of
     the bureaucracy; land distribution; relationships between the colonial masters and the indigenous
     people; the way they handled rebellions and resistance. Many answers will focus on comparisons,
     but some contrasts should also be identified.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge about Dutch and French colonial rule in
     Southeast Asia. Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and
     irrelevant comments.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is description of the Dutch and French colonies in Southeast Asia:
     descriptions may be sequential and there is little attempt to compare or contrast; may only compare
     or contrast the two countries in a general way rather than specifically focusing on the political
     structures of these colonial administrations. Answers may be unbalanced or have implicit or
     undeveloped arguments.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the political structure of the Dutch and French colonial
     systems and a balanced attempt to compare and contrast the two. Essays may be detailed
     and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a range of
     political, social, cultural and economic factors that influenced the political structures of these
     colonial administrations and may analyse different interpretations.

     N.B. If only one colonial power is discussed maximum of [7 marks].

2.   “The Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) of 1857 came as a surprise to the British, but not to the
     Indians and it altered forever the relationship between the two.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     Candidates may identify what they consider to be the causes of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny):
     both long-term and short-term. The consequences should also be identified: these may be the
     changes in the role of the British East India Company and the way India was governed, economic
     changes, trade, and the nature of the relationship between the British and the Indians.
     Many answers will focus on the causes, but some consequences should be identified.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge about the British in India or the Great Revolt
     (Indian Mutiny). Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and
     irrelevant comments.

     [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly descriptive accounts about the Great Revolt
     (Indian Mutiny) and its aftermath. Answers may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped
     arguments.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on both the causes and the consequences of the Great Revolt
     (Indian Mutiny). Responses in the upper level of this mark range may specifically address the key
     words in the question such as “surprise” and “altered forever”. Essays may be detailed, balanced
     and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range
     of political, social, cultural and economic factors that influenced both the British and the Indians
     before and after the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny). Candidates may challenge the assertion in the
     question and discuss historians’ views.

3.   “The Chinese tribute system and the Western powers’ demands for trade, diplomatic
     representation and the rights of their citizens were incompatible.” To what extent do you
     agree with this assessment of the interaction between China and the Western powers during
     the period 1793 to 1839?

     Candidates may first describe the Chinese tribute system and then discuss the Western powers
     demands for trade, diplomatic representation and the rights of their citizens. They may identify
     what they consider to be the reasons for the differences between China and the Western powers and
     suggest that there was a complete lack of understanding between the two cultures. These may
     include: Confucianism and Buddhism as opposed to Christianity; Chinese “tribute system” of
     international relations in contrast to the Western desire to establish diplomatic relations; Guangzhou
     (Canton) system of trade versus the Western view of free trade; the Chinese legal system which
     emphasised collective responsibility versus the Western view of individual innocence or guilt;
     differences in science and technology. Candidates should address these issues in the context of the
     timeframe given and with reference to specific details such as the organization of the Chinese
     tribute system; the Macartney (1793), Amherst (1816) and Napier (1834) trade missions; the opium
     trade and its effects on China; Lin Zexu’s (Lin Tse-hsu’s) attempt to stop the opium trade and the
     Western reaction; the actions of Captain Charles Elliot; the Lin Weixi (Lin Wei-hsi) affair and the
     beginning of the First Opium War in 1839.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge about the interaction between China and the
     Western powers in the period 1793 to 1839. Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations,
     inaccurate and irrelevant comments. Undue emphasis may be placed on anecdotes.

     [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be a narrative account of events in the period 1793 to
     1839 or descriptions of the Chinese tribute system and the British trade missions. Answers may be
     unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question. At the bottom level of this mark range
     candidates may place undue emphasis on the causes of the Opium War rather than fully analyse the
     reasons why these two cultures were incompatible. At the top level responses should be analytical
     and balanced answers which deal with aspects of the cultural, diplomatic, legal and economic issues
     within the timeframe given.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
     cultural, diplomatic, legal, economic and technological factors that influenced the interaction
     between China and the Western powers in this period. Candidates may challenge the assertion in
     the question and discuss historians’ views.

4.   Examine the consequences for the Tokugawa Shogunate of Commodore Perry’s arrival in
     Japan in 1853.

     Candidates may identify what they consider to be the reasons why Perry’s arrival created a crisis for
     the Bakufu: the technological might of the US fleet; the indecision of the Shogun in the face of
     Perry’s demands; the consultations with the Emperor and the daimyo which were seen as a sign of
     weakness; pre-existing undercurrents in Tokugawa society which came to the fore; the decision to
     agree to Perry’s demands and domestic opposition. An assessment of the longer term consequences
     may be made: Treaty of Kanagawa 1854; Treaty of Edo 1858 (Harris Treaty); the opening up of
     trade; the Sonno Joi movement, “Honour the Emperor and expel the barbarian”; the tozama clans
     challenge to the Shogun’s power; the weakening of the alternative attendance rule and the other
     ways in which the Shogun had maintained control over the daimyo; the Satsuma and Choshu wars;
     fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1867; the emergence of the genro and the Meiji Restoration
     in 1868.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge about Tokugawa Japan; US power in the
     mid-nineteenth century; and the short and long term impact of Perry’s arrival in Japan in 1853.
     Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate and irrelevant comments.
     Undue emphasis may be placed on anecdotes such as the samurai in full battle dress amassed on the
     beach demanding that Perry’s fleet depart.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is description of the Tokugawa Shogunate and Perry’s arrival in 1853 and a
     narrative account of the aftermath. Answers may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped
     arguments.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on both the crisis for the Tokugawa Shogunate that Perry’s
     arrival created and the long term consequences. Essays may be detailed, balanced and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a range of
     political, economic, cultural and social factors that produced both the immediate crisis and the long
     term consequences of Perry’s arrival in Japan and may analyse different interpretations.

5.   Analyse the extent to which a nationalist movement developed before 1939 in one country in
     the region.

     Candidates can choose from Burma, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines or India. First World War
     may be seen as a watershed with the pre-war period of colonial rule where the nationalist
     movements developed. Individual Asian leaders of nationalist movement should be identified but a
     distinction be made between resistance movements of the nineteenth century (often aimed at foreign
     colonizers) and the twentieth century goals to forge new nations. Candidates will refer to
     charismatic leaders – Gandhi and Nehru (India), Aung San (Burma), Sukarno (Indonesia), Ho Chi
     Minh (Vietnam), or Jose Rizal and Aguinaldo (Philippines). Religion played a significant part,
     especially in the development of the Burmese and Indonesian nationalism movements. The starting
     point for the answer will depend on which nationalist movement is chosen but the Second World
     War is the limit. Expect some assessment of the extent to which the movement had developed by

6.   In what ways, and for what reasons, did the emerging sense of national identity in Australia
     or New Zealand at the end of the nineteenth century transform the country in the early
     twentieth century?

     Candidates may first identify what they consider to be the emerging sense of national identity in
     Australia or New Zealand by the end of the nineteenth century. In Australia: the movement towards
     and the achievement of federation; the celebration of Australia’s uniqueness with reference to the
     flora and fauna; the adoption of the bushman image despite the fact that most people lived in towns
     and cities; the art and writing of this period; the different strands of nationalism, radical
     republicanism and dual loyalty to both Australia and the British Empire. In New Zealand a similar
     set of factors and sentiments prevailed: involvement in the Boer War; granting of dominion status
     in 1907; the rugged and enterprising man alone versus nature; egalitarianism; double patriotism;
     cultural nationalists. The impact of Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the First World
     War may then be discussed. For both: the initial enthusiasm for the war; the idea that Gallipoli was
     a defining moment in nationhood, for Australia “baptism by fire” and New Zealand “baptism
     of blood”; the soldiers come to represent the typical Australian or New Zealander in uniform with
     his values of resourcefulness and mateship; war correspondents and cartoonists popularised this
     image. Despite the fact that the Gallipoli campaign ended in withdrawal, the Anzac legend came to
     symbolise Australia’s or New Zealand’s involvement in the First World War and subsequent wars
     and Anzac Day became a public holiday and de facto national day. The aftermath of the war may
     be discussed. In both countries the sense of national identity is now linked with commemoration
     and remembrance and it becomes part of a conservative imperialist nationalism in the 1920s;
     an example of this is the establishment of returned servicemen’s associations who become the
     keepers of the legend.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge or understanding about the development of
     Australia’s or New Zealand’s national identity.             Answers may include unsubstantiated
     generalizations, inaccurate and irrelevant comments. Undue emphasis may be placed on anecdotes
     such as stories about the soldiers’ feats during the First World War.

     [9 to 11 marks] there is some understanding of the development of Australia’s or New Zealand’s
     national identity. Responses may be mainly descriptive about national identity at the beginning of
     the twentieth century and after the First World War.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on both the emerging sense of national identity in
     Australia or New Zealand prior to the beginning of the twentieth century and the impact of the
     First World War. The response should address both the ways and the reasons why the First World
     War transformed concepts about national identity in Australia or New Zealand. Essays may
     be detailed, balanced and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
     cultural, social, economic and political factors that influenced the development of national identity
     in Australia or New Zealand. Candidates may discuss different interpretations and challenge the
     assumption in the question.

7.   Evaluate the importance of Sun Yixian’s (Sun Yat-sen’s) role in bringing about the
     1911 Revolution in China.

     Candidates should identify what they consider to be Sun Yixian’s (Sun-Yat-sen’s) role in bringing
     about the 1911 Revolution in China. This may include: his time in exile; his ideas, the Three
     Principles of the People; the organizations he formed, the Xingzhonghui or Revive China Society
     and the Tongmenghui or Revolutionary Alliance (other translations include United League or
     Combined League Society); various attempts at revolution which had his support, including
     Huanghuagang or Yellow Flower Hill in May 1911. Other factors which candidates may include:
     the weakness of the Qing government; the Boxer Protocol and the consequences; the Late Qing
     (Ch’ing) Reform Movement’s military, educational and constitutional reforms and growing
     resentment; Railway Recovery Movement; influence of other revolutionary groups in exile;
     the accidental nature of how the 1911 Revolution actually started and gained support; role of
     Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-k’ai).

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge about Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) and the
     1911 Revolution. Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate and irrelevant
     comments. Undue emphasis may be placed on anecdotes such as the Qing (Ch’ing) government’s
     attempt to assassinate him.

     [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of events in
     China leading up to the 1911 Revolution or a biographical account of Sun’s life. Answers may be
     unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question. Answers may focus on both assessing the
     importance of Sun’s role and other factors in bringing about the 1911 Revolution. Essays may be
     detailed, balanced and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a range of
     political, social and economic factors that contributed to the 1911 Revolution and in particular
     Sun’s role. Candidates may analyse different historians’ views.

8.   Compare and contrast the attitudes of China and Japan to reform and change during the
     period 1861 to 1894.

     Candidates should identify what they consider to be the response of the government and the
     bureaucracy in China to the concepts of reform and change. This may include a discussion of the
     Tongzhi (T’ung-chih) restoration of Confucian government; the weakness and conservatism of the
     central government; Cixi’s (Tz’u-hsi’s) power; roles of Zeng Guofan (Tseng Kuo-fan),
     Li Hongzhang (Li Hung-chang), Zuo Zongtang (Tso Tsung-t’ang) and Prince Gong (Kung);
     the aims of the Self-Strengthening Movement and the attempted reforms; and an assessment of why
     they failed. The response of the samurai class in Japan to these concepts also may be examined:
     Sonno Joi movement, “Honour the Emperor and expel the barbarian”; rise of Satsuma and
     Choshu clans; fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate; the Meiji Restoration; the Regency and
     Imperial rule; “Western science and Eastern ethics”; political, cultural, economic, military and
     social reasons why the reforms were so successful in Japan; Shintoism, Confucianism and
     Buddhism; reform from above; readiness for reform. Many answers will focus on contrasts, but
     comparisons should also be identified.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge or understanding of reform and change in China
     and Japan in the period 1861 to 1894. Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations,
     inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments.

     [9 to 11 marks] essays at this level may be narrative or descriptive accounts of the Chinese and
     Japanese attempts at reform and change in the period 1861 to 1894: descriptions may be one after
     the other with little attempt to compare or contrast; may only contrast the responses of the two
     countries to change in a general way rather than specifically focusing on the attitudes to both reform
     and change. Answers may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

     [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question and a balanced attempt to compare and
     contrast the attitudes in both China and Japan to reform and change in the period 1861 to 1894.
     Essays may be detailed and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
     political, cultural, social, philosophical, religious, economic and technological factors that
     influenced the attitudes of different groups in both China and Japan to reform and change in the
     period 1861 to 1894. Candidates may discuss different interpretations whilst comparing
     and contrasting.

     N.B. If only one country is discussed maximum [7 marks].

9.   Analyse the reasons for the 1947 partition of the South Asian subcontinent into India and
     Pakistan.

     Candidates may first describe British rule of the South Asian subcontinent and the growth of the
     nationalist movements in the period prior to the Second World War. The policies of the
     Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League may be discussed. The relationship
     between Hindus and Muslims deteriorated after the leadership of the League was taken over by
     Sir Muhammad Iqbal, who in 1930 first put forward the demand for a separate Muslim state
     in India. The “Two-Nation Theory”, the belief that Hindus and Muslims were two different nations,
     who could not live in one country, gained popularity among Muslims. Gandhi’s vision of an
     inclusive and united India may be mentioned. The significance of other factors which also
     contributed to partition will need to be discussed. These may include: the Government of India Act
     1935 and those for and against; the role of Congress and Nehru; the role of Jinnah and the revival of
     the All Muslim League and the impact of the Second World War. The League’s Lahore Resolution
     was adopted on March 23, 1940, and its principles formed the foundation for Pakistan’s first
     constitution. During the Cripps mission in 1942, Jinnah demanded parity between the number of
     Congress and League ministers, the League’s exclusive right to appoint Muslims and a right for
     Muslim-majority provinces to secede, leading to the breakdown of talks. Jinnah supported the
     British effort in the Second World War, and opposed the Indian National Congress’ Quit India
     movement. Talks between Jinnah and Gandhi in 1944 in Bombay failed to achieve agreement.
     This was the last attempt to reach a single-state solution. The 1946 election for the
     Constituent Assembly of India; the British Government’s proposals; the strikes and outbreaks
     of violence; the actions of Wavell and Mountbatten should all be examined.

     [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge of the 1947 partition of the South Asian
     subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations,
     inaccurate and irrelevant comments.

     [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of events in
     India leading up to the achievement of Indian independence and partition in 1947.

     [12 to 17 marks] essays at this level focus on analysing a variety of reasons for the 1947 partition of
     the South Asian subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Essays may be detailed, balanced
     and analytical.

     [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a range of
     political, social, cultural and economic factors that contributed to the 1947 partition of the South
     Asian subcontinent into India and Pakistan. Candidates may analyse different historians’ views.

10.   Evaluate to what extent Japanese expansion into Southeast Asia during the Second World
      War influenced the nationalist movement in one country in the region.

      Candidates will probably choose from Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma or the Philippines. The Second
      World War and Japanese occupation may be seen as a watershed with the pre-war period of colonial
      rule where the nationalist movement initially developed. Although nationalist movements did not
      all follow exactly the same path, there are some common themes. There may be some discussion of
      the pre-war situation in order to later assess the impact of the Japanese occupation. The Japanese
      expansion and occupation will need to be examined. This may include: Japanese atrocities;
      resistance to Japanese rule; the way the Japanese restructured the government (Burma, Philippines);
      the way the Japanese used the colonial administration of the European country occupied by the
      Nazis (Indonesia, Vietnam); the opportunities for nationalists to acquire experience in
      administration and in the military; the impact of Japanese ideas such as “Asia for the Asians”;
      Japanese support for independence from Western colonial rule; the immediate declaration of
      independence after the defeat of the Japanese in an attempt to pre-empt the return of the colonial
      power (Indonesia, Vietnam); the subsequent struggle with the colonial power until the final
      achievement of independence. Candidates may discuss the role of a charismatic nationalist leader:
      Sukarno (Indonesia); Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam); Aung San (Burma); Quezon and Osmeña
      (Philippines). Some assessment of the extent to which the Japanese occupation influenced the
      nationalist movement needs to be addressed.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific and accurate knowledge of Japanese expansion into Southeast
      Asia or of any appropriate nationalist movement in the period required. Answers may include
      unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of events in
      a Southeast Asian country during the Japanese expansion and the Second World War. Answers
      may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments. Answers that discuss in detail the
      development of nationalist movements in more than one country should not go higher than this
      mark range.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question. Answers may focus on both assessing the
      influence of the Japanese expansion and occupation of a Southeast Asian country and other factors
      in the development of that country’s nationalist movement. Essays may be detailed, balanced
      and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
      political, social, cultural, military and economic factors that influenced the nationalist movement of
      a Southeast Asian country. Candidates may challenge the assertion in the question and discuss
      historians’ views.

      N.B. If the Japanese occupation or the nationalist movement are discussed without any specific
      reference to the issue raised in the question maximum [11 marks].

11.   “The May Fourth Movement was more effective at destroying the past than constructing a
      future.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates may first identify what they consider to be the events relating to the May Fourth
      Movement. These could include: weak central government; Japan’s 21 Demands in 1915;
      warlordism after the death of Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-k’ai) in 1916; relationship with the West
      during the First World War; that the May Fourth Movement began as an outburst by workers and
      students in response to China’s treatment in the Treaty of Versailles. However, once the context
      has been established candidates will need to analyse some of the ideas embodied in the May Fourth
      Movement in order to fully answer the question. The May Fourth Movement was a part of the
      wider New Culture Movement which was an intellectual revolution and literary revival which
      promoted the publication of magazines in the everyday language and characters. It favoured
      Western ideas such as an emphasis on youth, liberalism, and socialism and it criticised China’s
      traditional society and Confucian values. The May Fourth Movement was also anti-imperialist,
      patriotic, favoured student and worker involvement in politics and the establishment of unions.
      Some candidates may agree with the quotation and argue that traditional Chinese values and society
      were destroyed and Western political ideas dominated without much constructive gain. Other
      candidates may argue that the future directions of China were set by the May Fourth Movement in
      that it gave rise to Sun Yixian’s (Sun Yat-sen’s) revamped Guomindang (Kuomintang) or
      Nationalists and the formation of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific or accurate knowledge about China in the early twentieth
      century; the May Fourth Movement and its impact. Answers may include unsubstantiated
      generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be descriptive accounts of the May Fourth Movement
      and the New Culture Movement; place undue emphasis on the causes of the May Fourth Movement
      and not fully analyse the ideas embodied in it or discuss its significance. Answers may be
      unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on both the events and ideas linked with the May Fourth
      Movement and there is an attempt to analyse the assertion made in the question. The significance
      of the May Fourth Movement is placed in the context of Chinese history. Essays may be detailed,
      balanced and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
      political, cultural, social and diplomatic factors that influenced the May Fourth Movement.

12.   To what extent was Jiang Jieshi’s (Chiang Kai-shek’s) rule authoritarian and oppressive?

      Candidates should look at the period of rule of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) after the death of Sun
      Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) in 1925 until he left for Taiwan in 1949. Features of his rule and the
      connection with authoritarianism: appeal to nationalism, single-party/leader and reliance on the
      military; attempt to create a mass movement and ideological control. There could be mention of the
      New Life Movement and the Blue Shirts. Oppression was endemic; the government looked after
      the interests of industrialists and landowners. He turned against the Communists in 1927 with much
      bloodshed. Features of Jiang’s (Chiang’s) rule included campaigns of extermination – between
      1930 and 1934. Lack of efficiency – Jiang (Chiang) never controlled much more than one third of
      China’s territory or two thirds of her population; warlordism never fully subdued by Jiang (Chiang);
      political weaknesses of the GMD (Kuomintang or KMT). Corruption was endemic to the system;
      administrative inefficiency and self-seeking rule. Lack of efficiency lead to inflation, a major
      reason for Jiang’s (Chiang’s) failure. Nationalists were unable to defeat the Japanese (or the
      Communists) 1937–1945. 1945 – civil war broke out again. No military victories from 1947 to
      1949 – fled to Taiwan.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge of the rule and policies of Jiang Jieshi
      (Chiang Kai-shek) and little or no awareness of the link to authoritarianism.

      [9 to 11 marks] at this level there is narration of the establishment of Jiang Jieshi’s
      (Chiang Kai-shek’s) rule but little analysis of the statement.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is a balanced, focused and structured analysis of Jiang Jieshi’s
      (Chiang Kai-shek’s) rule and a clear attempt to address the key words “authoritarian” and
      “oppressive” which are in the question.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as insight into Jiang Jieshi’s (Chiang Kai-shek’s)
      rule and an assessment of the efficiency of his rule and policies.

13.   To what extent was the rise of militarism in Japan during the 1930s a product of both internal
      and external factors?

      Candidates may identify what they consider to be the reasons why militarism developed in Japan in
      the 1930s. Internal factors may include: the instability of party politics in the late 1920s; failure of
      the rice crop in 1931; extreme nationalism; growth of extreme right-wing patriotic societies;
      factionalism in politics; political assassinations. External factors may include: Great Depression;
      Manchurian incident 1931; creation of Manchuko; invasion of China; US trade embargos;
      Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little or inadequate knowledge about Japan in the 1930s. Answers may

14.   “The Japanese expected a cruel and harsh occupation but found a benevolent one.
      They feared vindictive rule but found a constructive one.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement about the United States’ occupation of Japan after the Second World War?

      Candidates should identify what they consider to be Japanese attitudes and fears at the end of the
      Second World War and discuss whether these fears were realised or not and have further discussion
      about the post-war problems that faced the US occupation such as food shortages; inflation;
      the need to demilitarize and war criminals; the onset of the Cold War. The reforms under the US
      occupation should be identified. These may include: demilitarization, changing the role of
      the emperor; the constitution of 1947; land reform; dismantling the power of the zaibatsu and the
      trade unions; widening the availability; of education. The issue of how constructive the reforms
      under the US occupation were should be addressed.

15.   Analyse the reasons for, and the ways in which, immigration changed the nature of society in
      Australia or New Zealand between 1945 and 2000.

      Candidates may first identify the nature of society in Australia or New Zealand in 1945. Both were
      conservative societies which were strongly influenced by a British political, legal, economic and
      cultural heritage. The majority of the population was of British ancestry. Both countries had
      restricted immigration policies, although there had been some immigration from other European
      countries prior to 1945. For Australia the points that may be discussed include: Calwell as Minister
      for Immigration in 1945 said that Australia must “populate or perish”; Calwell wanted ten British
      for every non-English speaking immigrant, but this was unattainable so immigrants from Europe
      were encouraged; 1945–1951, displaced persons including Jewish immigrants; 1950s and 1960s,
      southern European immigration; mid 1960s, some relaxation of the White Australia Policy for
      skilled workers; 1972, the White Australia Policy was formally ended; 1970s, boat people from
      Indo-China and other Asian immigration; 1980s, people from the Middle East. Initially, immigrants
      were given little government help and were expected to assimilate into the predominantly British
      influenced culture and many experienced prejudice. Overseas qualifications were not recognised.
      The 1972–1975 Whitlam Government adopted the policy of multiculturalism. Immigration
      contributed to creating Australia’s post-war prosperity because it allowed the economy to
      expand rapidly. Migrants were both workers and consumers. Social and cultural change to the
      Australian way of life was apparent by the 1980s and 1990s: in food and in eating out in cafes
      and restaurants; in liquor licensing laws; in the diversity of sports played; in the variety and the
      appreciation of all form of the arts; in religious composition. Australia was a much more open and
      tolerant society, although there were still instances of racism and discrimination. In New Zealand
      a similar pattern occurred, though restricted immigration was not changed until the 1980s.
      The New Zealand way of life was also shaped by the demands of Maori urbanization and the
      immigration of Pacific Islanders.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge about immigration to Australia or New Zealand or
      understanding of the changes to the nature of the society that occurred in period 1945 to 2000.
      Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant
      comments.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of immigration to
      Australia or New Zealand in the period 1945 to 2000. There may be some understanding of the
      impact immigration had on the nature of the society in Australia or New Zealand. Answers may be
      unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on both the extent of immigration to Australia or
      New Zealand and its impact on the nature of the society in the period 1945 to 2000. The response
      should assess how far the society changed. Essays may be detailed, balanced and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
      cultural, social, economic and political factors that influenced the way immigration changed the
      nature of society in Australia or New Zealand. Candidates may challenge the assumption in the
      question and discuss different interpretations.

16.   To what extent was the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 justified?

      Candidates may start by explaining the nature of the Whitlam Government and the issues involved:
      in 1972 the Australian Labor Party won government after 23 years in opposition on a wave of
      youthful idealism in response to the “It’s Time” campaign; those in jail for refusing to accept
      conscription were released, conscription was abolished and Australia withdrew troops from the
      Vietnam War; the Whitlam Government embarked on an era of rapid social reforms in health,
      education, equal opportunity, multiculturalism; these reforms required huge expenditure, but they
      came at a time when Australia was affected by the difficult world economic situation; Whitlam was
      re-elected in May 1974 with a smaller majority; in the Senate (the upper house) he did not have
      a majority; this government was beset by scandals; in May 1975 the Loans Affair involved
      Rex Connor, the Minister for Minerals and Energy trying to raise a $4000 million loan from
      Middle Eastern sources for Australia’s development. In October Malcolm Fraser, the Leader of
      the Opposition, used the Senate to block supply for the budget. This led to a crisis that lasted for
      several weeks and was finally resolved when the Governor General, Sir John Kerr, sacked Whitlam
      and appointed Fraser as the caretaker Prime Minister until an election in December; Fraser then
      campaigned for responsible economic management and won the election. Candidates will need to
      address the constitutional issue raised by “The Dismissal” of whether Kerr, who had originally been
      appointed by Whitlam, was within his rights to sack the government. He did it without consultation
      with the Queen whom he was supposed to represent.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific or accurate knowledge about the Whitlam Government and its
      dismissal in 1975. Answers may include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate and irrelevant
      comments and strong opinions. Undue emphasis may be placed on anecdotes such as Whitlam
      calling Fraser “Kerr’s cur”.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative accounts of events in Australia
      under the Whitlam Government and/or descriptions of the dismissal of the Whitlam Government.
      Some understanding of the constitutional issue may be apparent, though responses may concentrate
      on the failures of the Whitlam Government and the supply issue. Answers may be unbalanced or
      have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the issue raised in the question. The response may be a
      balanced assessment of the failures of the Whitlam Government, the supply crisis and the
      constitutional issue raised by Kerr’s actions. Essays may be detailed and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
      political, cultural, economic and constitutional factors that influenced Kerr’s dismissal of the
      Whitlam Government. Candidates may analyse different historians’ views.

17.   Examine how the politics of one post-independence country in the region has been influenced
      by religious and ethnic differences in the second half of the twentieth century.

      Candidates may choose any one post-independence country in the region. Popular choices may
      be India, Pakistan or Indonesia. With reference to the chosen country candidates may discuss the
      political tension that developed between the ideal of democratic institutions and the desire for
      strong government to prevent political divisions leading to partition and fragmentation. Ethnic and
      religious minorities existed to a greater or lesser extent in all countries of the region and for each
      country they posed a problem with regard to developing a sense of national identity and unity.
      Strong centralized government, often with military backing, was seen as a means of imposing a
      national ideology and maintaining national unity. Each country had its own particular issues, but
      the impact of rise of fundamentalism and terrorist groups may also be discussed. Reward reasoned
      discussion based on historical evidence.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific or accurate knowledge about the politics of one
      post-independence country during the period.                  Answers may include unsubstantiated
      generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments. Undue emphasis may be placed on
      the biographical details of a political, religious or ethnic leader’s life.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of the
      political events in one post-independence country during the period. There is some understanding
      of the religious and/or ethnic differences within this country. Responses may be unbalanced or
      have implicit or undeveloped arguments. Answers that discuss in detail the politics of more than
      one country should not go higher than this mark range.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question. Answers may assess both the influence of
      religious and/or ethnic differences and other factors on the politics of one post-independence
      country during the period. Essays may be detailed, balanced and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
      political, social, cultural, religious and economic factors that influenced the politics of one
      post-independence country during the period. Candidates may analyse different historians’ views.

18.   Discuss whether the Vietnam War (1961–1975 Second Indo-China War) was a nationalist
      struggle rather than a Cold War conflict.

      Candidates may initially establish that the Vietnamese nationalist struggle began against the French
      and resulted in victory in the 1946–1954 First Indo-China War and then make comments to the
      effect that the Vietnam War (1961–1975 Second Indo-China War) developed from the
      unsatisfactory resolution of this conflict at the 1954 Geneva Conference. The relevant points that
      may be considered: Ho Chi Minh’s declaration of independence 2 September 1945;
      President Truman ignored Ho’s letters and did not recognise the Democratic Republic of Vietnam;
      US viewed Ho Ch Minh as a communist threat in the light of the emerging Cold War tensions; 1947
      Truman Doctrine, policy of containment and later the domino theory; 1954 Geneva Conference split
      Vietnam at the seventeenth parallel; South Vietnam was proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam
      (RVN) in 1955 under Ngo Dinh Diem and the United States (US) began to provide military and
      economic aid; the elections promised for 1956 and the re-unification of the country did not happen
      because both Diem and the US feared a communist victory. The regime in South Vietnam was
      unpopular: there was chaos and corruption; communist insurgencies from North Vietnam and in
      1960 Ho Chi Minh established the National Liberation Front (NLF) in South Vietnam; self-
      immolation protests against the Diem government by Buddhist monks; US Central Intelligence
      Agency (CIA) was implicated in the assassination of Diem in 1963. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin
      Resolution legitimized the introduction of US troops and in 1965 US forces and their allies arrived
      in South Vietnam. The USSR and China provided aid to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong.
      The widespread use of propaganda in North Vietnam depicted the war as both a nationalist and an
      ideological struggle.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific and accurate knowledge about the nationalist struggle
      in Vietnam, the Vietnam War and the Cold War. Answers may include unsubstantiated
      generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments and strong opinions.
      Undue emphasis may be placed on the biographical details of Ho Chi Minh’s life.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of events in
      Vietnam in period 1954–1975. Answers may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped
      arguments. Some understanding of the concept of a nationalist struggle may be apparent though
      responses may focus more on the Vietnam War and the Cold War.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the issue raised in the question. The response may be a
      balanced assessment of both the nationalist struggle and Cold War elements of the Vietnam War.
      Essays may be detailed and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range
      of political, social, cultural, ideological, military and economic factors that influenced the
      Vietnam War.       Candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and discuss
      historians’ views.

19.   Evaluate how successful Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) and the Chinese Communist Party were
      in instituting a socialist state in the People’s Republic of China in the period 1949 to 1961.

      Candidates may attempt to define what they consider socialism to be and in particular socialism in
      the Chinese context. This may involve a discussion of Mao Zedong’s (Mao Tse-tung’s) adaptation
      of Marxism to suit the Chinese situation: land redistribution, peasant participation, class struggle,
      the mass line, new democracy and the three-thirds system, Yan’an (Yenan) spirit, Maoist virtues,
      xiafang or downwards flow of Chinese Communist Party (CCP) workers and ideas to the people
      and xiaxiang or upwards flow of ideas and needs to the CCP, gender equality, right thinking,
      rectification, continuous revolution and Chinese nationalism. The success of Mao Zedong
      (Mao Tse-tung) and the CCP in creating a socialist state in the period 1949 to 1961 may then be
      assessed in light of whichever definitions have been selected. Events and policies that candidates
      may include are: Agrarian Reform 1950 and the “speak bitterness” sessions with the landlords;
      CCP organization and structure; Marriage Act 1950; Three and Five Antis campaigns 1952–1953;
      first Five Year Plan 1952–1957; Constitution 1954; Hundred Flowers Campaign 1956 and the Anti-
      Rightist Campaign 1957; Great Leap Forward 1958; Sino-Soviet split 1959; Three Bitter Years and
      the Famine 1959–1961; Peng Dehuai’s (P’eng Te-huai’s) criticism of Mao and the Lushan
      Conference 1959.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific or accurate knowledge about the People’s Republic of
      China (PRC), Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung) and the CCP in the period 1949 to 1961. Answers may
      include unsubstantiated generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments.
      Undue emphasis may be placed on the biographical details of Mao’s life.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be narrative accounts of events and policies in the PRC
      in the period 1949 to 1961 or descriptions of people’s lives. Some understanding of the concept
      of a socialist state is apparent. Answers may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped
      arguments.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question. Answers are balanced in their discussion of
      both the events and the assessment of how successful Mao and the CCP were in creating a socialist
      state in the PRC in the period 1949 to 1961. Some distinction may be made between the roles
      of Mao, the CCP and other leaders. Essays may be detailed and analytical.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of a clear and detailed
      understanding of Maoist theory and insight into the range of political and economic factors that
      influenced the type of state created in the PRC. Candidates may analyse different historians’ views.

20.   Explain why relations between China and the US were hostile between 1949 and 1976.

      With the advent of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) led by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung)
      in 1949, relations between the US and China remained uneasy right up to the 1972 visit of
      President Nixon. Candidates should stress the ideological differences between these two
      superpowers and talk about the United States’ support of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-shek) during the
      Civil War and its continued support of his government as the legitimate government of China
      (two Chinas Policy). Both countries participated in the Korean War (on opposite sides) and China
      supported liberation movements in Asia (Vietnam) and became a nuclear power. The United States
      supported Japan over this period while trade with China was restricted. The Taiwan and nuclear
      issues were a thorn in their relationship. Candidates will probably take the relationship up to the
      recognition by the US of the PRC and their entry into the United Nations. Candidates may indicate
      that not all tensions were resolved.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little knowledge or understanding of relations between China and the
      United States between the key dates in the question.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some knowledge and understanding of relations between China and the
      United States between the key dates. Accounts may be unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped

      explicit focus on the question.

      relationship and for fully analytical and relevant answers with detail, insight, perceptive comments
      and perhaps different interpretations.

21.   To what extent was the role of the state a key factor in determining the success of the
      economic miracle in any one country of the region in the second half of the twentieth century?

      Candidates should identify the “role of the state” to mean the degree of government control, input
      or interference in economic measures in the country of their choice. The role of the state could also
      impact social factors in this context. In both communist and capitalist states in the Asian region,
      governments have intervened more heavily in the management of their economies than most of their
      counterparts in the West. Candidates can choose any country in the region and their choice will
      determine the extent and success of the economic advance. Popular choices will probably be Japan,
      South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore with China, Vietnam and Malaysia as possible choices too.
      The success of government intervention has been the subject of much debate in that it challenges
      traditional free market assumptions. Capitalist systems generally share the characteristics of private
      ownership of property and the means of production and the encouragement of private enterprise to
      respond to market forces. But there is considerable variation amongst these systems over the nature
      and degree of state intervention. Japan will be a popular choice as it has dominated the
      Pacific Asian economy and the role of the state has been significant in determining the success of
      economic advance. South Korea too has exercised heavy control of its economy. Other factors
      apart from the state should be indicated, including outside forces such as a steady expansion of
      world trade, the ease of access to foreign markets, the role and influence of the American market
      and cultural traditions such as Confucian values, which may have favoured labour discipline, the
      postponement of personal gratification for the national good and the reliance upon family, clan and
      community support systems, all of which may play a role in promoting economic development.
      Award credit for reasoned discussion based upon historical evidence.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge of the role of the state or of economic issues in one
      country in the period required.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some description of the role of the state and economic issues in one country
      Analysis may not be well developed but some indication is present about the role of the state as a
      factor and possibly other factors too.

      [12 to 17 marks] analysis is developed and there is some indication about the role of the state as a
      factor and possibly other factors too. A clear attempt to address “to what extent” must be contained
      in the answer and at the upper end, some indication of other possible factors.

      [18 to 20 marks] there may be insight into the role of the state in determining the extent of the
      economic success as well as some indication of other possible factors and possible different
      interpretations.

22.   Discuss the importance of globalization in the economic development of Japan in the second
      half of the twentieth century.

      Globalization is a term that came into popular usage in the 1980s to describe the increased
      movement of people, knowledge, ideas, goods and money across national borders, which has led to
      increasing interconnectedness among the world’s populations. It is the tendency for markets to
      become global rather than national, as barriers to international trade (e.g. tariffs) are reduced and
      international transport and communications improve, and the tendency for large multinational
      companies to grow to service global markets. Candidates should offer some definition or show
      understanding of the term in the context of the question.

      Japan is a special case and globalization has played a key role in its development. After the war,
      Japan’s major trading partner was the US in the early stages of its international trade. With the
      advantageous tariff and quota Japan faced after the Second World War, Japanese imports flooded
      into the US. To maintain its price advantage with the West, Japan moved production facilities to
      other Asian countries as costs rose domestically in the latter part of the twentieth century.
      Since Japan was already comfortable with moving raw material to its own shore and adding value to
      it before shipping to Western markets, it was a relatively easy transition to move production
      facilities to other Asian countries with lower costs. Japan effectively expanded its available labour
      force to include those of other Asian countries as well. Japan has diversified economic production
      to sell Japanese products for foreign markets, ranging from children’s toys to electronics
      and automobiles. Candidates need to discuss the development of Japan in the context of
      globalization and assess how far it has played a key role.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge of globalization and the role it has played in the
      development of Japan.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some basic recognition of the term “globalization” and some details of
      Japan’s economic development.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is recognition of the term “globalization” and its role in the development
      of Japan. At the upper end, a clear indication as to how far this has played a key role in Japan’s
      development.

      [18 to 20 marks] detailed and accurate knowledge of globalization and its importance in Japan’s
      development, together with insight, perceptive comments and perhaps different interpretations,
      which address all aspects of the question.

23.   Compare and contrast the extent to which social structures changed in two countries in the
      region between 1945 and 2000.

      Social structures refer to the distinctive, stable arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in
      a society interact and live together. Social structure is often treated together with the concept of
      social change, which deals with the forces that change the social structure and the organization
      of society. This could be taken with regard to the position of women in society in any two countries
      of the region. Candidates could refer to social movement and to issues of population and migration
      within two countries. Education, literacy, poverty and any or all of these factors could be
      dealt with. Changes may impact the economy and the political structure but with attention
      primarily paid to social structures and internal consequences for two countries. Any countries may
      be chosen in the region after the Second World War with some of the major players in the region
      probably being popular choices. The question could be interpreted in a broader sense, so reward
      initiative and reasoned discussion based on historical evidence.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific knowledge and inadequate general answers, or vague,
      inaccurate and irrelevant descriptions or accounts prior to the Second World War.

      [9 to 11 marks] these are mainly narrative or descriptive answers and contain general descriptions
      of social structures in two countries with few specifics on how social structures have changed.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is balanced, structured analysis of the changes and a clear understanding of
      “to what extent” the social structures have changed in two countries in the period specified.

      [18 to 20 marks] these are analytical, well-focused, and balanced answers, which deal with the
      changing social structures within the timeframe given and the impact on the countries in question
      and perhaps the region at large.

      N.B. If only one country is discussed maximum of [7 marks].

24.   From your study of one country in the region discuss the extent to which sport has become
      closely linked to national identity and big business between 1945 and 2000.

      Any country in the region after the Second World War may be chosen. Candidates may tackle this
      question in a thematic way with examples from a range of sports. Others may choose to use
      specific case studies. Reward initiative and reasoned discussion based on historical evidence.
      The issue of national identity will need to be addressed and the other issues that may be
      discussed include: the change from amateur to professional sport; the corporate nature of sporting
      clubs in the late twentieth century; the development of national leagues; big spectator events; sport
      tourism; international sporting events; politics and sport; national institutes of sport for training
      purposes; drugs in sport; the role of the media in sport. Some of the historical events that may be
      discussed include: the Olympic Movement and the Cold War – 1956 Melbourne, 1980 Moscow and
      1984 Los Angeles Olympics; changes in the 1970s to international cricket with the advent of one
      day matches; soccer and the Cold War; the Asian games; the 1971 Springbok rugby tour
      of Australia.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little specific or accurate knowledge about national identity, big business and
      sport in one country in the period 1945 to 2000. Answers may include unsubstantiated
      generalizations, inaccurate, anecdotal and irrelevant comments.

      [9 to 11 marks] responses at this level may be mainly narrative or descriptive accounts of national
      identity, big business and sport in one country in the period 1945 to 2000. Answers may be
      unbalanced or have implicit or undeveloped arguments.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is explicit focus on the question. Sport and its links to national identity
      and big business in one country in the period 1945 to 2000 is analysed in a balanced and
      informative manner. Essays should be detailed and specific.

      [18 to 20 marks] essays at this level may have an extra dimension of insight into a wide range of
      political, social, cultural and economic factors have influenced sport in one country in the period
      1945 to 2000. Candidates may challenge the assertion in the question and discuss different
      interpretations.

Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide.

      0:    Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no
            evidence of appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported
            generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present
            but the detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely
            understood and there are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge
           is limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may
           be present but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, in-depth,
           historical knowledge is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is
           narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited argument that requires
           further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
           place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
           processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or
           thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications
           considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be
           present. Events are generally placed in context, and historical processes, such
           as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt at a
           structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply
           summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-
           depth knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary
           are used to indicate some in-depth understanding but is not consistent
           throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of
           historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
           approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is
           present but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the
           demands of the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and
           detailed historical knowledge is used convincingly to support critical
           commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast, placing
           events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
           and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
           well developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the
           question and may challenge it successfully.            Knowledge is extensive,
           accurately applied and there may be a high level of conceptual ability.
           Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
           historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
           Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and
           well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

1.   To what extent was the outbreak of revolution in France in 1789 caused by the outdated
     ancien régime?

     Candidates need to explain the nature of the ancien régime, especially in relation to the position of
     the monarchy and the three estates. They should analyse in what ways it was out of date and
     unsuitable as a form of government and social system in Europe at the end of the
     eighteenth century. They should then assess how aspects of it were responsible for the outbreak
     of revolution. Other causes not specifically connected with the ancien régime should then be
     considered, such as the financial state of the monarchy, philosophical works, and the American War
     of Independence, although their connection with the ancien régime might be argued.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the ancien régime in France and its involvement in causing
     the outbreak of revolution in 1789.

     [9 to 11 marks] for some knowledge of the ancien régime as a cause of the outbreak of the
     French Revolution.

     [12 to 17 marks] for analysis of the ancien régime and explanation of to what extent it caused the
     outbreak of the French Revolution.

     [18 to 20 marks] “to what extent” is covered analytically and succinctly.


2.   Analyse the successes and failures of Napoleon Bonaparte’s domestic policies between 1799
     and 1814.

     This is a straightforward question which requires analysis of Napoleon’s domestic/home policies
     from 1799 when he was appointed first consul until his defeat in 1814. Important measures to
     analyse could include the Code Napoleon (1804), the concordat with Pope Pius VII (1801) included
     in the Law of Public Worship (1802), assumption of position of emperor (1804), educational
     reform, local administration, fiscal and economic measures, as well as law enforcement, censorship
     and terror. Foreign policy is only relevant in so far as it affected domestic issues. To obtain good
     marks candidates must assess all policies in relation to their success or failure.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of Napoleon Bonaparte’s domestic policies between 1799
     and 1814.

     [9 to 11 marks] for some description of Napoleon’s domestic policies between 1799 and 1814 and
     comments relating to success and failure.

     [12 to 17 marks] Napoleon’s domestic policies are analysed according to their successes and
     failures in a well structured and focused answer.

     [18 to 20 marks] another dimension such as different interpretations of successes and failures
     is added.
                                                  –4–              SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


3.   Compare and contrast the contribution of Mazzini and Cavour to Italian unification.

     This is a comparative question and candidates who answer it in a comparative structure should
     score better than those who write sequential accounts. Mazzini (1805–1872), a writer and thinker,
     was associated with the Carbonari and Young Italy. Cavour (1810–1861), was a Piedmontese
     politician and statesman. Mazzini, a republican and militant leader of the Risorgimento, spent most
     of his adult life in exile, although he was involved with the attempt to form a republic in Rome
     in 1848–1849. Cavour learnt from the 1848 failures that Italy needed foreign help to remove
     Austrian dominance, and Piedmont needed modernizing and strengthening. Mazzini was an Italian
     patriot, Cavour probably sought to enlarge Piedmont, but embraced unification when he saw that it
     was either necessary or obtainable. The above material suggests contrast, but both were involved in
     unification, had their supporters and played important roles.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge about Mazzini and Cavour.

     [9 to 11 marks] for some accurate knowledge about Mazzini and Cavour, and an attempt at
     comparison, probably in sequential accounts.

     [12 to 17 marks] Mazzini and Cavour are compared and contrasted; at the lower end there may be
     sequential accounts with very good linkage, otherwise a comparative framework is expected.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as excellent knowledge and perceptive comparison
     is present.

     N.B. If only one leader is discussed mark out of [7 marks].


4.   In what ways, and with what success, did Bismarck use (a) diplomacy, (b) economic measures
     and (c) war to achieve German unification?

     This question is worded in a way that it is hoped will focus on Bismarck’s aims and policies,
     and the relative success of each, whilst avoiding an answer that narrates and describes his
     three wars. Candidates can use the wording to write three separate sections, or include the three in
     one continuous answer which addresses the three sections. Analysis of the impact of diplomacy,
     economic strength, and military victories were all important in achieving unification. Candidates
     might also consider if unification was planned, or if Bismarck seized opportunities as they arose.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of any of the following: Bismarck’s diplomacy, or economic
     measures, or war in relation to German unification.

     [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding of how Bismarck’s use of diplomacy, economic measures
     and war helped to achieve German unification.

     [12 to 17 marks] for focused analysis of Bismarck’s use of diplomacy, economic measures and war,
     and their success in bringing about German unification.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as the relative importance of the three is included.

     N.B. If only one is discussed mark out of [7 marks].

     N.B. If only two are discussed mark out of [13 marks].
                                                  –5–               SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


5.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Muhammad Ali succeed in establishing and
     maintaining himself as ruler of Egypt?

     Muhammad Ali (1769–1849) entered Turkish service, fought against the French, and through
     intrigue and later French support forced the Sultan to appoint him as ruler of Egypt in 1805 and
     concede supreme authority to him in 1811. He established and maintained power with French help,
     a powerful army, military conquests and wars against Turkey in 1832–1833 and 1839–1841.

     Results included causing concern amongst the major European powers, who forced him to surrender
     some of his conquests in exchange for recognition as hereditary ruler of Egypt; his dynasty ruled
     Egypt until 1952.

     [0 to 8 marks] for vague generalizations about how Muhammad Ali became ruler of Egypt, and
     his rule.

     [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding of how Muhammad Ali became ruler of Egypt, and the
     results of his rule.

     [12 to 17 marks] for a well supported analysis of Muhammad’s rise and rule of Egypt.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as in depth appreciation of results in Egypt and
     Europe and the Middle East.


6.   Analyse the reasons for the decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire during the nineteenth and
     early twentieth century.

     The Ottoman or Turkish Empire was considered to be in decline throughout the nineteenth century
     due to weak sultans, poor government and institutions and military and economic weakness;
     however it was bolstered and used by various European countries for their own political ends.
     Turkey joined Germany and Austria in the First World War in November 1914, and was attacked
     by Russian troops in the Caucasus and British and imperial forces in Mesopotamia. The Treaty of
     Sèvres (1920) was accepted by Turkey, but never ratified. Losses were resented, and the republican
     movement under Mustapha Kemal grew. The Sultanate was abolished in 1922, and the milder
     Treaty of Lausanne accepted, which included the loss of all territories occupied by non-Turks.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire.

     [9 to 11 marks] the decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire is described, with some discussion on
     why it happened.

     [12 to 17 marks] the decline and fall of the Ottoman Empire is analysed in a well substantiated and
     focused answer.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as different interpretations of decline and fall.
                                                   –6–              SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


7.   “Napoleon III’s attraction to an ambitious foreign policy was the main cause of his downfall.”
     To what extent do you agree with this judgement?

     Napoleon III, (1808–1873), was elected President of the Second French Republic in 1848, extended
     his presidency by a coup d’état in 1851, and became Emperor in 1852. Candidates could begin by
     commenting on reasons for Napoleon’s attraction to a vigorous foreign policy. As the “heir” to
     Napoleon Bonaparte, it was probably expected that he would pursue an assertive foreign policy in
     order to bring glory and prestige to France. The main areas of foreign involvement,
     e.g. Crimean War, Italian unification, Mexico, and relations with Bismarck (including the
     Franco-Prussian War), should be analysed in relation to how far they were ambitious and to what
     extent they were responsible for causing his downfall. Candidates could then note other causes, but
     those who deny the quotation without analysing his foreign policy and just substitute other reasons,
     will not score well.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of Napoleon III’s foreign policy and his fall.

     [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding and description of Napoleon III’s foreign policy,
     and his fall.

     [12 to 17 marks] Napoleon III’s foreign policy is analysed to explain why it could be considered
     ambitious and in what ways it led to his fall.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as perceptive analysis of to what extent it was the
     main cause of his fall.
                                                  –7–              SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


8.   Compare and contrast the domestic policies of Disraeli and Gladstone.

     This question will probably be confined by most candidates to the periods when Disraeli and
     Gladstone were prime ministers. This is fine, but also allow material from their earlier careers
     if relevant. Disraeli was prime minister briefly in 1868 and 1874–1880. Gladstone was prime
     minister 1868 to 1874, 1880–1885, briefly in 1886, and 1892–1894. Candidates may make general
     comments about the two, such as Disraeli was more interested in foreign and imperial affairs and
     Gladstone was obsessed with Ireland. His last two periods in office tackled little but Irish affairs.
     Another contrast is that Disraeli’s domestic policies, partly due to Cross, were largely social.
     Whilst carried out under Gladstone, economic and work were mainly institutional reforms.

     For comparison:
       both widened the franchise; Disraeli in the 1867 Reform Act, and Gladstone in the Ballot act,
       1872, and 3rd Reform Act, 1884
       both improved education; Disraeli in the 1876 Education Act, and University reform, Gladstone
       in the 1870 Education Act and in removing the religious test for University entrance
       both helped the Trade Union movement.

     For contrast:
       Disraeli passed numerous acts to improve social and working conditions. Some of these are,
       Public Health Act, Factory Act, Food and Drinks Act, Merchant Shipping Act, River Pollution
       Act, Artisans Dwelling Act. Gladstone passed the Licensing Act in 1872, which might be
       considered a social measure
       Gladstone reformed the army, with Cardwell’s army reform measure, reorganised the
       Judicature Act of 1873 and also reformed the Civil Service, opening it to all who passed the
       entry exam. Disraeli did not legislate in these areas.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of both prime ministers

     [9 to 11 marks] for answers that show some knowledge and understanding of both, perhaps in
     sequential narratives.

     [12 to 17 marks] at this level candidates will compare and contrast both, in a comparative structure,
     or at the lower end with good linkage. At the top end candidates will show depth and detail, and
     generally the answers will be balanced.

     [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension is demanded for this level, such as different interpretations of
     their aims and achievements.

     N.B. If only Disraeli or Gladstone is addressed mark out of [7 marks].
                                                 –8–              SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


9.   To what extent did Alexander II succeed in his attempts to modernize Russia?

     Candidates need to explain the situation which faced Alexander II after he came to power in 1855
     and the perceptions of his reign as a progressive one. The question examines the modernization of
     the tsarist state and the transformation of Russia from a backward medieval state to the beginnings
     of a modern one. Candidates should write about the tsar’s aims and motives as well as outlining
     the major reforms he instigated such as emancipation, the local government reforms,
     and administrative judicial, military and educational reforms. Financial and economic reforms and
     how far these were carried out are also relevant. Candidates do not necessarily have to assess his
     motives for reform but assess whether he succeeded or not.

     Analyse and address why he was assassinated in 1881, how long lasting and deep were the reforms
     he had carried out and if he solved the underlying problems of the regime or simply prolonged its
     life and created conflict which would eventually lead to the death of tsardom in the reign of
     his grandson.

     [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the methods and policies of Alexander II in his attempts to
     modernize Russia.

     [9 to 11 marks] Alexander II’s policies in his attempt to modernize Russia are narrated
     or described.

     [12 to 17 marks] for well supported analysis of Alexander II’s modernizing policies and judgement
     is given on his successes and failures.

     [18 to 20 marks] for an in depth and perceptive analysis of to what extent Alexander II succeeded in
     modernizing Russia.
                                                   –9–               SPEC/3/HIST2/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


10.   “The outbreak of war in 1914 postponed the downfall of Nicholas II but also contributed to
      his overthrow in the first 1917 Russian revolution.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Candidates will need to explain the relative weaknesses of Nicholas II after the 1905 Revolution
      and the failure of the Dumas, etc.; the weakness of the tsarist autocracy, an assessment of the
      character, policies and actions of the tsar – the extent to which his position was weak in 1914.
      How did the tsarist system change? Candidates could refer to Stolypin’s reforms, how the tsar
      could have backed the Duma and given some of the privileged sections of Russian society
      more concessions. Candidates then need to indicate that war in 1914 caused a wave of patriotic
      support for the tsar, but the events of 1914–1917 weakened both the tsar and Russia, as well as
      increasing support for the opposition.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the effect of the outbreak of the First World War on the
      downfall of Nicholas II of Russia.

      [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding and narrative of the effects of the First World War on the
      position of Nicholas II.

      [12 to 17 marks] the relationship of the First World War between 1914 and 1917 and the downfall
      of Nicholas II is analysed in a structured and focused answer.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as different interpretations of the effects on Nicholas II
      are evaluated.


11.   “Wars frequently begin ten years before the first shot is fired.” To what extent does this
      statement explain the outbreak of the First World War?

      This should be a popular choice and the question invites candidates to look back to 1904 or even
      earlier for possible causes of the outbreak of the First World War. Some candidates will go back
      further – into the Alliance system as well as economic, naval and colonial rivalries and some of the
      more traditional causes of the war. Candidates could also analyse the immediate “trigger” for war –
      such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in order to connect it to previous problems.

      Candidates can use their considerable knowledge about the causes of the First World War and will
      comment on the rivalries between the Great powers, the various crises, Balkan nationalism, etc.
      But they should also evaluate the relative importance of long-term and short-term causes and come
      up with a valid judgment of their “causes” in the context of the question posed.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little understanding of the meaning of the quotation, or knowledge of the causes
      of the First World War.

      [9 to 11 marks] at this level candidates will narrate causes of the First World War.

      [12 to 17 marks] emphasis of events between 1904 and 1914 will be the main focus of a structured
      analytical answer.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as perceptive interpretation of the quotation will be added.

12.   Discuss the effects on Germany in the First World War of (a) the weakness of her allies
      and (b) the entry of the United States.

      In comparison both were key factors in the defeat of Germany. Germany’s allies (together they
      were known as the Central Powers) were Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.
      Although there were some successes on the eastern frontier, they were more of a liability than
      an asset. The United States entered the war as an associated power supporting the Allies,
      in April 1917. Although their troops were not ready until later, the advent of fresh, well armed
      troops on the all important Western Front was an important factor in the allied victory.

      For contrast, the different strengths and weaknesses of the Central Powers and the United States
      should be addressed.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge and no real discussion of the effects on Germany of her allies
      and her enemy, the US.

      [9 to 11 marks] at this level a sequential account of the effects on Germany of the allies and the US,
      with an attempt at discussion, will be given.

      [12 to 17 marks] the effects on Germany of her allies and the role of the US will be discussed
      analytically in a comparative structure.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as excellent depth and detail will be added.

      N.B. If only one is discussed mark out of [12 marks].

13.   In what ways, and for what reasons, was the mandate system responsible for the rise of
      independence movements in the Middle East between 1920 and 1939?

      This question is an invitation for candidates to assess British and French administration in the
      Middle East and its impact on local affairs. Since no prescribed number of independence
      movements is specified, the candidates could see this as a comparative question in which a number
      of mandates are assessed for common themes. Alternatively, the British and French systems could
      be compared. However, if one example is done well the candidate should receive credit. The time
      period specified means that candidates can begin with the King-Crane Commission, San Remo and
      the Treaty of Sèvres, and go through to the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. It is not
      meant to include the creation of the state of Israel.

      Examples could come from any of the following areas: British mandates in Palestine, Iraq,
      and Transjordan; French mandates in Syria and Lebanon. The British inconsistency in backing
      Arab independence and the native frustration with their administration are of key importance.
      Failed French attempts to divide Syria into smaller areas to manage the independence movement are
      also important. Zionism in Palestine is also a factor that bears mentioning. Additionally, analysis
      of the impact of independence granted to the Hejaz would certainly be relevant to this question.
      Iraqi independence in 1932 is a symbol of the success of independence movements in the region.
      Do not expect all of the above.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the mandate system and its importance in the rise of
      independence movements in the Middle East.

      [9 to 11 marks] at this level there is some understanding and description of the ways the mandate
      system contributed to the rise of independence movements.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is thorough analysis of why and how the mandate system was responsible for
      the rise of independence movements in the Middle East.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as different interpretations is present.

14.   To what extent do you agree with the assessment that Atatürk achieved his primary objectives
      for Turkey between 1920 and 1938?

      Candidates should first identify the primary objectives of Atatürk – these include the establishment
      of an independent Turkish state and the six aims that Atatürk himself outlined: republicanism,
      nationalism, populism (government belongs to all the Turkish people regardless of rank, class
      or sex), secularism, statism (state capitalism and socialistic economic policies), and reformism
      (modernization); as well as women’s rights, and foreign policy objectives. Candidates should then
      determine how successful they feel that Atatürk was in achieving these goals in his lifetime.

      Many candidates will point to the successes in expelling the Allied powers; renegotiating the terms
      of the Treaty of Sèvres through Lausanne (1923), success in the Greco-Turkish war, the overthrow
      of the Sultan and abolition of the Caliphate, establishment of a Turkish republic (1923) and
      women’s rights, including the right to vote (1934). Candidates who challenge the assessment could
      identify a failure to implement democracy, the repression associated with secularism, treatment of
      the Kurdish population. Some of the more astute candidates will note that the popularity of Atatürk
      did not necessarily mean unmitigated success.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of Atatürk’s objectives and achievements in Turkey.

      [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding and narrative of Atatürk’s aims and how far they were
      achieved in Turkey.

      [12 to 17 marks] Atatürk’s aims and achievements are analysed in a focused and structured essay.
      A judgement is reached on his success.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as excellent detail and in depth analysis.

15.   Why was the Weimar Republic in Germany able to survive the crisis years between 1919 and
      1923 but not those between 1929 and 1933?

      Candidates will need to write about the circumstances of the foundation of the Weimar Republic,
      the constitution, the association with the Versailles treaty and the immediate problems that faced the
      German government in the aftermath of Germany’s defeat and surrender in 1918–1919.
      Candidates should identify the major political, international and economic problems it faced,
      the extremist forces on the left and the right, e.g. the Spartacists (1919), the Kapp Putsch (1920),
      and Hitler’s Munich Putsch (1923).

      The survival of the Republic came about for a variety of reasons: the relative disorganization of
      political extremism in those early years, the national support against the occupation of the Ruhr
      in 1923, the use by Ebert and the Republic of Article 48, the Dawes and Young Plans, and the
      policies of Stresemann.

      In 1929, following a period of relative stability, the Wall Street Crash and the death of Stresemann
      gave the Communists and the Nazis (led by Hitler) another opportunity. The crisis of confidence
      and fears of a return to economic slump and political instability, Bruning’s policies, inflation, rising
      unemployment; contrasted with the better organization and attractive alternatives offered by the
      Communists and the Nazis in these years contributed to the Republic’s demise. The political
      intrigues which brought Hitler to power early in 1933 may be addressed. Inherent weaknesses in
      the constitution, coupled with the economic slump doomed the Weimar Republic to failure in 1933.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the Weimar Republic and its survival and fall.

      [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding and some reasons given for its survival 1919 to 1923 and
      failure to survive 1929 to 1933.

      [12 to 17 marks] the differences between the crisis years of 1919 to 1923, and those of 1929 to
      1933 are analysed in a focused answer and a clear conclusion is reached.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as historiographical issues and views are added.

16.   Evaluate the relative success of Mussolini’s economic, religious and social policies between
      1922 and 1939.

      In this question, candidates should decide in a hierarchical fashion which of Mussolini’s policies
      were most – and least – successful. In answer to this question, candidates could choose to look
      at the various Battles (e.g. Lira, Births, Grain/Wheat, Land Reclamation), policies towards women
      and youth, the Lateran Accords, attempts at a planned economy, public works programmes,
      and anti-Semitism in a limited form (as it was only extensively addressed after 1939). Do not
      expect all the above.

      More astute candidates will distinguish between the earlier phases of these policies and the
      later phases, perhaps stating that Mussolini’s policies seemed more successful in different stages of
      the regime, depending upon the popularity of the regime at the different points in time.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of Mussolini’s policies between 1922 and 1939.

      [9 to 11 marks] some of Mussolini’s economic, religious and social policies are described with
      some comments on their success.

      [12 to 17 marks] Mussolini’s economic, religious and social policies are evaluated in a structured
      essay, and judgement is given on their relative success.

      [18 to 20 marks] depth and detail of the required policies form an extra dimension.


17.   To what extent was Stalin responsible for the break-up of the Second World War alliance,
      and the early stages of the Cold War?

      Candidates need to explain Stalin’s policies in the closing stages of the Second World War, such as
      the conferences to determine post-war policies and Soviet invasion of Eastern Europe.
      The immediate post-war situation and Stalin’s policies up to 1948, for example the division
      of Germany, demands for reparations, claims for Soviet control of “satellites” to form a protective
      buffer zone, should then be analysed. Other factors, such as Western policies and measures
      (including the atomic bomb) should also be considered. Early disagreements and the two sides’
      different ideologies might also be included, but too much material outside 1944–1948, would lead
      to a lack of focus and/or time to answer the question in depth.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of Stalin’s policies and how they were responsible for the end of
      the wartime alliance and start of the Cold War.

      [9 to 11 marks] the break up of the wartime alliance between USSR and the West is narrated, with
      some comments about Stalin’s responsibility.

      [12 to 17 marks] Stalin’s policies between 1944 and 1948 are analysed, and judgement given on his
      responsibility for the break-up of the alliance and start of the Cold War.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as different interpretations of responsibility.

18.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Khrushchev pursue a policy of destalinization?

      In February 1956 Khrushchev gave his “secret report” to the twentieth Congress of the Communist
      Party of the Soviet Union. In it he surveyed Stalin’s career since 1934, exposing crimes and errors
      made by Stalin against the party.

      For reasons, candidates could include some of the following:
        between 1953 and 1956 there were hints that Stalin might be appraised by the party
        to criticise Stalin, but not the party, for these crimes, etc. and especially the cult of personality,
        so that Khrushchev and his associates, would not be blamed for earlier atrocities
        to win and maintain support
        because he recognised the weak state of the USSR, wished to dissociate himself from it, and get
        credit for improvements
        to introduce new, more radical, policies especially in agriculture and foreign policy.

      For results:
        agriculture, especially the virgin land policy was unsuccessful
        destalinization was misinterpreted by the satellite states as Khrushchev did not intend to lessen
        Soviet grip on them; troops were sent to Hungary and Poland to put down movements for
        independence
        events and policies in Germany led to the Berlin Wall
        Mao objected to destalinization and hoped that he could be recognized as leader of the
        Communist bloc, therefore relations between China and USSR deteriorated
        Khrushchev travelled more and to the West, gaining some propaganda successes, but the Cuban
        Missile Crisis caused fear of a nuclear war.

      There is much material that could be used to answer this question. Good answers will be balanced,
      but it is not necessary to suggest a mark division for reasons and results.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of reasons and results, although at the top end there will be
      general relevant remarks.

      [9 to 11 marks] for answers that understand the question and answer it with a narrative of
      Khrushchev’s time as leader of the USSR.

      [12 to 17 marks] for answers that understand fully the demands of the question and supply relevant
      reasons and results. At the top end there will be specific detail and in depth analysis.

      [18 to 20 marks] candidates in this band will produce excellent answers with perceptive analysis on
      Khrushchev’s motives for destalinization.

19.   Explain why Franco’s regime in Spain lasted from 1939 until his death in 1975.

      The focus of this question is Franco’s regime in Spain and how he managed to stay in power as a
      right-wing dictator. Franco came to power in all of Spain in 1939 after defeating the Republicans in
      the Spanish Civil War, and while this is relevant to the establishment of his regime, there should not
      be undue emphasis placed on this. Issues to consider include the support he received from
      traditional Spanish elites (military, church, aristocracy/upper classes), the use of repression against
      dissenters (executions, arrests, imprisonment, police state), movements to change or alter the
      situation when necessary (act of succession, attitude towards democracy, etc.), economic
      improvements, and US assistance via aid and loans.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of Franco’s regime and why it lasted so long.

      [9 to 11 marks] Franco’s policies are described giving some indication of how he and his regime
      lasted from his victory in the Spanish Civil War, until his death.

      [12 to 17 marks] an analysis of Franco’s regime is provided which explains how and why he
      remained in power.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as different interpretations of his regime lasting for
      36 years.

20.   Discuss the ways in which post-war economic recovery programmes contributed to the
      economic and political integration of Western Europe between 1945 and 1973.

      The chronological parameters are the end of the Second World War to the expansion of the initial
      membership to include new members, specifically the United Kingdom. Given the reference to
      post-war economic recovery, this question demands specific knowledge of the Marshall Plan or
      European Recovery Plan (ERP) but is not meant to be solely an analysis of the economic success of
      this plan. Nor should it focus on American aims and outcomes as this is part of the Europe/Middle
      East Paper. Other treaties and organizations that bear mentioning are the Treaty of Rome, the
      European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), European Free Trade Association (EFTA),
      Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and Council of Europe.
      Political movements towards unification such as the United Europe Movement in the UK are also
      examples that could be provided.

      The issue of motivation is an important factor. Germany was eager for post-war acceptance and
      wanted to involve itself in international movements, Italy was facing political instability and wanted
      economic stability that it could not achieve on its own, France and the Benelux countries sought
      closer relations with the UK for political and economic reasons, the impact of decolonization on the
      push for integration, all faced the impact of wartime devastation. Some candidates may also assess
      the roles of individual statesmen such as Adenauer and de Gaulle.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of post war economic programmes and their effect on Western
      European cooperation.

      [9 to 11 marks] for a narrative account of some areas of post-war economic recovery and its
      contribution to Western Europe’s economic and political integration.

      [12 to 17 marks] for a balanced analytical discussion of post-war economic recovery programmes and
      their contribution to economic and political integration in Western Europe between 1945 and 1973.

      [18 to 20 marks] for extensive relevant specific detail used to form a convincing argument.

21.   Compare and contrast the foreign policies of Nasser and Sadat.

      Nasser (1918–70), was an Egyptian army officer who took part in the coup which deposed
      King Farouk. He became prime minister of Egypt in 1954 and president from 1956–1970. He
      attempted radical domestic policies to change and improve the life of Egyptians. The aims of his
      foreign policy were shaped by his Muslim religion, his wish to modernize and raise the status of
      Egypt, and Egypt’s geographical position. He nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956. This was
      followed by the Suez Crisis, in which he fought Israel, Britain and France. He fought Israel again
      in 1967. He tried to form a North African Arab Empire, and in 1958 formed the United Arab
      Republic with Syria. Relations with USSR were generally good, but later he tried to use the Cold
      War to obtain help from both sides.

      Sadat (1918–1981) was president of Egypt 1970–1981. He continued to oppose Israel, but after the
      October War in 1973 failed he sought better relations with the West, and weakened ties with USSR.
      The Suez Canal was reopened to international shipping. In 1977 Sadat conflicted with Gadaffi,
      after which he issued the Sadat Initiative seeking better relations with Israel. A peace treaty,
      opposed by the Arab world, was signed in 1979.

      Thus areas to compare and contrast could be: relations with Israel and Arab countries, policies
      involved in East/West relations, the Cold War, African policies.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the foreign policies of Nasser and Sadat.

      [9 to 11 marks] for some understanding and coverage of relations with Israel, other Arab states and
      with African issues and of the effects of the Cold War.

      [12 to 17 marks] the foreign policies of Nasser and Sadat are compared and contrasted in a clear
      comparative structure.

      [18 to 20 marks] another dimension is added such as deeper comparison and analysis of aims
      and motives.

      N.B. If only the policies of either Nasser or Sadat are discussed mark out of [7 marks].

22.   Analyse the nature of government of one Middle Eastern state in the second half of the
      twentieth century, and indicate to what extent the citizens of the chosen state benefited from
      this form of government.

      Candidates need to have undertaken a case study of one Middle Eastern state and evaluate the
      effects of the form of the government on its citizens. Nature of government covers the form of
      government: democracy, theocracy, monarchy, dictatorship, etc. Domestic policies, law and order,
      support, opposition, dissent, would all be relevant. Foreign policy could also be discussed.
      Specific details would depend on the chosen state. Probably Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,
      Lebanon and Israel would be popular choices.

      [0 to 8 marks] for little knowledge of the nature of government in the chosen state.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some understanding of the requirements of the question, the government of
      the selected state and its impact on the people is described.

      [12 to 17 marks] the answer analyses the nature of government and how many of its aspects affect
      the lives of the people living within it.

      [18 to 20 marks] for another dimension, such as different interpretations of the nature and impact of
      the form of government.


23.   Analyse the role and impact of religion in one country in either Europe or the Middle East for
      a period of approximately fifty years in the nineteenth or twentieth century.

      A case study which included religion of one country in either Europe or the Middle East should
      have been undertaken for this question to be answered. All aspects of the religion or religions
      would be relevant. Perhaps there is a state religion, and other small religious sects, either tolerated
      or persecuted. Some countries might have a dominant religion which is not subsidised or directed
      by the state, and complete freedom of religion. Different organizations, financial arrangements,
      position, educational status and importance, relations with the state and government, size and
      following, position and training of the clergy, number and use of places of worship (for example
      churches, chapels, mosques, temples, etc.) could all be relevant. State dominance or persecution by
      the state, should be a key area for discussion. Specific details will depend on the country chosen.

      [0 to 8 marks] knowledge of the role and impact of religion in one country is very general.

      [9 to 11 marks] there is some knowledge and understanding of religion during a fifty year period,
      that is narrated with implicit attention to role and impact.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is a structured, balanced analysis, which is well substantiated and focused on
      role and impact of religion in the chosen country.

      [18 to 20 marks] an extra dimension such as comprehensive coverage and in depth analysis
      is included.

24.   Discuss the social and economic policies of either one European or one Middle Eastern state
      in the second half of the twentieth century, and indicate to what extent the inhabitants of the
      state benefited.

      In order to answer this question successfully candidates need to have undertaken a case study of
      social and economic conditions in their chosen state.

      Some areas that could be included are: religion, family life, education, traditions, employment
      opportunities (or lack of them), trade and industry, poverty, wealth, leisure. All areas covered
      should be analysed and a verdict reached as to how the policies benefited or failed to benefit the
      people who lived in the state.

      [0 to 8 marks] there is little accurate knowledge of social and economic policies in one state.

      [9 to 11 marks] the question is understood, and specific social and economic policies are addressed,
      but the answer is mainly narrative or descriptive.

      [12 to 17 marks] there is balanced analysis of the social and economic policies of one chosen state
      and conclusions are drawn on their success in benefiting the people who lived within the state.

      [18 to 20 marks] for an extra dimension such as judgement on long- or short-term failings
      and benefits.
