(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy to
      achieve low unemployment.                                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
       Definition: monetary policy, low unemployment.
       Explanation: of the impacts that might occur on the economy as a result of its use on
        employment, growth, inflation and trade.
       Diagram: AD/AS diagram.
       Synthesis (evaluate): strengths and limitations of monetary policy in achieving low
        unemployment. Monetary policy is incremental, easily changed, flexible, fast to
        implement, does not burden the government’s budget; it is less effective with close
        to zero interest rates, and ineffective when business/consumer confidence is low;
        effectiveness may depend on the type of unemployment.
       Examples: real-world examples where governments have attempted to lower
        unemployment using monetary policy.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory and examples that have already been

3.     (a)   Explain how currency depreciation might affect a country’s current account balance.      [10]

             Answers may include:
              Definition: depreciation, current account balance.
              Explanation: that a depreciation will make imports more expensive and exports
               cheaper but relative elasticities of demand will determine changes to volumes and
               thus influence the current account, Marshall-Lerner.

      Answers may include:
       Definition: current account deficit.
       Explanation: that exchange rates may depreciate, interest rates may rise to attract
        financial capital to help pay for the deficit. Foreign ownership of domestic assets
        may increase, debt may increase, credit ratings may be adversely affected,
        economic growth may be lowered, government policy responses may include use of
        fiscal and monetary policy.
       Diagram: AD/AS or exchange rate diagram depending on the implications chosen.
       Synthesis (discuss): the magnitude of the deficit, the proportion of national income it
        represents, whether borrowing is necessary to finance it, the composition of the
        deficit (capital or consumer goods), the impact on the currency, etc.
       Examples: real-world examples of countries which have experienced persistent
        current account deficits.

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already been
      given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

Answer one question.

1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Overview of Nigeria

        With a population of 173 million people, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and
         accounts for 47 % of West Africa’s population. It is the biggest oil exporter in Africa and also has
         the largest natural gas reserves in the continent.

        Economic growth is estimated to have been 6.1 % in 2014, owing to continued strong
         performance mainly in services, but also industry (apart from oil mining) and agriculture. The oil
         and gas sector was in decline, although at a slower rate than in the previous year. Revenues
         from oil and gas were estimated to have declined by 1.3 %, relative to a decline of 13.1 % in
         2013. The sharp decline in oil prices since the third quarter of 2014 has posed major challenges
         to the country’s current account balance and public finances. Oil contributes close to 90 % of
         export revenues and roughly 75 % of the country’s total budget revenues.

        Lower oil prices will continue to pose strong challenges for public finance at all levels of
         government during the year and will also represent a major constraint on the ability of the new
         government to introduce some of its ambitious programs. It is focusing on anti-corruption, the
         economy, including jobs and unemployment, and security.

        In the North East of Nigeria, Boko Haram, an extremist group, remains a threat. Millions of
         displaced persons require assistance. There has been major destruction of infrastructure,
         loss of lives and increased poverty in this region. The government will have a difficult time
         financing the major programs that it wants to introduce, as well as reconstructing the North East
         devastated by the activities of the violent extremists.

        The major medium-term challenge for the government is to accelerate the creation of
         productive jobs through private sector growth and to make improvements in education (skills).
         So far, the pace of job creation has been inadequate, leading to increasing frustration among
         underemployed Nigerian youth.


Text B — Oil spills in Nigeria

        In January 2015, Royal Dutch Shell, a multinational oil company, finally agreed to pay more
         than US$83 million to residents of a Nigerian fishing community that was devastated by two oil
         spills in 2008. This was the largest ever compensation related to an oil spill in Nigeria, a country
         plagued by oil-related market failure.

        Over 15 000 residents in the town of Bodo will each receive about US$3 250, adding up to
         approximately US$53 million. The remaining money will go into a community fund for health
         clinics, education centers and other projects.

        In 2006, the Nigerian government asked the United Nations Environment Programme to study
         the extent of delta oil pollution. In its report, published in 2011, the agency recommended
         that the government establish a fund with an initial investment of US$1 billion. The Nigerian
         government and the oil industry should finance the fund, the agency said.

(Question 1 continued)

       Now, in August 2015, the Nigerian government has finally put in place a fund from which to
        finance cleanup efforts in one of the world’s most contaminated areas. However, there is little
        money in the account and the companies responsible for the spills are not required to pay
        very much. The Nigerian government has set aside only US$10 million and Shell, a leading
        contributor to the region’s contamination, is only required to finance 30 % of the fund.


Text C — Nigeria Hikes Key Rate to 14 % in July 2016

        The central bank of Nigeria raised its base interest rate to 14 % in July 2016. It was the second
        rate increase in the year, after the central bank abandoned the fixed exchange rate to the
        US dollar in June. Since then, the naira, Nigeria’s currency, plunged more than 55 % to an
        all-time low. In addition, the inflation rate kept its upward trend and reached 16.5 % in June,
        the highest since 2005.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Mexico

        The Mexican economy continued to expand at an annual rate of 2.5 % through most of 2015
         and early 2016. However, the growth is expected to be about 2 % in 2016. Future growth now
         fully relies on private consumption, since weak investment and export demand are no longer
         contributing to growth. Increased external competitiveness following a substantial depreciation
         of the Mexican peso with respect to the US dollar, has not yet led to a boost in demand
         for exports.

        The Mexican peso is freely floating and there has been a significant depreciation against the
         US dollar over the past two years. Up to now, the effect of currency depreciation on domestic
         prices has been limited. Inflation decreased to slightly below the central bank’s target of 3 %.
         Additional currency depreciation remains a major concern for the monetary authorities. In
         response, they have raised the interest rate to 4.25 %.

        Monetary and fiscal policy responses to currency depreciation are likely to have a negative
         impact on aggregate demand in the short term. Another challenge comes from the oil industry
         where there has been a decline in the volume of oil production. This is due to falling output
         from older oil fields and insufficient investments in exploration for new oil fields. This will reduce
         future annual growth rates by about half a percentage point.

        On the positive side, several factors are expected to boost private investment and exports, and
         improve economic growth in the medium term. These include: economic and financial stability;
         further progress in the implementation of an ambitious structural reform programme; and the
         increase in external competitiveness following the depreciation of the currency.

        The Mexican economy continues to face a complex external environment. Persistently low
         oil prices, an increase in interest rates in the United States, a slowdown in global trade and
         economic growth, and a number of geopolitical uncertainties may pose challenges to the
         country’s economic and financial stability and growth outlook. Policy priorities should remain
         focused on sensible economic policies to create the conditions for stronger growth in the
         medium term.


Text E — The sugar industry in the USA

        The United States (USA) is the fifth largest sugar producer and fifth largest consumer of sugar
         in the world. The US sugar industry has enjoyed trade protection since 1789. US protectionist
         sugar policy consists of three main elements: subsidies through preferential loans, minimum
         prices, and tariffs and quotas.

        It has been estimated that in 2012, Americans paid an average of 95.5 cents per kilo for
         inefficiently produced domestic sugar instead of 58.3 cents per kilo for more efficiently produced
         world sugar.

        The US International Trade Commission has ruled that large tariffs on imported Mexican sugar
         should continue until December 2019, stating that Mexican subsidies on sugar allow Mexican
         companies to sell sugar in the United States at 40 % below market value.

Text F — US production line closes

        Mondelēz bakeries closed down production of Oreo biscuits in its Chicago (US) factory, as part
        of its plan to shift some of its production to Mexico, making about half of the Chicago bakery’s
        1200 workers unemployed. The firm said that they could save US$46 million a year by installing
        state-of-the-art production lines in Salinas, Mexico, rather than Chicago.

                    The idea that it is a growing economy (or an increase in GDP).

      2             Accurate definition.                                                                2

                    An explanation that it is one of the following:
                    • an increase in the value of output adjusted for inflation
                    • an increase in real GDP
                    • an increase in full employment output
                    • growth in production possibilities.

             (ii)      Define the term market failure indicated in bold (Text B, paragraph ).                [2]

                    The idea that a market does not produce at the equilibrium point, or a
                    misallocation of resources, or the existence of externalities.

      2             Accurate definition.                                                                2

                    An explanation that it is the failure of a market to produce at the point where
                    any of the following exist:
                    • social or community surplus is maximised
                    • marginal social cost = marginal social benefit
                    • Pareto optimality is achieved
                    • allocative efficiency is achieved
                    • the socially optimum level of output is achieved.

                  Population = 173 million

                  GDP per capita = $6100

                  Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

                  GDP = 173 million × 6100 = $1 055 300 million

                  An answer of 1 055 300 million OR $1 055 300 million OR $1055 billion OR
                  $1.055 trillion without working is sufficient for [2].

        (ii)      Draw a demand and supply diagram to show how the oil prices may have
                  changed in the third quarter of 2014 (Text A, paragraph ).                               [2]

               For drawing a correct demand and supply diagram, showing a shift of
               the demand curve for oil to the left OR shift of the supply curve for oil to
               the right.

 2             There is a correct diagram AND correct labelling.                                      2

               shift of the demand curve for oil to the left OR shift of the supply curve for oil
               to the right.

                  For a demand and supply diagram, the use of P and Q is sufficient.

 (c)    Using a market failure diagram, explain how the “two oil spills in 2008” could
        represent a negative externality (Text B, paragraph ).                                     [4]

          For drawing a correctly labelled market failure diagram, showing an MSC
          curve above the MPC curve and an indicated welfare loss area or externality
          OR for an explanation that the oil spill would create costs that would not be
          paid by the oil company and that there would thus be a negative externality
          of production, since MSC was greater than MSB.

 2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.                       3–4

          For drawing a correctly labelled market failure diagram, showing an MSC
          curve above the MPC curve and an indicated welfare loss area or externality
          AND for an explanation that the oil spill would create costs that would not be
          paid by the oil company and that there would thus be a negative externality
          of production, since MSC was greater than MSB.

 (d)    Using an AD/AS diagram and information from Text C, explain the likely cause
        of the increasing inflation rate.                                                           [4]

          For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram, showing a shift of the
          SRAS curve to the left (or a shift of the AD curve to the right) and an
          increase in the average price level OR for an explanation that increases in
          the costs of production may have led to increased costs for firms, causing
          cost-push inflation in the economy (or increased AD in the economy, caused
          by an increase in [X–M], may have caused demand-pull inflation).

 2        There is a correct diagram AND an accurate written response.                       3–4

          For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram, showing a shift of the
          SRAS curve to the left (or a shift of the AD curve to the right) and an
          increase in the average price level AND for an explanation that increases in
          the costs of production may have led to increased costs for firms, causing
          cost-push inflation in the economy (or increased AD in the economy, caused
          by an increase in [X–M], may have caused demand-pull inflation).

        Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

        For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be Average (General) Price Level, APL or Price
        level. The horizontal axis may be real output, real national output, real income,
        real national income, real GDP or real Y. A title is not necessary.

 (e)    Using an exchange rate diagram, explain how the increase in the interest rate
        by the Nigerian central bank might prevent the continued fall in the value of the naira
        (Text C).                                                                                     [4]

 1        There is a correct diagram OR an accurate written response.                         1–2

          For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram, showing a shift of
          the demand curve for the naira to the right and an increase in the exchange
          rate OR for an explanation that an increase in the interest rate will lead to a
          greater demand for saving in Nigerian financial institutions, from abroad.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
• an explanation of the differences between economic growth and
  economic development
• an explanation of the link between growth and development
• an explanation of the sources of economic growth
• an explanation of the sources of economic development.

Possible supply side policies to improve the quality/quantity of factors
of production
Interventionist policies:
• improvements in education (Text A, paragraph ), however:
   • with the falls in public revenue/finances owing to falling oil revenues, this may be
      difficult to fund (Text A, paragraph )
   • there seems to be no recent improvement in literacy rates (Table 2)
   • government debt and external debt are both increasing (Table 1)
• improvements in infrastructure, however, this is harmed by the problems in the
   North East (Text A, paragraph ) and also the funding problems relating to falling oil
   revenues (Text A, paragraph )
• reducing interest rates to encourage investment, however, the need to keep
   the interest rate high to combat the falling value of the naira goes against this
   (Text C).
Market based policies:
  • reducing direct taxes, however, in most developing countries, tax revenue is not a
     significant revenue for the government and it is likely that Nigeria is no different.

Possible policies to improve the institutional framework
• Improve governance, however:
  • problems with public finances and corruption are likely to hamper this (Text A,
     paragraph  and paragraph )
• improve security (Text A, paragraph )
• reduce corruption (Text A, paragraph ).

Possible other strategies
• Export-led growth, however:
  • there are problems with over reliance on one product, ie oil
     (Text A, paragraph ).
• Import-substitution.
• Micro finance.
• Diversification.
• FDI, however:
  • there are possible problems associated with this.

Any reasonable discussion.

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
• an explanation of the differences between economic growth and
  economic development
• an explanation of the link between growth and development
• an explanation of the sources of economic growth
• an explanation of the sources of economic development.

The current international trade prospects:
• Substantial depreciation of the peso and increased external competitiveness
  (Text D, paragraph ) should lead to an improvement in [X–M] and thus an increase
  in AD and so economic growth. However:
  • if demand is inelastic or if PED < 1, then the [X–M] may not improve and, since
     oil has inelastic demand, this may apply to Mexico (Text D, paragraph )
  • economic growth may not necessarily lead to economic development.
• Freely floating exchange rate (Text D, paragraph ) means that the current
  account deficits and depreciation of the peso should be self-righting in the
  long run. However:
  • external factors normally interfere with the theoretical movements of the market.
• Monetary and fiscal policy responses to currency depreciation (Text D,
  paragraph ) mean that there will be contractionary policies that will lead to a
  reduction in economic growth in the short run.
• Decline in the volume of oil production (Text D, paragraph ) will impact exports
  and thus government revenue, meaning that there may be a reduction in
  government spending, which could harm both economic growth and also
  economic development.
• Slowdown in global trade (Text D, paragraph ) could harm economic growth and
  so development.
• Large tariffs and protectionism (Text E) may lead to problems with exports and so
  another reason for a fall in [X–M] and slower economic growth.
• Persistent current account deficit (Table 3) may have an impact on economic growth
  and development as the government will have to fund the deficit through reserves
  and borrowing, harming their ability to invest in other areas.
• Increasing external debt (Table 3) suggests a lack of sovereignty and the threats to
  government spending made above.
• Increasing FDI inflows (Table 3) suggest the lack of sovereignty again and all the
  advantages and disadvantages that come with FDI.

Any reasonable discussion.

              The government of Country X is concerned about the future of the coffee market for
              three reasons.

              • Several coffee-producing countries have announced plans to increase output.
              • Political changes abroad are expected to bring about trade protection.
              • Some coffee-producing countries are likely to introduce export subsidies for coffee.

              It is believed that the world price of coffee could decrease by as much as US$0.80 per kg.

              (iii)    Calculate how much the revenue earned by coffee producers in Country X would
                       decrease if the world price of coffee falls by US$0.80 per kg.                                                                      [2]

              The minister of finance for Country X has stated that “one of our problems is that our

              domestic market. Indeed, many coffee drinkers in our country buy imported products

              approximately 200 million litres per year.

              (vii) Using this information, draw the marginal social benefit (MSB) curve on Figure 3.                                                      [1]

Notes for examiners:

1. Whenever relevant, carry over marks must be awarded. If a candidate makes an error in
   calculation, but then uses the incorrect figure appropriately and accurately in later question
   parts, then the candidate may be fully rewarded. This is the “own-figure rule” and you should
   put OFR on the script where you are rewarding this.

2. Alternative approaches may be taken in responses to the [4] questions that use AO2 command
   terms. If this is the case and the alternative approaches are valid, then full credit should
   be given.

3. A candidate may be penalized for not rounding correctly, failing to give answers correct to
   2 dp or, in some cases, for not including the appropriate units. However, a candidate may only
   be penalized ONCE per question (not per part) for each type of error.


1.   (a)   (i)    Calculate the value of coffee exports per year from Country X.                [2]

                  200 - 20 = 180 OR 180 000

                  Any valid working (including recognition of US$3 as the export price)
                  is sufficient for [1].

                  180 000 × 3 = US$540 000

                  An answer of US$540 000 OR 540 000 without working is sufficient for [1].

           (ii)   Calculate the social/community surplus earned by stakeholders in the coffee
                  market in Country X under conditions of free trade.                           [3]

                  Consumer surplus = 0.5 × 1.6 × 20 000 = 16 000

                  Producer surplus = 0.5 × 2 × 200 000 = 200 000

                  Any valid working is sufficient for [1].

                  Social/community surplus = 16 000 + 200 000

                  = US$216 000

                  An answer of US$216 000 OR 216 000 without working is sufficient for [2].

                  OFR applies for adding consumer surplus to producer surplus.

        (iii)   Calculate how much the revenue earned by coffee producers in Country X
                would decrease if the world price of coffee falls by US$0.80 per kg.                [2]

                Initial revenue = 3 × 200 000 = 600 000

                Final revenue = 2.20 × 120 000 = 264 000

                Award [1] if the initial OR final revenue is correct.

                Decrease in revenue = 600 000 - 264 000 = US$336 000

                An answer of US$336 000 OR 336 000 without working is sufficient for [1].

        (iv)    In 2016 the population of Country X was 41.5 million. Using information
                from Table 1, calculate the GDP (US$ PPP) for 2016.                                 [1]

                1717 × 41.5 m

                = US$71 255.5 million
                An answer of 71 255.5 OR 71 255.5 million OR 71.255 billion OR 71.26 billion
                OR 71 255 500 000 without working is sufficient for [1].

        (v)     Define the term current account balance.                                            [2]

        (vi)   Using an example, explain the importance of presenting “GDP per capita”
               statistics at purchasing power parity (PPP).                                              [4]

           For the idea that the purchasing power of GDP per capita (measured in, for
           example, US$) is not comparable between countries due to differences in
           the general price level.

 2         The written response is accurate.                                                       3–4

           For an explanation that purchasing power of GDP per capita (measured in,
           for example, US$) is not comparable between countries due to differences
           in the general price level, and that adjusting for purchasing power parity
           allows a realistic comparison of the real value of GDP per capita AND for an
           example, such as: if annual GDP per capita is $5000 in Country A and
           $10 000 in Country B, while the cost of living in Country B is twice that in
           Country A, then GDP per capita at PPP would be equal between
           the countries.

               If a relevant example is not included, a maximum of [3] may be awarded.

        (vii) Assume the price of coffee is US$2.20 per kg. Using Figure 1, calculate the
              price elasticity of demand (PED) for coffee in Country X if the price were to fall
              from US$2.20 per kg to US$1.40 per kg.                                                     [2]

                       33.33 %
               PED =
                       -36.36 %

               Any valid working (either the % change in P or Qd) is sufficient for [1].
               Figures may be rounded.

               = –0.92 OR 0.92
               An answer of 0.92 without working is sufficient for [1].

        (viii) Using at least two items of information provide, explain why the government
               of Country X should be very concerned at the prospect of a fall in world
               coffee prices.                                                                            [4]

          maximum of [3].

             Answers may include:
             • Coffee comprises 20.2 % of export earnings. If the price of coffee falls then
               export earnings will decrease.
             • The current account balance is in deficit (-US$2.35 billion). The deficit
               would increase.
             • Agriculture accounts for 26.7 % of GDP, 40 % of the labour force works in
               agriculture. A fall in the price of coffee will affect rural workers significantly.
             • The level of poverty is relatively high (19.7 %) while GDP/capita is less than
               10 % of the world average. Inequality is significant (Gini coefficient = 0.41).
               A fall in the price of coffee would be likely to increase poverty, reduce
               GDP/capita and increase inequality.

             Any valid reason explained.

(b)   Using the data provided and your knowledge of economics, recommend a policy
      which could be introduced by the government of Country X in response to the
      expected fall in the world price of coffee.                                      [10]

      Possible policies may include (but are not restricted to):
      • Support for the domestic coffee industry eg subsidies, import tariffs.
      • Policies to promote domestic consumption.
      • Import tariffs on foreign coffee.
      • Policies to encourage diversification.
      • Policies to encourage the domestic processing of coffee.
      • Investment in infrastructure in order to support the coffee industry.
      • The establishment/development of a regional trading bloc.
      • A combination of policies.
      • Any other valid policy.

        (iv)   Referring to the change in New Zealand’s Gini coefficient shown in Figure 2,
               outline one possible reason for this change.                                           [2]

           For example: the tax system.

           For example: the tax system has become less progressive.

               Possible reasons may include:
               • The tax system has become less progressive.
               • The rate of indirect taxation has increased.
               • Market orientated supply-side policies have been introduced, such as
                 labour market reforms.
               • Welfare payments have been cut.
               • The bargaining power of organized labour has been reduced.
               • Any other valid reason.

        (v)    Explain the likely impact on New Zealand’s Gini coefficient if the
               government increased the rate of GST to 20 % in 2017.                                  [4]

           For the idea that an increase in the rate of GST will make the system more
           regressive, as GST paid on any good/service constitutes a smaller
           percentage of income for those on higher incomes OR that this will make
           the distribution of income more unequal and therefore increase the Gini
           coefficient.

           For an explanation that an increase in the rate of GST will make the system
           more regressive, as GST paid on any good/service constitutes a smaller
           percentage of income for those on higher incomes AND that this will make

        (vi)   Using Table 4 and Table 5, comment on the view that the consumption
               of sugary drinks contributes to market failure in New Zealand.                      [4]

           For the idea that the data suggest that the consumption of sugar can lead to
           diabetes, a negative externality of consumption, causing market failure.

 2         The written response is accurate.                                                 3–4

           For an explanation that the data suggest that the consumption of sugar can
           lead to diabetes, a negative externality of consumption, causing market
           failure. Pacific people, with high prevalence of diabetes appear to consume
           relatively high quantities of sugary drinks when they are young. This
           indicates that there is a link between sugar consumption and diabetes,
           although the causation is not necessarily proven.

               A response which does not refer directly to the data or which does not challenge
               the issue of causality may be awarded a maximum of [3].

        (vii) Using this information, draw the marginal social benefit (MSB) curve on Figure 3.    [1]

      (viii) Using your answer to part (vii), calculate the welfare loss to New Zealand
             resulting from excessive consumption of sugary drinks.                         [2]

           An answer of 72 million without workings is sufficient for [1].

           OFR applies if the curve for part (vii) is placed incorrectly.

(b)   Using the data provided and your knowledge of economics, recommend a policy
      which the New Zealand government could introduce to address the over-consumption
      of sugary drinks.                                                                    [10]

      Possible policies may include (but are not restricted to):
      • An indirect tax on sugar or products containing high levels of sugar.
      • Legislation to regulate the sugar content in food/drinks.
      • Legislation to restrict the availability of products which are high in sugar
        (eg in schools/shops near to schools).
      • Subsidies on “healthier” food products.
      • Education/advertising aimed at decreasing the demand for products high in sugar.
      • Behavioural economic policies, such as Nudge theory, choice architecture.
      • A combination of policies.
      • Any other valid policy.

(b)   Using real-world examples, discuss the consequences of a price ceiling
      on stakeholders.                                                                            [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Definition: price ceiling, stakeholders.
      • Explanation: impact of a price ceiling on stakeholders:
        • Consumers: shortages, lower prices, parallel/unofficial markets and the possible
           means to resolve a shortage (queues), possible reduced quality of goods,
           benefits such as access for low income families especially during inflation, equity.
        • Producers: discouragement of suppliers to produce more because they cannot
           set prices and consequent reduction of availability, impact on signalling and
           incentive functions of price.
        • Government: need for intervention to overcome shortages (rationing).
      • Diagram: to show price ceiling (if not given in part (a)).
      • Synthesis (discuss): a considered and balanced review that includes a range of
        consequences for different stakeholders.
      • Examples should include real-world illustrations such as rents, fuel, food and their

             Answers may include:
             • Definition: deflation.
             • Explanation: any determinant of AD that could shift it to the left, eg falling consumer
               or business confidence, falling consumption, falling investment, falling government
               spending, or any determinant that shifts AS to the right, eg falling costs of raw

(b)   Using real-world examples, evaluate the effectiveness of monetary policy to
      achieve low inflation.                                                                      [15]

      Answers may include:
      • Definition: inflation, monetary policy.
      • Explanation: that it is incremental, easily changed, flexible, fast to implement, does
        not burden the government’s budget. That there are limitations: it is less effective
        when business/consumer confidence is low; effectiveness may depend on the type
        of inflation.
      • Diagram: AD/AS diagram to illustrate contractionary monetary policy.
      • Synthesis (evaluate): strengths and limitations of monetary policy in achieving low
        inflation. Fiscal policy might be considered as an alternative, but the emphasis of the
        response should be on monetary policy.
      • Examples: real-world examples of where governments have attempted to lower
        inflation using monetary policy.

Answer one question.

1.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text A — Overview of Nigeria

        With a population of 173 million people, Nigeria is the most populated country in Africa and
         accounts for 47 % of West Africa’s population. It is the biggest oil exporter in Africa and also has
         the largest natural gas reserves in the continent.

        Economic growth is estimated to have been 6.1 % in 2014, owing to continued strong
         performance mainly in services, but also industry (apart from oil mining) and agriculture. The oil
         and gas sector was in decline, although at a slower rate than in the previous year. Revenues
         from oil and gas were estimated to have declined by 1.3 %, relative to a decline of 13.1 % in
         2013. The sharp decline in oil prices since the third quarter of 2014 has posed major challenges
         to the country’s current account balance and public finances. Oil contributes close to 90 % of
         export revenues and roughly 75 % of the country’s total budget revenues.

        Lower oil prices will continue to pose strong challenges for public finance at all levels of
         government during the year and will also represent a major constraint on the ability of the new
         government to introduce some of its ambitious programs. It is focusing on anti-corruption, the
         economy, including jobs and unemployment, and security.

        In the North East of Nigeria, Boko Haram, an extremist group, remains a threat. Millions of
         displaced persons require assistance. There has been major destruction of infrastructure,
         loss of lives and increased poverty in this region. The government will have a difficult time
         financing the major programs that it wants to introduce, as well as reconstructing the North East
         devastated by the activities of the violent extremists.

        The major medium-term challenge for the government is to accelerate the creation of
         productive jobs through private sector growth and to make improvements in education (skills).
         So far, the pace of job creation has been inadequate, leading to increasing frustration among
         underemployed Nigerian youth.


Text B — Oil spills in Nigeria

        In January 2015, Royal Dutch Shell, a multinational oil company, finally agreed to pay more
         than US$83 million to residents of a Nigerian fishing community that was devastated by two oil
         spills in 2008. This was the largest ever compensation related to an oil spill in Nigeria, a country
         plagued by oil-related market failure.

        Over 15 000 residents in the town of Bodo will each receive about US$3 250, adding up to
         approximately US$53 million. The remaining money will go into a community fund for health
         clinics, education centers and other projects.

        In 2006, the Nigerian government asked the United Nations Environment Programme to study
         the extent of delta oil pollution. In its report, published in 2011, the agency recommended
         that the government establish a fund with an initial investment of US$1 billion. The Nigerian
         government and the oil industry should finance the fund, the agency said.

(Question 1 continued)

       Now, in August 2015, the Nigerian government has finally put in place a fund from which to
        finance cleanup efforts in one of the world’s most contaminated areas. However, there is little
        money in the account and the companies responsible for the spills are not required to pay
        very much. The Nigerian government has set aside only US$10 million and Shell, a leading
        contributor to the region’s contamination, is only required to finance 30 % of the fund.


Text C — Nigeria Hikes Key Rate to 14 % in July 2016

        The central bank of Nigeria raised its base interest rate to 14 % in July 2016. It was the second
        rate increase in the year, after the central bank abandoned the fixed exchange rate to the
        US dollar in June. Since then, the naira, Nigeria’s currency, plunged more than 55 % to an
        all-time low. In addition, the inflation rate kept its upward trend and reached 16.5 % in June,
        the highest since 2005.

2.   Read the extracts and answer the questions that follow.

Text D — Overview of Mexico

        The Mexican economy continued to expand at an annual rate of 2.5 % through most of 2015
         and early 2016. However, the growth is expected to be about 2 % in 2016. Future growth now
         fully relies on private consumption, since weak investment and export demand are no longer
         contributing to growth. Increased external competitiveness following a substantial depreciation
         of the Mexican peso with respect to the US dollar, has not yet led to a boost in demand
         for exports.

        The Mexican peso is freely floating and there has been a significant depreciation against the
         US dollar over the past two years. Up to now, the effect of currency depreciation on domestic
         prices has been limited. Inflation decreased to slightly below the central bank’s target of 3 %.
         Additional currency depreciation remains a major concern for the monetary authorities. In
         response, they have raised the interest rate to 4.25 %.

        Monetary and fiscal policy responses to currency depreciation are likely to have a negative
         impact on aggregate demand in the short term. Another challenge comes from the oil industry
         where there has been a decline in the volume of oil production. This is due to falling output
         from older oil fields and insufficient investments in exploration for new oil fields. This will reduce
         future annual growth rates by about half a percentage point.

        On the positive side, several factors are expected to boost private investment and exports, and
         improve economic growth in the medium term. These include: economic and financial stability;
         further progress in the implementation of an ambitious structural reform programme; and the
         increase in external competitiveness following the depreciation of the currency.

        The Mexican economy continues to face a complex external environment. Persistently low
         oil prices, an increase in interest rates in the United States, a slowdown in global trade and
         economic growth, and a number of geopolitical uncertainties may pose challenges to the
         country’s economic and financial stability and growth outlook. Policy priorities should remain
         focused on sensible economic policies to create the conditions for stronger growth in the
         medium term.


Text E — The sugar industry in the USA

        The United States (USA) is the fifth largest sugar producer and fifth largest consumer of sugar
         in the world. The US sugar industry has enjoyed trade protection since 1789. US protectionist
         sugar policy consists of three main elements: subsidies through preferential loans, minimum
         prices, and tariffs and quotas.

        It has been estimated that in 2012, Americans paid an average of 95.5 cents per kilo for
         inefficiently produced domestic sugar instead of 58.3 cents per kilo for more efficiently produced
         world sugar.

        The US International Trade Commission has ruled that large tariffs on imported Mexican sugar
         should continue until December 2019, stating that Mexican subsidies on sugar allow Mexican
         companies to sell sugar in the United States at 40 % below market value.

Text F — US production line closes

        Mondelēz bakeries closed down production of Oreo biscuits in its Chicago (US) factory, as part
        of its plan to shift some of its production to Mexico, making about half of the Chicago bakery’s
        1200 workers unemployed. The firm said that they could save US$46 million a year by installing
        state-of-the-art production lines in Salinas, Mexico, rather than Chicago.

          paid by the oil company and that there would thus be a negative externality
          of production, since MSC was greater than MSB.

          SRAS curve to the left (or a shift of the AD curve to the right) and an
          increase in the average price level OR for an explanation that increases in
          the costs of production may have led to increased costs for firms, causing
          cost-push inflation in the economy (or increased AD in the economy, caused
          by an increase in [X–M], may have caused demand-pull inflation).

          For drawing a correctly labelled exchange rate diagram, showing a shift of
          the demand curve for the naira to the right and an increase in the exchange
          rate OR for an explanation that an increase in the interest rate will lead to a
          greater demand for saving in Nigerian financial institutions, from abroad.
          This will require naira to do it, leading to an increased demand for the naira
          and thus an increase in the exchange rate.

        For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of
        naira in other currencies, or other currency per naira. The horizontal axis should
        be quantity or quantity of naira. A title is not necessary.

          equality and two Lorenz curves, labelled by year OR for an explanation that
          the increasing value of the Gini coefficient means that income inequality in
          Nigeria worsened between 2010 and 2014, causing an outward shift in the
          Lorenz curve.

          equality and two Lorenz curves, labelled by year AND for an explanation
          that the increasing value of the Gini coefficient means that income inequality
          in Nigeria worsened between 2010 and 2014, causing an outward shift in
          the Lorenz curve.

        Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

        For the Lorenz curve, the vertical axis should be cumulative percentage of
        income (or wealth). The horizontal axis should be cumulative percentage of the
        population. A title is not necessary.

a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
 an explanation of the differences between economic growth and
  economic development
 an explanation of the link between growth and development
 an explanation of the sources of economic growth
 an explanation of the sources of economic development.

Possible supply side policies to improve the quality/quantity of factors
of production
Interventionist policies:
 improvements in education (Text A, paragraph ), however:
    with the falls in public revenue/finances owing to falling oil revenues, this may be
      difficult to fund (Text A, paragraph )
    there seems to be no recent improvement in literacy rates (Table 2)
    government debt and external debt are both increasing (Table 2)
 improvements in infrastructure, however, this is harmed by the problems in the
   North East (Text A, paragraph ) and also the funding problems relating to falling oil
   revenues (Text A, paragraph )
 reducing interest rates to encourage investment, however, the need to keep
   the interest rate high to combat the falling value of the naira goes against this
   (Text C).
Market based policies:
   reducing direct taxes, however, in most developing countries, tax revenue is not a
     significant revenue for the government and it is likely that Nigeria is no different.

Possible policies to improve the institutional framework
 Improve governance, however:
   problems with public finances and corruption are likely to hamper this (Text A,
     paragraph  and paragraph )
 improve security (Text A, paragraph )
 reduce corruption (Text A, paragraph ).

Possible other strategies
 Export-led growth, however:
   there are problems with over reliance on one product, ie oil
     (Text A, paragraph ).
 Import-substitution.
 Micro finance.
 Diversification.
 FDI, however:
   there are possible problems associated with this (Text B).

Any reasonable discussion.

        necessary.

        Candidates may draw a product diagram showing a decrease in the US supply of
        biscuits leading to a fall in output which suggests a fall in the demand for labour or a fall
        in the level of employment. If this is correctly explained and structural unemployment is
        identified as the type of unemployment, then full marks may be awarded.

          For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS diagram, showing a shift of the AD
          curve to the right and an increase in the average price level OR for an
          explanation that currency depreciation will make exports cheaper and
          imports more expensive, possibly leading to an increase in [X–M] and so
          increased AD, leading to inflation.

        level. The horizontal axis may be real output, real national output, real income,
        real national income, real GDP or real Y. A title is not necessary.

        Candidates may explain that the increased price of imports from the depreciation
        may cause a shift of SRAS to the left and cost push inflation. If the diagram is
        correct and the explanation is full, this should be fully rewarded.

             increasing the exchange rate

Command term
“Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
a range of arguments, factors, or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Responses may include:
 an explanation of the differences between economic growth and
  economic development
 an explanation of the link between growth and development
 an explanation of the sources of economic growth
 an explanation of the sources of economic development.

The current international trade prospects:
 Substantial depreciation of the peso and increased external competitiveness
  (Text D, paragraph ) should lead to an improvement in [X–M] and thus an increase
  in AD and so economic growth. However:
   if demand is inelastic or if PED  1, then the [X–M] may not improve and, since
     oil has inelastic demand, this may apply to Mexico (Text D, paragraph )
   economic growth may not necessarily lead to economic development.
 Freely floating exchange rate (Text D, paragraph ) means that the current
  account deficits and depreciation of the peso should be self-righting in the
  long run. However:
   external factors normally interfere with the theoretical movements of the market.
 Monetary and fiscal policy responses to currency depreciation (Text D,
  paragraph ) mean that there will be contractionary policies that will lead to a
  reduction in economic growth in the short run.
 Decline in the volume of oil production (Text D, paragraph ) will impact exports
  and thus government revenue, meaning that there may be a reduction in
  government spending, which could harm both economic growth and also
  economic development.
 Slowdown in global trade (Text D, paragraph ) could harm economic growth and
  so development.
 Large tariffs and protectionism (Text E, paragraph ) may lead to problems with
  exports and so another reason for a fall in [X–M] and slower economic growth.
 Persistent current account deficit (Table 3) may have an impact on economic growth
  and development as the government will have to fund the deficit through reserves
  and borrowing, harming their ability to invest in other areas.
 Increasing external debt (Table 3) suggests a lack of sovereignty and the threats to
  government spending made above.
 Increasing FDI inflows (Table 3) suggest the lack of sovereignty again and all the
  advantages and disadvantages that come with FDI.

Any reasonable discussion.
