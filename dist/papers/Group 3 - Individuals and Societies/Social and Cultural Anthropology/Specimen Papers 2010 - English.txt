Extract from Gordillo, Gastón, 2002. “The Breath of the Devils: Memories and Places of an Experience
of Terror.” American Ethnologist 29:33-57.

        Between the early 1900s and late 1960s, the Toba [of Northern Argentina] worked in the
        Tabacal sugar plantation, […] a dazzling, contradictory place of excess. This was an excess of
        commodities (firearms, clothing, utensils), which made them return every year in spite of harsh
        working conditions, and excess of disease, death, and terror. The terror of the plantation was best
    5   expressed in their belief in devils and the KiyaGaikpí “cannibal people”. […]

        By 1930, Toba [seasonal] labour migrations were regular. At Tabacal, the Toba became part of
        a diverse group of workers hierarchically organised by the administration along ethnic lines.
        The administration assigned different tasks to each group, [paying] wages according to what it
        considered to be their culturally specific working skills. The top of the hierarchy was formed
   10   by Criollo permanent factory workers.* Next, the Chiriguano, a slash-and-burn horticulturalist
        group, […] were considered the best indigenous labourers. The hunting and gathering Toba
        group were ranked lowest on the scale. They were considered unskilled seasonal labourers,
        received the lowest wages, and suffered the worst working conditions. The forms of ethnicity
        dominating social interactions in the cane fields were produced by the incorporation of various
   15   groups into a single political economy.

        The Toba believed that devils inhabited the mountains overlooking the cane fields. Invisible, they
        came down from the mountains to spread diseases and death. The labour migrations threatened
        not just individual lives, but also the Toba’s social reproduction, as children […] are remembered
        as the most likely victims of the plantation.

   20   The Toba remembered that they buried their dead in the forests surrounding the cane fields, but the
        following year those forests were cleared to plant sugarcane. The Toba’s memories of the bones
        of their people scattered in the fields served as a grim reminder that they were leaving their most
        basic possession, their own bodies, literally swallowed by fields of sugarcane.

        High mortality rates and fear of devils did not deter most Toba from going to the plantation.
   25   The desire for commodities available on the sugar plantation, reinforced by the Toba’s growing
        inability to survive through hunting and gathering, [was] stronger than the threat of death in the
        cane fields. […]

        According to the Toba, [as well as devils at Tabacal there were] the KiyaGaikpí people who
        ate human flesh. The nature of social relations in the cane fields shaped Toba ideas about
   30   the KiyaGaikpí. Many Toba considered them rich and also told stories of [how] they
        killed people. [One Toba said] that the KiyaGaikpí used to leave packages of money by the road,
        tied with string, to attract, capture and devour people. Other Toba remembered them using money
        to buy their prey. Thus the people whose only commodity while at the plantation was their labour
        believed that they were being bought and sold as a new type of commodity: as meat. The attitudes

          * Criollos are a population of mixed colonial and indigenous descent.

     35     projected on these cannibals reflects the Toba experience of workers reduced to consumable and
            disposable objects. Moreover, the Toba believed that their flesh was for the KiyaGaikpí, not only
            a commodity for consumption, but also a means of exchange. A story about a Toba man who did
            a day’s work for the KiyaGaikpí relates that they paid him with a grim commodity: the hand of a
            dead worker.

     40     The Toba internalized the ethnic hierarchies created in Tabacal as demonstrated by their belief that
            the KiyaGaikpí thought their flesh had a “bad taste”. On the plantation, the Toba were despised, and
            they projected this attitude on the KiyaGaikpí. Yet they found that elements of their aboriginality
            played to their advantage. A Toba told me, “They don’t find Toba flesh tasty because they don’t eat
            nice things. They’d much rather eat white people, for whites have nice food and the KiyaGaikpí
     45     find their flesh very nice.” […]

            The meanings and practices that Toba projected onto the KiyaGaikpí pointed to some of the
            disturbing experiences that shaped their work conditions. Fear of the KiyaGaikpí expresses
            a particular aspect of the Toba experience in Tabacal: the fear of losing one of the few things
            they still owned while working there, their own bodies, consumed by exhausting work, disease
     50     and death. Connections between exploitation and cannibalism are [not] restricted to this area.
            Narratives about people being “consumed” or “eaten up” in factories and mines are common
            among workers around the world.

1.   What was the relationship between hierarchy and ethnicity on the plantation?                 [6 marks]

     There are several descriptive examples to choose from in the passage and these begin with the
     pragmatic outlining of the hierarchically organized ethnic groups in relation to labour practice on
     the plantation. This then leads on to the discussion of the rationale for the labour hierarchy and the
     implications and outcomes of such ranking according to ethnicity.

     Clearly there is a hierarchy of ethnicity based on subsistence, with the hunter-gatherer Toba at the
     bottom of the scale and the Chiriguano slash and burn horticulturalists above them. The Toba are
     seasonal migrant workers and are therefore expected to have alternative sources of income when the
     plantation does not require their labour. The Criollos are permanent workers on the plantation and
     can be assumed to be considered ethnically superior to the other groups on the plantation
     (some students might guess that they are peasants). The Criollos work indoors in the factory while
     the Toba and Chiriguano work outdoors in the fields. The ethnic hierarchy established at the
     plantation equates subsistence patterns with supposed skills and cultural abilities, and ranks groups
     according to this. Pay differentials follow this ranking and the outcome is a form of
     institutionalised discrimination against certain groups because of their assumed abilities, or lack
     of them, on the basis of their traditional forms of subsistence and ethnicity. Such an organization of
     labour keeps workers divided along ethnic lines and prevents a collective union of workers against
     harsh working conditions. Some candidates might also mention that the harsher working conditions
     of the seasonal field labourers also took a heavier toll on them in terms of disease and death.
     The lower down the ethnic and labour hierarchy one was, the greater the likelihood of disease
     and death. The poorer one was to begin with, the worse the chances of survival and well-being.

     Another aspect of the inferior labour position of the Toba on the plantation was their internalization
     of this situation in their beliefs that the cannibal KiyaGaikpí would not find their flesh tasty because
     the Toba did not eat the nice food of the whites. In this instance relative poverty reflected in poorer
     diet may have worked, as far as the Toba were concerned, to their advantage when confronted
     by cannibals.

2.   Using one or more theoretical perspectives explain how the Toba’s beliefs about
     death and disease were an expression of their work conditions.                  [6 marks]

     This question requires candidates to develop answers which move beyond the more descriptive
     answer of question 1. Here the ability of candidates to show that beliefs are, to some extent,
     contextual and can be understood in relation to working and living conditions will produce stronger
     answers than those which simply list the devil and cannibal beliefs of the Toba. The level of fear of
     devils is correlated to the high death rates among the Toba working on the plantations and the terror
     of the people that they were being wiped out by death and disease as the deaths of children, in
     particular, compromised the ability of the Toba to reproduce themselves in the future. These death
     rates are themselves the outcome of the very harsh working and living conditions on the plantation
     and the price the Toba paid for entering the capitalist system at the very bottom of the hierarchy.
     The Toba recognised this but were tempted by the commodities available to wage labourers and
     also compelled to work in the fields by the fact that their traditional means of subsistence were no
     longer sufficient to meet their needs.

     Some candidates may even consider the “naturalizing” effect of beliefs in devils as a cause of death
     and disease. If such things are caused by devils then the actual labour conditions on the plantation
     are not responsible and this displaces the causes of the death from the organization of labour in the
     fields (which could be challenged and changed) to the non-human and non-preventable action of
     devils (which the plantation owners cannot do anything about). The alienation of labour and its
     commodification is also expressed in the stories of cannibals who use human flesh as a means
     of exchange.

     Good answers do not have to provide an exhaustive discussion of all elements of devil and cannibal
     belief and the alienation and commodification of labour covered in the passage. However, they do
     have to contextualize their answers within a suitable theoretical framework and select a sufficient
     range of appropriate examples from the text to justify their discussion. For example, agency,
     structure, conflict or material perspectives would all be acceptable choices. Of course,
     candidates could also choose to analyse the passage through the lens of just one of these.

3.   Compare the Toba’s response to their work experience with the response to work
     experience of one other group you have studied in detail.                      [8 marks]

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. The question requires
     candidates to demonstrate an understanding of capitalist labour practice as a force which does not
     impact uniformly on all members of a society. While the Toba find ways of expressing and
     understanding the impacts of exploitative working conditions through beliefs in devils and
     cannibals, other social groups may have alternative ways of conceptualising the impacts of
     capitalism on their social order. The ethnic inequalities that the passage highlights may be
     compared to class or gender inequalities in relation to work practices found in other social systems.
     Better answers will be able to demonstrate the variable impacts of labour conditions on different
     segments within a given society.

     Students may choose to use theoretical perspectives (ideally introduced in their question 2 response)
     to help frame their comparison.

Extract from Gordillo, Gastón, 2002. “The Breath of the Devils: Memories and Places of an Experience
of Terror”. American Ethnologist 29:33-57.

        Between the early 1900s and late 1960s, the Toba [of Northern Argentina] worked in the Tabacal
        sugar plantation, […] a dazzling, contradictory place of excess. This was an excess of commodities
        (firearms, clothing, utensils), which made them return every year in spite of harsh working
        conditions, and excess of disease, death, and terror. The terror of the plantation was best expressed
    5   in their belief in devils and the KiyaGaikpí “cannibal people”. […]

        By 1930, Toba [seasonal] labour migrations were regular. At Tabacal, the Toba became part of
        a diverse group of workers hierarchically organised by the administration along ethnic lines.
        The administration assigned different tasks to each group, [paying] wages according to what it
        considered to be their culturally specific working skills. The top of the hierarchy was formed
   10   by Criollo permanent factory workers.* Next, the Chiriguano, a slash-and-burn horticulturalist
        group, […] were considered the best indigenous labourers. The hunting and gathering Toba
        group were ranked lowest on the scale. They were considered unskilled seasonal labourers,
        received the lowest wages, and suffered the worst working conditions. The forms of ethnicity
        dominating social interactions in the cane fields were produced by the incorporation of various
   15   groups into a single political economy.

        The Toba believed that devils inhabited the mountains overlooking the cane fields. Invisible, they
        came down from the mountains to spread diseases and death. The labour migrations threatened
        not just individual lives, but also the Toba’s social reproduction, as children […] are remembered
        as the most likely victims of the plantation.

   20   The Toba remembered that they buried their dead in the forests surrounding the cane fields, but the
        following year those forests were cleared to plant sugarcane. The Toba’s memories of the bones
        of their people scattered in the fields served as a grim reminder that they were leaving their most
        basic possession, their own bodies, literally swallowed by fields of sugarcane.

        High mortality rates and fear of devils did not deter most Toba from going to the plantation.
   25   The desire for commodities available on the sugar plantation, reinforced by the Toba’s growing
        inability to survive through hunting and gathering, [was] stronger than the threat of death in the
        cane fields. […]

        According to the Toba, [as well as devils at Tabacal there were] the KiyaGaikpí people who
        ate human flesh. The nature of social relations in the cane fields shaped Toba ideas about
   30   the KiyaGaikpí. Many Toba considered them rich and also told stories of [how] they
        killed people. [One Toba said] that the KiyaGaikpí used to leave packages of money by the road,
        tied with string, to attract, capture and devour people. Other Toba remembered them using money
        to buy their prey. Thus the people whose only commodity while at the plantation was their labour

     35     projected on these cannibals reflects the Toba experience of workers reduced to consumable and
            disposable objects. Moreover, the Toba believed that their flesh was for the KiyaGaikpí, not only
            a commodity for consumption, but also a means of exchange. A story about a Toba man who did
            a day’s work for the KiyaGaikpí relates that they paid him with a grim commodity: the hand of a
            dead worker.

     40     The Toba internalized the ethnic hierarchies created in Tabacal as demonstrated by their belief that
            the KiyaGaikpí thought their flesh had a “bad taste”. On the plantation, the Toba were despised,
            and they projected this attitude on the KiyaGaikpí. Yet they found that elements of their
            aboriginality played to their advantage. A Toba told me, “They don’t find Toba flesh tasty because
            they don’t eat nice things. They’d much rather eat white people, for whites have nice food and the
     45     KiyaGaikpí find their flesh very nice.” […]

            The meanings and practices that Toba projected onto the KiyaGaikpí pointed to some of the
            disturbing experiences that shaped their work conditions. Fear of the KiyaGaikpí expresses
            a particular aspect of the Toba experience in Tabacal: the fear of losing one of the few things
            they still owned while working there, their own bodies, consumed by exhausting work, disease
     50     and death. Connections between exploitation and cannibalism are [not] restricted to this area.
            Narratives about people being “consumed” or “eaten up” in factories and mines are common
            among workers around the world.

1.   What was the relationship between hierarchy and ethnicity on the plantation?                 [6 marks]

     There are several descriptive examples to choose from in the passage and these begin with the
     pragmatic outlining of the hierarchically organized ethnic groups in relation to labour practice on
     the plantation. This then leads on to the discussion of the rationale for the labour hierarchy and the
     implications and outcomes of such ranking according to ethnicity.

     Clearly there is a hierarchy of ethnicity based on subsistence, with the hunter-gatherer Toba at the
     bottom of the scale and the Chiriguano slash and burn horticulturalists above them. The Toba are
     seasonal migrant workers and are therefore expected to have alternative sources of income when the
     plantation does not require their labour. The Criollos are permanent workers on the plantation and
     can be assumed to be considered ethnically superior to the other groups on the plantation
     (some students might guess that they are peasants). The Criollos work indoors in the factory while
     the Toba and Chiriguano work outdoors in the fields. The ethnic hierarchy established at the
     plantation equates subsistence patterns with supposed skills and cultural abilities, and ranks groups
     according to this. Pay differentials follow this ranking and the outcome is a form of
     institutionalised discrimination against certain groups because of their assumed abilities, or lack of
     them, on the basis of their traditional forms of subsistence and ethnicity. Such an organization of
     labour keeps workers divided along ethnic lines and prevents a collective union of workers against
     harsh working conditions. Some candidates might also mention that the harsher working conditions
     of the seasonal field labourers also took a heavier toll on them in terms of disease and death.
     The lower down the ethnic and labour hierarchy one was, the greater the likelihood of disease
     and death. The poorer one was to begin with, the worse the chances of survival and well-being.

     Another aspect of the inferior labour position of the Toba on the plantation was their internalization
     of this situation in their beliefs that the cannibal KiyaGaikpí would not find their flesh tasty because
     the Toba did not eat the nice food of the whites. In this instance relative poverty reflected in poorer
     diet may have worked, as far as the Toba were concerned, to their advantage when confronted
     by cannibals.

2.   Explain the relationship between Toba beliefs about death and disease and their
     work conditions.                                                                [6 marks]

     This question requires candidates to move from the more clearly descriptive answer of question 1 to
     consider the nature of beliefs in devils and cannibals and analyse how these relate to the working
     conditions on the plantation. The plantation itself is located in the vicinity of devils who can
     descend from the nearby mountains to spread disease and death. In this way the place of work in a
     capitalist system is also a place of death and this is reinforced by the descriptions of the bones of
     deceased Toba buried in the cane fields. The death caused by devils arouses fear which
     encompasses the future as well as the present as the deaths of children compromise the Toba’s
     ability to reproduce themselves in the future. The belief in devils, however, reflects the brutality of
     the working conditions and the fear these aroused but does so in a manner which deflects blame for
     the working conditions from the plantation owners to the devils. In this way brutal working
     conditions become naturalized and beyond the scope of human intervention to alter.

     The belief in the cannibal KiyaGaikpí adds a further dimension to the Toba conceptualization of
     their position on the plantation. They are commodified in the most basic way – literally becoming
     food for consumption or no more than meat body-parts for exchange. However, the low social
     position of the Toba on the plantation is internalized by them and reflected in their belief that the
     KiyaGaikpí do not find Toba flesh tasty. This is because, as poor labourers, the Toba do not eat
     good food and so they do not taste as nice as the whites who eat the best food. Although a
     reflection of the way in which they are despised and subjected to the worst of everything on the
     plantation, this Toba belief is also a way of finding some advantage in their lowly position.
     Other examples could also be chosen from the text to answer this question.

     Candidates should draw on relevant anthropological concepts in their answers. This could be
     anything that the candidate has studied relevant to the passage.        For example power,
     class or ethnicity.

     Strong answers will incorporate examples from the text in order to present coherent and well argued
     discussions revealing some of the complexities of belief in relation to social context.

     The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. The question requires
     candidates to demonstrate an understanding of capitalist labour practice as a force which does not
     impact uniformly on all members of a society. While the Toba find ways of expressing and
     understanding the impacts of exploitative working conditions through beliefs in devils
     and cannibals, other social groups may have alternative ways of conceptualising the impacts of
     capitalism on their social order. The ethnic inequalities that the passage highlights may be
     compared to class or gender inequalities in relation to work practices found in other social systems.
     Better answers will be able to demonstrate the variable impacts of labour conditions on different
     segments within a given society.
