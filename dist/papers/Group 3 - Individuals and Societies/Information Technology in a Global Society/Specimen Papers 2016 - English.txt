Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.   BodyGuardian

     The BodyGuardian is a lightweight, wearable and wireless body sensor. This technology allows
     patients to remain active and independent while their health is being monitored with a simple
     sensor that is in contact with their skin.

                                    Figure 1: The BodyGuardian device




                                          [Source: www.mayoclinic.org]


     The BodyGuardian system consists of the BodyGuardian device and a smartphone with the
     BodyGuardian app* installed. The smartphone connects to the cloud-based service mHealth using
     a 3G cell/mobile phone network.

     Doctors are able to access their patient’s data via mHealth using a mobile device. They can also
     set different limits for each patient, allowing for personalized alerts.



* app: application software, typically a small, specialized program downloaded onto
  mobile devices; apps can also run on the internet, on a computer, on a cell/mobile
  phone or other electronic device.

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two health indicators that could be measured by the BodyGuardian
                 device.                                                                                 [2]

		(ii)           Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                 measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                                [4]

     (b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by doctors to
           access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
           • the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
           • the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
             changed every 40 days.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                    [6]

     (c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in clinical
           trials by doctors and patients.

           Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian device
           before it is sold publicly.                                                                   [8]

2.   3D printing

     Charlie is a duck who was born with only one foot. His owner took pictures of another duck’s foot
     from different angles and was able to use 3D printer technology to produce a new plastic foot for
     him.

                                            Figure 4: A 3D printer




                                             [Source: http://cubify.com]


     A 3D printer, like the one shown in Figure 4 creates an object by adding plastic layer by layer until
     it is complete.

     Inspired by Charlie’s story, Alejandro Toys has created a company that uses a computer with a 3D
     printer and software to produce plastic toys for children.

     Alejandro Toys has found out that some software will allow them to input 2D images into the 3D
     printer software so that they can be converted into a 3D object. They are considering either to use
     open source software or to purchase proprietary software.


     (a)   (i)   Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer software.      [2]

		(ii)           Identify four of the steps required to produce Charlie’s replacement foot.             [4]

     (b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to purchase
           proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                                       [6]

     (c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
           to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However some
           governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely available on
           the internet.

           To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for 3D printers?           [8]

3.       Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

         El Hoyo is a small village in the south of Argentina. The local book shop has recently received
         a number of academic books from a large university in Buenos Aires. The university also sent a
         computer which has all of the books listed in a spreadsheet.

         The table in Figure 5 shows a small part of the list of books. The complete table has 400 different
         entries (last entry is in row 401).

         Daniela, the shop manager, has been waiting for a computer for a long time. She knows that, with
         this computer, her staff will provide a faster service when they are searching for specific books.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject area”
                 sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from largest to
                 smallest.

                 State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                 using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                               [1]

		(ii)           State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books in the
                 book store.                                                                           [1]

		(iii)          Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the information
                 about the books. Outline two advantages that a database would have over a
                 spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                                                [4]

     (b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the book
           shop.                                                                                       [6]

     (c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit festival
           takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity. Daniela has
           now created a separate area in the book shop that has several computers with free
           broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to check their emails and find
           information about the local area.

           Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                        [8]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.   Penrose Airport (United Kingdom) automated baggage system

     The automated baggage system designed for Penrose Airport is an example of an IT project
     failure. When a prototype of the system was switched on for a demonstration, bags became
     jammed on the conveyer belt, fell off, or airport employees put them on the wrong conveyer belt.
     As a result, bags were often misrouted, lost or damaged.

     An investigation into the failure of the automated baggage system revealed several problems:
     • the managers of Penrose Airport kept changing their requirements for the system
     • the company that designed and implemented the automated baggage system had never
       created one of this size before
     • the deadline for completion was only two years from the beginning of the project
     • the airlines that use Penrose Airport were not included in the early discussions about the
       project.

     The waterfall method of development was used.

     The project management team, which was composed of the airport’s chief engineer and the
     senior management team of the firm that built the system, made the key decisions regarding the
     project. Several lower level managers, who were not directly involved in the decisions, advised
     the project management team that the project needed four years to complete, not the two years
     allocated.

(Question 4 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two key stakeholders in this automated baggage system project.             [2]

		(ii)           Identify two characteristics of a “prototype”.                                      [2]

		(iii)          Identify two types of information that should have been gathered at the beginning
                 of the automated baggage system project.                                            [2]

     (b)   Explain three reasons why the use of the AGILE system of project development might
           have prevented the failure of the automated baggage system project.                       [6]

     (c)   To what extent is the success of projects such as the Penrose Airport automated

5.     Zunica Chocolates

       Zunica Chocolates sells its products from a number of stores in New Mexico, USA. Sales have
       grown rapidly in recent years.

       Zunica Chocolates has decided to create an e-commerce platform for online sales. This platform
       needs to be integrated with the company’s current website. Zunica Chocolates has decided to
       contract the work out to Karlsons, an e-commerce development company. The owner will work
       with Anna, the project manager at Karlsons, who will design and create the e-commerce platform.
       She has developed a Gantt chart to schedule and coordinate tasks.

6.   Telepresence robots

     Several students of Fernwood School have to study at home because of serious health issues.
     The school is considering whether to purchase VGo robots for these students.

     The robots stand inside the classroom and have a screen that displays the student’s face in real
     time. The student is able to control the robot in order to see and hear what is happening in the
     classroom as well as participate in class discussions, group work, and even attend assemblies or
     join other students in the lunchroom.

     The student at home will need a computer with access to the internet to receive the video
     and sound from the robot. The school will need a Wi-Fi network, because the robot will travel
     throughout the school just as the student would. The student controls the movement of the robot
     from their home computer.

     At the end of the school day, the student “drives” their robot to a secure area where its battery is
     charged overnight.

(Question 6 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two of the sensors that the robot must have in order to move around the
                 classroom.                                                                            [2]

		(ii)           Outline two characteristics that make the VGo different from a fixed video system
                 such as Skype.                                                                        [4]

     (b)   Analyse the impact that using a VGo robot would have on a student who cannot attend
           school in person.                                                                           [6]

     (c)   Larsson Laboratories, which makes drugs for rare diseases, is considering the use of
           VGo robots for company communications. The head office is in central Stockholm, with
           a research laboratory in a nearby town and a production facility in Germany. The VGo
           robots would be used for meetings and visits to the laboratory and production facility by
           managers, as well as by workers who are in the office for some of the time, and work
           from home (telecommute) for the rest.

           Discuss the potential effects of the use of VGo robots for Larsson Laboratories.            [8]

7.   Art and expert systems

     Harold Cohen, a noted painter, has used his knowledge of drawing and colour to create an expert
     system called AARON. AARON uses a knowledge base containing information about real-world
     objects and has a set of rules about how to create works of art. AARON has a robotic arm that it
     uses to mix colours, draw, paint and, finally, clean its paint pots and paint brushes.

                                              Figure 9: AARON




                                          [Source: http://hackaday.com]


     Cohen also gave AARON machine learning capabilities. All of AARON’s works are different
     from one another and, once the program is running, AARON makes all the decisions about the
     paintings; for example AARON makes decisions about the components of the paintings.

                     Figure 10: AARON follows a set of rules to create works of art




                                  [Source: http://prostheticknowledge.tumblr.com]


     AARON’s drawings and paintings have been exhibited in a number of museums, including the
     San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Tate, London and the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam.
     According to one art critic, “AARON allows the spontaneously occurring accidents that often give a
     work of art its character to remain, rather than efficiently cleaning them up”.

(Question 7 continued)

     (a)   AARON, like all expert systems, has a knowledge base and inference engine.

		(i)            Identify two possible items that could be included in AARON’s knowledge base.    [2]

		(ii)           Programs like AARON often contain fuzzy logic. Identify two characteristics of
                 fuzzy logic.                                                                     [2]

		(iii)          Identify two characteristics of machine learning.                                [2]

     (b)   (i)   AARON needs to select colours for leaves and flowers in each drawing. Once a
                 shape is selected, it must follow these rules:
                 • AARON can colour large flowers red
                 • AARON can colour small flowers blue
                 • if the shape is a leaf, AARON can colour it green
                 • if the shape is neither a leaf nor a flower, AARON should not colour it.

                 Copy and complete the information below to construct a decision tree that
                 AARON could use to colour its drawings.                                          [4]

                                                   Figure 11:



                                           Is the colour inside the
                                             shape the same as
                                                the underlying
                                                   canvas?

                                     Yes                              No




                               Do not colour it.            Is the shape a flower?




		(ii)           Explain one weakness of using a decision tree like this one for AARON.           [2]

     (c)   Discuss the museums’ decision to list AARON as the artist when exhibiting AARON’s
           paintings and drawings.                                                                [8]

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                                 Section A
1.    BodyGuardian

     Note to examiners.
      All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
      Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments
        to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks.

      (a)   (i)    Identify two health indicators that could be measured by the BodyGuardian
                   device.                                                                          [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    body temperature
                    respiratory rate
                    blood pressure
                    sugar levels (blood glucose)
                    heart rate/pulse rate
                    electrocardiogram (ECG).

                   Award [1] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2].

            (ii)   Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                   measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                         [4]

                   Answers may include:
                    device takes the measurement
                    measurement converted to digital data/ analogue to digital conversion
                     (ADC)
                    data sent from BodyGuardian device to smartphone
                    patient data is uploaded to mHealth system for analysis
                    value is compared with the “normal” value stored in device for patient
                    if value is outside accepted range, then signal is sent to doctor for action
                     to be taken
                    if value is inside accepted range, then no signal is sent
                    device waits for next time interval to take new measurement.

                   Consider any four steps in the response.

                   Award [1] for each step up to a maximum of [4].

(b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by
      doctors to access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
       the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
       the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
        changed every 40 days.

      Analyse these two options.                                                              [6]

      Answers may include:
       Option: password created by doctor that does not need to be changed
        - familiar for doctor and probably easy for him to remember
        - no need to write it down therefore it will not be found by others
        - others with access to the computer may “guess” it if they know the doctor
          well
        - if the password is discovered/cracked it can be used for an indefinite time
          period. the doctor may not be aware that the password has been
          compromised
        - may allow doctor to access account faster as no need to look-up the
          password
        - a password that is never changed creates a security problem as people
          close to doctor may find out the password (ie see it, guess it)
        - may not be a strong password
       Option: strong password created by doctors that must be changed every 40
        days
        - secure as it may not be related to the doctor – therefore difficult to guess
        - the need of constantly updating the password in mHealth will improve the
          security as it may be harder to guess
        - may be difficult for doctors to remember which variant of the password they
          have used
        - doctor may need to keep it written down – therefore it has the risk of being
          found by others
        - may have difficult characters that may not be in a keyboard of mobile
          devices.

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      Only one of the options is addressed in the response.

      [3–4]: A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples from the
      scenario are used within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS
      terminology in the response. Both options are either explicitly or implicitly implied
      in the response.

      [5–6]: A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates
      thorough knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples from the
      scenario are used throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS
      terminology throughout the response. Both options are explicitly addressed in
      the response.

(c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in
      clinical trials by doctors and patients.

      Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian
      device before it is sold publicly.                                                   [8]

      Answers may include:
       may have to do double checks: with and without the device – this will take
        more time and put the patient under unnecessary stress / may take time from
        busy doctors
       if doctors/patients discover that incorrect information is being sent from the
        device they may not trust it / feel uncomfortable about having to use it
       if device works well doctors/patients may advertise it positively, making others
        more willing to use it
       doctors/patients may need training to use the device
       patients in the trial may feel their health is being more effectively monitored
       patients and/or doctors may provide feedback to improve final device
       patients may need to be assured that security measures have been taken to
        protect the privacy of their data
       doctors may have an opportunity to learn how to use the device before it is
        sold publicly.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

     (a)   (i)    Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer
                  software.                                                                     [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   2D images imported imported into the 3D printer software
                   2D images are opened by the 3D printer software
                   2D file is converted into a format required by the 3D printer software by

                  Answers may include:
                   images of the other duck's foot are imported into the 3D
                    printer/modelling software
                   the software creates a 3D image/model of the foot from the images
                   the 3D image/model is edited to make it the same size as Charlie’s foot
                   printer is loaded with the type of raw material needed for creating the
                    foot
                   the 3D image/model of the foot is sent to the 3D printer
                   the 3D printer creates the replacement foot

                  Award [1] for each step up to a maximum of [4].

(b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to
      purchase proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                       [6]

      Answers may include:
       open-source software is often free or low-cost, allowing the company to aquire
        more software within a limited budget / proprietary software may demand a
        higher level of investment by the company
       open-source software can be changed or customised to suit the company’s
        requirements – the source code is available for programmers to modify /
        proprietary software can only be modified by the manufacturer
       open-source software may have “bugs” that have not yet been reported which
        affect the company’s production (ie may take time to be fixed) / proprietary
        software manufacturers may release patches/bug-fixes on a regular basis
       open-source software may not have all the options/features needed by the
        company / proprietary software often has a greater range of options/features
       manufacturers of proprietary software can provide support and assistance to
        the company / open-source software often has limited support
       using open source software for producing the 3D toys may require hiring more
        programming staff to upgrade the software

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      Only open-source software or proprietary software is explicitly referred to in the
      response.

(c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
      to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However
      some governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely
      available on the internet.

      To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for
      3D printers?                                                                            [8]

      Answers may include:
      Regulation of the access to software for 3D printers
       could aim to ensure good quality of the 3D objects being made. 3D software
        may allow for sub-standard / faulty 3D objects to be manufactured, creating
        risks for users
       could aim to prevent the manufacture of artifacts that are only sold with a
        licence (eg guns). However if similar shapes are needed for other articles,
        their manufacture may be prevented by mistake Eg: if a certain shape is
        recognized the software may not allow it to be printed
       could protect manufacturers of copyrighted products. Owners of 3D printers
        would be prevented from making them
       could prevent owners of 3D printers making their own objects freely, stifling
        innovation
       could mean an invasion of privacy. It is possible to know what blueprint is
        being downloaded to which IP address
       to what extent is regulation possible.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

3.   Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

     Note to examiners.
       Part a and part b questions are marked using ticks and annotations where
        appropriate
      Part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to provide
        a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject
                  area” sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from
                  largest to smallest.

                  State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                  using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                         [1]

                   Badke

                  Award [1] for the correct answer shown above.

           (ii)   State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books
                  in the book store.                                                              [1]

                  Answer may include:
                   =SUM(G2:G401)
                   =SUMA(G2:G401)
                   =ADD(G2:G401)
                   =  (G2:G401). (where xxxx is another valid formula which adds the
                    numbers in cells G2 through G401)
                   =G2+G3+...+G401

                  Award [1] for any one of the above.

(iii)   Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the
        information about the books. Outline two advantages that a database
        would have over a spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                      [4]

        Answers may include:
         queries can be done to select specific records, ie English books
         reports can be made (ie summary of all the books that have been
          purchased, labels can be printed to label the books/bookshelves etc.)
         databases may reduce data redundancy and allow for more efficient
          storage & updating of data than spreadsheets
         a user interface can be included for the book shop staff without much IT
          knowledge, using spreadsheets may require a greater level of IT
          capability
         databases allow for data for a large number of books to be stored and
          accessed without increasing complexity for the user.
         databases allow the field choices to be set so that only certain types of
          data may be entered (e.g. Type of book, language etc.). Spreadsheets
          to not have this possibility.
         a database can limit the view of the data for particular users (e.g.
          Daniela as the shop manager, may be able to view more data than the
          rest of the staff), a spreadsheet does not have this capability

        Note:. If an advantage is generic with no reference to the book shop, a
        maximum of 1 mark is awarded for identifying the advantage.

        Award [1] for identifying an advantage and an additional [1] for an outline
        for that advantage.

        Award up to a maximum of [4] for the question.

(b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the
      book shop.                                                                         [6]

      Answers may include:
       the salesperson may have to learn/receive training on how to use the
        computer and software. This may involve additional time commitment.
       the salesperson may request new software applications (ie image editing
        software to create posters about the books) or hardware (ie barcode
        scanners) and this may involve costs
       shop owner may now expect the salesperson to perform analysis of
        sales/inventory
       having a computer may allow the salesperson to perform additional tasks
        (ie printing of advertisements about new books, mail merged letters, ordering
        books from their supplier)
       employees work will be easier and faster as they can check directly in the
        computer if they have a copy of the book
       staff will no longer have to calculate the costs of books manually leading to
        less errors in charging customers/fewer customer complaints.

      Award [1] for each impact identified, and an additional [1] for an appropriate
      explanation of that impact.

      Award a maximum of [6] for the response.

(c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit
      festival takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity.
      Daniela has now created a separate area in the book shop that has several
      computers with free broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to
      check their emails and find information about the local area.

      Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                [8]

       Answers may include:
        additional staff with IT expertise may be needed to work in that area if the
         demand is high installation, maintenance and repairs may be needed if the
         equipment is used frequently
        antivirus and firewalls may be needed to be installed
        the shop may become a popular place and sales of books may increase
        Daniela’s investment may not be cost effective if demand for the bookshop’s
         internet access decreases
        Daniela may need to develop an acceptable use policy
        Daniella may have access to the browser histories on the computers and
         could use that information to help decide what books to stock
       staff are able to query the book database for specific information (e.g. all of
         the books written by a certain author, all books which cost less than $200).

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

        appropriate
      Part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to provide
        a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)     Identify two key stakeholders in this automated baggage system project.      [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    passengers
                    airlines
                    airport’s chief engineer
                    airport’s managers
                    firm that built the system (or its senior management team)
                    system development personnel
                    project management team.

                   Note: reward a specific member of any team i.e. someone who would be on
                   the project management team, but do NOT reward two members of the
                   same team.

                   Award [1] for each of the points identified above up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Identify two characteristics of a “prototype”.                               [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    early working model of a system or subsystem
                    used to test the system (eg interface, functioning)
                    used to demonstrate how the system will work
                    used to check whether the systems will meet the target user’s
                     requirements.

                   Award [1] for each of the points identified above up to a maximum of [2].

           (iii)   Identify two types of information that should have been gathered at the
                   beginning of the automated baggage system project.                           [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    amount of baggage the system will need to handle
                    maximum size and weight of baggage
                    needs of individual airlines
                    time parameters ie when is the automated baggage system scheduled to
                     open
                    number of concourses or gates to be served by the system
                    cost estimate.

                   Award [1] for each kind of information identified up to a maximum of [2].

(b)   Explain three reasons why the use of the AGILE system of project development
      might have prevented the failure of the automated baggage system project.             [6]

      Answers may include:
       project could be adapted to changing needs of the stakeholders
       the concerns of lower level managers would have been heeded (eg resolving
        issues early on before they became significant
       small parts of the system can be tested as they are developed (eg the parts of
        the baggage system that failed would have been caught early)
       requires stakeholders and developers to work together throughout the process
        (eg airlines would have communicated requirements throughout the process)
       developers work in teams increasing communication
       deadlines can be adjusted based on concrete information about the current
        performance of the system.

      Award [1] for each reason why the use of the AGILE system of project
      development might have avoided the failure of the automated baggage system
      project.

      Award [1] linked to each reason identified for why the use of the AGILE system of
      project development might have avoided the failure of the automated baggage
      system project. [1] giving a maximum of [2] for each reason.

      Mark as [2 + 2 + 2].

(c)   To what extent is the success of projects such as the Penrose Airport automated
      baggage system dependent on the involvement of key stakeholders throughout
      the development process?                                                              [8]

      Advantages may include:
       needs of all stakeholders will be taken into account from the beginning/avoids
        sudden dramatic changes in the project
       key stakeholders will have a clear idea of how the project is progressing
       regular communication with stakeholders ensures that the solution will meet
        their needs
       affords developers the possibility of working with experts who have detailed
        knowledge of the system requirement
       enables early recognition of small problems before they become huge
        problems
       regular communication ensures that necessary resources can be identified
        and provided.

      Disadvantages may include:
       if views of some stakeholders are divergent from the rest, the project could fail
       coordination problems, ie between stakeholders, could cause delays in the
         project
       if there is no centralized control and knowledge, the project could fail
       meetings with stakeholders can be time consuming and/or non-productive.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

      to ensure the success of the project. The answer may be unbalanced and lack
      appropriate reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [5–6]: A clear, detailed explanation of how both alpha and beta testing can be
      used to ensure the success of the project.

(c)   To what extent could the use of a Gantt chart such as the one above lead to the
      successful development of Zunica Chocolates's website?                               [8]

      Benefits may include:
       use of a Gantt chart visualizes the process eg helps to maintain organization
       it illustrates which tasks must be completed before the next one can begin
       task can be viewed against a calendar showing start and end dates
       resources required for tasks can be linked to the tasks on the chart.

      Drawbacks may include:
       it is a linear ie step-by-step process so it is very inflexible. Changes are
        difficult to make
       errors are difficult to correct
       changes could result in significant costs
       chart can be too simplistic ie does not provide enough detail for a complex
        project ie this chart leaves out the construction of the database
       it is difficult to show where there is slack time in the project.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

6.   Telepresence robots

     Note to examiners.
       All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
       Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
        comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Identify two of the sensors that the robot must have in order to move
                  around the classroom.                                                         [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   cliff/edge detection
                   sensor to detect edge of the wireless network
                   sensor to detect battery level
                   motion sensor
                   proximity sensor (obstacle detection)
                   visual sensor.

                  Note: do not accept distance sensor or cameras.
                  Award [1] for each sensor identified up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Outline two characteristics that make the VGo different from a fixed video
                  system such as Skype.                                                         [4]

                  Answers may include:
                   the VGo robot is portable while the video system must be available in
                    every classroom
                   the student controls the VGo robot, can move from class to class along
                    with everyone else while a portable video system must be wheeled
                    around by a staff member
                   the student controls the VGo while someone in each classroom needs to
                    position the camera
                   the student can move around the classroom as if she were physically
                    present but the video system is relatively fixed
                   the camera in the VGO system can look all around instead of having a
                    fixed perspective
                   student can control the robot from a remote place
                   student can zoom in and out to see details or get a better perspective on
                    the room.

                  Award [1] for each characteristic that makes the VGo different from a fixed
                  video system such as Skype identified up to a maximum of [2].

                  Award [1] for each expansion of each characteristic identified up to a
                  maximum of [1] giving a maximum of [2].

                  Mark as [2 + 2].

(b)   Analyse the impact that using a VGo robot would have on a student who cannot
      attend school in person.                                                              [6]

      Advantages may include:
       students will be able to participate fully in interactive class discussions/group
        work/working in pairs so they will have the full educational experience
       students will be able to move from class to class with peers/go to the
        lunchroom/chat while walking through the halls so they will be able to develop
        friendships
       student can participate in some extracurricular activities.

      Disadvantages may include:
       sitting in front of a computer monitor can be tiring for the user
       parents might have privacy concerns about using cameras in class
       if the robot loses power, drops the internet connection or there’s a hardware
         or software failure, the student will not be able to follow the lesson
       The student might play with the robot and get distracted
       Other students in school might make the student using the robot feel
         uncomfortable
       if the student is not confident or competent at using the VGo, the student’s
         ability to follow the lesson will be reduced

      [1–2]: A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic.

      [3–4]: A reasonable description of the positive and negative impacts of using the
      VGo robot in this scenario. The answer may be unbalanced and lack appropriate
      reasoning at the lower end of the band.

      [5–6]: A balanced and thorough analysis of the positive and negative impacts of
      using the VGo robot in this scenario.

(c)   Larsson Laboratories, which makes drugs for rare diseases, is considering the
      use of VGo robots for company communications. The head office is in central
      Stockholm, with a research laboratory in a nearby town and a production facility
      in Germany. The VGo robots would be used for meetings and visits to the
      laboratory and production facility by managers, as well as by workers who are in
      the office for some of the time, and work from home (telecommute) for the rest.

      Discuss the potential effects of the use of VGo robots for Larsson Laboratories.      [8]

      Advantages may include:
       the system would allow employees who telecommute to interact with
        colleagues in the office
       would save the business the costs of travel ie transportation,
        accommodations, meals; especially important for global companies
       employees can gain visual access to remote facilities such as manufacturing
        facilities, laboratories, etc
       employees can be more productive as time will not need to be spent on travel
        eg managers can visit multiple locations in a short period of time
       allows for “walk and talk” or “watercooler” discussions ie informal collaboration
       allows direct monitoring and interaction with employees if the supervisor is not
        physically present
       fewer people physically present means less risk of contamination in the
        laboratory.

      Disadvantages may include:
       trust is harder to build when working with telecommunication technologies eg
         personal relationships are often critical in business environments
       bandwidth can be a problem ie video requires significant bandwidth.
         Companies may be limited in the use of robots by cost of bandwidth or may
         find their networks cannot handle the telepresence robots
       security is a problem because remote control cameras are moving around a
         financial institution or research laboratory
       the use of the internet to transmit the video opens up the company to
         breaches of security
       can make employees uncomfortable because they feel as if they’re being
         spied on
       cannot be sure the robot will be controlled by the person who is supposed to
         be controlling it
       the field of vision of VGo’s camera is not as wide as a human’s, so it is
         impossible to have a view of the whole room
       a moving robot may risk expensive equipment or spill chemicals if not
         controlled correctly by the remote control user.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

7.   Art and expert systems

     Note to examiners.
         Part a and part b questions are marked using ticks and annotations where
            appropriate
         Part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to
            provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   AARON, like all expert systems, has a knowledge base and inference engine.

           (i)     Identify two possible items that could be included in AARON’s knowledge
                   base.                                                                         [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    part of a human body
                    physical types
                    a set of colours to choose from
                    basic shapes.

                   Award [1] for each item that could be in AARON’s knowledge base
                   identified up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)    Programs like AARON often contain fuzzy logic. Identify two
                   characteristics of fuzzy logic.                                               [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    based on degrees of truth not “true or false”, eg percentages
                    can quantify natural language expressions that state imprecise values,
                     eg hot, warm, cool
                    can be used in situations where precise values are not known, eg the
                     temperature in a clothes dryer
                    uses the logical values between 0 and 1 ie things can be partly true and
                     partly false at the same time.

                   Award [1] for each characteristic identified.

           (iii)   Identify two characteristics of machine learning.                             [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    software learns from data/input
                    software can perform new tasks after processing the data
                    software can react to new inputs it has not encountered before
                    software searches through data for patterns and adjusts accordingly
                    an example might be the newsfeed in Facebook/adjusts to the users
                     behaviour.

                   Award [1] for each of the characteristics stated above up to a maximum
                   of [2].
                                            – 22 –             SPEC/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(b)   (i)   AARON needs to select colours for leaves and flowers in each drawing.
            Once a shape is selected, it must follow these rules:
             AARON can colour large flowers red
             AARON can colour small flowers blue
             if the shape is a leaf, AARON can colour it green
             if the shape is neither a leaf nor a flower, AARON should not colour it.

            Copy and complete the information below to construct a decision tree that
            AARON could use to colour its drawings.                                      [4]




            Answers may include:
             Y/N at each decision node
             leads to correct conclusions, bottom line
             exactly four levels
             exactly four terminators
             no false leads.

            Any four points, award [1] each up to a maximum of [4].
                                       – 23 –             SPEC/3/ITGSX/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(ii)   Explain one weakness of using a decision tree like this one for AARON.         [2]

       Answers may include:
        the decision tree is based on preset parameters which may not address
         all of the eventualities encountered when AARON is trying to complete a
         painting
        “flower size: large or small” is ambiguous and relative
        the decision tree is made up of binary choices which are very limited,
         ie only two choices for colour/only flowers vs. leaves. This could be very
         limiting OR could lead to a huge decision tree thus a very slow program
        the decision tree may be influenced by new information as a result of
         machine learning during the creation of a painting by AARON. This may
         lead to paintings being created using different inference rules (and not
         being consistent in the style intended).

       Award [1] for identifying one reason why the use of a decision tree like the
       one in b(i) for AARON may be considered a weakness.

       Award [1] for why the use of a decision tree like the one in b(i) for AARON
       may be considered a weakness. [1] giving a maximum of [2].

(c)   Discuss the museums’ decision to list AARON as the artist when exhibiting
      AARON’s paintings and drawings.                                                     [8]

      Reasons supporting the decision may include:
       each of AARON’s works is unique, ie AARON remembers its drawings so it
        does not repeat itself
       AARON makes all the decisions so it is the artist
       works to be exhibited in museums are judged to be art by the curators, ie they
        are appreciated as fine art
       it is impossible to know what an artist was feeling when she/he created the
        work of art
       human brains work creatively while we are unconscious, ie asleep.

      Reasons against the decision may include:
       Harold Cohen wrote the program so he is the artist
       AARON cannot experience the world the way a human can so he cannot
        create art
       AARON is not conscious so it cannot make decisions about the quality of its
        art
       there can be multiple copies of the program, so there is no individual artist
       AARON can only create images out of the knowledge that Cohen has
        programmed into it
       real art communicates the emotion/passion of the artist.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

1.   BodyGuardian

     The BodyGuardian is a lightweight, wearable and wireless body sensor. This technology allows
     patients to remain active and independent while their health is being monitored with a simple
     sensor that is in contact with their skin.

                                    Figure 1: The BodyGuardian device




                                          [Source: www.mayoclinic.org]


     The BodyGuardian system consists of the BodyGuardian device and a smartphone with the
     BodyGuardian app* installed. The smartphone connects to the cloud-based service mHealth using
     a 3G cell/mobile phone network.

     Doctors are able to access their patient’s data via mHealth using a mobile device. They can also

(Question 1 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Identify two health indicators that could be measured by the BodyGuardian               [2]
                 device.

		(ii)           Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                 measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                                [4]

     (b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by doctors to
           access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
           • the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
           • the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
             changed every 40 days.

           Analyse these two options.                                                                    [6]

     (c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in clinical
           trials by doctors and patients.

           Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian device
           before it is sold publicly.                                                                   [8]

2.   3D printing

     Charlie is a duck who was born with only one foot. His owner took pictures of another duck’s foot
     from different angles and was able to use 3D printer technology to produce a new plastic foot for
     him.

     A 3D printer, like the one shown in Figure 4 creates an object by adding plastic layer by layer until
     it is complete.

     Inspired by Charlie’s story, Alejandro Toys has created a company that uses a computer with a 3D
     printer and software to produce plastic toys for children.

     Alejandro Toys has found out that some software will allow them to input 2D images into the 3D
     printer software so that they can be converted into a 3D object. They are considering either to use
     open source software or to purchase proprietary software.


     (a)   (i)   Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer software.      [2]

		(ii)           Identify four of the steps required to produce Charlie’s replacement foot.             [4]

     (b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to purchase
           proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                                       [6]

     (c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
           to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However some
           governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely available on
           the internet.

           To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for 3D printers?           [8]

3.       Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

         El Hoyo is a small village in the south of Argentina. The local book shop has recently received
         a number of academic books from a large university in Buenos Aires. The university also sent a
         computer which has all of the books listed in a spreadsheet.

         The table in Figure 5 shows a small part of the list of books. The complete table has 400 different
         entries (last entry is in row 401).

         Daniela, the shop manager, has been waiting for a computer for a long time. She knows that, with
         this computer, her staff will provide a faster service when they are searching for specific books.

(Question 3 continued)

     (a)   (i)   Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject area”
                 sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from largest to
                 smallest.

                 State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                 using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                               [1]

		(ii)           State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books in the
                 book store.                                                                           [1]

		(iii)          Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the information
                 about the books. Outline two advantages that a database would have over a
                 spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                                                [4]

     (b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the book
           shop.                                                                                       [6]

     (c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit festival
           takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity. Daniela has
           now created a separate area in the book shop that has several computers with free
           broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to check their emails and find
           information about the local area.

           Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                        [8]

4.   Digital citizenship

     After several problematic situations with the use of technology by students and staff, a school
     decided to adopt “We are Digital Citizens” as its mission statement for the year. This goes beyond
     limiting access to some resources such as social networking sites and video streaming sites, and
     instead focuses on using technology inside and outside of school in a responsible way.

     The network administrator has also been told to allow the downloading or streaming of videos
     from the internet. However he has explained to the principal that allowing this would cause issues
     related to bandwidth, storage and appropriateness of content for high school students.

     A working party has been set up, consisting of the network administrator, teachers from different
     departments and some students. This working party will meet to plan a programme of activities for
     the next year that will be used to help teachers and students understand what digital citizenship is,
     and how to promote the responsible use of technology by everybody in the school.


     (a)   (i)   Outline one difference between streaming and downloading videos.                       [2]

		(ii)           Define the term “bandwidth”.                                                           [2]

		(iii)          The science teacher wants to show to the class a video about polar bears and
                 how they survive living near the north pole.

                 The size of this video is 3.2 gigabytes (GB) and it is available for download.
                 The teacher will download it in advance to be able to show it to the class without
                 the need for an internet connection.

                 The school has a bandwidth of 50 megabits per second (Mbps). Calculate how
                 long it will take the teacher to download the video.

                 Use 1 GB = 1000 megabyte (MB).                                                         [2]

     (b)   At the request of the principal, the network administrator has allowed teachers to
           download videos. Students are still not allowed to download videos at any time using
           the school internet.

           Analyse the impact this will have on the teachers and the students.                          [6]

     (c)   One area that the working party will focus on is the responsible use of the available
           bandwidth. Some teachers have found that the internet is too slow to allow a class to
           investigate a topic when students in different classes are using social networking sites.

           To what extent can the implementation of the digital citizenship policies ensure the
           responsible use of technology in the school with respect to sharing the available
           bandwidth?                                                                                   [8]

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach,
which if appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your team leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate
even if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                   device.                                                                          [2]

                   Answers may include:
                    body temperature
                    respiratory rate
                    blood pressure
                    sugar levels (blood glucose)
                    heart rate/pulse rate
                    electrocardiogram (ECG).

                   Award [1] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2].

            (ii)   Identify four steps taken by the software to decide if a health indicator
                   measurement needs to be sent to a doctor for a decision.                         [4]

                   Answers may include:
                    device takes the measurement
                    measurement converted to digital data/ analogue to digital conversion
                     (ADC)
                    data sent from BodyGuardian device to smartphone
                    patient data is uploaded to mHealth system for analysis
                    value is compared with the “normal” value stored in device for patient
                    if value is outside accepted range, then signal is sent to doctor for action
                     to be taken
                    if value is inside accepted range, then no signal is sent
                    device waits for next time interval to take new measurement.

                   Consider any four steps in the response.

                   Award [1] for each step up to a maximum of [4].

(b)   The managers of mHealth are investigating the nature of passwords used by
      doctors to access patient information. The two options being investigated are:
       the doctor creates a password that does not need to be changed
       the mHealth system requires doctors to create a strong password that must be
        changed every 40 days.

      Analyse these two options.                                                              [6]

      Answers may include:
       Option: password created by doctor that does not need to be changed
        - familiar for doctor and probably easy for him to remember
        - no need to write it down therefore it will not be found by others
        - others with access to the computer may “guess” it if they know the doctor
          well
        - if the password is discovered/cracked it can be used for an indefinite time
          period. the doctor may not be aware that the password has been
          compromised
        - may allow doctor to access account faster as no need to look-up the
          password
        - a password that is never changed creates a security problem as people
          close to doctor may find out the password (ie see it, guess it)
        - may not be a strong password
       Option: strong password created by doctors that must be changed every 40
        days
        - secure as it may not be related to the doctor – therefore difficult to guess
        - the need of constantly updating the password in mHealth will improve the
          security as it may be harder to guess
        - may be difficult for doctors to remember which variant of the password they
          have used
        - doctor may need to keep it written down – therefore it has the risk of being
          found by others
        - may have difficult characters that may not be in a keyboard of mobile
          devices.

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      Only one of the options is addressed in the response.

      [3–4]: A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples from the
      scenario are used within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS
      terminology in the response. Both options are either explicitly or implicitly implied
      in the response.

      [5–6]: A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates
      thorough knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples from the
      scenario are used throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS
      terminology throughout the response. Both options are explicitly addressed in
      the response.

(c)   As part of the development of the BodyGuardian device, it is being tested in
      clinical trials by doctors and patients.

      Discuss the implications for doctors and patients of trialling the BodyGuardian
      device before it is sold publicly.                                                   [8]

      Answers may include:
       may have to do double checks: with and without the device – this will take
        more time and put the patient under unnecessary stress / may take time from
        busy doctors
       if doctors/patients discover that incorrect information is being sent from the
        device they may not trust it / feel uncomfortable about having to use it
       if device works well doctors/patients may advertise it positively, making others
        more willing to use it
       doctors/patients may need training to use the device
       patients in the trial may feel their health is being more effectively monitored
       patients and/or doctors may provide feedback to improve final device
       patients may need to be assured that security measures have been taken to
        protect the privacy of their data
       doctors may have an opportunity to learn how to use the device before it is
        sold publicly.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   3D printing

     Note to examiners.
       All part a questions are marked using ticks and annotations where appropriate
       Part b and part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text
        comments to provide a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Identify two ways that a 2D image file can be input into the 3D printer
                  software.                                                                     [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   2D images imported imported into the 3D printer software
                   2D images are opened by the 3D printer software
                   2D file is converted into a format required by the 3D printer software by
                    another file conversion program.

                  Award [1] for each way up to a maximum of [2].

           (ii)   Identify four of the steps required to produce Charlie’s replacement foot.    [4]

                  Answers may include:
                   images of the other duck's foot are imported into the 3D
                    printer/modelling software
                   the software creates a 3D image/model of the foot from the images
                   the 3D image/model is edited to make it the same size as Charlie’s foot
                   printer is loaded with the type of raw material needed for creating the
                    foot
                   the 3D image/model of the foot is sent to the 3D printer
                   the 3D printer creates the replacement foot

                  Award [1] for each step up to a maximum of [4].

(b)   Analyse Alejandro Toys’s decision to either use open source software or to
      purchase proprietary software to produce the company’s 3D toys.                       [6]

      Answers may include:
       open-source software is often free or low-cost, allowing the company to aquire
        more software within a limited budget / proprietary software may demand a
        higher level of investment by the company
       open-source software can be changed or customised to suit the company’s
        requirements – the source code is available for programmers to modify /
        proprietary software can only be modified by the manufacturer
       open-source software may have “bugs” that have not yet been reported which
        affect the company’s production (ie may take time to be fixed) / proprietary
        software manufacturers may release patches/bug-fixes on a regular basis
       open-source software may not have all the options/features needed by the
        company / proprietary software often has a greater range of options/features
       manufacturers of proprietary software can provide support and assistance to
        the company / open-source software often has limited support
       using open source software for producing the 3D toys may require hiring more
        programming staff to upgrade the software

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.
      Only open-source software or proprietary software is explicitly referred to in the

(c)   It is now possible to use a 3D printer to print a large range of products in addition
      to toys. These include guns, bicycles and human prosthetic limbs. However
      some governments are concerned about the software for 3D printers being freely
      available on the internet.

      To what extent should governments regulate the access to software for
      3D printers?                                                                            [8]

      Answers may include:
      Regulation of the access to software for 3D printers
       could aim to ensure good quality of the 3D objects being made. 3D software
        may allow for sub-standard / faulty 3D objects to be manufactured, creating
        risks for users
       could aim to prevent the manufacture of artifacts that are only sold with a
        licence (eg guns). However if similar shapes are needed for other articles,
        their manufacture may be prevented by mistake Eg: if a certain shape is
        recognized the software may not allow it to be printed
       could protect manufacturers of copyrighted products. Owners of 3D printers
        would be prevented from making them
       could prevent owners of 3D printers making their own objects freely, stifling
        innovation
       could mean an invasion of privacy. It is possible to know what blueprint is
        being downloaded to which IP address
       to what extent is regulation possible.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

3.   Small town book shop moves to computer-based records

     Note to examiners.
       Part a and part b questions are marked using ticks and annotations where
        appropriate
      Part c are marked using markbands. Use annotations and text comments to provide
        a rationale behind the marks you awarded. Do not use ticks

     (a)   (i)    Daniela needs to see the books in alphabetical order, with the “Subject
                  area” sorted from A to Z and then the “Number of books” sorted from
                  largest to smallest.

                  State the author that would appear in the first row of the sorted spreadsheet
                  using only the books shown in Figure 5.                                         [1]

                   Badke

                  Award [1] for the correct answer shown above.

           (ii)   State the formula that would be required to add up the cost of all the books
                  in the book store.                                                              [1]

                  Answer may include:
                   =SUM(G2:G401)
                   =SUMA(G2:G401)
                   =ADD(G2:G401)
                   =  (G2:G401). (where xxxx is another valid formula which adds the
                    numbers in cells G2 through G401)
                   =G2+G3+...+G401

                  Award [1] for any one of the above.

(iii)   Daniela now thinks that she should have installed a database for the
        information about the books. Outline two advantages that a database
        would have over a spreadsheet for the El Hoyo book shop.                      [4]

        Answers may include:
         queries can be done to select specific records, ie English books
         reports can be made (ie summary of all the books that have been
          purchased, labels can be printed to label the books/bookshelves etc.)
         databases may reduce data redundancy and allow for more efficient
          storage & updating of data than spreadsheets
         a user interface can be included for the book shop staff without much IT
          knowledge, using spreadsheets may require a greater level of IT
          capability
         databases allow for data for a large number of books to be stored and
          accessed without increasing complexity for the user.
         databases allow the field choices to be set so that only certain types of
          data may be entered (e.g. Type of book, language etc.). Spreadsheets
          to not have this possibility.
         a database can limit the view of the data for particular users (e.g.
          Daniela as the shop manager, may be able to view more data than the
          rest of the staff), a spreadsheet does not have this capability

        Note:. If an advantage is generic with no reference to the book shop, a
        maximum of 1 mark is awarded for identifying the advantage.

        Award [1] for identifying an advantage and an additional [1] for an outline
        for that advantage.

        Award up to a maximum of [4] for the question.

(b)   Explain three impacts that the new computer system may have for the staff at the
      book shop.                                                                          [6]

      Answers may include:
       the salesperson may have to learn/receive training on how to use the
        computer and software. This may involve additional time commitment.
       the salesperson may request new software applications (ie image editing
        software to create posters about the books) or hardware (ie barcode
        scanners) and this may involve costs
       shop owner may now expect the salesperson to perform analysis of
        sales/inventory
       having a computer may allow the salesperson to perform additional tasks
        (ie printing of advertisements about new books, mail merged letters, ordering
        books from their supplier)
       employees work will be easier and faster as they can check directly in the
        computer if they have a copy of the book
       staff will no longer have to calculate the costs of books manually leading to
        less errors in charging customers/fewer customer complaints
       staff are able to query the book database for specific information (e.g. all of
        the books written by a certain author, all books which cost less than $200).

      Award [1] for each impact identified, and an additional [1] for an appropriate
      explanation of that impact.

      Award a maximum of [6] for the response.

(c)   El Hoyo receives a large number of tourists during the summer when the fruit
      festival takes place, but suffers from periods of poor internet connectivity.
      Daniela has now created a separate area in the book shop that has several
      computers with free broadband internet access so that tourists can use them to
      check their emails and find information about the local area.

      Evaluate the impacts of this initiative for Daniela as shop manager.                [8]

      Answers may include:
       additional staff with IT expertise may be needed to work in that area if the
        demand is high installation. Daniela may need to meet additional wage costs
       maintenance and repairs may be needed if the equipment is used frequently,
        increasing costs to the shop
       website blocking software, antivirus and firewalls may be needed to be
        installed which may increase costs to the shop
       the shop may become a popular place and sales of books may increase
       Daniela’s investment may not be cost effective if demand for the bookshop’s
        internet access decreases
       Daniela may need to develop an acceptable use policy
       Daniella may have access to the browser histories on the computers and
        could use that information to help decide what books to stock

      Note: Do not award marks for references to staff being able to search faster or
      more easily for information relating to books. This is stated in the scenario.


      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

     (a)   (i)    Outline one difference between streaming and downloading videos.              [2]

                  Answers may include:
                   streaming video is content sent in compressed form over the internet
                    and displayed by the viewer in real time / downloaded videos are stored
                    on a local device and played later
                   streaming video can start to be played as soon as sufficient data arrives
                    / downloaded videos must finish downloading before they can be played
                   streaming video requires a network connection to be maintained
                    throughout the playing / downloaded video can be stored for offline
                    playback
                   streaming videos may pause or stutter if the bandwidth/data transfer rate
                    is too low / downloaded videos are more likely to play without
                    interruption from the hard disk
                   Download videos occupy storage space on the local device / streaming
                    videos are only stored temporarily while they are being played

                  Award [1] for identifying a difference for either streaming or downloading
                  videos with an implied reference to the other.

                  Award up to a maximum of [2] for an outline of a difference between
                  streaming and downloading videos that explicitly refers to both methods of
                  watching videos.

           (ii)   Define the term “bandwidth”.                                                  [2]

(iii)   The science teacher wants to show to the class a video about polar bears
        and how they survive living near the north pole.

        The size of this video is 3.2 gigabytes (GB) and is available for download.
        The teacher will download it in advance to be able to show it to the class
        without the need for an internet connection.

        The school has a bandwidth of 50 megabits per second (Mbps). Calculate
        how long it will take the teacher to download the video.

        Use 1 GB = 1000 megabyte (MB).                                                  [2]

        Answers may include:
         convert 3.2 Gigabytes to Megabytes – 3.2  1000  3200MB
         multiply by 8 to get it into Megabits – 25 600 Mbits
                                                     25 600
         divide by 50 to get the download time –            512 seconds,
                                                       50
          or 8 minutes 32 seconds.

        Award [1] for the correct calculation of file size 3200 MB.
        Award [1] for the correct calculation into time.

(b)   At the request of the principal, the network administrator has allowed teachers to
      download videos. Students are still not allowed to download videos at any time
      using the school internet.

      Analyse the impact this will have on the teachers and the students.                   [6]

      Answers may include:
       teachers can download a video and save it to use it with class in the future
       teachers may have to stay after school hours if they want to download videos
        using the school internet as they may not have time to do it during the day
       teachers may have fewer problems with the video in class if it has been
        downloaded as the internet speed will not affect the playing of the video
       teachers may be better prepared for a lesson
       students may receive the a link to the videos to watch at home before the
        lesson
       internet speed will not affect the flow of the lesson when watching the video
        during a lesson
       students may ask for a copy of the video without having to use internet to
        download it or watch it
       students may resort to downloading study-related videos at home which could
        incur costs/consumption of bandwidth
       if the video is deleted/removed from the internet the teacher/student will still
        have a copy to use.

      [1–2]: A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and
      understanding of the impact of downloading videos using the school internet and
      uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4]: A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the impact of downloading of videos using the
      school internet. Some relevant examples related to the scenario are used within
      the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the
      response. Award a maximum of [4] if only the impact on teachers or students are
      addressed.

      [5–6]: A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates
      thorough knowledge and understanding of the impact of downloading videos
      using the school internet. Relevant examples related to the scenario are used
      throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the
      response.

(c)   One area that the working party will focus on is the responsible use of the
      available bandwidth. Some teachers have found that the internet is too slow to
      allow a class to investigate a topic when students in different classes are using
      social networking sites.

      To what extent can the implementation of the digital citizenship policies ensure
      the responsible use of technology in the school with respect to sharing the
      available bandwidth?                                                                [8]

      Answers may include:
       policies without a previous education campaign /involvement of stakeholders
        may not work
       teachers/students may feel they can ignore the policies because they do not
        apply to their situation (e.g. downloading copyrighted videos to use in class
        because the school has insufficient bandwidth to stream them)
       digital citizenship policies are only as effective to the extent which all the
        stakeholders in the school community agree to follow them (e.g. students,
        teachers, parents, administrators etc.)
       the school may need to use technical solutions to support responsible use
        (e.g. blocking certain social networking sites, monitoring students network
        activities)

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

             Theme: Student cyber-bullying using social networking sites

IT system: using computer-based technologies and social networks

     According to a recent poll, more than 10 % of parents surveyed around the world said their child
     had been cyber-bullied and nearly 25 % knew a child who had been a victim. The most widely
     reported method of online cyber-bullying is by using social networking sites, such as Facebook.

     Results from the poll indicated that 32 % of parents in India had said that their child had
 5   experienced cyber-bullying, followed by 20 % in Brazil, 18 % in Canada and Saudi Arabia, and 15 %
     in the United States.

     Billye, in Utah, USA and Olivia, in Wales, UK are two teenagers that have been victims of
     cyber-bullying through Ask.fm. Ask.fm is a social networking site that is popular with teenagers.
     The site allows an account holder to send anonymous questions from a cell phone (mobile phone)
10   or laptop to another account holder. Once a response is received, the exchange of messages
     is posted publicly for anyone to read. Both Billye and Olivia received a constant stream of nasty
     messages through the site, and felt that they would not survive this cyber-bullying. Cyber-bullying
     victims suffer from a range of stress-related health problems, including anxiety and depression.
     In the case of Billye and Olivia, they were able to take control of the situation and overcome the
15   cyber-bullying. In instances where the cyber-bullies anonymously post in school, school security
     systems can be used to identify the cyber-bullies.

     People who cyber-bully are able to terrorize their victims 24/7 by using cell phone apps* to post
     directly to social networking sites. The postings can include a range of personal information,
     photos, or videos intended to hurt or embarrass the victim. The anonymous nature of these
20   websites may also lead bullies to behave even more aggressively than they would in real life.

     There is considerable evidence that cyber-bullying is a worldwide concern. However children
     and students often feel helpless when they are trapped in a cyber-bullying situation. Parents are
     uncertain about how to help their child if they are being bullied via their cell phone services and
     social networking sites. In some locations, parents of the children who are doing the cyber-bullying
25   may be held accountable for the actions of their children.

     Teachers and school administrators are often uncertain about what their role and responsibility is
     regarding cyber-bullying that occurs both inside and outside of the school premises. They are also
     concerned about how cyber-bullying disrupts the school’s positive learning environment and are
     uncertain about what action they should take. Often it is unclear if laws apply in some instances
30   of cyber-bullying. In other situations new laws have been passed quickly and may be difficult to
     enforce. However social networking sites do not want to lose their advertisers and customers.
     They often make claims on their websites that they are addressing issues related to cyber-bullying.

Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment
criterion has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate
range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels
failure to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

 The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

 The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
   the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be
   made when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark
   awarded should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is
   not necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

 When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion
   until they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If
   a piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
   one that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

 Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
   if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should
   award the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

 Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
   acceptable.

 Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
   the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
   a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions
   of the work being assessed.

 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
   attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
   low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
   other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will
   produce any particular distribution of marks.

 The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

           specific concerns listed below.

           [1]: For identification of the concern, which may not be explicitly named
           separately or incorrectly named or vaguely named (ie identifying cyber-bullying
           without describing a related impact/result/consequence/effect/outcome).

           [2]: The candidate must describe the impact/result/consequences/effect/
           outcome of the concern to obtain [2]. If the description does not support the
           identified concern, award [1]. Detailed description not required as it will come into
           2b

           If two linked/overlapping concerns are identified, eg reliability and integrity,
           mark the best response and that concern needs to be explained in (2)(b).

           The description needs to reference the IT system in the article (sometimes
           candidates will describe the issue and not the concern in context).

           If two different concerns are raised, since the question specifies one concern
           hence only mark the first; except if commonly linked eg security and privacy,
           anonymity and on-going harassment.

           Social/ethical concerns may include the following:
            anonymity – being able to post anonymously on social networking sites giving
             potential for aggressive behaviour
            on-going harassment – leading to hurt and embarrassment
            privacy (use and sharing of personal information without permission) the
             unethical use of personal information from a victim with the intent of
             harassment (if a concern is identified as privacy but described as another
             concern e.g. anonymity = 1 mark)
            ethics of cyber-bullying (incorrect behaviour on the internet)/digital citizenship
             in appropriate use of technology – this is regarded as unacceptable and even
             illegal in some circumstances
            authenticity – public availability of information about the victim which may not
             be true , defamatory claims.

(b)       Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system in the
          article.

          Describe means to include who, what and where but not how and why for full
          marks.

          [1]: Who – identification of the stakeholder.

          [2]:   Where social networking sites or sms or emails.
                 What are they doing with the IT system - to communicate, interacting with
                 others or to post information, images and videos about the victim eg
                 “uploading files” or “posting information” is insufficient, must make a
                 reference to how and where.

          Primary stakeholders may include the following:
           victim of cyber-bullying – the person harassed by the personal information
             posted to a cell phone (ie SMS) or to a social networking site (Facebook,
             Ask.fm)
           cyber-bully – person using mobile device/desktop computer or cell phone to
             post hurtful information about a person to a cell phone service or social
             networking site
           persons viewing the personal information about the victim posted to a social
             networking site
           developers/companies of the SNS/Websites -Designing the SNS and
             developing the features that include anonymity used by the victims and bullies.
           parents - they may monitor the SNS/emails/SMS that their children are using
             to be bullied or to bully with.
           student/users use it to communicate and collaborate, staying in touch with
             friends, organising personal life, sharing updates, images, media, or
             messages with their circle of friends (must have some context).

Criterion B — The IT concepts and processes                                                      [6]

2.   (a)   Describe, step-by-step, how the IT system works.
           IT system: using computer-based technologies and social networks.

           The steps are for access and storage/sharing of information - reference to
           cyberbullying is not required.

           Many of the responses will not fit neatly into a mark descriptor, so best fit will
           need to be applied. There is a large variety of technologies and ways of using
           them the candidates could include.

           Candidates may choose to describe the process for using a cellphone service or
           a social networking site for accessing and storing/sharing information for cyber-
           bullying – a description of either one is sufficient. This may not be clear to the
           candidates and some may decide to do both and compare them. If they do so
           they should not be penalized by a lack of some details in their descriptions. It is
           not necessary to include about anonymity, as not all information sharing is
           anonymous but this may be written as one of the developments.

           [1]: The candidate may show some understanding of the process but not in a
           step-by-step approach – using the information in the article and possibly some
           steps missing. If storage or sharing (pics, messages, posts, tags) is not
           mentioned the highest mark is [1].

           [2]: The student is able to provide a logical step-by-step account of how an IT
           system is used to access, store/share information – using the information in the
           article but lacks some details. Best fit if contains information beyond the article
           but not in step-by-step or does not include both the computer based technology
           and the social network site.

           [3]: The candidate is able to provide a more detailed step-by-step account of the
           storage/sharing of materials (pics,messages, video, posts, tags, etc). AND
           access using the computer based technology (computer or phone or tablet);

           AND include some information beyond the article (at least one development).

           [4]: The candidate is able to provide a detailed step-by-step account how an IT
           system is used to access and store/share information (at least three
           developments - at least one for each of storage/sharing of pics, messages, etc.
           AND access using the computer based technology.

           The candidate does not need to describe a step-by-step process which includes
           both cellphone services (ie SMS) and social networking services. They may
           focus on one or the other or a combination of both.

Answers provided in the article include the following:

Access using the computer based technologies
 examples of SNS in article include Facebook and Ask.fm (line 3, 8)
 from a cell phone (mobile phone) or laptop to another account holder (line 10)
 24/4 access using cell phone apps to post directly to SNS (line 17)
 via cell phone services (line 23)
 apps are specialized programs downloaded onto mobile devices, that can run
  on the internet on a computer or on a cell/mobile phone or other electronic
  device (footnote)

Storage and sharing
 the site allows an account holder to send anonymous questions (line 9)
 once a post is received the exchange of messages is posted publicly for
  anyone to read (line 11)
 receiving a stream of nasty messages (line 11)
 anonymous posting in school (line 15)
 posts can include a range of personal information including photos, videos
  (line 18, 19)

Answers with additional information to that in the article may include the following:

Access using the computer based technologies
 setting up the account and the personal information needed to do this
 downloading of the app or logging into the SNS URL
 additional social networking websites (ie Twitter, internet polling site,
  interactive gaming site, blogs)
 using public wifi/hot spots to avoid IP tracking
 creating fake accounts (not using personal details or other email accounts)

Storage and sharing
 users receives an alert(in the form of email/sms/?) that information has been
  posted to their cell phone or social networking site
 anonymity is allowed on Ask.fm, but may not be possible on other sites
 personal information may include photos and videos that were taken without
  the user’s knowledge
 the information posted may be seen by far more people than the account
  holders realise
 user may leave identifying information (ie coordinates on photos, what kind of
  device took the images, background details in the photo) (users may take
  photos with geo-tagging enabled device and post it )
 search for friends on the SNS to connect with/Use the Search Bar
 use the chat (voice or message) feature in SNS or email
 tagging of photos or videos

(b)   Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
      described in Criterion A.

      Explaining the link between the concern and specific parts, or whole, of the
      IT system means the candidate must include how and why the concern has
      arisen from the use of the IT system. The naming of the concern identified in
      Criterion A may be implicit.

      Question 2.(b) clearly asks for a link to question 1.(a), but the link only needs to
      be generic – eg for a specific concern described in question 1.(a), then in
      question 2.(b) the candidate can explain further without reference to the specific
      concern in question 1.(a). If the concern addressed in question 2.(a) is
      completely different from that in question 1.(a), a link cannot be made and
      hence [0]. If identified as privacy in 1(a) and described as anonymity in 1(a) and
      2(b) explains anonymity then 2 marks - no double jeopardy penalty.

      [1]: If the candidate identifies the relationship between the concern and the IT
      system. This may be a repeat, or rewording, of the response to 1.(a).

      [2]: For concerns regarding a technical aspect of the IT system, candidates would
      be expected to demonstrate an understanding and use of ITGS terminology for
      one of the IT systems. Not a general reference, eg “cyber-bully is invisible” for
      anonymity.

      Some answers may give adequate explanation with limited technical detail due to
      the nature of the concern, eg lack of policy, involving the whole system or many
      aspects of the system.

Answers may include the following:
This is not an exhaustive list.

 Anonymity is a concern:
  - the social networking site does not have a way of knowing who is
     cyber-bullying
  - being able to post anonymously on social networking sites or using an fake
     account (how); not very strong authentication measures or SNS policies,
     often only a valid but fake email address needed(why).

 On-going harassment is a concern:
  - the victim is receiving constant alerts every time information is posted
     (how). Account settings for SNS/email have been set up to receive alerts
     every time someone makes a post or are automatic (why)
  - it is possible for multiple persons to be posting information to a common
     account (how), due to the privacy settings of a user's account - this may be
     set to friends or public and the number of ‘friends’ of the account holder
     (why)
  - the victim is feeling hurt/embarrassed/harassed due to the nature and
     frequency of the postings to the cell phone service(s) and/or social
     networking site (how), the ease of being able to spread posts ensures that
     embarrassing posts can spread quickly and into the hands of others using
     mobile technologies (why)
  - there is no way of reporting to the social networking site information that
     specific posts should be deleted (how); there are inadequate built in
     features to report misuse of SNS. (why).

 Privacy is a concern:
  - IT system allows the postings to be publicly accessible (how); the spread
      of pics/post without the person not being asked permission to be tagged.
      The tagging spreads it quickly without permission being given (why)

 Ethics of cyber-bullying is a concern:
  - cyber-bullying - the sharing of personal information with the intent of
      harming or embarrassing another through posts, tagged pictures/videos
      often taken/shared without their permission (how); a bully does not have to
      ask permission to post a picture or send an email with attachments; they
      may not realise that it is a form of bullying and that it is just ‘fun’, public
      SNS are not fully monitored (why)
  - has legal consequences in some circumstances - victims can sue the
      bully, by gathering evidence of the bullying or tarnished reputation and
      take them to court (how); bullies can leave a digital footprint e.g. IP
      address used, log activities of school networks; emails/SNS posts can be
      printed as evidence (why)
                                             – 10 –              SPEC/3/ITGSX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



        Authenticity of person posting information (also connected to anonymity) is a
         concern:
         - bullies can easily create fake accounts and hide their true identity when
            creating accounts which they make the bullying posts/messages from
            (how); as very little authentication is required to set up an account to prove
            that you are who you say you are (verification is often through email
            accounts which can easily be made)(why).
         - bullies logging on under other accounts (e.g. friends log on) to share
            information/bullying posts (how); lack of security of friends accounts by
            sharing passwords or log on details (why)

        Authenticity of information is a concern:
         - bullies can post information about others even if it is not true (how); lack of
            approval processes on the site to check the accuracy of the content before
            published (why).

       Candidates are expected to make reference to relevant stakeholders, information
       technologies, data and processes. Candidates will be expected to refer to “how
       the IT system works” using appropriate IT terminology.

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                          [8]

3.   Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders. The list
     below is not exhaustive. If in doubt contact your team leader.


     Impact = result/consequence/effect/outcome

     There are a large number of impacts that can be compared and critically analyzed.
     Given the time constraints not all are needed.

     At least two stakeholders are required for entrance into the top markband.

     [1]: One or two impacts described.

     [2]: More than two impacts described of either type.

     [3]: Analysis by structure – organizing a response in a consistent manner
     (eg positive/negatives issues and/or various stakeholders).

     [4–5 ]: Must include linking analytical connections (between positive/negatives,
     various stakeholders, various issues) and/or added evaluative comments about extent
     of implications on stakeholders. Candidates who have supplied a good conclusion
     apply best fit here. Only one stakeholder, maximum of [4] if includes analysis and
     evaluations, eg the impacts on the person who has been
     cyber-bullied only.

     Notes for markers that you would expect to see in this markband:
      if NO analytical links and only evaluative comments then maximum of 4
         (candidates may be providing many evaluations from their own experience).
      candidates providing a descriptive sequence of impacts is not considered
         analytical links (and … and … and….)
      an analytical example may be when there is a discussion of the impact where the
         negative is for the victim and positive for the bully (credit for highlighting the
         relationship between the two)
      a link between impacts such as bullying to health issues to poor grades is another
         example of analysis.
      an extensive list of benefits of SNS not relevant to the cyberbullying focus of article
         should not be awarded significant marks without a link to other relevant ideas.
         Possibly count as one positive impact, especially in the 1-2 mark range
      a wider discussion about the benefits of social networking that builds on the issues
         linked to cyber bullying could be implicit or explicitly linked e.g.., “ …… although
         cyberbullying is bad, it may make the person consider the amount of time they
         spend on social networking sites Overall …….” could be the approach of a level 5
         answer because there are analytical connections and evaluations made.
      4 or more analytical links/evaluations could still be unbalanced and not warrant 6
         marks.

[6]: At least two negative per stakeholder; and two positive impacts overall for any
stakeholder/s linked explicitly to cyberbullying. At least two stakeholders need to be
addressed relatively equally. Number of analyses, links and evaluations, is the most
important consideration as well to reach this level. Must be at least FOUR.

[7–8]: A conclusion backed by direct reference to the impacts described is needed.
The overall evaluation should focus on the significance of the impacts on the various
primary stakeholders. The evaluation may include secondary stakeholders as well. A
good conclusion would balance the benefits of SNS with the problems arising from the
possibility of cyberbullying. Another conclusion could focus on the evaluation of a
range of negatives for various stakeholders (with little reference to positive impacts).

Answers may include the following:

Impact on victim
Positive
 character building - victims, learn to stand up for themselves
 learning how hurtful cyber-bullying can be and it may discourage the victim from
  cyber-bullying others.
 the ability to conduct in anonymous postings allows freedom of expression, possibly
  for shy introverted students, or people living in a oppressive environment
 cyberbullying is in writing - this means that it is easy to show proof of it happening as
  posts/messages can be printed

Negative
 sense of being victimized, tormented, hurt, threatened, harassed, embarrassed
  and/or humiliated
 24/7 – constant alerts whenever information is posted
 health issues (ie stress-related disorders, fear, anxiety, depression, helplessness)
 need to change schools or club affiliations to avoid personal contact with
  cyber-bullies
 reluctant to tell an adult (ie teacher or parent) that they are being cyber-bullied drop
  in grades - due to emotional distraction of being bullied

Impacts on the person cyber-bullying
Positive
 sense of power over the victim
 personal recognition from peers involved in the cyber-bullying
 less adult supervision online than face-to-face
 bullying can be done from the safety of their own homes, which is convenient and
  feels safe from not being caught
 being able to find private information is a positive for the bully
 increased awareness of the implications of his/her actions which may lead to their
  own more responsible use of technology

Negative
 if caught can be punished by the school or face legal battles with the victim and
  parents

Impacts on persons viewing the postings
Positive
 increased awareness and lookout for signs of depression in friends.. help prevent
  many fatalities
 forces users to be careful and selective of online friends and have increased
  security settings.
 may include the feeling of power in learning personal information (real or not) about
  the victim and making judgments about the victim.

Negative
 information is posted about the victim to a wide spread audience
 may have little/no awareness if the information is true or not
 may choose to take no action for fear of being cyber-bullied themselves

Impacts on school personnel
Positive
 schools have implemented policies and security systems that help prevent
  cyber-bullying during school hours.
 some schools have developed social education programs that address
  cyber-bullying
 Schools can monitor public postings of their students and use this to be proactive in
  dealing with issues
 cyberbullying is in writing - this means that it is easier to support the students who
  can build a case against the bully.

Negative
 teachers may not be aware of their role and responsibility in cyber-bullying cases
 schools may not have a social education program in place that addresses
  cyber-bullying case
 security systems for monitoring or tracing cyberbullying can be expensive and time
  consuming to extract the needed information.
 additional pressure on staff to respond to bullying which happens outside of school
 schools with a cyberbullying problem may have a poor reputation

Impacts on parents
Positive
 parents have learned from other instances to keep aware of the apps and online
  services that their child is using
 increase parent awareness of possible remedial actions
 parents can monitor their children’s accounts and so protect them from afar.

Negative
 parents may not know how to deal with the situation when their child is being
  cyber-bullied
 parents may need to enroll their child in another schools in order to stop the
  cyber-bullying
 in some countries, parents are ultimately responsible for the actions of their child
  who is a minor and a bully and may be sued.

Impacts on Social networking sites such as Facebook and Ask.fm
Positive
 update policies to address cyber-bullying – this may encourage more students to
  choose their SNS as it may appear ‘safer’
 increased number of users (parents) who will join the SNS in order to monitor or
  keep in contact with their children.

Negative
 implementation of reporting system for cyber-bullying may need to be created which
  will require time for developers to write and cost the company money to employ the
  developers and test out the new features.
 prevent anonymous posting - this may discourage certain users who joined because
  of that specific feature.
 reputation of the website will go down as a result of repeated cyber-bullying
  happening in a particular website – result in fewer users – result in less money
  made by the website.

If the evaluation does not provide any additional information to that in the article, the
candidate will be awarded a maximum of [2].

     [1]: Solution is identified. If not, the response is usually not well structured.

     [2]: Solution is described (what, who, where)
     A solution may have more than one part/aspect, e.g. developments for the SNS -
     monitoring and reporting features, policy has different parts and stakeholders. The
     solution may be briefly described early and then expanded subsequently when
     discussing its application - combine descriptions for the 2 marks and other marks for
     the first positive application and further evaluations.

     [3]: The solution is applied to the problem directly and not generally – how and why
     it solves the problem (first positive evaluation). The solution must be feasible and can
     be applied to the problem, even if not good “quality”. A description may also
     include the application to the problem.

     [4–5]: Further positive evaluations and at least one negative evaluation is required for 5
     marks. Best fit if description is limited.

     [6]: Fully evaluated strengths and weaknesses requires at least two positive and
     negative evaluations.

     [7–8]: Concluding paragraph directly referencing the evaluations. Candidates may
     propose future developments as part of the conclusion instead of discussion of
     evaluations – best fit applies. Likewise if a candidate has not fully described the
     solution or provided the minimum four evaluation best fit applies.

     Answers may include the following:

     Solutions to social networking sites allowing anonymous posting
      social networking sites must store identifying information so that anonymous
       cyber-bullies can be reported
      instances of cyber-bullying requires a simple method for reporting and prompt action
      policies need to clearly state the penalties for cyber-bullying
      social networking sites should not allow anonymity.

     Solution to educating parents about actions to take against cyber-bullying
      install web filters on home computers to filter social websites

     Big Data is a commonly used term with no single accepted definition. Most definitions are
     linked to the analysis of very large data sets, which do not use the traditional relational
     database model, by organizations to provide a competitive advantage.

     Overview

     In Mexico, over 300 independent family-owned supermarkets across the country have recently
 5   decided to create an association of local supermarkets called the Asociación de Supermercados
     Independientes (ASI). This was proposed so they could use economies of scale when
     purchasing goods to compete with the larger more established supermarket chains,
     who currently receive better prices from suppliers. Currently each family-owned supermarket is
     responsible for the purchasing of stock for their own store. The ASI management has chosen to
10   have its Head Office in Mexico City.

     Since they are local community stores many supermarkets in the ASI have become involved
     with community organizations such as schools and sports clubs. Based on customers’
     suggestions, the supermarkets often donate a small percentage of their sales revenue to these
     community organizations. They believe it is important to be an integral and socially responsible
15   part of the community they serve.

     The managers of the supermarkets do not feel they have a systematic way of analysing data
     from customer purchases, which may be reducing possible profits and their competitiveness
     with large supermarket chain stores in the area.




                                                                                            Turn over
                                              –4–              SPEC/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS


     Current IT system

     Currently, each store operates its own independent information system that manages
20   the sales, finance and stock data on a local area network. Various types of EPOS
     (Electronic Point of Sale) and stock control systems are used by the different stores in these
     information systems. To order stock from the suppliers a variety of methods are used, such as
     email, online ordering, phone calls and faxes.

     The changing situation

     The ASI Loyalty Card scheme
25   The management of the ASI realized that customers like to feel that they are being rewarded
     either altruistically, by giving to good causes, or financially, through price discounts.
     The introduction of a loyalty card scheme was seen as a mechanism to facilitate the rewarding
     of customers.

     About five years ago the large supermarket chains developed loyalty card schemes that offer
30   points based on the value of the goods purchased, which are recorded at the checkout.
     The ASI Loyalty Card will reward customers with 1 point for each 10 peso purchase. The points
     can be redeemed for a variety of goods and services such as discounts, gifts, travel vouchers
     and donations to a charity, where 5 points is equivalent to 1 peso.

     Customers can register at any ASI supermarket by filling in a written form with personal details,
35   and are given a card soon after with the customer name and Loyalty ID number (also recorded
     as a barcode so it can be scanned quickly). This data in the customer database will eventually
     lead to an online profile being created which will also contain details of purchases along with
     other information such as time of purchase and store location. Customers will be able to access
     their profile and purchasing record on the ASI website.

40   Whenever a customer in a supermarket taking part in the ASI Loyalty Card scheme makes a
     purchase, their loyalty card barcode is scanned like a normal product barcode. After payment
     they receive a receipt. In some cases the receipts may not show the full name of the item,
     only the amount paid for it. However, the loyalty card ID number, the product code (the name is
     not needed) of the item, plus additional data, such as the price, store ID number, and time and
45   date of purchase, are put into the store database without the customer being aware of it.
     This data is eventually transferred to the ASI data warehouse and is included in the profile of
     the customer.

     Proposed system

     Manuel Arriagada, a member of the senior management team of ASI, realized that in
     aggregating data from many stores there was an opportunity to find out more about customers
50   and their purchasing patterns. Manuel, while working in the United States, had heard of how
     businesses had been improved by implementing “Big Data” analysis techniques on the data that
     their business was collecting from the stores and customers.

     ASI will use SUSA Analytics, a company that Manuel has worked with previously, to provide
     advice and expertise to support local stores with the analysis of the data. He will liaise with
55   Lorena Florentes from SUSA Analytics throughout the process.

     ASI will gather large amounts of data about customer behaviour and product purchases through
     the use of a loyalty card scheme. This can be used for deeper analysis of their business
     activities. ASI will use the data collected for targeted advertising, marketing to customers who
     show various behavioural traits and to identify valuable customers.

60   Stock management
     Decisions on what to stock, and when, are based on current sales patterns and the stock control
     database. As a result of discussions at their monthly meetings the managers of the individual
     stores have concluded that the current systems are inadequate for the following reasons:
     • there has been an increase in customer complaints that certain goods are not available
65   • managers have noticed that the shelves are either empty or overstocked, and in this case
        has to sell the goods at a reduced price.

     The store managers have recognized that this lack of efficiency in stock management is
     reducing their ability to make profits and compete with the large supermarket chains.

     As a result, the management of the ASI, after further discussions with store managers, is in the
70   process of setting up stock distribution centres in the various regions. The operations of the
     centres will rely on the information provided by SUSA Analytics and ASI Head Office in
     Mexico City. This means that stock can be bought in bulk from local and international suppliers
     at a competitive price to that of the larger supermarket chains. Each distribution centre will use
     a Just-in-Time (JIT) process to ensure that the volume of stock being held in storage both in the
75   distribution centre and in the individual supermarkets is as low as possible.

  The data from the individual supermarkets may be in a variety of formats.

  This data is assimilated into a relational database at the ASI head office.

  The data in the SUSA Analytics data warehouse is in a different format to that sent from
  the head office.
  Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is taking place in the ASI head office and again at the
  SUSA Analytics data warehouse.

      Challenges faced

      Analysing Big Data
      • SUSA Analytics will provide reports based on the data provided by customers in ASI stores.
        This will allow ASI to create comprehensive customer profiles and to introduce targeted
        marketing.
 80   • Strategic data analysis using data mining techniques will be used to discover patterns
        to inform future decisions and planning. This will include: clustering/pattern analysis,
        forecasting, hypothesis testing and targeted marketing. The data collected will be used for
        analysing current customer purchasing patterns and predicting future customer purchasing
        patterns to allow the supermarkets to create medium- and long-term forecasts for staffing
 85     requirements and marketing strategies.
      • Operational reporting and analysis includes exception reporting, querying of the store
        database to produce regular and customized reports, real-time display of sales and inventory,
        and data visualization of sales and trends. Data is collected to assist managers in making
        short-term decisions about appropriate stock levels, numbers of staff for a particular time/day,
 90     number of checkout lanes required and opening times.
      • Data analysts have expressed concerns about the homogeneity of such large data sets and
        the ability of data analysis techniques to determine information that is specific to individual
        stores. For example, the findings from the analysis of the Big Data may provide suggested
        pricing levels for products for all of the stores in the ASI, but pricing of individual products
 95     may need to vary from to store to store.
      • The opening hours of the store and the shift details of staff, as well as their wages,
        will also be collected and included in the analyses. Recommendations can be made to store
        managers about managing the store and the staff.

      Communicating the data analytics approach
100   • Manuel is concerned that with such a large amount of technical language, he will not be able
        to explain the way the proposed system would function. Lorena Florentes from
        SUSA Analytics has been asked to outline how the system would work to senior managers of
        ASI and to individual store managers (see diagram on page 7). Lorena’s ability to explain the
        technical language in a form that is understandable by the audience is a major advantage.
105   • As well as the technical details Lorena will demonstrate and explain the benefits of the
        analytical techniques identified above, which the individual store managers and
        ASI managers in the Head Office will be trained to use.
                                               –9–              SPEC/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Ethical and social impacts
      • With respect to customers involved in the loyalty card scheme, ASI is unsure to what extent
110     customers should be aware of how much information is being collected about them,
        the purpose for which it will be used, and with whom it will be shared.
      • ASI is concerned that customer involvement in the loyalty card system may have implications
        for their privacy, security and anonymity.
      • ASI must develop policies for the ethical use of customer and corporate data.
115   • ASI is keen to ensure customer details held in the database can be anonymized when used.
      • The implications of using the data collected about customer behaviour for targeted
        advertising to and preferential treatment for individual customers need to be investigated.

      Implementation issues
      • ASI management are concerned and stress that according to data privacy laws there must
120     be appropriate access controls to protect customer and store data when accessed from the
        database system. This is because the data will be accessible in real-time via a
        web-browser/smartphone dashboard app by managers; and by customers through the loyalty
        card scheme website and smartphones.
      • Manuel, in consultation with Lorena, will develop a detailed timeline for implementation of the
125     new system.

3.   The information obtained by SUSA Analytics revealed that the number of staff working at
     various times was not always appropriate to the level of sales (lines 96–98). Based on this
     information, ASI management recommended that patterns of staff working hours should be
     reviewed by the store managers.

     Discuss whether store managers should use this information to decide the hours the staff
     should work.                                                                                                                                           [8]

1.   (a)   Identify two characteristics of a data warehouse.                                       [2]

           Answers may include:
            integrating or collecting data from one or more different data sources
            a central repository of data for a business, organization or enterprise or
             government
            data warehouses store current and historical data
            data warehouses store a variety of data such as sales data, customer data
             that have a common focus, eg from a business
            data in a data warehouse is added to but not changed, and often not deleted
             but archived.
            data is a warehouse is stored in a non-normalised form (which is easier for
             summative data)
            May use a non-relational database which allows statistical querying eg an olap
             / cube
            Data in a warehouse may be anonymised or have non-relevant details
             excluded
            stored a huge volume of data?
            Often outsourced to/managed by a third party

           NB: Answers that identify the use/purpose of a data warehouse are not
           characteristics, eg support management decisions, for data mining, etc, but the
           answer may include characteristics.

           Simple answers such as “a collection of data”, “central repository of data” and “it’s
           where most of the data analysis takes place”are too general and do not identify
           the integrated storage aspect of the data, the sources of the data or the type of
           data that separate the data warehouse from other data storages such as
           personal hard drives, USB memory devices and backups/archives of data.

(b)   Outline one reason why an extract, transform, load (ETL) process should be
      used when moving data from one computer system to another.                           [2]

      Answers may include:
       the main reason is to transform/convert data from its previous format so that it
        can be placed into another database with a different format/structure
       data from a source database cannot be processed or stored in another
        database (simple, RDMS, special) unless it is in a format that matches the
        receiving database, eg a customer’s name, NAME (George Smith), stored in
        one database may need to be separated into FIRSTNAME (George) and
        FAMILY NAME (Smith) in another database
       an automated ETL process is required because modifying the format or
        structure of data in the process of moving it from one database to another is
        too difficult and time consuming by hand
       data in one database may not be “clean”, i.e. corrupt, not validated,
        incomplete, ill-defined, non-standard format, or inaccurate, for a number of
        reasons so it cannot be processed easily. Therefore “cleaning” the data so it
        can be used by moving it to another database is required
       saves time, compared to writing a program(eg i a DML such as SQL) which
        does this
       ETL is configurable for many different data structures and can easily be
        modified by non-technical users
       an ETL tool understands all common data formats by default (databases, flat
        files, etc) therefore can extract data from many different systems , including
        legacy systems, transform it to a standard format and load it into the data
        warehouse format.

      NB: The answer must address the transformation process as the extract and load
      processes are included in the question. The details of how the transformation
      happens using lookup table and processing rules is not required.

      Award [1] for a basic comment related to the transformation process.
      Award [2] for outline of the reason the process is needed.

2.   (a)   Distinguish between data mining and data querying.                                          [2]

           Answers may include:
            data mining is a tool that analyses data from different perspectives and
             summarizes it into useful information; data querying is more focused on
             retrieving information from a database which then needs to be analysed
            in contrast to a query which simply returns the data that fulfills certain
             constraints as expressed in a database query statement (usually in SQL
             format), data mining constructs models of the data in question. The models
             produced by data mining can be viewed as high-level summaries of the
             underlying data
            data querying is a low-level extraction of information from a database; data
             mining is a high-level extraction of information that produces more complex
             and comprehensive results than a single query. Data querying is a tool used
             in data mining and the results are then processed further to look for patterns
             and formulas
            the results of a set of data queries performed on a database by a person can
             be summarized into a pattern or conclusion by that person. Data mining
             techniques automate this process
            data queries produce a set of data matching a specific set of constraints
             usually expressed in a database query language such as SQL. Data mining
             produces statistical summaries, patterns of data and formulas that explain
             patterns.

           NB: Essentially these answers are the same but focus on a slightly different type
           of comparison: results, methods, purposes. Basically data querying is a
           sub-set/process of data mining and there is significant overlap as the data
           querying becomes more complex – either automated or by hand.

           Award [1] if data mining and/or data querying are described in isolation up to [2 marks].
           Award [1] for each distinction made between the two up to [2 marks]

(b)   “ASI [Asociación de Supermercados Independientes] management are
      concerned that according to data privacy laws there must be appropriate access
      controls to protect customer and store data when accessed from the database
      system” (lines 119–121).

      Explain one control that can be applied to staff access, and one control that can
      be applied to customer access.                                                       [4]

      Answers may include:
      General
       managers and employees need to have system logon names and passwords
        (or other form of security such as fingerprint, eye-scans or cards that need
        scanning) to enter system
       audit logs of activity on the database that can be examined for
        unusual/suspicious activity at unusual times and that track the type and extent
        of data accessed
       access levels to the data and the data mining software depending on the
        needs of the managers and employees
       legal agreements, user agreements and policies are an acceptable way of
        control (ie. the answer does not need to just focus on technical solutions).

      Accessed in real-time via a web-browser/smartphone dashboard app by
      store managers
       access to secure website using logon name and password
       limited search and access capabilities from the web-browser/app to summary
         data only. Detailed search and analysis capabilities restricted to use while on
         the network in their offices
       set up a VPN that can use the full capabilities of the search and analysis
         software using client software, or receiving results directly from the database
         software
       access can be from a locally connected LAN computer only, or limited by a
         white list of MAC addresses
       access could also be limited by time, ie during their specified working hours.

      Accessed by customers through the loyalty card scheme website and
      smartphones
       users need a logon (loyalty card number, logon name or both) and password
        to access a secure site using HTTPS
       having a set of security questions that can be used to identify the customer
       registering the identity (IP address, MAC number) of the computer/smartphone
        that is accessing the site. If accessed from an unknown device a security
        question is asked
       using a one-time password sent by SMS to the phone or via email each time
        access is attempted.

Reponses need to explain how the security will be achieved by the measures
described.

For each unique control method, one for staff and one for customers:
Award [1] for identification of the control method used.
Award [2] for explanation of control method and how data will be protected.

If the control method outlined is identical for staff AND customers, award a
maximum
of [2 marks]

3.   The information obtained by SUSA Analytics revealed that the number of staff working
     at various times was not always appropriate to the level of sales (lines 96–98). Based
     on this information, ASI management recommended that patterns of staff working
     hours should be reviewed by the store managers.

     Discuss whether store managers should use this information to decide the hours the
     staff should work.                                                                          [8]

     Answers may include:
     General
      sales may be seasonal or promotions so data could be misleading
      if based on value of sales rather than volume then perhaps a lot of work but little
       profit or vice versa, ie. do larger but more expensive items sell at a certain time of
       day which would imply needing more staff but workload may be lower.
      different types of staff - more customers may mean more salespeople required but
       not necessarily more managers, office staff etc. so a proper ratio would need to be
       found
      examine the data collected initially that was used to decide the number of staff at
       various working times Train staff to develop skills in areas that need development.

     Considerations for:
     Staff
      greater recognition of skills and abilities in a more organized and efficient workplace
      higher wages due to greater recognition and less staff required – productivity
        increase benefits.

     Managers/Business
      less staff needed to pay – save money
      more productivity from each staff member as less staff used.

     Considerations against:
     Staff
      reduced working hours as less staff may be needed
      higher work load as minimal staff allocated each shift
      less flexible working hours due to decreased staff and more rigid shift requirements
      forced to work at certain times due to need for specialized staff in each shift.

     Managers/Business
      unhappy staff who have the problems above
      need to spend more time and effort organizing rosters of staff
      need to negotiate with staff, especially those with other commitments such as
       children
      minimal staff could be a problem if something unusual happens

Note to examiners: Please use the following simplified version of the markband

If there is no awareness of the different impacts (positive and negative) on staff and/or
the managers/business award [0].

To enter the 1/2 markband the response needs to present different types of
considerations, but without an attempt at a comparison or a conclusion.

To enter the 3/4 markband, responses need to have an attempt at a conclusion that is
based on at least two different types of considerations for either staff or the
managers/business.

To enter the higher markbands, 5/6 and 7/8, the conclusion needs to be based on
explicit considerations for and against for both the staff and the managers/business.
However three types of considerations covering both staff and managers/business and
used to support a detailed analysis may warrant entry to the 5/6 markband – best fit for
detailed analysis.

At least one for each type of the four types of considerations is needed to enter
markband 7/8 and are used to support a conclusion.

4.   With reference to your independent research, to what extent do the benefits for ASI’s
     customers of receiving targeted advertising outweigh the ethical concerns that these
     customers may have about the impacts on their privacy, security and anonymity (lines
     108–117)?                                                                                     [12]

     Answers may include:

     Positives
      profile of customer purchases used to send advertising to customers may be seen
       by some customers as a benefit as it provides them with access to the latest product
       and sales information in a timely manner without the need to do extra research
      targeted personal advertising can remind them of a need without having to make an
       effort to check
      access to products before others have the chance to purchase them
      access to special deals that others may not be offered
      targeted advertising is cheaper than bulk advertising and more effective so the
       business will make more money and hopefully pass this on to the customer
      by enrolling in the loyalty card scheme the customers have opted into the target
       advertising and expect to benefit from it with rewards.

     Negatives
      invasion of privacy – profile of customer purchases used to send advertising to
       customers may be a concern to some customers
       - “How much do they know about me?”
       - “What else will they do with the information?”
      intrusion into personal life – targeted, personal advertising may be intrusive as it will
       be pushed out to the customer who may not want that amount or type of advertising
      the advertising may be targeted but not fully appropriate to the needs of the
       customer due to the lack of detail in the profile and the changing needs of the
       customer which could be annoying
      the customer may prefer to research their own purchases themselves
      is it wrong to force advertising on customers when clearly it is being pushed out to
       the customer and not to some others?
      is it wrong to use information in the profile without asking specific permission of the
       customer? Has this been done?
      customers may want to be able to cancel the use of these advertisements so this
       facility will need to be included in the website. Cancelling requires an effort from the
       customer
      customers who are targeted with extra advertising may feel pressured to purchase
       when not able to control their spending or they do not have the money – such as the
       elderly, children and immature adults for whatever reason
      the customer profile may be sold or hacked into which could have negative impacts
       on the customer such as unexpected advertising from unknown companies
      also it may be stored in another country with different laws and security
       arrangements which could lead to the data being unlawfully accessed, sold and
       used
      by enrolling in the loyalty card scheme the customers have opted into the target
       advertising but may not have realized the extent to which it would impact them
      customers may be concerned that their purchases may be used to infer other things
       about them (medical insurance if health products are purchased etc)
      customers might be concerned that their credit card details may be compromised if
       stored with the profile.

The response must focus on the customer. When business orientated impacts and
actions are included they need to be linked to a positive or negative impact on the
customer, eg “loss of market share due to customers being annoyed at the advertising”
should focus on the annoyance for the customer and not the loss impact for the
company.

The focus of the response must be a judgement about the decision that has been
made: overall, is the decision good or bad for the customer, or a mixture of both. The
judgement needs to be defended by comparing the impacts.
