Topic       Non-state actors

                                Non-government organizations (NGOs)

Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

SOURCE A                Adapted from “Singapore rapped over protest ban” from BBC News, 2006.
                        URL: http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/business/5326692.stm

The World Bank president has criticized Singapore for banning accredited activists from its annual
general meeting in the country. Singapore authorities have blocked the 19 civil society representatives
from attending the event amid claims that they pose a security risk.

The president told BBC World he hoped Singapore would reconsider its stance. On the agenda for
next week’s World Bank annual general meeting are plans to tackle corruption and reform of the bank’s
voting structure. The president said Singapore had made a “bad” decision when it blocked activists that had
been invited to the event. “I hope Singapore’s authorities will change their minds and allow the people in
that we have accredited as originally agreed,” he added.

He added that was important for the organization to hold a “strong dialogue” with such groups. “We may
not always agree with what they have to say, but it is very important to have that discussion.”

The comments followed Singapore’s refusal to lift a ban on public protests. Following the ban,
pressure groups and non-government organizations decided they would demonstrate on Batam Island
instead – an Indonesian island located close to Singapore by boat. But now Indonesian police have
decided to ban international NGOs from protesting there as well, saying the demonstrations could become
violent and act as a deterrent to tourists.


SOURCE B                Adapted from Global Politics by Andrew Heywood, Palgrave MacMillan, 2011.

Although lacking the economic influence that transnational corporations (TNCs) can exert, advocacy
NGOs have proved highly skilled at mobilizing “soft” power and popular pressure. In this respect they
have a number of advantages. Leading NGOs have developed high public profiles, often linked to public
protests and demonstrations that attract eager media attention. Their typically altruistic and humanitarian
objectives enable them to mobilize public support and apply moral pressure in a way that conventional
politicians and political parties struggle to rival. On a wide range of issues the views of NGOs are taken
to be both authoritative and impartial, based on the use of specialists and academics.

SOURCE D                Extract from “Strengthening Civil Society” from the Aga Khan Development
                        Network website, accessed 2012. The Aga Khan Development Network
                        is a non-government organization which works to support development
                        and address poverty in over 30 countries around the world.

It has become clear to many governments that successful states require more than the introduction of
democratic elections and political parties. Civil society, particularly indigenous NGOs, must play
a central role in promoting good governance and accountability. But to be effective, NGOs must be
well-run and well-governed themselves. They must operate under a code of ethics and governance
that stresses accountability so that resources are not wasted. They must also have a quantifiable
impact on development challenges, as measured against well-recognized indicators, such as infant and
maternal mortality, literacy and the reduction in the incidence of disease. Increasing community
participation is also vital to progress.




                                                                                          Turn over

Topic      Non-state actors

                                Non-government organizations (NGOs)

1.   According to Source B, what are three advantages of NGOs over other actors in
     global politics?                                                                                   [3]

     •   highly skilled at mobilizing “soft” power and popular pressure
     •   high public profiles
     •   media attention
     •   altruistic and humanitarian objectives
     •   mobilize public support and apply moral pressure
     •   authoritative and impartial
     •   use of specialists and academics.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].


2.   Explain the term civil society, using both the information in the sources and
     examples you have studied.                                                                         [4]

     Key features may include, but are not limited to: that civil society is made up of a collection of
     different groups that may exist beyond state boundaries, social organizations and relationships
     which are distinct from the state, are voluntary, that are people-based, that there is no one accepted
     definition of civil society, that civil society is a complex and contestable term, etc. Examples given
     may include, but are not limited to, organizations such as trade unions, non-government
     organizations and community groups.

     For an inappropriate answer, award [0 marks]. For the general idea that the term civil society is
     used to refer to social organizations and relationships which are distinct from the state, award
     [1 mark]. For the idea that the term civil society is used to refer to social organizations and
     relationships which are distinct from the state and limited identification of some of the key features
     of civil society award [2 marks]. For a clear explanation of some of the key features of civil
     society, award [3 marks]. For a clear explanation of some of the key features of civil society and
     the effective use of relevant examples award [4 marks].

3.   Contrast the views of Source A and Source D regarding the relationship
     between NGOs and the state.                                                                     [8]

     Potential points of contrast
     • Source A refers to the Singaporean government banning NGO activists from the World Bank
       annual general meeting, whereas Source D emphasizes the need for cooperation between NGOs
       and governments
     • Source D refers to NGOs having “a central role in promoting good governance and
       accountability” whereas Source A sees them as a negative and destabilizing influence
     • Source D states that NGOs should “operate under a code of ethics and governance that
       stresses accountability” whereas Source A presents the view that they pose a security risk and
       “could become violent”
     • Source A says that avoiding violence and protecting tourism is more important than the rights of
       the NGOs to protest, whereas Source D says that “increasing community participation is also
       vital to progress”
     • Source A describes how Singapore is exerting state power over the NGOs, whereas Source D
       argues that NGOs are a key part of “successful states”
     • Source D is from an NGO whereas Source A is from the BBC (NGO advocating a point of view,
       BBC reporting news).

     If the view of only one source is discussed award a maximum of [3 marks]. If the views of the two
     sources are discussed separately with no linkage, award a maximum of [4 marks]. For a response
     which focuses significantly on one source with only minimal reference to the other source, award a
     maximum of [5 marks]. Award [2 marks] per effective point of contrast, up to a maximum of
     [8 marks]. For an [8 mark] response expect a detailed running contrast but do not expect all of the
     above, and allow other valid points.

4.   “NGOs are insignificant actors in global politics.” Using the sources and your
     own knowledge evaluate this claim.                                                           [10]

     Note: The bullet points indicate possible areas candidates might cover in their answers. They are
           not compulsory points. Examiners should not expect all of the points and should be
           responsive to any other valid points/arguments; for example, individual candidates may
           refer to their own experience of NGO activities which is acceptable if used effectively and
           appropriately. If only source material or only own knowledge is used the response can only
           be awarded a maximum of [6 marks].

     Source material may include, but is not limited to:

     Source A
     • importance of NGOs recognized by president of the World Bank, who emphasizes the need for
       “strong dialogue” with NGOs
     • Singapore has blocked and Indonesia has banned NGO protests, which could be seen as an
       attempt to marginalize them, or as traditional state power over the NGO
     • the decision to ban the protests could indicate that the state feels threatened by the NGO
     • NGOs receive media attention – this is a BBC news article.

     Source B
     • “high public profiles”, skilled at mobilizing “soft” power, often have popular and appealing
       humanitarian objectives
     • often regarded as “authoritative and impartial”
     • lack the economic power and influence of TNCs.

     Source C
     • many NGOs have very large memberships, e.g. Amnesty International has a membership of
       3 million and Greenpeace has 2.5 million members
     • many NGOs have very large budgets, e.g. the Red Cross / Red Crescent has an annual budget of
       US$821 892 318
     • global reach – although Greenpeace is officially based in the Netherlands it conducts activities
       all around the world.

     Source D
     • NGOs are highlighted as “particularly” important elements of civil society
     • NGOs can model good governance and accountability in developing states
     • although this source (taken from the website of an NGO) advocates “a central role”, it doesn’t
       say that this is actually currently the case
     • the emphasis on the need for NGOs to be ethical, “well-run” and more efficient could be seen to
       imply that this is currently not the case.

Own knowledge may include, but is not limited to:
    Arguments for the claim that NGOs are insignificant actors:
    • other actors have far more power; for example, states have more military power and TNCs have
      more economic power
    • they may have to undertake controversial or even illegal activities to attempt to gain media
      attention
    • some NGOs have to work with states or other organizations and therefore have to compromise
      their ideals and values.

     Arguments against the claim that NGOs are insignificant actors:
     • NGOs can act as a moral compass and promote a sense of civic responsibility
     • NGOs are important because they can empower people who are otherwise disempowered
     • NGOs can build networks across state borders and are therefore better placed to draw attention to
       and act on cross-border issues
     • Some large NGOs have more income and more membership than some small states; for example,
       the US arm of the International Planned Parenthood Federation has an annual budget which is
       greater than the gross domestic product of Liberia (2010).

Indicative content

Note: This section of the markscheme outlines what members of the paper setting team had in mind when
      they devised the questions. The content listed indicates possible areas candidates might cover in
      their answers. They are not compulsory points. They are only a framework to help examiners in
      their assessment. Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach,
      which if appropriate should be rewarded. Examiners should not expect all of the points listed and
      should allow other valid points.

Power, sovereignty and international relations

1.   To what extent is state sovereignty an outdated concept in the 21st century?

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of sovereignty, including reference to
     sovereignty as characterizing a state’s independence, its control over territory and its ability to
     govern itself. They may also include an explanation of the distinction between internal and
     external sovereignty. Candidates may refer to the changing nature of sovereignty in the 21st
     century through reference to the erosion of sovereignty by globalization; pressures on state
     sovereignty from the international community / intervention; the growth / increased influence of
     international organizations and other non-state actors. The candidate may present counterclaims
     such as the strengthening of national security and national interest due to terrorism; states which
     attempt to exist in isolation from the international community; or the link between sovereignty and
     the economic strength and power of the state. There may be reference to specific examples such as
     the traditional Westphalian view, or examples of nations who are seen as reluctant to engage with
     outside influences such as North Korea. The response may end with a conclusion/judgment on the
     extent to which state sovereignty is an outdated concept in the 21st century.


2.   “Global politics is characterized more by cooperation than by conflict.” Discuss.

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of cooperation, including reference to the link
     to governance, cooperation at different levels, international law, or the liberal approach. There may
     also be an explanation of the concept of conflict including reference to distinctions between violent
     and non-violent conflict, and political realism / national interest. Arguments that global politics is
     more cooperation based may include reference to the United Nations, joint operations to provide
     humanitarian aid, international law, trade liberalization, or the decline of inter-state conflicts.
     Arguments that global politics is more conflict based may include reference to tensions,
     controversies and challenges surrounding cooperation, resistance to intervention, intractable
     conflicts, and the rise of terrorism. There may be reference to specific examples of cooperation
     such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, International
     Monetary Fund, or NATO. There may also be reference to specific examples of conflict such as the
     war on terror, conflict in Afghanistan, conflict in the Gaza strip, or the actions of militant groups
     such as ETA or Hezbollah. The response may end with a conclusion/judgment on whether
     global politics is characterized more by cooperation than by conflict.

Human rights

3.   “A national or regional approach to human rights enforcement is more effective than a global
     approach.” Discuss.

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of human rights; for example they may include
     reference to human rights as often being regarded as universal, inalienable, equal, and indivisible
     rights which people are entitled to purely by being human. Answers may also include an
     explanation of the difference between national, regional and global; global as referring to events
     and trends which have far-reaching and longterm impact across the globe, cutting across national
     identities and interests, regional referring to events and trends limited to a particular geographic
     region such as the Middle East or Western Europe, and national as within a particular country.
     Arguments that a national or regional approach is more effective may include reference to the
     ability to act more swiftly, less bureaucratic, greater knowledge of the situation, a sense of shared
     regional identity, or avoiding the imposition of universalism. Arguments that a global approach is
     more effective may include reference to greater power and weight, prestige and influence,
     means/resources, or that the global approach potentially avoids cultural relativism / provides an
     objective view. The response may contain reference to specific examples of global actors/activities,
     such as the Human Rights Council or The Hague courts, or specific reference to regional examples
     such as the African Charter. The response may end with a conclusion/judgment on whether a
     national or regional approach to human rights enforcement is more effective than a global approach.


4.   “The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) seeks to impose a Western perspective
     on human rights on non-Western societies.” To what extent do you agree with this criticism?

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of human rights, for example they may include
     reference to human rights as often being regarded as universal, inalienable, equal, and indivisible
     rights that people are entitled to purely by being human. Answers may also include an explanation
     of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) adopted by the UN in 1948 as marking the
     beginning of formal discussion of human rights around the world. Arguments that the UDHR does
     present and impose a Western perspective may include reference to the geo-political climate in
     which it was written (the 1948 post-WW2 context, heightened sense of human sacrifice,
     Judeo-Christian value influence, limited understanding/appreciation of non-Western value
     systems, etc.) Arguments that the UDHR does not present and impose a Western perspective may
     include reference to the idea of rights as being universal so the context is irrelevant, or the
     development and evolution of rights legislation which is more sensitive to cultural diversity.
     The answer may make reference to specific examples, such as the impact of Western figures such as
     Eleanor Roosevelt or John Peters Humphrey, or that the members of the Commission on Human
     Rights included representatives from countries including China, Chile, Uruguay and Panama,
     or later examples such as the Bangkok Declaration of 1993. The answer may end with a
     conclusion/judgment on whether the UDHR presents a Western perspective on human rights and
     seeks to impose those values on non-Western societies.

Development

5.   Evaluate the claim that development is impossible to measure.

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of development, for example including
     reference to the fact that it is not the same as economic growth, that it reflects living standards and
     well-being of an entire population, and incorporates ideas such as access to basic goods and services
     including education and healthcare. Arguments that it is impossible to measure may include
     that it is non-quantifiable, subjective values, difficulty in acquiring data, data conflict, data lag,
     non-reporting countries, manipulation of data for political means, etc. Arguments that it is not
     impossible to measure may include improving collection of and access to data, better global
     awareness, greater focus on previously “hidden” groups such as children or women, etc.
     The response may contain reference to specific examples, such as the Human Development Index,
     the Human Poverty Index or the Gender Related Poverty Index. The response may end with a
     conclusion/evaluation of the claim that development is impossible to measure.


6.   “The biggest obstacle to development in developing countries is debt.” Discuss.

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of development, for example including
     reference to the fact that it is not the same as economic growth, that it reflects living standards and
     wellbeing of an entire population, and incorporates ideas such as access to basic goods and services
     including education and healthcare. Answers may also include an explanation of the concept
     of debt, including reference to creditor countries, debtor countries and banks, and an explanation of
     the term developing countries. Arguments that debt is the biggest obstacle to development may
     include reference to debt leading to instability of currencies and/or instability of governments,
     debt servicing causing net outflows of currency leaving insufficient support for healthcare,
     education, etc. Arguments that debt is not the biggest obstacle may include reference to other
     obstacles to development such as the poverty cycle, lack of infrastructure, lack of human and
     physical capital; debt forgiveness programmes / writing off of debt, etc. They may also include
     reference to the possibilities of development that debt allows for. The response may make reference
     to specific examples, such as the IMF, debt crises in Latin America, the Jubilee Debt Campaign, etc.
     Responses may end with a conclusion/judgment on whether the biggest obstacle to development
     in developing countries is debt.

Peace and conflict

7.   “Truth and reconciliation commissions are the most effective way to foster peace.” To what
      extent do you agree with this claim?

     Answers may include an explanation of the concept of peace, including reference to peace as often
     being defined not only as a state of non-conflict but also of harmony. They may also include an
     explanation of truth and reconciliation commissions as being commissions which try to resolve
     conflict by discovering the truth about past wrongdoing. Arguments that truth and reconciliation
     commissions are the most effective way to foster peace may include that they are public, amnesty,
     inclusion of rehabilitation, reparations/compensation, reliable model, inclusive, defence against
     historical revisionism. Arguments that truth and reconciliation commissions are not the most
     effective way to foster peace may include that there are alternative more effective ways,
     e.g. community based measures, more direct/imposed top down action, TRCs take a longer time,
     too public, too limited in capacity, cannot deal effectively with child, youth or sexual crimes,
     underfunded. The response may make reference to specific examples, such as TRCs for
     South Africa, Sierra Leone or Liberia. The response may end with a conclusion/judgment on
     whether truth and reconciliation commissions are the most effective way to foster peace.


8.   Evaluate the claim that humanitarian intervention is a justifiable intrusion into the
     sovereignty of a state.

     Answers may contain an explanation of the concept of humanitarian intervention, for example
     making reference to it referring to the provision of troops for the protection of people facing
     extreme danger or human rights violations. They may also contain an explanation of the concept
     of sovereignty, including reference to sovereignty as characterizing a state’s independence,
     its control over territory and its ability to govern itself. Arguments that it is a justifiable intrusion
     may include motivation to save lives, addresses human rights violations, not unilateral – is
     legitimized by collective security organization, etc. Arguments that it is not a justifiable intrusion
     may include weakens the institution of sovereignty, can be used as an excuse / mask
     national interests, likely to result in instability or even loss of life, assumes moral superiority, etc.
     The response may make reference to specific examples, such as NATO’s intervention in Kosovo
     in 1999, or military intervention in Libya in 2011. Responses may end with a conclusion/judgment
     on whether humanitarian intervention is a justifiable intrusion into the affairs and sovereignty of
     the state.
