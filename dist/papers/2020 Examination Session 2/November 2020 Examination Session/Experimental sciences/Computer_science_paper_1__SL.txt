     A company promotes its products online. To make a purchase, customers are required to
     register with the company and provide data like their name, date of birth, age, gender and
     email address. Once registered, more than one customer is able to access the server to

9.   A school has 100 students. All student names (strings) and student ID numbers (five-digit
     integers) are held in two separate one-dimensional arrays named SID and SNAMES.
                                   SID                                SNAMES

                         [4]   22103                     [4]      John Buffet

                           …   …                              …   …

     For example, student Pia Baranger has ID number 11 876.

     A binary search algorithm is not used to find a particular name in array SNAMES.

     (a)   State the reason for not using a binary search.                                              [1]

     The school offers its sporting program to students and has a basketball team, a tennis team
     and a football team. Each student must choose at least one of these three sports.

     Three collections, BASKETBALL, TENNIS and FOOTBALL, are created. When a student
     chooses a sporting activity, their ID number is added to the appropriate collection.

     For example:

     BASKETBALL={10011, 11876, 10122}
     TENNIS={10011, 11876, 10002}
     FOOTBALL={10011, 10002, 22103, 32000}

     The method isIn(X, COL) is available, where:
     y X is a five-digit integer representing an ID number
     y COL is a collection that holds student ID numbers.

     The method isIn(X, COL) returns True if the ID number X is in the collection COL; False
     otherwise.

     For example:

     isIn(11876, BASKETBALL) returns True
     isIn(11876, FOOTBALL) returns False

     (b)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode for the method isIn(X, COL).[4]

(Question 9 continued)

     The football and tennis training sessions are held at the same time. The football coach
     would like to know how many students will not be able to attend the football training session
     because they will be attending the tennis training session.

     (c)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode that will output the number of students who have
           chosen both tennis and football. The method isIn() should be used in your answer.          [3]

     The school coordinator would like to check whether there are students who have not yet
     chosen any one of the three sports.

     (d)   Construct an algorithm in pseudocode that will output the names of students who
           have not yet chosen any one of the three sports. An appropriate message should be
           displayed if every student has chosen a sport.                                             [7]
