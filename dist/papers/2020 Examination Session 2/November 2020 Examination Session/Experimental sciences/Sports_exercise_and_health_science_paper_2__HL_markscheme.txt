Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [50 marks] and TWO questions in Section B [40 marks].
Maximum total = [90 marks].

Markscheme format example:


     Question                                       Answers                                                   Notes                     Total

                  OR
                  the extent to which the performer has control over the timing of the
                  movement;                                                                                                             2 max

                  external paced skills are sailing/windsurfing/receiving a serve;
                  internal paced skills are javelin throw/gymnastics routine;


1.    Each row in the “Question” column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.    The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the “Total” column.

3.    Each marking point in the “Answers” column is shown by means of a semi colon (;) at the end of the marking point.

4.    A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by “max” written after the mark in the “Total” column.
      The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the “Notes” column.

5.    An alternative word is indicated in the “Answers” column by a slash (/). Either word can be accepted.

6.    An alternative answer is indicated in the “Answers” column by “OR”. Either answer can be accepted.

7.    An alternative markscheme is indicated in the “Answers” column under heading ALTERNATIVE 1 etc. Either alternative can be accepted.
                                                                               –4–                                            N20/4/SPEXS/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.    Words inside chevrons « » in the “Answers” column are not necessary to gain the mark.

9.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

10.   The order of marking points does not have to be as in the “Answers” column, unless stated otherwise in the “Notes” column.

11.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity as
      that in the “Answers” column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized
      by OWTTE (or words to that effect) in the “Notes” column.

12.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

13.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point
      then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks should be
      awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. “ECF acceptable” will be displayed in the “Notes” column.

14.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the “Notes” column.

             mucosal secretions eg those found in the respiratory tract which trap bacteria and

             their base of support;

             as the body moves the COM repositions itself to represent the point where the
             mass is concentrated;

             COM can move outside of the body depending on the type of position;

             to maintain balance the gymnast must keep their COM/line of gravity above the
             base of support;

             a gymnast can lower their COM to increase their stability on the beam;

             by widening the base of support/adding more points of contact the COM/line is
             more likely to remain balanced;
