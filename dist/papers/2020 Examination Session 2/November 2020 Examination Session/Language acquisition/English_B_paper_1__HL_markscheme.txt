Criterion A: Language

How successfully does the candidate command written language?
• To what extent is the vocabulary appropriate and varied?
• To what extent are the grammatical structures varied?
• To what extent does the accuracy of the language contribute to effective communication?

  Marks                                         Level descriptor
     0       The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
             Command of the language is limited.
             Vocabulary is sometimes appropriate to the task.
    1–3      Some basic grammatical structures are used, with some attempts to use more
             complex structures.
             Language contains errors in both basic and more complex structures. Errors interfere
             with communication.
             Command of the language is partially effective.
             Vocabulary is generally appropriate to the task and varied.
    4–6      A variety of basic and some more complex grammatical structures is used.
             Language is mostly accurate for basic structures, but errors occur in more complex
             structures. Errors at times interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is effective and mostly accurate.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and varied, including the use of idiomatic
             expressions.
    7–9
             A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used effectively.
             Language is mostly accurate. Occasional errors in basic and in complex grammatical
             structures do not interfere with communication.
             Command of the language is mostly accurate and very effective.
             Vocabulary is appropriate to the task, and nuanced and varied in a manner that
             enhances the message, including the purposeful use of idiomatic expressions.
  10–12      A variety of basic and more complex grammatical structures is used selectively in
             order to enhance communication.
             Language is mostly accurate. Minor errors in more complex grammatical structures
             do not interfere with communication.


Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

Criterion B: Message
To what extent does the candidate fulfil the task?
  • How relevant are the ideas to the task?
  • To what extent are ideas developed?
  • To what extent do the clarity and organization of ideas contribute to the successful delivery of
    the message?

The “descriptor unpacked” explain the assessment criteria in greater detail. Where a candidate’s
response does not correspond exactly to a single mark band, the statements in bold should be
used as a guide for the ‘best fit’ approach.

Note: When marking candidate responses, keep in mind that neither the factual accuracy of the
information presented, nor the validity of the candidates’ personal opinions, are being assessed.
Therefore, scripts that are factually inaccurate should not be marked down, provided the ideas
presented have coherence and are sufficiently developed.



Criterion C: Conceptual understanding

To what extent does the candidate demonstrate conceptual understanding?
   •       To what extent is the choice of text type appropriate to the task?
   •       To what extent are register and tone appropriate to the context, purpose and audience of the
           task?
   •       To what extent does the response incorporate the conventions of the chosen text type?

              task.
              The response fully incorporates the conventions of the chosen text type.



Note: Examiners must balance all three elements in criterion C (choice of text type,
appropriateness of tone and register, and use of text type conventions) to arrive at the final mark.

Question specific guidance (Criterion B and C)

Task 1

 A famous former student of your school will visit your campus next month. You have been asked
 to announce this to the school community to raise awareness and interest. Write a text in which
 you describe the famous visitor’s achievements and the purpose of their visit, and explain why
 the school community should be excited about this occasion.

 Opinion column                    Review                           Speech

Criterion B:

• The three required elements of the task are: to describe (i) achievements and (ii) the purpose,
  and (iii) to explain why the school should be excited.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or given only cursory attention (eg dismissed in one
  sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally
  fulfilled” at best
• The former student can be “famous” for any reason, but there should be some linkage between
  the “achievements” and both the purpose of the visit and the excitement expected, if the response
  is to be judged “logical” and “coherent”.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                   Text type           Rationale
Appropriate        Speech              The text type is suitable for raising awareness and interest
                                       among a large group of people in a school context.

Generally          Opinion column      The text type is suitable for raising awareness and interest,
appropriate                            but it is typically a mass media text. The choice may be
                                       considered “appropriate” if the response makes clear that
                                       the text is published in a school magazine / newspaper /
                                       website.
Generally          Review              The text type is typically used to communicate views on
inappropriate                          something that the writer has already experienced, rather
                                       than on a future event.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Semi-formal, although touches of informality would be suitable in a speech to the student’s peers
• Enthusiastic, positive, ‘excited’ tone

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 2

 You recently watched a documentary which gave you a surprising insight into an aspect of
 English-speaking culture, and you want to share your reactions with a wider public. Write a text
 in which you describe the documentary you watched, evaluate its content, and offer your own
 conclusions about its quality.

 Opinion column                    Pamphlet                         Review

Criterion B:

• The three required elements of the task are: (i) to describe the documentary, (ii) to evaluate its
  content, and (iii) to offer conclusions about quality.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or given only cursory attention (eg dismissed in one
  sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally
  fulfilled” at best.
• Any believable “aspect of English-speaking culture” should accepted. Factual accuracy as such
  should not influence the mark.
• The ‘conclusions about quality’ may deal with the documentary’s technique, or the ideas
  presented, or both technique and ideas.

Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                   Text type           Rationale
Appropriate        Review              The text type is suitable for sharing a personal reaction to a
                                       programme the writer has viewed, to a mass audience.

Generally          Opinion column      The text type is suitable for sharing a personal point of view,
appropriate                            but it is not typically used to discuss programmes. The
                                       choice may be considered “appropriate” if the ‘opinion’
                                       developed about the content of the documentary does not
                                       exclude or minimise the necessary attention to the tasks of
                                       describing the documentary and drawing conclusions about
                                       its quality.
Generally          Pamphlet            The text type is typically used to inform or raise awareness
inappropriate                          about something that is/should be of concern to the target
                                       audience. It is not usually used to share personal reactions
                                       about a programme.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type may be considered “appropriate”, or the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Basically formal, although touches of informality are acceptable (note that “a wider public” implies
  more than simply ‘fellow students’, although it does not exclude e.g. a text for the school website).
• Thoughtful, respectful, engaged with the subject

Please refer to the appendix for a list of text type conventions.

Task 3

 The government has proposed a housing development project in your local national park which
 will result in environmental damage. You strongly object to the project and wish to raise
 awareness among the local community. Write a text describing the government’s project,
 explaining the negative impact it will have and persuading the community to take action.

 Email                             Pamphlet                         Speech


Criterion B:

• The three required elements of the task are: (i) to describe the project, (ii) to explain the negative
  impact, and (iii) to persuade the community to take action.
• Equal weight does not have to be given to all three elements, but all should be given some
  developed attention. If one is ignored, or given only cursory attention (eg dismissed in one
  sentence), no more than the 4-6 band should be awarded, since the task has only been “generally
  fulfilled” at best.
• The “housing development” does not need to be described in great detail, so long as the
  “environmental damage” is made clear. The best scripts will both explain the impact clearly and
  persuade powerfully and convincingly.


Criterion C:

Choice of text type:
                   Text type           Rationale
Appropriate        Pamphlet            The text type is suitable for raising awareness about
                                       something that is/should be of concern to everyone in the
                                       local community.
Generally          Speech              The text type is suitable for raising awareness, but it is
appropriate                            typically used to communicate with a smaller, more clearly
                                       defined group of people. The choice may be considered
                                       “appropriate” if the response makes clear that the speech is
                                       addressing everyone in the local community.
Generally          Email               The text type is typically used to communicate with an
inappropriate                          individual or a small group of people. It is usually not used
                                       by an individual to communicate with everyone in the local
                                       community.

Note: If a response makes the context, audience and purpose of the writing clear, and these
conform to the task, the “generally appropriate” text type can be considered “appropriate”, and the
“generally inappropriate” text type considered “generally appropriate”.


Register and tone:
• Formal, perhaps with semi-formal touches
• Serious, authoritative, decided
