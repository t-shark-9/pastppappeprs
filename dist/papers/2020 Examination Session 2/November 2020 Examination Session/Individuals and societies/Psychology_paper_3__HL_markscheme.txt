Note: the underlining of terms is for emphasis only.

1.   (a)   Identify the research method used and outline two characteristics of the method.         [3]

           Award [1] for identification of correct research method.

           Experiment (accept also: lab experiment; true experiment)

           Answers related to an outline of characteristics of the method may include two of the
           following characteristics: [1] per relevant point. Maximum of [2].

           • The experimental method involves at least two conditions. In this study, there were
             two conditions: social exclusion and social inclusion.
           • The experiment is based on a hypothesis that predicts a causal relationship
             between the IV and the DV.
           • The experiment (true experiment) involves random allocation of participants to the
             experimental group (also accept: to the exposure of the IV).
           • The experiment can establish a cause-effect relationship between manipulation of
             the IV and levels of the DV.
           • The experimental method involves control for confounding variables, for example,
             for participant variables to avoid bias

     (b)   Describe the sampling method used in the study.                                          [3]

           Award [1] for naming the correct sampling method.

           Convenience sampling (accept also: opportunity sample; volunteer sample; self-
           selected sample) [1].

           Description of the sampling method may include two of the following characteristics:
           Award [1] per relevant point, up to a maximum of [2].

           Descriptions of the sampling method used in the study could include but are not
           limited to:
           • A convenience sample is a non-probability sample where members of the population
              who meet certain practical criteria (such as geographical proximity, similarity or
              willingness to participate) are selected.
           • It is an easy way to get a sample for the researcher. This was also the case in this
              study where the sample consisted of psychology university students who were
              available and participated for course credits.
           • A convenience sample is cost-effective and saves time compared to gathering a
              random sample.
           • A convenience sample suffers from self-selection bias. The sample is not
              considered representative of a target population and the findings cannot easily be
              generalized if at all.

(c)   Suggest one alternative or one additional research method that could be used to
      investigate the aim of the original study, giving one reason for your choice.             [3]

      Award [1] for naming an alternative or additional research method, and up to [2] for
      reason with rationale.

      The candidate may choose to write about an alternative or additional method. Either
      approach to answering the question is acceptable. The rationale may differ depending
      on which is chosen.

      Suitable alternative or additional research methods could be but are not limited to:

      Focus group interviews
      Focus group interviews with the participants could be used either as a follow-up
      (additional method) or as an alternative method. Reasons (with rationale) for using a
      focus-group interview could include but are not limited to:
      • This is a different way to explore how people’s perceptions of social exclusion
         influence prosocial behaviour. The facilitator would encourage the participants to
         share their experiences, including emotions, in situations in which they had felt
         socially excluded.
      • This qualitative approach could give a more subjective view on what the threat of
         exclusion feels like and how this could potentially affect human behaviour.

      A semi-structured interview
      Reasons (with rationale) for using a semi-structured interview as an
      alternative/additional method could be but are not limited to:
      • The semi-structured interview is based on an interview guide with a list of potential
         questions and topics that need to be covered during the interview. The focus of this
         research was a possible relationship between social exclusion and lack of prosocial
         behaviour and it can be considered a very sensitive topic. Therefore, a semi-
         structured one-to-one interview could be more appropriate if the researcher wants to
         explore how individuals experienced social exclusion and how that affected them.
      • The semi-structured interview is flexible. There are both closed and open-ended
         questions and the interviewer can ask respondents to elaborate on answers, which
         could potentially lead to a better understanding of participants' own subjective
         understanding of this very sensitive issue.
      • The one-to-one setting in a semi-structured interview is likely to establish a good
         rapport between the interviewer and the respondent. This could be extremely
         important in a research study on a sensitive issue.

2.   Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study and explain if further ethical
     considerations could be applied.                                                                    [6]

     Describe the ethical considerations that were applied in the study: Award [1] per relevant
     point made, up to a maximum of [3].

     • Consent: The participants signed a consent form before the start of the study. In principle,
       participants should be fully informed about the aim and procedures of a study before it
       starts. However, in this experiment deception was used because it would be impossible to
       conduct this experiment if the hypothesis was revealed to participants before the study.
       Informed consent is a requirement in all research and in line with ethical guidelines in
       psychological research.
     • Debriefing: The participants were debriefed after completing the study. The researchers
       would have informed participants about the true purpose of the study and the results they
       expected to find, in this case about a possible relationship between social exclusion and
       decrease in prosocial behaviour. They should also explain the risk of possible
       psychological harm in the social exclusion group and offer help to participants who wanted
       it.
     • Anonymity: Participants in a study must be sure that nobody can identify them in
       research reports. This is particularly important in socially sensitive studies such as this,
       because of the risk of self-stigmatization. The stimulus material specifically mentions that
       participants were not named in the research report.

     Explain if further ethical considerations could be applied. Award [1] per relevant point made,
     up to a maximum of [3].

     • Protection from harm: (1) In a study like this on a quite sensitive issue that could
       potentially cause some psychological harm to participants, the researchers should inform
       them after the study that they could contact the researchers if they have any questions.
       (2) The researchers should make sure that participants in the social exclusion condition
       did not risk any long-term psychological harm after the unpleasant experience, for
       example by offering a follow-up session after the experiment to those who asked for it. A
       thorough debriefing session could also serve as a way to fully inform participants about
       the aim of the study and at the same time touch upon the ethical issues involved in the
       social exclusion group.
     • Deception: Deception was used in this experiment.. Candidates should explain and justify
       the use of deception in the study, for example, explaining that a research ethics
       application form to an ethics committee could ensure that deception is acceptable in this
       particular study.
     • Right to withdraw: A further ethical consideration to apply could be to inform students
       during debriefing that they could still withdraw their data. However, participants in this
       study are students who receive course credit for their participation so they might not feel
       they can withdraw their data because they have given consent. However, students should
       be informed that they are not obliged to participate if they would rather not.
     • Confidentiality: The researchers could ensure that participants knew that the data would
       be kept in secure storage and destroyed afterwards to ensure confidentiality.
     • Any other relevant point.

3.   Discuss the possibility of generalizing the findings of the study.                                  [9]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     Marks should be awarded according to the descriptors in the markbands. Each level of the
     markband corresponds to a range of marks to differentiate candidates' performance. A best-
     fit approach is used to ascertain which particular mark to use from the possible range for
     each level descriptor.

     The study in the stimulus material is a quantitative study so it is expected that candidates use
     terminology related to generalization in quantitative research. Use of concepts related to qualitative
     research such as “theoretical generalisation” and “inferential generalisation” should not be awarded
     credit.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a review of the possibility of
     generalizing the findings of the study in the stimulus material.

     Discussion related to the possibility of generalizing the findings of the study in the stimulus
     material could include but are not limited to:
     • Generalization means drawing inferences from findings in this experiment to something
        outside the study (external validity). The study in the stimulus is quantitative and therefore
        a model of generalization could be statistical generalization (also accept: nomothetic
        generalization). Although the participants in this study are randomly allocated to the two
        conditions, the sample is not randomized (as it was a convenience sample). Therefore,
        generalization would be problematic.
     • In this study, the target population is psychology students who as part of their education
        are expected to sign up for a certain number of research studies. The study used
        convenience sampling, which is a non-probability sample, but it is also an easy and quick
        way to select a sample. However, this sampling method has received a lot of criticism, as
        psychology students at universities cannot be expected to represent a wider population.
        Therefore, it can be argued that it might at best be possible to generalize these results to
        psychology students at universities. Some would argue that a convenience sample only
        represents itself.
     • The sampling method (based on convenience) is not considered statistically
        representative of a target population as it suffers from self-selection bias. One way to
        ensure generalization in a study is to choose a random sample (probability sampling).
     • The fact that students received credit for participation could result in selection bias. When
        there is requirement to participate, students may be more likely to sign up for one study
        and not another on the basis of a convenient appointment time, rather than because they
        are making an informed choice about the kind of study they want to participate in.
     • The sample was relatively small with only 26 participants. However, the researchers had
        ensured that the sample included both males and females as well as different ethnic
        groups. If the researchers added more participants to the sample it would enhance the
        possibility of generalization, as well as adding to statistical power. The more participants,
        the greater the chance that differences between participants will be levelled out and
        therefore generalization is more likely to
        be possible.
     • If replications of this study arrived at the same conclusion, the potential for generalization
        is enhanced. If the same theory of cause-effect relationship between social exclusion and
        decrease in prosocial behaviour found support in additional studies it would be more likely
        to confirm the validity of the original findings.
