      For an exchange rate diagram, the vertical axis may be exchange rate, price of
      pesos in USD, USD/peso, USD per peso. The horizontal axis should be quantity, or quantity
      of pesos. A title is not necessary.

      A title is not necessary.

      A diagram may show demand initially shifting left (and/or supply shifting right)
      causing the exchange rate to fall and then demand shifting right (or supply shifting
      left) to restore the value of the peso to its original level. If correctly drawn and
      explained, this can achieve full marks.

                OR
                An explanation that a weak peso makes imports more expensive
                (imported oil prices go up), which increases the costs of
                production, shifting SRAS to the left/up, further raising inflation.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      For AD/AS the vertical axis may be average (general) price level, or price level. For
      the horizontal axis, real output, real national output, real income, real national
      income, real GDP or real Y. Any abbreviations are acceptable. A title is not
      necessary. “AS” is a valid label for the SRAS curve.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • Definition of floating exchange rate.

      Arguments for floating exchange rates may include:
      • The peso is less likely to be overvalued, and therefore exports will be more price-
         competitive (paragraph 3).
      • Allows current account to be self-correcting, which seems to be happening as the current
         account deficit is slowly narrowing (paragraph 3) now that the peso has significantly
         depreciated.
      • More freedom to set interest rates and domestic monetary policy (paragraph 2), which has
         been necessary given the high inflation rate and need to finance the government deficit.
      • The central bank needs not use foreign reserves to maintain a fixed exchange rate, which
         could otherwise be depleted (paragraph 4).
      • Argentina needs to keep its floating exchange rate system to qualify for the US$50 billion
         loan from the IMF (paragraphs 4 and 5). The loan is necessary to meet Argentina’s debt
         requirements until 2020.

Arguments against floating exchange rates may include:
• Speculative activity can greatly influence the exchange rate, eg speculators selling pesos
   to buy US dollars (paragraph 1), further depreciating the peso.
• The rise in interest rates (to stop the peso falling) is reducing investment (paragraphs 4
   and 6).
• Servicing foreign debt is difficult/costs more in terms of pesos when the value of the
   currency continues to fall in value (paragraph 4).
• Instability and lack of predictability for firms, consumers, importers and exporters –
   imported costs, including oil, have increased (paragraph 6).
• Governments not required to keep exchange rate fixed, hence there is less incentive for
   governments to keep inflation in check (paragraph 6).
• If the peso continues to fall, the IMF may need to continue to support the Argentinian
   economy. This could make Argentina over-reliant on (conditional) loans from the IMF.
• If demand for exports and/or imports is very inelastic, a depreciation will widen the trade
   deficit, causing further downward pressure on the peso.
• Further depreciation might lead to stagflation and/or a recession (paragraph 6).

Any reasonable discussion.

      Answers may include:
      • Definition of trade protection, tariff, subsidies.

      Arguments for trade protection may include:
      • To reduce a trade deficit with China (paragraph 1), as the imposition of tariffs should
         reduce import spending.
      • To allow US firms to compete against “unfair trade practices” (paragraph 1) from China. If
         China uses unfair trade practices and their goods/services are relatively cheaper, then
         American goods will not be able to compete and unemployment may rise.
      • Import-substitution might take place due to the tariffs if consumers are able to substitute
         the previously imported goods with domestically-produced goods (paragraph 4) at an
         affordable price, leading to increased revenue for domestic firms and economic growth for
         the US.
      • Trade protection may have been used for political reasons, rather than economic ones.
      • The US government will gain revenue from the tariffs.

Arguments against trade protection may include:
• The tariffs have been harming Chinese producers and workers in some provinces have
   already become unemployed (paragraph 2).
• The reduction in Chinese incomes/growth will mean that less is imported from the US,
   harming US exporters (paragraph 2).
• US farmers are suffering from the retaliatory ban on soybeans (paragraph 2), showing that
   the original intention of protecting its steel industry is backfiring on the farmers.
• The trade war is negatively impacting global trade; as Chinese incomes fall they are
   importing less: export revenue for producers in the EU and Australia (paragraph 3) is
   falling.
• Germany’s economy may hit a recession if the tariffs on cars and car parts are imposed
   (paragraph 3).
• With or without import substitution, consumers are paying higher prices for domestic and
   imported goods.
• Prices of inputs might rise; leading to cost-push inflation.
• Profits of large US companies (such as Apple Inc. and Caterpillar Inc.) have been hurt
   (paragraph 4), this is not good for the companies, its shareholders and possibly the
   workers if they become unemployed. (Since Apple Inc. has production firms in China, it
   will hurt the US and China alike.)
• Small and medium-sized firms in China are most hurt (paragraph 5), which may result in
   more unemployment if the trade war continues.
• With trade protection, welfare losses exist, which means that resources are allocated to
   less efficient producers.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Responses may include:
      • Functions of IMF, World Bank.
      • Definition of economic development.
      • The difference between the IMF and the World Bank.

      May promote/achieve economic development because:
      • IMF loans provide help with balance of payments deficit and external debt
        obligations (paragraph 1), allows government revenue to be used for
        improving quality of life through expenditure on merit goods.
      • The IMF may learn from previous agreements and provide the
        monitoring/support needed for successful implementation of realistic
        conditions to reduce the burden of debt payments (paragraph 4).
      • Other potential lenders may be persuaded or given the confidence to provide
        finance to help with economic development projects (paragraph 3).
      • The World Bank’s education projects directly influence education and female
        enrollment rates which promote gender equality, employment possibilities,
        increasing incomes and access to basic needs (paragraph 5).
      • Providing key infrastructure such as hydroelectric dams allows access to
        electricity and provides basic needs and infrastructure for business
        development (paragraph 6).
      • Loans help build capacity and attract FDI to facilitate economic growth needed
        to break out of the poverty cycle (paragraph 3), may provide employment
        opportunities and increased tax revenue.
      • IMF suggestions/conditions such as improved tax collection and access to
        credit can help support economic development (paragraph 2).

Above points should link to how these impacts will reduce poverty, increase living
standards, reduce income inequalities and/or increase employment opportunities,
improve health and education indicators, ie achieve economic development.

However, may not promote economic development because:
• Loan conditions (paragraph 2) may limit the government’s ability to achieve its
  development objectives, particularly the improvement in human capital
  (paragraph 5).
• Development spending might be decreased due to contractionary fiscal policy.
• Balance of payments issue has not been dealt with in the past (paragraph 4).
• World Bank infrastructure project – may lack sustainability (paragraph 6).
• The lending conditions may reduce economic growth, increase unemployment
  and hamper economic development.
• While FDI may lead to increased employment and economic growth, attracting
  FDI may require offering concessions (tax, regulatory, etc) which may limit its
  development impact.
• More loans and extending loans (paragraph 3) may not be dealing with other
  fundamental issues of managing the loans, such as servicing costs (paragraph
  4).
• Environmental issues may be overlooked, threatening sustainability
  (paragraph 6).

Any reasonable evaluation.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Answers may include:
      • Definitions of economic development, export promotion.
      • The link between export-led growth and economic development.

      Advantages of export promotion may include:
      • The PEDP 2017–2022 wants to boost the export of services, which could bring in more
        export revenue due to its higher value, increasing incomes of workers in numerous
        services, allowing for a better standard of living and higher tax revenue for the
        government (paragraph 3).
      • Increased exports of processed foods rather than unprocessed foods will increase farm
        incomes (paragraph 2).
      • If boosting exports and increasing export competitiveness (such as the standards, testing
        and certification) is successful, then more export revenue should come in (paragraph 3),
        providing the government with more tax revenue which could be spent on development
        objectives.
      • Removing regulations should make it easier for exporters to run their business and to
        export their products (paragraph 3).
      • Investment in the production processes and supply chains (paragraph 3) should reduce
        the costs of production over time and make the goods more export competitive.
      • Exploiting existing and new opportunities from trade agreements (paragraph 3) should
        increase export revenues in sectors that are competitive.

• If more is exported, then more can be imported and the tariffs on rice can be lowered,
  benefitting low-income families (paragraph 1).

Disadvantages/limitations of export promotion may include:
• Export promotion could favour economic activities in urban areas which could lead to
   higher prices and wages in these areas, especially in Manila (paragraph 2); higher
   domestic prices and inflation, affecting all families negatively as real incomes and
   purchasing power falls, and therefore lower income families are most negatively affected,
   lowering standards of living, and possibly increasing inequality and poverty.
• Export promotion will be difficult to achieve when investment in much-needed irrigation
   systems that would improve productivity in farming as well as infrastructure to help
   farmers connect to export markets, is discouraged (paragraph 2).
• There is a lack of access to export markets due to the lack of infrastructure, which would
   also hamper export promotion.
• The Philippines lacks the infrastructure needed to attract export-oriented manufacturing
   (paragraph 4) from overseas.
• Other countries may resist increased exports from the Philippines.
• Reliance on a narrow range of exports (such as processed food) may be risky.
• More will be spent on infrastructure by the government. Although the budget may have
   more income from an increase in income tax, poorer households may suffer due to a
   higher indirect tax on a range of goods (paragraph 4).

Any reasonable evaluation.

Candidates may argue that export promotion may lead to economic growth. As long
as they have established a clear link between economic growth and economic
development, such arguments should be fully rewarded.
