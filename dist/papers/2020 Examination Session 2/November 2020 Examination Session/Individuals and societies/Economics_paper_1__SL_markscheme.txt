Microeconomics

1.   (a)    Explain how production that causes pollution leads to market failure.                   [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definition of market failure, negative production externalities
            • diagram to show an over-allocation of resources where MSC is greater than MPC
            • explanation that pollution causes a negative externality of production and over-production
            • examples of where pollution leads to market failure.

            NB Where a diagram showing negative externalities of consumption is used, a maximum of
            level 2 should be awarded.

     (b)    Discuss whether government regulation is the most effective way to deal with
            negative externalities of consumption.                                                    [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definition of government regulation, negative externalities of consumption
            • diagram to show how government regulation reduces the problem of negative
              consumption externalities
            • explanation that government regulation can reduce the demand for the product, shifting
              the MPB curve closer towards the MSB curve and the socially optimum output or
              decrease in supply if a government regulation leads to a fall in output
            • examples of where government regulations have been used to control negative
              externalities of consumption
            • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

            Discussion may include: the effectiveness of government regulation including the policing of
            regulation, consideration of alternative policies like taxation, where the tax revenue raised
            can be used to pay for some of the of the consequences of the negative externality.

            NB To reach level 4, students need to consider an alternative approach to regulation.

2.   (a)    Explain the impact of a price floor on market outcomes.                                    [10]

            Answers may include:
            • definition of price floor
            • diagram to show the effect of a price floor
            • explanation that a price floor can lead to excess supply in the market, inefficient resource
              allocation, government measures to dispose of a surplus and welfare impacts
            • examples of a price floor being used.

            NB A price floor to reduce consumption of a demerit good can be fully rewarded if the candidate
            approaches the question in this way.

            • explanation of how a price ceiling can affect consumers, producers and the government.
              Some consumers will experience a lower price and some will not be able to access the
              good, producers will experience a fall in revenues and the government will have the cost

            Discussion may include: consideration of how the product will be allocated and
            whether those in need are able to access the good after the imposition of a price
            ceiling, the effect on the quality of the product, the likelihood of underground (parallel)
            markets developing.

     (b)    Evaluate the view that a decrease in aggregate demand would always be deflationary.     [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of aggregate demand, deflationary
            • diagram to show a fall in AD leading to a fall in the average price level in the neo
              classical/monetarist model
            • explanation that in the neo classical/monetarist model a fall in AD would be deflationary
              because a fall in AD leads to a new equilibrium income at a lower average price level and
              real GDP
            • examples of economies that have experienced a decrease in AD, which is deflationary
            • synthesis or evaluation.

            Evaluation may include: When AD falls in the Keynesian model and the economy is below
            full employment the average price level does not fall because wages and costs tend not to
            fall.

            NB Candidates can approach this question in terms of deflationary conditions in the
            economy or as deflation.

            • explanation that governments can provide or subsidize merit goods such as education
              and health care to benefit those on low incomes and also increase transfer payments
            • examples of government expenditure measures to promote equity.

     (b)     Evaluate the impact on efficiency in the allocation of resources when the government
             uses taxation to promote equity.                                                        [15]

            Answers may include:
            • definitions of allocative efficiency, taxation, equity
            • a diagram is not required for this question
            • explanation that using taxation can promote equity in the distribution of income but this
              can lead to negative effects on efficiency. An increase in progressive tax may reduce the
              incentive to work, reduce FDI in a country and if firms’ costs increase because of higher
              tax their prices might rise
            • examples of where taxation has been used to promote equity
            • synthesis or evaluation.

            Evaluation may include: consideration of the extent to which there is a trade-off between
            equity and efficiency and why an attempt to improve equity can have positive and negative
            effects on efficiency. Evaluation can consider the impact on incentives to work and whether
            higher taxation does actually lead to disincentives.
