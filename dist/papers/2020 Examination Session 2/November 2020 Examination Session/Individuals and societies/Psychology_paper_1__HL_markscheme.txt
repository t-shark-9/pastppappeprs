Section B assessment criteria

A — Focus on the question

To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue being raised
by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the question or breaking down the
question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the problem are showing that they understand the
issues or problems.

 Marks     Level descriptor

    0      Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

    1      Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

    2      Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.

B — Knowledge and understanding

This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of specific areas of
psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding that is targeted at
addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
   1–2
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
   3–4
          Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

          The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
   5–6
          Psychological terminology is used appropriately
                                                   –8–                 N20/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


C — Use of research to support answer

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of research to
support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces of research are
appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the research selected is relevant and
useful in supporting the response. One piece of research that makes the points relevant to the answer
is better than several pieces that repeat the same point over and over.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response. Research selected serves
   1–2
          to repeat points already made.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response, and is partly explained.
   3–4
          Research selected partially develops the argument.

          Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is thoroughly
   5–6
          explained. Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.

D — Critical thinking

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their understanding
of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may demonstrate critical thinking about the
knowledge and understanding used in their responses and the research used to support that knowledge
and understanding.

The areas of critical thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition, students
could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a well-developed
evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result, a holistic judgement of their
achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding marks.
                                                   –9–                 N20/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive. Evaluation or
  1–2
          discussion, if present, is superficial.

          The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development. Evaluation or discussion of
  3–4
          most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

          The response consistently demonstrates well developed critical thinking. Evaluation
  5–6
          and/or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.

E — Clarity and organisation

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner. A good
response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of thought underpinning
the argument.

 Marks    Level descriptor

    0     Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

          The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained throughout
    1
          the response.

    2     The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.

                                                Section B
4.   With reference to research investigating the brain, discuss the role of animal research in
     understanding human behaviour. [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     role of animal research in investigating the brain and behaviour. A clear link between
     animal research and the understanding of human behaviour must be made.

     Research that can be used to support the discussion may include, but is not limited to:

     • Meaney et al (2000) on the role of cortisol on the hippocampus with regard to
       memory
     • Rogers and Kesner (2003) on the role of acetylcholine in formation of spatial
       memories
     • Klein (2008) on the role of exercise on neuroplasticity in rats
     • Rosenzweig, Bennett, and Diamond’s (1972) study on the effect social interaction
       and the development of rats’ brains
     • Weiskrantz’s (1956) study of amygdalar lesioning and the fear response in rhesus
       monkeys
     • Lashley (1929) study on localization of memory in mice.

     Discussion points may include, but are not limited to:
     • Alternatives to animal research
     • Justifications for using animals over human participants in research
     • Key differences between animal and human physiology and behaviour
     • methodological considerations and generalizability of animal research
     • Operationalization of variables in animal research (e.g. studies of effects of stress on the brain)


     The use of animal studies that focus on hormones or genes that explicitly discuss the
     role of the brain in behaviour is an acceptable approach to the question. Candidates
     may discuss one or more behaviours. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   Discuss the influence of technology on one or more cognitive processes.    [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     influence of technology on cognitive processes.

     Technology is a broad term that includes the use of computers, the Internet and social
     media, mobile phones, video games, and virtual reality.

     Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
     • Sparrow et al.’s (2011) study of transactive memory
     • Rosen et al (2011, 2013) on the effect of multi-tasking on memory recall
     • Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) on computer assisted notetaking and memory
     • Storm et al (2016) on the Google effect
     • Blacker et al (2014) on the effect of video games on visual working memory
     • Swing et al (2010) on the effect of screen time on attention
     • Kaspersky Lab’s (2015) study on digital amnesia.

     Relevant discussion points may include, but are not limited to:

     •   The balance between ecological and internal validity in evaluating research
     •   Biological explanations of why technology may affect cognitive processes
     •   The difficulty of establishing causal relationships
     •   Issues of researcher bias
     •   Linking research to cognitive models of processes - e.g. the working memory model
     •   Researcher and participant biases

     Candidates may discuss the effect of technology on one cognitive process to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or discuss the effects on more than one cognitive process to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                 – 12 –                N20/3/PSYCH/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss the formation of stereotypes and/or the effect(s) of stereotypes on human behaviour. [22]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the
     formation of stereotypes and/or the effect(s) of stereotypes on human behaviour.

     Candidates may address the effect of stereotypes in relation to specific aspects of human
     behaviour or address the effect of stereotypes on behaviour in general. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

     Explanations for the formation of stereotypes may include, but are not limited to:
     • Grain of truth hypothesis (Campbell, 1967)
     • Illusory correlation: Hamilton and Gifford (1976)
     • Social Identity Theory: Hilliard and Liben (2010); Johnson, Schaller and Mullen (2000), Park and
       Rothbart (1982)
     • Social cognitive theory: gatekeepers, personal experience, media

     Effects of stereotypes on human behaviour may include, but are not limited to:
     • Memory distortion (Allport and Postman (1947); Martin and Halvorson (1983)
     • Misdiagnosis in mental health (Zhang, 1998; Van Ryn and Burke, 2000)
     • Stereotype threat (Steele and Aronson, 1995; Shih et al, 1999)
     • Prejudice and discrimination against individuals (eg Duncan, 1976; Buckhout, 1974;
        Gibbins, 1969)


     Relevant discussion points may include, but are not limited to:

     • contrary findings or explanations (Shewach et al., 2019)
     • cultural considerations
     • methodological considerations

     Candidates may discuss only the formation of stereotypes or only the effect(s) of
     stereotypes. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate addresses both formation and effect(s) of stereotypes, the response does not need
     to be equally balanced in order to access marks in the top bands.

     Candidates may address one potential effect of stereotypes in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge or may address more than one potential effect of stereotypes in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.
