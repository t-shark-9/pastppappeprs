               right, with an increase in price of the won.
               OR
               an explanation that as South Korean exports/inflows are greater
               than imports, foreigners are demanding won to pay for the South
               Korean products, which increases the price/value of the
               won/resulting in an appreciation.

               Alternative:

(c)   Using an AD/AS diagram, explain how the use of fiscal policy could lower “the high rates of
      youth unemployment” in South Korea (paragraph 5).                                         [4]

                an explanation that expansionary fiscal policy shifts AD to the
                right, resulting in an increase in real output/GDP,
                which would require more workers; therefore, youth
                unemployment may decrease.

                which would require more workers, therefore youth
                unemployment may decrease.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be awarded a maximum of [3].

      Candidates who do not refer to the impact on youth unemployment in the
      explanation can be awarded a maximum of [3]

      NB Full marks can be awarded if a student correctly applies a fiscal policy tool that
      has a supply side impact, such as subsidies for apprenticeships or education and
      training.

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be “price level” or any similar terms such as
      “average (general) price level”. For the horizontal axis, “real (national)
      output/income” or “real GDP”. Any relevant abbreviations are acceptable.

               and evidence.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • Definition of current account surplus.

      Economic analysis may include:
      • AD/AS theory
      • exchange rate market
      • balance of payments
      • economic growth.

      To discuss:
      • Slowing domestic consumption (paragraph 5, slowest growth in 4 years),
        impact on AD, economic growth and employment opportunities, making it
        more difficult for unemployment issues (paragraph 5).
      • Koreans investing overseas rather than domestically (paragraph 4), but this
        may lead to inflow in the current account through primary income in the long
        run.
      • Insufficient domestic investment in key areas (paragraph 5), limiting economic
        growth.
      • Encourages appreciation of the won (paragraph 2), leading to imports
        cheaper, leading to lower imported inflation, exports more expensive/less
        competitive, may impact economic growth – important considering it is not
        growing as expected (paragraph 5).
      • Appreciation of the won from current account surplus, in theory (paragraph 2)
        should be self-correcting, but this does not apply to this case due to large
        working-age population contributing to the surplus (paragraph 1).

• Suggests that the current account surplus may have long-term consequences
  on the economy – until 2042 (paragraph 1).
• Domestic firms competing from cheaper imports suffer – due to the current
  account surplus encouraging an appreciation (paragraph 1).
• Persistent imbalances with trade partners may encourage protectionist
  measures from trade partners (paragraph 3). This may lead to problems with
  exports, growth.
• Current account surplus is influencing decisions made by government
  regarding policy which may conflict with other macro objectives.
• Contractionary monetary policy (paragraph 6) to avoid a depreciation will
  negatively impact on economic growth, but important to avoid issues of a
  current account surplus.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths
      and limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and
      supported with appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • Definition of current account surplus.

      Economic analysis may include:
      • economic integration theory
      • economies of scale
      • balance of payments
      • protectionism
      • externalities
      • AD/AS
      • economic growth
      • employment

      • comparative advantage.

      For free trade:
      • Third largest free trade area in the world (paragraph 1) larger market leading
        to possible economies of scale.
      • Encourages good political relations and inclusive growth (paragraph 1).
      • Worth in excess of US$70 billion to Japan’s economy (paragraph 2) – exports
        increasing, may lead to economic growth.
      • Lower prices of imported products, such as Australian cheese and beef for
        restaurant owners (costs of production), reducing the impact of higher wage
        costs in Japan. (paragraph 2).
      • Lower prices of rice for Japanese consumers.

           • May help with trade imbalances between Japan and other countries like
             Australia.

            Against free trade:
           • Concerns of food self-sufficiency/food security (paragraph 3), over 60%
              already imported. This may have long-term implications if there is an over-
              reliance on food imports.
           • Subsidies for Japanese farmers are needed to help diversification
              (paragraph 3), results in opportunity costs and production inefficiencies.
           • Removing some forms of trade barrier may only be replaced by others –
              subsidies (paragraph 3) and the benefits may be mitigated.
           • Some industries negatively affected (paragraph 2), may lead to structural
              unemployment issues.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that

      Answers may include:
      • Definitions of aid, economic development.

      Economic analysis may include:
      • poverty cycle
      • AD/AS diagram
      • PPC curve
      • Lorenz curve.

      To discuss:
      Role of aid in achieving economic development:
      • Taiwanese aid before 2016 would have contributed to economic development through
        public health (paragraph 4)
        • increases human capital – leads to greater opportunity for breaking out of the poverty
            cycle
        • citizens can access higher income, more employment due to increased productivity,
            leads to increase living standards
        • businesses may benefit from healthier workforce. Encouraging economic growth which
            may lead to further economic development, if widespread.

• Chinese aid (paragraph 4)
  • targets economic development challenges (paragraph 1); insufficient infrastructure,
    limited range of export products and markets could be overcome through deep-sea port
    and airport improvements (paragraph 4)
  • deep-sea port and airport spending may help overcome STP’s remoteness and high
    transport costs (paragraph 3), this supports expanding export markets (paragraph 3),
    which may offer employment and growth opportunities leading to higher incomes and
    increased standard of living
  • economic growth rate is insufficient to have an impact on poverty rate (paragraph 2),
    targeted aid spending on areas to support increasing exports may encourage higher
    economic growth, so it is sufficient to start translating into economic development and
    having an impact on the poverty rate
  • airport work supports exploiting the high value-added and comparative advantage of
    tourism (paragraph 4). More employment opportunities and economic growth.

Aid in general has been very important in supporting the economy:
• 57 % of GDP and 93 % of public investments – needed for health and education
   spending.
• Limited access to credit (paragraph 1), has meant that aid could be used to bridge the
   savings gap to help break poverty cycle.
• Nutritional needs of the people are a concern and aid could help improve this
   (paragraph 5). Significant aspect to support improving human capital.
• Aid could help with setting up institutional support/good governance/transparency
   (paragraph 1 and paragraph 3), to help develop trade and management of revenue from
   oil at the onset (paragraph 3). This may help with the income equality as it avoids
   mismanagement or misappropriation of funds/revenues.
• Decrease reliance on cocoa (paragraph 3) needs new industry, which can be supported
   by aid in short term (infant industry support – new export products/tourism), to help
   support long term diversification. Significant argument considering 80 % of exports are
   from cocoa (paragraph 3).
• Aid can be used to help deal with climate change issues (paragraph 1 and paragraph 5).
   Important area as it is an island and has limited resources to solve these issues.
• Cannot develop without the finance from economic growth to spend on infrastructure
   (paragraph 1), human capital (paragraph 1), health/nutrition/water issues (paragraph 5).

Aid might not support economic development:
• Intentions – China may be promoting own export routes to Africa with deep-sea port.
• Corruption/misallocation due to poor governance (paragraph 1), may mean that areas in
   need have not received the funds needed to decrease poverty.
• Changing donors may change projects and focus – Nutrition is an issue (paragraph 5),
   and was being helped with Taiwan, but may not have that focus with China (paragraph 4).
• High level of dependence with poor governance (paragraph 1) may mean that it could be
   difficult to break the level of dependency or seek other methods to support economic
   development.
• Aid is often tied to specific projects or to spending on machines or goods from the donor
   country – China on deep sea port/airport (paragraph 4).
• Aid (concessional loans) from the IMF has come with conditions – decreasing government
   spending (paragraph 4), this may mean some areas involving economic development may
   suffer, AD decrease and lower economic growth will not help meet the 6 % needed to
   elevate the poverty rate (paragraph 2).

Any reasonable discussion.

           To reach level 3, students must show awareness of the ways in which aid will
           impact upon economic development (not simply discuss the advantages and
           disadvantages of aid and trade in general). This means to link the evaluation to how
           it will reduce poverty, increase living standards, reduce income inequalities and
           increase employment opportunities, improve health and education indicators.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions
      should be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Answers may include:
      • Definition of economic development.

      Economic analysis may include
      • Poverty cycle
      • Lorenz curve
      • AD/AS diagram
      • Externality diagram
      • PPC.

      Discussion that government intervention is the best way to achieve economic development
      may include:
      • Financial support for sugar cane producers needed for diversification
         (paragraph 2) needed for access to credit and to encourage investment.
      • The diversification supported through government intervention may lead to
         more value-added products (paragraph 4). May result in more jobs, increasing
         household income, raised standard of living as able to access basic
         necessities.
      • Education for women is highlighted as an area for development (paragraph 2),
         leads to improved human capital, productivity, increased incomes, access to
         health and basic necessities – raising living standards.
      • Government strategies are targeting equality for all, including gender equality
         (paragraph 2)
      • Support in coconut production vital for food security (paragraph 4).

• The investment (paragraph 2) leads to AD increase and increase in economic
  growth, may lead to economic development if incomes and access to health
  and education are improved.
• The government provides subsidies on pesticides to support/increase sugar
  production (paragraph 3); this may or may not result in more jobs, which could
  increase household incomes and thereby standards of living.
• Ginger and coconut production are economically and environmentally
  sustainable (paragraph 4) which implies that they are efficient industries, but
  also environmentally friendly, leading to sustainable growth and development.
• Ginger and coconut production provide “worthwhile income” for an increasing
  number of Fijians (paragraph 4), leading to an increased standard of living and
  breaking out of the poverty cycle.
• Social safety net is limited; therefore, government intervention is needed
  (paragraph 1).
• Infrastructure spending vital to support the tourism industry as a major export
  (paragraph 1), if exports decrease, economic growth decrease, leads to lower
  employment opportunities.
• “Green finance” (paragraph 5) would allow sustainable ginger and coconut
  farmers to have access to credit and invest in their farms to make them more
  productive and earn more income.
• To improve information flows by reducing asymmetric information, would
  improve information between farmers and middlemen (paragraph 6). When
  farmers have more information, they can make better economic decisions that
  benefit their families in terms of income.

Discussion that government intervention may not be best way to achieve economic
development may include:
• Intervention may not reach the very poor/those with limited resources. The
   subsidy for pest control (paragraph 3) requires excessive paperwork, so not all
   may benefit from the support.
• To be effective government intervention needs to be targeted to areas of
   need. Farmers’ financial literacy needs to be improved (paragraph 5). So,
   access to credit will only be effective if government can also provide
   education.
• The government must develop major infrastructure (paragraph 6), which will
   be costly and take a long time to develop and will have opportunity costs.
• Potential for corruption means government subsidies may not reach those
   who need it (paragraph 3).
• Subsidies for pesticides may create a negative externality (paragraph 3)
• Brazil has absolute advantage in sugar and is Fiji’s competitor, so the
   subsidies may be better directed alternative development areas (paragraph 3).

Students may offer alternative strategies to achieve economic development:
• Trade liberalization and development might be better by creating market
   access through greater economic integration (paragraph 6), the export
   revenue earned from this could be used to improve or build new infrastructure
   in the future, leading to economic development for many in society.
• Grants and concessional loans from Australia (paragraph 6)
• Export promotion – new markets opportunities emerging as products such as
   coconut water is becoming popular throughout the world (paragraph 4)
• Green finance through Asian Development Bank (paragraph 5).

Any reasonable discussion.

To reach level 3, students must show awareness of the ways in which
government intervention impacts upon economic development (not simply
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of government intervention in
general). This means to link the evaluation to how it will reduce poverty, increase
living standards, reduce income inequalities and increase employment
opportunities, improve health and education indicators.
