Option A — Freshwater

1.   (a)   Identify two changes between 2003 and 2011 along the southern shore of the lake between
           Sandusky and Cleveland.                                                             [1+1]

                  ▪   Increased severity [1].
                  ▪   Greater area of water affected [1].
                  ▪   Increased distance from shore affected [1] / 100-150 km distance [1]

      (b) Outline one environmental problem caused by eutrophication. [2]

            Award [1] for the problem and [1] for development.

           For example: Fish die [1] due to oxygen depletion [1],

           Possible problems include:
           • declining biodiversity
           • creation of dead zones
           • excessive vegetation on surface.

     (c)   Explain one human reason and one physical reason why some areas of a freshwater lake
           such as this experience high levels of eutrophication.                            [3+3]

           In each case, award [1] for the reason and up to [2] for development / explanation.

           Possible human reasons include:
           • agricultural
           • industrial
           • settlement.

           For example: Runoff from farming into particular parts of the lake [1] carries high amounts of
           nitrates [1] that were used as fertilizer [1].

           Possible physical reasons include:
           • drainage patterns
           • wind / storms / currents
           • hydrological flows
           • relief
           • depth/temperature of water.

           For example: An area of water with many rivers draining into it [1] will receive more inputs of
           dissolved nutrients in solution [1], leading to excessive algae growth in that part of the lake
           [1].

2.   (a)   Examine the role of local communities in the management of water resources.             [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Freshwater is an essential resource that has come under increasing pressure
           due to growth in demand, especially from increased population and urbanization,
           industry and intensive agriculture. Water quality is also under threat from physical
           and chemical pollution and salinization. Scarce and poor water quality can
           seriously affect the health of local communities.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • Local management strategies aimed at providing fresh, sustainable water quality; access
               to clean and affordable water.
           • Local communities play an important role in the improvement of health and well-being,
               and adequate supplies for agriculture and irrigation.
           • Local efforts or strategies to reduce pollution from urban areas and agricultural run-off.
           • Construction of wells, boreholes and small reservoirs.
           • The role of different stakeholders, for example national governments, international
              organizations, TNCs, in assisting local communities in management of water resources.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the role and power of different
           stakeholders. Another approach might be to critically evaluate the importance of
           interactions between different scales of management using a sustainability
           framework.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some local strategies
           in relation to management of water resources.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           •   either an evidenced explanation of the role/importance/work of local
               communities managing different water resources
           •   or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
               concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                               –7–                N20/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (b) Examine the ways in which different physical factors can affect the characteristics of
         hydrographs.   [10]

       Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

       A range of different physical factors affect the characteristics of river
       hydrographs. Many physical factors may be inter-related to affect the shape of
       the hydrograph. Physical factors may vary between rivers in different places, and
       also within the same large river basin. They may vary over different time scales,
       from seasonal to annual and long term. Climate change may have a long-term
       influence.

       Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and
       understanding (AO1):
       • Characteristics of the hydrograph include peak discharge, lag time, steepness of rising
         and falling limbs, and baseflow.
       • Physical factors that affect the characteristics of hydrographs include:
            o rock permeability and soil type/thickness; topography and relief; the type and
               amount of vegetation cover
            o climatic factors, such as rainfall amount, duration and intensity
            o snowfall (precipitation held in storage)
            o drainage basin characteristics, such as basin shape, drainage density and
               bifurcation ratio.
       • Climate change may cause the character of the hydrographs to change over
         time, eg the impact of reduced rainfall, or more intense rainfall.
       Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
       critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the different scales/importance of
       physical factors, and the interactions between different physical factors, eg the
       impact of climate change on local water systems.

       For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the influence of two
       different physical factors.

       For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account, which includes:
       • either an evidenced explanation of two or more physical factors affecting
         hydrograph characteristics
       • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
         concepts and/or perspectives.

        For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option B – Oceans and coastal margins

3.   (a)   (i)    Identify the dominant land use that is replacing mangrove swamps on island A.       [1]

                  Aquaculture

           (ii)   Estimate the percentage of mangrove swamp loss caused by urban development B. [1]

                  Accept answers between 15 – 20% (units not required).


     (b)   Outline one physical factor necessary for the formation of a mangrove swamp.       [2]

           Award [1] for the factor and [1] for explanatory development.

           For example: Mangroves grow in the coastal intertidal zone [1], where freshwater
           mixes with saltwater [1].

           Other possible factors include:
           • In areas of low energy waves/sheltered areas, where slow moving water allows fine
              sediments to accumulate.
           • In areas of tropical/sub-tropical climates / water temperatures of 20’C, which provide ideal
              environmental conditions for growth
           • Shallow waters, allowing roots to be exposed and continue to grow.

     (c)   Explain two environmental consequences of the loss of mangrove swamps in coastal areas
           such as those shown on the map. [3+3]

           Award [1] for the consequence and up to [2] for development / explanation /
           exemplification.

           For example: Removing the mangroves may mean the coastline is less protected
           from hurricanes / tropical cyclones [1], as mangroves absorb wave energy [1]
           and dissipate the force of the storm [1].

           Other possibilities include:
           • loss of biodiversity
           • loss of breeding and feeding grounds for fish
           • removal of natural filters of run-off from farms and sewage
           • removal of potential stabilization of shorelines / prevention of erosion.

4.   (a)   Examine the role of sea level changes in the formation of relict cliffs and raised beaches. [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Sea levels have undergone significant changes over the last few thousand years,
           and these have had a significant impact on coastal landforms, resulting in
           coastlines of emergence (sea level fall) and submergence (sea level rise).

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • Relict cliffs and coastal cliffs that were formerly active/eroded, but are now above sea-
              level and are inactive. They may be degraded by sub-aerial processes (have a less-
              steep profile) and may be vegetated.
           • Relict cliffs and raised beaches are features of an emerging coastline, where there has
              been a fall in relative sea level.
           • Raised beaches (which may be erosional or depositional) are former wave-cut platforms
              in front of active cliffs, but are now “raised” above sea level; they may also be former
              beaches now above sea level.
           • Coastal emergence, caused by a fall in relative sea level, may be caused by eustatic or
              isostatic processes, or both.
           • Eustatic changes are often associated with climate change, causing melting (sea level
              rise), or expansion/freezing (sea level fall), of ice sheets; these tend to be world-wide
              changes.
           • Isostatic changes may be caused by tectonic uplift of the land, or uplift caused by the
              removal of the weight of former ice sheets.
           •   Many coastlines, especially in previously glaciated regions, see the effects of
               both of these processes – isostatic uplift caused by the removal of the weight
               of ice sheets after melting, superimposed on eustatic changes in sea level;
               the causes are often difficult to disentangle.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3). The formation could become complicated because of
           interactions between different eustatic and isostatic processes, eg sea level rise
           due to climate change may begin to drown isostatically uplifted areas. There may
           be many changes over time in relative sea levels.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the role of sea level
           change in the formation of relict cliffs and/or raised beaches.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           •   either an evidenced explanation of the sometimes complex relationship
               between sea level change and formation cliffs and raised beaches in different
               places and time-scales
           •   or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
               concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

4.   (b)   Examine the roles of different stakeholders in the management of one coastal margin
           affected by erosion or flooding.                                                           [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Coastal margins may be affected by erosion and flooding. Rapid erosion of cliffs
           may cause significant impact on human activity, such as loss of settlements,
           infrastructure and agricultural land. Coastal flooding not only causes damage, but
           may also cause significant loss of life and injury.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and
           understanding (AO1):
           • Management should address either erosion or flooding of one coastal margin.
           • The causes of erosion/flooding.
           • The power and perspectives of different stakeholders, such as local peoples, tourists,
             local and national governments, and conservationists.
           • Strategies vary between hard-engineering schemes, cliff-line stabilization and soft
             engineering, such as beach nourishment.
           • Sea defenses to reduce flooding.
           • Planning based on managed retreat of coastlines may also be considered.
           • Management of patterns of land use.
           • The effectiveness of strategies may be judged on other factors, such as
             aesthetic quality, cost, displacement of people, conservation of wetlands and
             wildlife, such as on coastal marshes. Also, the impacts on peoples and
             communities in other areas along the coast.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) of the roles or power of the stakeholders. Another
           approach is to examine their different perspectives.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of a coastal
           management strategy, possibly with implied stakeholders, in order to combat
           either flooding or erosion

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either an evidenced explanation of a management strategy to combat either
             flooding or erosion, with stakeholders roles explained
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

           If both erosion and flooding are written about, only the first one mentioned is to
           be credited.

Option C – Extreme environments

5.   (a)   (i)    State the difference in mean altitude, in metres, for south-facing and north-facing
                  corries.                                                                                [1]

                  2200 – 1500 = 700m (units not required)

           (ii)   Estimate the percentage of cirques/corries facing east.                                 [1]

                  15% (accept 14–16) (% not required)


     (b)   Outline one erosional process responsible for the formation of cirques/corries.                [2]

           Award [1] for the named process and [1] for explanatory development.

           For example: Plucking [1] is where ice tears rock away due to it thawing and
           (re)freezing [1].

           Other erosional processes include:
              • Abrasion
              • Freeze thaw

     (c)   Explain two consequences of a warming climate on ice distribution in a glaciated
           mountainous area such as this.                                                               [3+3]

           In each case, award [1] for the consequence and up to [2] for further
           development.

           For example: Ice disappears/shrinks overall [1] because of higher rates of
           melting [1] and possibly less snowfall [1].

           Other consequences include:
           • Ice remains at higher altitude
           • Aspect – ice remains on north-facing slopes (hemisphere dependent) due to aspect and
             less sunshine on that slope
           • Ice coverage could increase if the system changes in ways that foster this (far
             more snow; relatively small temperature increase).

6.   (a)   Examine possible ways of managing the causes and consequences of desertification.       [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Desertification is a major problem in many arid and semi-arid regions, resulting in
           soil degradation, salinization, loss of vegetative cover, crop failure and threat to
           water supplies. Addressing desertification is critical in the eradication of poverty
           in vulnerable human populations and ensuring environmental sustainability.
           Management strategies should be implemented at the local and global scales,
           with the active engagement of stakeholders and local communities.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • The causes and consequences of desertification.
           • The importance of local, national and global strategies, and the need to involve local
             communities.
           • Integrated land and water management to protect soils from degradation and salinization;
             countering erosion through terracing and other measures.
           • Protecting vegetative cover as a major instrument for soil conservation against wind and
             water erosion; planting trees.
           • Applying a combination of traditional practices with locally adapted land use techniques.
           • Introduction of drought-resistant crops and animal husbandry.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the challenges of desertification in
           different places and scales. They might consider whether one way is easier than
           the other. Another approach might be to look at different scales of desertification
           – the causes might be global warming, but the consequences are felt locally, at a
           different scale.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some causes and/or
           consequences of desertification.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either an evidenced explanation of different management strategies to combat
             the causes and consequences (do not expect balance) of desertification
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

6.   (b)   Examine how competition over resources in one or more extreme environments has led to
           tension among stakeholders.                                                        [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           Both arid and cold extreme environments possess considerable and increasingly
           valuable natural resources. These include minerals, freshwater and scenic
           resources. Competition over the use of these resources has resulted in tensions
           and conflicts between different stakeholders, especially between local people and
           external powers.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • The issues may be discussed in relation to one or more extreme environments.
           • Conflicts/tensions may be caused by increased demand for resources, such as minerals,
             land and freshwater, and increased pressures from tourism.
           • Stakeholders occur at different scales, including local people/indigenous groups,
             governments, TNCs, tourists, environmentalists/conservation.
           • The relative power of these stakeholders also varies with time and place.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the conflict between identified
           stakeholders, their relative power, and the scale of the conflict. Another approach
           might be to reflect critically on the degree of tension and possible conflict.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of stakeholder tensions
           in an extreme environment.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either an evidenced explanation of how competition for resources has resulted
             in stakeholder tensions/conflict in one or more extreme environments
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

           For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option D – Geophysical hazards

7.   (a)   (i)     Determine the difference in height between the spot heights at A and B.               [1]

                   1446–125 = 1321 m (units not required)

           (ii)    Estimate the distance in kilometres between A and B on the map.                       [1]

                   9.1 km (accept 8.5–9.5). (unit not required)

     (b) Outline how one piece of map evidence indicates that this is a volcanic area.                   [2]

           Award [1] for relevant evidence and [1] for development linked to volcanic
           activity. There should be some specific reference to an area/place on the map to
           gain [1].

           For example: Snaefellsjokull [1] is a large dome/cone-shaped volcano as seen
           from circular contour lines [1]

           Other possibilities include:
           • lava block field along the coast / NW of the area indicating lava flows from a
             volcano
           • crater(s) – on named volcano – indicates volcanic activity.

     (c)   Explain how volcanic hazard vulnerability in an area such as this could be reduced using:

           (i)     GPS crater monitoring;                                                                [3]

           Allow [1] for demonstrating an understanding of the term and [1] for each further
           development point explaining how vulnerability is reduced, up to a maximum of
           [3].

           For example: GPS monitoring means that transmitters/receivers are placed around the
           volcano [1] allowing scientists to monitor and record data about the volcano's activity and
           changes [1] thus allowing for a timely evacuation of the populations affected by potential
           volcanic eruptions [1].


            (ii)    lava diversions.                                                                     [3]

           Allow [1] for demonstrating an understanding of the term and [1] for each further
           development point explaining how vulnerability is reduced, up to a maximum of
           [3].

           For example: Lava diversions can be building walls or incorporating lava tubes [1] as is used
           for volcanic eruptions on Mount Etna [1] which have helped divert the lava from the more
           populous areas and so saving lives and property [1].

8.   (a)   Examine how social and economic strategies may reduce people’s vulnerability to
           earthquake hazard events.                                                             [10]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

           The vulnerability of people to an earthquake hazard varies spatially. Mitigating
           measures to reduce vulnerability to injury, disease and death include a variety of
           social and economic strategies. Levels of wealth, and planning by local and
           national authorities, will influence their effectiveness.

           Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
           (AO1):
           • Levels of vulnerability vary spatially, between and within communities.
           • Reduction in vulnerability concerns both individuals and communities.
           • Social strategies include increasing perception of the hazard risk, knowledge and degree
             of preparedness.
           • Reduction in vulnerability might involve risk reduction through measures such as
             education, drills, increasing awareness.
           • Increasing individual, family and community preparedness includes storing food and water
             for emergencies, emergency kits.
           • Special preparation strategies may be needed for disabled, elderly and young children.
           • Economic strategies / wealth – making buildings and infrastructure more resilient;
             improved communications (warnings); media.
           • There is a relationship between social and economic strategies, at different
             scales.

           Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
           critical evaluation (AO3) that examines how vulnerability may be reduced at
           different spatial scales (individual, family, community), and the role and power of
           different stakeholders. Another approach might be to critically examine the
           interaction between social and economic factors at different scales.

           For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of some social and/or
           economic strategies to reduce human vulnerability.

           For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
           • either an evidenced explanation of a variety of social and economic strategies
             (do not expect balance) to reduce human vulnerability
           • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
             concepts and/or perspectives.

8.   (b)    Evaluate pre-event strategies and post-event strategies for the management of mass
            movement hazards.                                                                        [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Mass movements pose a considerable risk to people and infrastructure,
            especially in upland areas with steep slopes and high rainfall. The potential risk
            may increase due to human activity modifying the slopes through the building of
            settlements and roads and changing the vegetation cover on vulnerable slopes.
            Hazard risk and vulnerability may be the result of different types of mass
            movement, from slow (soil creep, solifluction) to rapid (landslides, rockfalls).

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Pre-event strategies include:
                 o identifying areas at risk (geological surveys and mapping)
                 o GIS
                 o slope stabilization, drainage
                 o vegetating slopes/afforestation/grass
                 o terracing, re-shaping
                 o use of gabions and netting.
            • Also, mitigating factors such as:
                 o planning and land-use zoning
                 o increasing levels of awareness; education.
            • Post-event strategies (varying with type of mass movement and different time scales)
              include:
                 o reducing injury/loss of life (search and rescue; medical aid; securing water supplies)
                 o reconstruction
                 o re-location of vulnerable settlements
                 o modifications to infrastructure.

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3), comparing the relative importance/success of
            strategies, or different scale examples. They may compare successes and
            failures for different places (of different stages of development). Another
            approach might be to systematically evaluate strategies for different mass
            movement processes, eg rapid to slow mass movement.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of pre- and/or post-
            event strategies.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either an evidenced explanation of pre- and post-event strategies (do not
              expect balance) for managing mass movement hazard(s)
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

           Award up to a maximum of [4] if a tectonic process is used instead of mass movement but has
           some valid pre-/post-event strategies.

Option E – Leisure, tourism and sport

9.   (a)   (i)    Estimate the percentage of older adults playing basketball in 2008.              [1]

                  22 (allow 21–23)

           (ii)   Identify the year in which 50% of children played basketball.                    [1]

                  2018

     (b)   Outline one factor that can influence the location of a sports stadium.                 [2]

           Award [1] for the factor and a further [1] for development / explanation
           /exemplification.

           For example: A basketball stadium needs to be easily accessible to supporters
           [1]; this favours a central urban area with good transport accessibility [1].

           Other factors include, but are not limited to:
           • land availability
           • cost of land
           • car parking
           • noise
           • population density
           • culture and history
           • government and private investment.

     (c)   Explain why participation in basketball or other sports might increase over time for:


           (i)    women;                                                                           [3]

           Award [1] for each relevant explanation/exemplification point.

           For example: Gender equality rights are being legally enforced [1]; this results in
           changing attitudes and mindsets towards women in sport [1]; women are more
           empowered to participate in sport, for example, in the FIFA World Cup [1].

           (ii)   low-income groups.                                                               [3]

           Award [1] for each relevant explanation/exemplification point.

           For example: Civil society organizations [1] are working with poor communities
           by providing equipment and access to facilities [1], such as youth rugby in
           townships in South Africa [1].

10.   (a)    Examine ways of managing the negative impacts of tourism’s rapid growth in some urban
             environments.                                                                         [10]

             Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

             The rapid growth of tourism in cities of cultural/historical importance has resulted
             in increased physical, economic and social stress for both residents and visitors.
             This may decrease the quality of life and make the city a less desirable place to
             visit. Management strategies need to be implemented for a more sustainable
             future and to increase site resilience. Credit should be given where “rapid” is
             implied but not necessarily explicitly stated.

             Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
             (AO1):

             • Negative impacts of urban tourism include overcrowding/reduction in perceptual and
               physical carrying capacities, increased pollution, and congestion.
             • Management strategies may be at different scales, from local to national and international.
             • Strategies for both visitors and residents.
             • Strategies include restricting access (eg, Venice), reducing vehicular traffic,
               pedestrianization, bicycles.
             • Encourage localization, and reduce the power of TNCs.
             • Improving infrastructure, such as water supply and waste disposal.
             • Restricting ownership and letting policies (housing strategies).
             • Improved education of visitors and residents.

             Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
             critical evaluation (AO3) that examines conflicts between, and the power and
             perception of, different stakeholders (residents, tourists, TNCs, governments).
             Management strategies may vary spatially, and at different scales, for a
             sustainable future.

             For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two
             management strategies dealing with rapid urban tourist growth.

             For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
             • either an evidenced explanation of two or more management strategies
               dealing with impacts of the rapid growth of tourism in urban environments
             • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
               concepts and/or perspectives.

             For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

            Award up to a maximum of [4] if a non-urban environment is used eg Machu Pichu
                                                    – 19 –              N20/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


10.   (b)   Examine the advantages and disadvantages of the site used for one or more festivals. [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Festivals are increasingly important as a leisure and tourist activity. A wide
            variety of different festivals are held in many different locations, attracting large
            numbers of visitors. They may be in urban or rural areas, and range from large
            open-air music or sporting festivals to smaller, more intimate, literary and artistic
            festivals. Site is an important factor when choosing the location of a festival.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Site factors will vary according to the type of festival, its duration, and numbers of
              participants.
            • Site factors might include area/size (may affect carrying capacity).
            • Geology and soils, relief and drainage.
            • Provision of water supply, food, and disposal of waste.
            • Accessibility of the site (may be important for large festivals) – affects sphere of influence
              and catchment area.
            • Urban or rural (will vary with the nature of the festival).
            • Landscape/scenery (might be important for literary/artistic festivals).
            • Proximity to settlements (noise pollution).

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that examines accessibility and different scales – some
            festivals attract millions, others hundreds. Disadvantages could be based around
            a stakeholder analysis, including different power perspectives. Another approach
            is to look at the advantages of places that are very well connected compared with
            other places, thereby allowing interaction.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of advantages and/or
            disadvantages of one or more festival sites.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either an evidenced explanation of the advantages and disadvantages (do not
              expect balance) of one or more festival sites
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option F — Food and health

11.   (a)   Estimate the area of the country of Nigeria, in km2. Show your working.                     [2]

            Award [1] for correct answer.
            Award [1] for evidence of some valid working / data extraction (even if with
            incorrect answer).

            Accept answers between 800,000 and 1,000,000.

            Looking for evidence of use of scale eg: 1000 x 1000 m = 1, 000, 000 km2 (units not required
            for full marks).

      (b)   Outline one of the main components of the food security index.                              [2]

            Award [1] for stating a correct component and [1] for valid outlining or further understanding
            of what the food index is measuring.

            For example: Affordability [1] measures the ability of people to purchase food [1].

            The three other components are:
            • access to food
            • nutritional quality/diet
            • safety.

      (c)   Explain two human factors that may have led to high food insecurity in countries such as
            those shown.                                                                           [3+3]

            In each case, award [1] for a relevant human factor and up to [2] for
            development/explanation/exemplification.

            For example: High incidence of disease (HIV/AIDS, malaria, etc) [1] means fewer
            people available to work the land sufficiently [1], leading to a lack of food for their
            families [1].

            Other possible factors include:
            • poor farming techniques
            • political instability
            • cost of seeds/ fertilizers / foodstuffs
            • corruption
            • poor transport links
            • poor storage
            • population increases
            • lack of aid due to militia etc
            • inability to trade in world markets.

12.   (a)   Examine ways in which people’s dietary choices are sometimes influenced by different types
            of transnational corporation (TNC).                                                    [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            People’s habits of food consumption and dietary choices have undergone
            significant changes in recent years in both higher-income and lower-income
            countries. The food chain, from production to marketing and consumption, is
            increasingly dominated by large TNCs that influence people’s food choices.
            There is an increasing uniformity of food production and consumption, and
            concern that poor diets may lead to a greater incidence of obesity and heart
            disease. Food consumption habits and dietary choices may be influenced by
            different types of TNC – eg agribusiness, media, supermarkets and fast-food
            franchises.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Agribusinesses form a crucial role in the food chain, from production (supply) to marketing
              and consumption.
            • TNCs ensure a relatively cheap, reliable and consistent supply of food.
            • Supermarkets, the media and fast-food chains promote certain types of food, affecting
              people’s diets.
            • Need for uniformity leads to a reduction in variability and lack of choice of different types
              of foodstuffs.
            • Close links between production and retailing of food through outlets such as
              supermarkets, fast-food outlets, pre-cooked meals and other food supplies.
            • A link between advertising in the media and agribusinesses, influencing patterns of
              consumption.
            • Dietary choices may vary over time and space.
            • Changing patterns of food consumption in low-income countries – movement
              away from traditional forms of agriculture and foodstuffs. Reduction in diversity
              of food production and diets.

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the relative power of different
            categories/types/examples of TNC (eg, media, agribusinesses, supermarkets,
            fast-food franchises). Different places, eg isolated rural communities, could be
            less affected than people in urban centres. There is also the possibility that TNC
            influence is limited by factors like government health campaigns.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of how one or more
            different types of TNCs have influenced people’s diets.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either an evidenced explanation of how two or more different types of TNCs
              have influenced people’s dietary choices
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

12.   (b)   Examine the role of diffusion and barriers in the spread of disease                       [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The spread of infectious diseases may be increased by increasing globalization,
            and the movement of people between different parts of the world. Some disease
            outbreaks, such as influenza, may spread rapidly over a wide area. Although
            physical controls are important in limiting the spread, human factors, such as
            vaccination, quarantine and education play a crucial role.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Responses may focus on one or more named diseases.
            • Types of diffusion of diseases include expansion and relocation.
            • Geographic factors may act as barriers in the spread of disease and the rate of diffusion.
            • Barriers may be physical (relief or water features), political (eg, quarantine), economic or
              social (eg, controls such as vaccination campaigns). The role of international bodies, such
              as relief workers and the UN, might also be considered.
            • Responses should refer to the areal spread of disease, at different scales, and the rates of
              diffusion.
            • The effectiveness of barriers may also vary according to the disease.

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that focuses on the spatial interaction between places
            with respect to the spread of disease, and the power of different stakeholders to
            erect effective barriers. Another approach is to examine different diffusion
            processes and the extent to which barriers are effective.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of how diffusion and/or
            barriers affect the spread of disease(s).

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either an evidenced explanation of the role of diffusion and barriers (do not
              expect balance) in the spread of disease(s)
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.

Option G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   (i)    Identify two types of vehicle allowed within the superblock model.                     [1]

                   Award [1] for any two, and [0] for only one.

                   bicycles / urban and emergency services / residents’ vehicles (do not accept
                   cars)

            (ii)   Determine the number of residents living in each superblock (as enclosed by the
                   marked roads)                                                                          [1]

                   900

      (b)   Outline one way in which the superblock model could modify the microclimate of an urban
            area.                                                                                [2]

            Award [1] for a valid environmental consequence of the superblock model and [1]
            for a link to microclimate.

            For example: Less motorised vehicles reduces emissions [1], which lowers air
            temperature [1] / which improves air quality [1].

            Other ways include:
            • wind patterns (decrease / funneling)
            • changing albedo as road surface changed for pedestrianisation

      (c)   Explain two ways in which technologies can be used by urban planners to manage smart
            cities such as this more sustainably.                                             [3+3]

            In each case, award [1] for a correct way and up to [2] for development /
            explanation / exemplification linked to sustainability.

            For example: Urban planners can use satellite data to monitor traffic [1]. This lets
            drivers know where to go to keep the city moving [1], which is vital in cities that
            can become over congested [1].

            Other examples include but are not limited to
            • scheduling waste collections
            • parking availability
            • irrigation controls for vertical/ roof-top gardens.
            • driverless cars
            • smart meters
            • technologies linked to increasing sustainability eg e.v. charging stations

            Do not accept general eco-city points like solar panels/power or use of public transport as
            these are not Smart City technologies.

14.   (a)   Examine the costs and benefits of urban redevelopment for different groups of stakeholders.
                                                                                                    [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            Urban redevelopment, in both low- and high-income countries, may have a
            significant impact on neighbourhoods and local communities. Costs and benefits
            will vary between different stakeholders, who may have differing perspectives
            and power.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Urban redevelopment includes land use changes, such as slum clearances and
              gentrification, development of brownfield and greenfield sites, affecting neighbourhoods
              and their populations.
            • Slum clearances may include areas in cities of different levels of economic development –
              eg squatter settlements and inner-city slums.
            • Residential populations in affected local neighbourhoods may have different viewpoints
              concerning land use changes, and be affected in different ways.
            • Costs and benefits will vary between different stakeholders, such as local
              communities, city planners, developers and TNCs, who have differing
              perspectives and power.

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that examines how perspectives will vary based on
            who is benefitting; these may change on longer timescales. Costs and benefits
            may be spread according to the power of different stakeholders. In different
            places there may also be more or less protection for disenfranchised
            stakeholders.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the costs and/or
            benefits of urban redevelopment for people/stakeholders.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either an evidenced explanation of costs and benefits of urban redevelopment
              (do not expect balance) for different groups of stakeholders
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
                                                    – 25 –              N20/3/GEOGR/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


14.   (b)   Examine the influence of economic and political factors on the location of low-quality
            residential areas in cities.                                                             [10]

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

            The location of low-quality residential areas in cities may vary over space and
            time. It may vary between cities in low-income and high-income countries. Their
            location is affected by a variety of economic, social, political and physical factors,
            and importance is affected by the relative power of different stakeholders.

            Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding
            (AO1):
            • Examples may be taken from one or more cities.
            • Economic factors include variations in land value and the relative wealth/poverty of the
              populations. Also, employment, industrial activity and proximity to other types of urban
              land use.
            • Transportation networks and accessibility.
            • Political factors include urban planning, including possible segregation of low-income
              groups.
            • Political factors may be more important in autocratic than democratic governments and
              societies.
            • Other factors may also be important, such as physical (eg, high relief and
              poorly drained areas) and social (ethnic minorities and immigrant groups,
              segregation).

            Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a
            critical evaluation (AO3) that examines the importance of scale – eg, small
            cities or megacities. Another consideration is the interaction between different
            political and economic stakeholders. This depends on different places in the
            world (developing or developed) and different power structures in
            autocracies/democracies. Perspectives may differ on what “low quality” means.

            For 5–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the influence of
            economic and/or political factors on the location of residential urban areas.

            For 7–8 marks, expect a structured account that includes:
            • either an evidenced explanation of how economic and political factors (do not
              expect balance) may influence the location of low-quality residential areas in
              cities
            • or a discursive conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) grounded in geographical
              concepts and/or perspectives.

            For 9–10 marks, expect both of these traits.
