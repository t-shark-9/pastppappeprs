           substantiated assertions.
    0      Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the impact of developments in science and technology on one society.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of science and technology, weighing up
     the strengths and limitations or otherwise of their impact on one society. There may be equal
     coverage of both science and technology, or one may be prioritized over the other, but both
     aspects will feature in the response. Candidates may refer to medical advancements made during
     the ‘Abbasid Empire or the impact that the development of the astrolabe, for example, had on
     trade. The study of Euclidian geometry during the early Renaissance may be mentioned as well as
     the invention of tidal mills and wooden ploughs during the Carolingian era. The development of
     typesetting in the Song dynasty in China enabled the printing of books. The advances in
     architecture in pre-Columbian America would also be relevant. The focus must remain on the
     impact such discoveries had upon the chosen society and these may include economic or social
     developments, advances in communications or improved agricultural yields. Candidates’ opinions
     and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the reasons for disputes between rulers and religious leaders in two societies, each
     chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between rulers and religious
     leaders in two societies that must be chosen from different regions. There should be focus on
     disputes that arose between rulers and religious leaders and an examination of the reasons for
     these. Examples of disputes may include the following: the quarrel between Henry II of England
     and Archbishop Thomas Becket; the impact of Zen Confucianism and Buddhism on the emergence
     of the Shogunate that overshadowed the authority of the emperor in medieval Japan; the dispute
     over the succession to the Caliphate in Islam; or the impact the Avignon Papacy, also known as
     the Great Western Schism, had upon the allegiance of temporal rulers to Rome. The two societies
     chosen need not be contemporaneous and the focus should remain on the reasons for disputes.
     Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                   –5–                   N20/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2: Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   “The mobilization of human and economic resources was the most important factor in determining
     the outcome of wars.” Discuss with reference to two wars, each chosen from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the mobilization of human and economic resources was the most important factor in
     determining the outcome of wars. The two wars must be from different regions. Responses will
     likely discuss economic mobilization via the acquisition of supplies (purchasing, requisition, or from
     rich territory) and/or the distribution of supplies including the maintenance of supply lines or efforts
     to limit the enemies’ access to resources. The Toluid Civil War may be used as an example.
     Methods to acquire financial capital including taxation and tribute are also appropriate examples,
     as are efforts to obtain resources from allies such as in the Byzantine–Seljuq Wars. Human
     mobilization could include both the mobilization of soldiers (via conscription, solicitation, hiring or
     ideological inducement) and/or the mobilization of the domestic population to support the war
     effort, for example the Crusades. Other relevant factors considered crucial in determining the
     outcome, may be addressed, for example leadership, tactics, strategy and organization.
     Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.


4.   Examine the short-term and long-term political consequences of one war.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the short- and long-
     term political consequences of one war. The long-term consequences appraised may extend
     beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Responses will likely include the transfer of political power in the short-term, such as in the Norman
     Conquest, and may go on to discuss the long-term political consequences of those changes.
     Attempts to address political divisions following civil wars including internal purges, such as
     following the Toluid Civil War, may also be discussed along with the long-term consequences of
     such divisions. The gain or loss of territory in the short term and the subsequent impact on the
     strength of the countries involved may also be considered, examples could include the Byzantine–
     Seljuq Wars (1048–1308) or the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453), of which candidates may also
     elect to evaluate distinct periods. Candidates may also appraise the political consequences of the
     wars as they relate to relations between countries, shifting alliances and balance of power.
     Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –6–                  N20/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 3: Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Examine the effects of religious and secular law on the governing institutions of one state.

     The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between the effects of
     religious and secular law on the governing institutions of one state. These may include: a
     monarchy, a council of nobles, a caliphate, the court of an emperor or a judicial system and they
     may be either or both secular and religious. Reference may be made to the impact of changes to
     laws governing the taxation and inheritance of land in Norman England; the development and
     application of Sharia Law in the ‘Abbasid dynasty; the development and application of customary
     law in the kingdom of Benin. For effects, candidates may consider rivalry that may have existed
     between institutions that promoted religious above secular laws or vice versa and how these may
     have impacted the evolution of governing institutions. A relative increase or reduction in the
     authority of the state or of a religious hierarchy may be considered or, for example, the impact such
     institutions may then have had upon the lives of subjects or religious communities. Candidates’
     opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Evaluate the effectiveness of two rulers, each chosen from a different region, in resolving issues of
     succession.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the effectiveness of two rulers, each
     chosen from a different region, in resolving issues of succession. Candidates need to identify
     clearly the nature of the issues: these may be linked to factors such as there being more than one
     heir to a kingdom or empire; the administration of a regency; or, alternatively, a challenge made
     due to the fitness or ability of an heir to defend or to expand territory. Candidates will need to
     evaluate the effectiveness of how these were resolved. Resolution may have been achieved
     through methods such as the custom of imprisoning or assassinating rivals in the Ottoman Empire;
     the resort to war as in the Wars of the Roses in England and the Tepanec War in the Aztec
     Empire. In Asia, the resolution of disputes over succession in the Song dynasty may be discussed.
     Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.
                                                  –7–                 N20/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Discuss the impact of social and economic change on either minority or indigenous peoples in
     one society.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of
     social and economic change on either minority or indigenous peoples in one society. The impacts
     discussed may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in
     the question. The economically motivated expansion of European populations to the Americas and
     the subsequent colonial empires will be likely examples of impacts on the indigenous populations.
     Candidates may discuss the brutal treatment of the indigenous populations including the
     establishment of the encomienda system. Similarly, the impact of economically motivated
     expansion on the minority African slave population may also be a frequent example. The
     experience of the Jewish population in Europe may also serve as an example of the impact of
     social and economic change on religious minorities. The changes resulting from the spread of
     Islam in western Africa and the Swahili Coast also offers an example. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   Evaluate the impact of cross-cultural exchange on two societies in transition.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of cross-cultural exchange on two
     societies in transition, weighing its impact on those societies. The two societies may or may not be
     from the same region. Impacts may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked
     to the issue raised in the question. Responses may appraise the impact of intellectual and
     technological exchange on societies in transition, for example, the developments of the European
     Renaissance. Responses addressing the Renaissance may appraise the impact of the exchange
     of literature, art and theatre and will use specific examples to support the appraisal. The impact of
     religious exchange including the introduction of new ideas, forced conversion and missionary work,
     for example, in relation to the Reformation and European colonization of the New World will likely
     be popular. Responses may appraise the impact of societal exchange/social transfer including
     cultural blending and inter-societal family relationships. Candidates may appraise cross-cultural
     exchange as having had a positive or negative impact on the societies in question, depending
     upon the examples and perspective taken. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
     clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –8–                   N20/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 5: Early Modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Discuss the economic reasons for expansion by two Early Modern states, each chosen from a
      different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the economic
      reasons for expansion by two Early Modern states. The two states must be from different regions.
      Reasons discussed may predate the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised
      in the question. Responses may consider expansion that was motivated by the desire to increase
      land holdings/territory, one example of which is the acquisition of natural resources including
      arable land. The expansion of the Ottoman and Safavid Empires and the early Qing dynasty may
      serve as examples. The role of joint-stock companies in the colonization of North America or the
      Spanish conquistadors’ motivations to gain territory and resources will be common examples.
      Responses may also consider expansion that was driven by the desire to acquire additional
      population as a work force, for taxation or as a market for the sale of goods. Expansion which was
      motivated by the desire to gain economically strategic areas (for example ports, passes) would be
      another viable topic for discussion. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   “Resistance and rebellion had a significant impact on colonial rule.” With reference to two states,
      to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      resistance and rebellion had a significant impact on colonial rule. The two states may or may not
      be from the same region and the number of acts of resistance/rebellion for each state may vary.
      The impacts considered may extend beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the
      question. Incidents of resistance and rebellion by the indigenous American peoples will likely be a
      common response, examples of which include the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II and the First Indian
      War. Slave revolts throughout the Americas and the subsequent impact on the institution of slavery
      and colonial rule may also be discussed with examples including the St. John's Slave Rebellion
      and slave insurrection in Jamaica. Impacts of resistance and rebellion may include political change
      including in governance or to the legal system as well as economic impacts such as changes to
      taxation, property rights and labour management. Candidates may also consider states in which
      resistance and rebellion did not have a significant impact on colonial rule. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                 –9–                   N20/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 6: Causes and effects of Early Modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   Evaluate the significance of religion as a cause of two wars, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of religion as a cause
      of two wars, each chosen from a different region. There should be focus on religion and an
      evaluation of its significance as a causation of the chosen wars. In Europe, reference may be
      made to the divisions within the Christian Church as a cause of the Thirty Years’ War or the War of
      the League of Cambrai against the Venetian Republic; the significance of Islam as a pretext for the
      expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Europe may be evaluated and how far this could be
      considered a “jihad”. An evaluation of religion as the motivation for the conquistadors in the
      Americas or the expansion of the Mughal Empire in India would also be appropriate. Candidates’
      opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


12.   “Land strategies were more important than sea strategies in determining the outcome of wars.”
      Discuss with reference to two wars, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the argument that
      land strategies were more important than sea strategies in determining the outcome of two wars,
      each chosen from a different region. As the question refers to the outcome of the chosen wars, the
      outbreak may pre-date the timeframe. There may be reference to sea strategies such as the use of
      galleys and Venetian galleasses as platforms for battles between soldiers, as in the Battle of
      Lepanto, although this did not prevent the disbanding of the Holy League. The Wars of Spanish
      Succession would provide opportunities to discuss the relative importance of land and sea
      strategies. The use of both land and sea strategies in the Spanish and Portuguese conquests of
      the Americas and the Indies as well as the seizure of coastal ports along the West African
      seaboard to facilitate the transportation of slaves may be discussed. Candidates should consider
      both land and sea strategies but, depending on the wars chosen, may prioritize one over the other.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
                                                    – 10 –                N20/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 7: Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Evaluate the significance of individuals to the origins of industrialization in two countries.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the significance of individuals to the
      origins of industrialization, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two countries may or
      may not be from the same region. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the number of
      individuals appraised from each country or they may vary the number selected. Additionally, the
      period of industrialization discussed from each country may not be contemporaneous. Candidates
      may appraise the significance of scientists in contributing to new discoveries and theories, for
      example James Watt; business owners such as Matthew Boulton or Henry Ford; or entrepreneurs
      such as Richard Arkwright, who facilitated industrialization. Responses may appraise the
      significance of key political figures in enabling industrialization for example Mao attempting
      industrialization in the Great Leap Forward. Other individuals appraised could include those who
      moved, emigrated or otherwise transmitted their ideas to another country and therefore contributed
      to its industrialization, for example John Dickson’s role in bringing the steam engine to Australia.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Examine the impact of developments in transportation on the industrialization of two countries.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between developments in
      transportation and industrialization. The two countries may or may not be from the same region.
      Responses will likely consider the relationship between transportation and industrialization via the
      transportation of vital goods and materials. Candidates may also consider the role of transportation
      in the movement of workers to enable industrialization. The means of transportation discussed will
      vary depending on the state and time period considered and may include railways, canals, roads,
      ocean shipping, and airplanes. Developments in personal transportation vehicles may also be
      considered including the car, bicycle and motorcycle. Responses may also consider the
      development of one mode of transportation over time and the resulting impacts, for example the
      continuing improvement of the steam engine, railway engineering or improved road surface
      materials. Where industrialization was linked to militarization and/or imperialism, responses may
      also consider the impact of developments in transportation and their connection to military
      endeavours including the mobilization of troops and the transportation of vital resources.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 8: Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   Discuss the importance of social and economic factors in the rise of one independence movement,
      up to the point of independence.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the importance of
      social and economic factors to the rise of one independence movement up to point of
      independence. Reference may be made to the importance of economic factors such as the
      demand for greater control over income derived from the sale of natural resources such as oil; the
      demand for greater equal opportunities for employment and promotion; or reforms to unfair
      taxation. For social factors, candidates may consider the importance of the demand for religious
      equality; a recognition of linguistic or cultural identity; reforms to allow greater access to secondary
      and higher education; or the impact that the spread of nationalism had as a popular ideology.
      Examples may include independence movements in the former European or Japanese overseas
      empires or those that emerged within the Austrian or Russian Empires. Candidates must discuss
      the relative importance of social and economic factors upon the rise of the chosen independence
      movements. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


16.   Discuss the effectiveness of responses to political problems during the first ten years of
      independence in two states, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of how effectively
      two states, each chosen from a different region, responded to political problems during the first ten
      years of independence. Candidates may refer to problems relating to the application of a
      constitution or the functioning of a democratic system. Similarly, problems arising out of the
      extension of suffrage or out of ideological challenges that may have confronted the newly
      independent states may be discussed. Examples may include conflict arising from the political
      problems following the division of Kashmir in the years following the independence of India; the
      accommodation of US influence on the political structure of the newly independent Cuba; the
      suppression of ideological challenges to the Sukarno presidency in Indonesia; the resort to civil
      war in Nigeria in response to disputes over the political process following independence.
      Candidates must clearly identify the link between the political challenges and the response of the
      newly independent states. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 9: Emergence and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Evaluate the success of suffrage movements in extending democracy in two states.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the success of suffrage movements,
      weighing up their success or otherwise in extending democracy in two states. The two states may
      or may not be from the same region. Candidates will likely refer to the extension of suffrage based
      on gender and may appraise the failures of female suffrage campaigns in the 19th century.
      Candidates will also likely appraise campaigns which focused on removing economic barriers to
      suffrage and the political reforms which resulted from these movements. Examples may include
      the Chartists and the British Reform Acts. The evolution of attempts to extend suffrage to particular
      groups and the means by which those efforts were frustrated and, in some cases, overcome are
      also appropriate. For example, the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1870 was
      not applied fully until the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Responses will likely appraise the impact of
      suffrage campaigns on the extension of democracy, including constitutional amendments and
      changes to voting districts and practices. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   To what extent were education and social welfare policies successful in achieving their aims in one
      democratic state?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
      education and social welfare policies were successful in achieving their aims. Candidates may
      offer equal coverage of education and social welfare, or they may prioritize their assessment of
      one policy. However, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates must refer to the
      aims of education and social welfare policies in their selected state, for example, the objectives of
      the National Policy on Education in India and the Medicare programme in the United States. In
      appraising the extent to which education policies achieved their aims, responses may consider
      whether the policies met pre-set targets, improved exam performance or increased citizen
      participation in the democratic process. In considering the extent to which social welfare policies
      achieved their aims, candidates may refer to a wide range of factors including improvements in
      overall health, standards of living, by either internal or external measures, or employment.
      Candidates may argue that one type of policy was more successful than the other or may pose the
      argument that success in these areas was interconnected. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 10: Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   Compare and contrast the use of force in the maintenance of power in two authoritarian states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the use of force in the maintenance of power in two authoritarian states referring to both
      throughout. The two states may or may not be from the same region. Candidates may compare
      and contrast the use of force as a tool to maintain authority within the state, for example, Mao’s
      use of the Cultural Revolution as a tool to eliminate opposition inside and outside of the ruling party
      with Lenin’s use of the Cheka that was intended to target only counter-revolutionaries. Candidates
      may compare and contrast the use of force in isolated incidents, such the use of political
      assassinations by Pinochet or in mass campaigns such as the purges under Stalin. Candidates will
      also likely compare and contrast the use of secret police forces in authoritarian states or agencies
      such as the OVRA in Italy. Candidates may compare and contrast the use of force to maintain
      power by individual leaders or refer, more broadly, to the use of force within authoritarian states.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.



20.   “Authoritarian states had total control over the population.” With reference to two states, to what
      extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      authoritarian states had total control over the population. The two states may or may not be from
      the same region. Responses will address the extent to which states were successful and/or
      unsuccessful in achieving full control. Candidates may refer to the extent to which political methods
      were effectively used by Nazi Germany to maintain authoritarian control, such as changing the
      political structure, instituting new laws, the purging of civil servants and banning opposition parties.
      Other possible themes include the use of social policies including the regulation of education,
      youth groups, religion, marriage, divorce and the use of economic policies to mobilize the
      population and to achieve ideological aims such as Mao’s establishment of communes. Candidates
      may also consider the use of force, secret police, terror and other violent methods such as in
      Stalin’s purges or the role and effectiveness of propaganda in the achievement of authoritarian
      control. Candidates may challenge the statement by referring to opposition to the regime such as
      the existence of opposition groups during Castro’s rule. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 11: Causes and effects of 20th century wars

21.   “Territorial disputes were the main cause of wars.” Discuss with reference to two wars, each
      chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of
      territorial disputes in causing two 20th-century wars, each chosen from a different region.
      Candidates may refer to disputes over borders; rival claims to colonial territory; competition over
      access to resource-rich territory; the desire to recover lands lost in the settlement of previous
      conflicts. Examples may include French revanchism as a cause of the First World War; the
      Japanese occupation of China that led to the Second World War in Asia and the Pacific; the
      dispute over borders leading to the Italo-Abyssinian War and also the Chaco War in Latin America;
      or the secession of resource-rich Katanga as a cause of the Congolese civil war. Candidates must
      clearly identify the link between the territorial dispute and the causes of the wars chosen as
      examples and it is important to note that this must remain the focus of the question, although other
      relevant causes may be mentioned. These may include causes such as ideology as for expansion;
      demands for self-determination; and opportunism. Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   Discuss the impact of the mobilization of human and economic resources on the outcome of two
      wars.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the impact of the
      mobilization of human and economic resources on the outcome of two wars. For human resources,
      candidates may consider the conscription of adult males; the conscription of women to replace
      men in the workforce. For economic resources, candidates may refer to government control over
      resources and production; the sale of war bonds; the rationing of food in order to supply both the
      Home Front and the military. Both world wars may be used as examples although different theatres
      in the First or Second World War may not be used as different wars. Alternatively, candidates may
      consider other factors that may have been more important in impacting the outcome of the chosen
      wars, for example, a war may have been won because of superior strategies; the impact of
      charismatic leadership on morale and unity; or the use of more effective technology. The focus,
      however, must remain on the mobilization of human and economic resources. Candidates’
      opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Topic 12: The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   To what extent was the arms race the most important reason for the end of the Cold War
      (1980–1991)?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      arms race was the most important reason for the end of the Cold War between 1980 and 1991.
      Candidates may refer to the Second Cold War during the early 1980s that resulted when the US
      increased its defence spending and invested in researching technology for the Strategic Defence
      Initiative (SDI). This coincided with a weakening economy in the USSR, exacerbated by falling oil
      prices and the cost of the Soviet–Afghan War. When Gorbachev became General Secretary, he
      looked for ways to reduce defence costs. Arguably, this led to arms reduction treaties and the end
      of the Cold War. Candidates may challenge the argument by claiming that the political and
      economic consequences of Gorbachev’s reforms within the USSR or the collapse of the Eastern
      Bloc were of equal or greater importance than the arms race in ending the Cold War. Candidates’
      opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


24.   Examine the economic impact of the Cold War on two countries, each chosen from a different
      region.

      The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between the Cold War and the
      economy of two countries, each chosen from a different region. Candidates may focus upon the
      impact of the Cold War upon the economies of US, the USSR and/or China and so consider the
      cost of the arms race; the need to provide aid to countries within their sphere of influence; and the
      cost of financial or military aid provided when proxy wars were being fought. For countries within
      the orbit of the superpowers, candidates may consider trade agreements; loans or investment in
      industrialization or infrastructure; pressure to adopt central planning or a free market system; and
      the pressure to increase expenditure on arms. Examples may include the economic impact on
      Cuba of aid from the USSR, as well as its withdrawal; or the economic dependence, both positive
      and negative, of many Latin American countries on the US. Candidates may consider both the
      advantages and the disadvantages of being within the economic sphere of a superpower.
      Candidates’ opinions and conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
