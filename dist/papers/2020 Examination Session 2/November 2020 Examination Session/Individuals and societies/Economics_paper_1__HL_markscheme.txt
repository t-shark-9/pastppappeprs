Microeconomics

1.   (a)       Explain how knowledge of price elasticity of demand could be used by a firm that is considering
               changing the price of its product.                                                         [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definition of price elasticity of demand
               • diagram to show the revenue consequences of elasticity when the price is
                 changed
               • explanation of how total revenue changes following a change in price
                 depending on whether the demand for the product is price elastic, price
                 inelastic or unit elastic
               • examples of “real-world” products with different elasticities to support the
                 explanation (students do not need to provide actual total revenue figures,
                 but should provide a consideration of why demand for the product might be
                 more or less likely to be elastic or inelastic).

(b)       Discuss how the introduction of a subsidy in a market will affect consumers, producers and
          the government.                                                                          [15]

          Answers may include:
          • definition of subsidy
          • diagram to show the imposition of a subsidy and the consequences for the
            three stakeholders
          • explanation of how a subsidy lowers the price of the product and may lead
            to increased consumption/consumer surplus by consumers, increased
            production/revenue/producer surplus for producers and increased
            government expenditure
          • examples of markets where subsidies have been introduced in practice
          • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

          Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
          appropriate, should be rewarded.

          Discussion may include: judgments about which stakeholders are better off and
          which stakeholders are worse off due to the imposition of a subsidy, which are well
          supported by the explanation of the theory, the diagram and the example(s).

               Answers may include:
               • definition of natural monopoly
               • diagram to show falling long-run average costs at least up to the point
                 where the LRAC curve intersects the market demand curve
               • explanation that a natural monopoly is a firm that experiences such
                 significant economies of scale (eg due to investment in fixed capital) that it
                 is able to satisfy the demand for the entire market at a level of output where
                 it still experiences falling average total cost and/or that natural monopoly
                 arises due to a natural barrier to entry such as ownership of vital input for
                 production
               • examples of natural monopoly.

(b)       Discuss how governments restrict monopoly power.                                        [15]

          Answers may include:
          • definition of monopoly power
          • a monopoly diagram to show a monopoly which is not producing at the
            profit-maximizing level of output because the price of its product is
            regulated by the government
          • explanation of why governments might choose to restrict monopoly power and
            how it might be done through government regulation of prices, legislation to
            prevent cartels and mergers, nationalization or the break-up of firms with
            monopoly power
          • examples of industries that were monopolized where a government has
            sought to exercise control
          • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

          Discussion may include: consideration of the relative merits of alternative means by
          which monopolies might be restricted. “Real-life” examples would be very suitable
          as a means to support the discussion.

          Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
          appropriate, should be rewarded.

          NB It should be noted that definitions, diagrams, theory and examples that have

               Answers may include:
               • definitions of unemployment (rate), inflation (rate)
               • diagram of the short-run Phillips curve to illustrate the trade-off between
                 inflation and unemployment and AD/AS diagram to support the explanation
               • explanation that, in the short-run, if aggregate demand in the economy
                 increases, this would lead to increase in national output, forcing firms to
                 hire more workers and decreasing the unemployment rate, while
                 simultaneously increasing the inflationary pressures in the economy, and/or
                 vice versa
               • examples of countries that have possibly experienced a trade-off between
                 inflation and unemployment.

(b)   Discuss the view that the redistribution of income is the most important impact that inflation
      has on an economy.                                                                           [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of inflation
      • AD/AS diagram to show the increase in the price level or a Lorenz curve to
        show changed distribution of income
      • explanation that (unexpectedly) high inflation affects positively the real
        income/wealth of borrowers and the groups in society with variable income while
        affecting negatively the real income/wealth of lenders and the groups in society
        with fixed income
      • examples of countries that have experienced inflation with attempt to
        identify consequences of inflation
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: consideration of alternative impacts of inflation (such as a
      loss of export competitiveness, increases in short-run economic growth, decreases in
      savings and increases in uncertainty resulting in lower investment and hence lower
      long-run economic growth, “menu costs”) with the candidate making judgment with
      regard to what might be the most important impact and whether or not the candidate
      feels the potential redistributive effect is the most significant impact of inflation, the
      importance of how high the inflation rate is, the difference between expected and
      unexpected inflation.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which, if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      NB It should be noted that definitions, diagrams, theory and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b), should be rewarded.

4.   (a)       Explain why measuring unemployment in a country is difficult.                     [10]

               Answers may include:
               • definition of unemployment
               • a diagram is not required for full marks, but candidates may use a labour
                 market diagram, AD/AS diagram or Phillips curve diagram
               • explanation of the challenges in measuring the exact number of people of
                 working age who are without work, available for work and actively seeking
                 work, resulting in inability to assess the underemployment/the hidden
                 unemployment and the unreported employment in the informal
                 (underground) economy
               • examples of specific cases or countries where there is unemployment that
                 may be difficult to measure.

(b)   Discuss whether the most important consequence of unemployment is a loss of income for
      individuals.                                                                         [15]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of unemployment
      • appropriate diagram(s) to show the loss of income due to unemployment
        and/or other consequences of unemployment
      • explanation of the different economic (loss of income), social and political
        consequences of unemployment
      • examples of the consequences of unemployment for individuals, communities
        and/or countries
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: whether or not a loss of income is the most important
      consequence of unemployment that may be set in the context of other impacts of
      unemployment, such as reduced economic growth, reduced government revenues,
      increased government expenditures on unemployment benefits, personal and social
      problems, political instability, with judgment being made with regard to whether a loss
      of income is the most important impact of unemployment.
