Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit wherever it is
possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question are understood and
addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons
or significance; methods or success), then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of
marks allowed for by the markscheme. Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria
should be rewarded accordingly. If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s
work please contact your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066–1223)

1.   “The main aim of William I’s foreign policy was to protect his conquest of England.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that William I’s foreign policy was defensive. Foreign policy issues to consider could include
     relations with Scotland, Wales, France, Flanders and Denmark. Rebellions in and attacks on
     Normandy could also be considered, for example in 1078 the French supported William’s son,
     Robert, in his rebellion. To support the statement candidates could discuss William I’s actions to
     prevent Scottish expansion in Cumbria and Northumbria. Similarly, he was anxious to resist
     potential threats from Denmark. Norman policy towards Wales was conducted more by the
     Marcher Lords who attempted to prevent Welsh incursions and who made some advances in
     South Wales. Some may argue that William was more concerned with his Norman territories than
     England. However, a counter argument is that a strong Normandy acted as protection from any
     aggression against England, which is why he had to deal effectively with rebellions. Candidates’
     opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


2.   Examine the reasons for conflict between the kings of England and France between 1154 and
     1216.

     The question requires that candidates consider the underlying reasons for the intermittent conflicts
     between England and France over the time period. Some may argue that each conflict had a
     different cause, some were about the relationship between the kings of France and England and
     some were territorial disputes. For example, Henry II was reluctant to pay personal homage to
     Louis VII, there were disputes over the guardianship of Geoffrey of Brittany and Richard I broke his
     betrothal to Alys of France leading to conflict. Richard and John were in conflict with France to try
     and regain lost territories. Others may argue that there was one major underlying cause which was
     the desire of Louis VII and more particularly Phillip Augustus to extend the authority of the French
     Crown and to weaken the Angevin Commonwealth: a too powerful vassal of France. Phillip
     Augustus particularly exploited poor relations between Henry and his sons to extend French
     authority. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
     appropriate evidence.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   “The main reason for hostility to Muslims was fear of their power.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
     main reason for the hostility to Muslims was fear of their power. Candidates may refer to European
     anxieties about access to Jerusalem and how this stoked their fears of Muslim power after the
     Seljuk invasions. Some may argue that economic power and the expansion of Muslim controlled
     lands was the reason for hostility as they controlled important trading routes. Clear examples of
     this are the tensions between Muslim traders and the important Christian cities of Pisa and Genoa.
     Another reason for hostility could be Muslim power in the Mediterranean. The Crusades in this
     respect can be viewed as a direct counterattack against their power. Other relevant factors may be
     addressed, for example the economic decline of Europe or religion, which drove expansionism in
     the eastern Mediterranean to protect Eastern Christian people. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


4.   “The persecution of the Jews had a negative impact on medieval European society.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the persecution of Jews had a negative impact on medieval European society. Candidates
     may refer to their role as important traders or money lenders to merchants and kings and that their
     persecution often disturbed commerce or the flow of capital in many European countries. Some
     may argue that the segregation of Jews in particular districts and their exclusion from certain
     aspects of urban life had a negative impact on social and economic relations. Some may argue
     that rulers used Jews as scapegoats for economic problems to win favour with their population and
     candidates may consider this as having a positive effect for the rulers or a negative impact due to
     rulers’ failure to address the real cause. Other relevant factors, for example, religious fanaticism
     and violence between Christians and Jews in the context of the Crusades could be seen as drivers
     of persecution, but it could be argued that it had a unifying effect on Christians in society.
     Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
     evidence.

Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Discuss the causes of the first stage (1337–1360) of the Hundred Years’ War.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
     England and France first went to war in 1337. Some may argue the main reason was Edward III’s
     claim to the French throne through his mother Isabella. The unexpected succession of Philip VI
     (Valois) was upheld by invoking Salic law, causing war between England and France. Others may
     argue that Edward initially paid homage for Aquitaine and did not make his claim until tensions with
     France increased over issues such as refuge being offered to David II in 1337 and the annexation
     of Aquitaine. Edward had to claim the throne to avoid excommunication for declaring war on his
     feudal overlord. Constant border tensions between France and Anglo-Gascon barons were a
     contributory factor. Some may point out that though the disputed succession was the main cause
     the underlying cause was rivalry between the French and English thrones for the rich territories of
     Aquitaine and Gascony. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


6.   Compare and contrast the rule of Philip the Bold (Philip II) and Charles the Bold.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
     reigns of the two rulers of ducal Burgundy. Philip was appointed Duke in 1363 with Burgundy
     remaining an appanage of France. Charles became Duke in 1467. Candidates may refer to the fact
     that both sought to increase Burgundian territory: Philip often through marriage, he acquired the
     counties of Burgundy, Artois and Flanders. Charles attempted to increase Burgundy’s power
     through various military campaigns that were of limited success. Both encouraged merchants to
     trade actively to increase the wealth of Burgundy. Candidates may argue that the most significant
     difference between the two was in their relationship with France. Philip, as a French prince, was
     happy for the duchy to be linked to the French crown and much of his focus was on events in
     France. He was regent for Charles VI and he was determined to keep the Orleans branch of the
     Valois family from power. In contrast Charles wanted complete independence from France and
     was involved in various campaigns against France to achieve this. Candidates’ opinions or
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Compare and contrast the forms of government in two of the following Italian city states: Milan,
     Florence, Venice.

     The question requires candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
     governments of two of the named city states referring to both throughout. Areas to discuss should
     include the size of the political class, which could include middle class merchants, a few wealthy
     families and possibly the guilds. Some may argue that all were similar in that they were oligarchies.
     Another area to consider could be the extent to which they were republics. There may be
     discussion of the dominance of one particular family such as the Sforza in Milan and the Medici in
     Florence. Some may argue that the Doge in Venice were an elective monarchy and that in Milan
     the Sforza were similar to a monarchy as power became hereditary, whereas Florence had a
     republican constitution that ensured that no one group or person had complete political control.
     The extent of similarities and differences will vary according to the chosen exemplars; do not
     expect an equal number of both. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.


8.   “The Renaissance had little impact.” Discuss with reference to one European country excluding
     Italy, Burgundy and Germany.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
     that the Renaissance changed very little in the country they have chosen to consider. One
     approach could be to identify the main characteristics of the Renaissance and then to consider
     which of these, if any, had an impact. The main characteristics could include the move towards a
     more humanist education, developments in scientific knowledge, changing attitudes to religion, a
     more educated population as a consequence of developments in printing, support for trade and
     exploration, as well as changes in the arts and politics. The Renaissance is viewed as having
     transformed these areas and as being a period of cultural renewal. The extent of its impact will
     vary from country to country and candidates may offer some explanation as to why there was or
     was not a significant impact. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
     supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

9.    “The main reason for exploration was a desire to open trade routes for luxury goods.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the main reason for exploration was a desire to open trade routes for luxury goods.
      Candidates may refer to the importance of luxury goods such as silk, gold, silver, ivory, porcelain
      and tea, which could be considered an impetus for exploration. Internal demand for these types of
      resources by certain social classes, such as the nobility and aristocracy, drove many of these
      classes to fund expeditions and also sparked the merchant classes to try to provide these goods.
      Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example the Renaissance spirit linked to testing
      human ability; a desire to explore the unknown and to expand their knowledge of the world;
      economic expansion and competition particularly along Muslim and Italian trade routes; and the
      religious motive to expand Christianity also played a significant role. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


10.   Discuss the consequences for European states of the exploration of the Indian Ocean.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      consequences for European states of the exploration of the Indian Ocean. Consequences may
      extend beyond the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the increased status of Portugal through the creation of new trade routes
      to India that broke apart the Arab–Venetian monopoly of the spice trade. Some may argue that a
      consequence was the arrival of various goods and their impact on the demand for certain
      commodities developed European markets. Candidates may refer to the transformation that took
      place in political and commercial organizations as important consequences of exploration. Other
      relevant factors may be addressed, for example, a new world view of the globe and Europe’s place
      in it, and the power of European trading companies that monopolized trade for the mother country.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 6: Aspects of the Reformation (1517–1572)

11.   Discuss the significance of Luther’s three critical tracts of 1520 to the Reformation.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the significance
      of Luther’s three critical tracts of 1520 to the Reformation. Consequences may extend beyond the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer
      to the challenge this represented to the very foundations of Catholicism in its attacks on the
      sacraments, particularly in the second tract. Some may argue that the third tract was significant as
      it concerned Christian liberty, focused more on political life, the Catholic system and the pope
      himself. Some may argue that the three tracts focused on faith and the word of God which helped
      crystalize the demands and logic of the Reformation and their significance as a call to action that
      proposed the separation of the spiritual and political realm. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example the role of the Christian nobility in challenging the position of the pope and
      demanding a sort of egalitarian relationship between priests and the faithful, but with a focus on the
      issue in the question. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.


12.   Evaluate the role of the Peace of Augsburg in resolving religious conflict.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of the Peace of Augsburg,
      weighing up the strengths and limitations in resolving religious conflict. Candidates may refer to the
      important part it played in relieving some of the religious tension and in producing a certain level of
      tolerance. Some may argue the importance of allowing German princes to decide their religious
      affiliations in the sovereign territories and the fact that it did maintain the peace and save the Holy
      Roman Empire from serious internal conflict. Candidates may also refer to its limitations, for
      example, legalizing but not accepting all religious practices within the Protestant traditions, which
      can be considered a cause of the Thirty Years’ War. Some may argue that the Peace of Augsburg
      did not address the important issue of reparations for some of the territorial possessions or
      ecclesiastical lands of Catholics in Lutheran territories. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   “Enlightenment ideas had little impact on politics.” Discuss with reference to two of the following:
      Germany, England, Scotland, France, Spain, the Dutch Republic or Italy.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the extent to
      which Enlightenment ideas changed political activity/structures in their chosen exemplars. There
      may be discussion as to whether these ideas altered attitudes to social inequality and ultimately
      contributed to a revolution as was perhaps the case in France. In other exemplars anti-clericalism
      reduced the power and influence of the church. Arguably, Enlightenment ideas contributed to the
      emergence of an educated and prosperous middle class in many countries, who felt it was their
      right to participate in politics. Some may argue that this educated bourgeoisie meant that
      rulers/governments had to consider public opinion. The importance of scientific ideas also had
      some impact on politics, there was a growing expectation that political power should be
      implemented rationally and effectively. Some might argue that Enlightenment ideas had very
      limited impact in many states even where the ruler was interested in Enlightenment ideas, such as
      Frederick the Great in Prussia, as the political structure was unchanged. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


14.   Examine the importance of monarchical patronage to the arts.

      The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between artistic development
      and monarchical patronage. It could be argued that monarchical patronage was very important to
      the arts as it was the main means of financing artistic endeavor. The arts could be taken to include
      architecture, sculpture, painting, music, poetry, literature and even porcelain such as Sèvres and
      tapestries such as Gobelins. Responses could also highlight that monarchs supported the arts in
      order to enhance their own power. It could also be argued that aristocratic and even bourgeois
      patrons were as important as monarchical patronage. Examples of monarchs who were great
      patrons could include Louis XIV in France, where the building of Versailles supported a range of
      artistic activities (architecture, painting, sculpture); Frederick the Great’s support for music and
      poetry in Prussia; Augustus II in Saxony (Meissen china) and Goya as court painter in Spain.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 8: The French Revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   To what extent was Louis XVI responsible for the end of the monarchy in 1792?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the actions
      of Louis XVI caused the collapse of the monarchy. Some may choose to set their responses within
      the context of Louis’ reign with some discussion of the causes of the 1789 Revolution and argue
      for or against Louis’ responsibility for these problems. Some may argue that his actions during the
      constitutional period were contributory factors to the end of the monarchy. Louis reluctantly agreed
      to his power being limited by the 1791 Constitution. The flight to Varennes in June 1791 caused
      much hostility towards the monarchy. Others could argue that the radicalization of the revolution
      was caused by the financial crisis and the fear of invasion and this had little to do with Louis, who
      was virtually powerless by then. Radicalization led to the Jacobin coup of August 1792 and the
      election of the republican-dominated National Convention which made the end of the monarchy
      much more likely. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


16.   “The Revolution had a significant social and economic impact up to 1799.” To what extent do you
      agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      economy and social structure of France was affected by the Revolution. The impact could be both
      negative and positive. The economic impact was largely negative with growing inflation and the
      fluctuating value of the assignat, which collapsed in 1796. The war was costly and damaged
      manufacturing and trade (exports fell by 50%); this is directly linked to the revolution. Arguably
      there was significant social change with the end of the monarchy and feudalism. The bourgeoisie
      gained power, wealth and influence and dominated politics to a great extent. The peasantry was no
      longer restricted by feudalism and retained land gained, so a large class of small landowners was
      established. Despite the Terror and emigration (7–8%) the position of the nobility remained largely
      unchanged as they retained most of their landholdings. In the cities where the sans culottes gained
      little economically or politically, the Revolution had little permanent impact on their lives.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   To what extent were the policies of Charles X the main reason for the establishment of the July
      Monarchy?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that it was the
      policies of Charles X that led to his abdication and the establishment of the July Monarchy. Policies
      to consider could include: compensation for émigrés, the return of the Jesuits and the introduction
      of the death penalty for sacrilege; these all led to the growth of an opposition press led by Thiers.
      Polignac’s appointment as chief minister increased criticism of Charles. The July Ordinances of
      1830 (St. Cloud Ordinances) were an attempt to control the press and reduce the electorate, this
      led to increased opposition and a workers/bourgeois alliance calling for resistance to the
      reactionary policies. The regime lost control of the situation in July; Louis Philippe accepted the
      Tricolor flag and despite Charles’ abdication in favor of his grandson, Louis Philippe was
      proclaimed King of the French in August. Responses could argue that the policies were largely
      responsible for the Revolution of 1830, but that it was a middle-class revolution not a republican
      one, that wanted a moderate monarchy. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


18.   Evaluate the successes and failures of the domestic policies of Napoleon III.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of Napoleon III’s domestic policies,
      weighing up the strengths and limitations. He had promised peace, stability and economic growth.
      France experienced industrial growth and development of the railways. Improvement to financial
      credit systems (Crédit Mobilier, Crédit Foncier) encouraged investment. He pursued free trade, for
      example signing the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty, although this was not always popular. The 1850s
      were prosperous although not for the working class. There was political stability as Napoleon used
      some censorship to limit opposition, but repression was limited. Education was made compulsory
      and there was a great improvement in literacy. Napoleon also remodelled Paris with Haussmann’s
      help, some might argue that this displaced many people in working-class areas and forced rents
      up. During the Liberal Empire, opposition groups were allowed a voice and in the plebiscite of 1870
      some 7.3 million people supported the regime. Some may argue the policies were successful but
      that their impact was uneven across the population. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   “Social protest was the main reason for the repeal of the Corn Laws.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that social
      protest was the main reason for the repeal of the Corn Laws. Candidates may consider the nature
      and tactics of the Anti-Corn Law League: it was a very middle-class movement that relied on the
      press, petitions and some mass meetings to generate support. By 1845 there were 12 abolitionist
      MPs and Peel reduced some duties. Peel was convinced of the need for repeal but was worried
      about the unity of his party. The Irish potato famine caused him to bring a repeal bill to parliament
      with the support of the Cabinet, during the ensuing crisis the Conservative Party split and the bill
      was passed with Whig support. It could be argued that it was the Anti-Corn Law League with
      significant popular support that made repeal a live political issue leading to repeal. Others could
      argue it was Peel’s determination to push repeal through parliament knowing it would split the
      Conservative Party that led to the repeal of the Corn Laws. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


20.   Evaluate the impact of the Labour Party on British politics before the First World War.

      The question requires candidates to make an appraisal of the impact of the emergence of the
      Labour Party on British politics prior to 1914, weighing up the strengths and limitations. In 1900,
      the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) was formed. The LRC made an electoral pact with
      the Liberals and contributed to the Liberal landslide of 1906. The pact ensured that 29 Labour MPs
      were elected, who were able to have some influence on Liberal policies. In support of this
      argument reference could be made to the Trades Disputes Act (1906) and the Workmen’s
      Compensation Act (1906). However, some might argue that the Liberal government introduced
      reforms because they did not want to lose working-class votes to Labour and because of the need
      to improve the health and lives of the population in the national interest. It could be argued that
      after 1907 the Labour party had limited influence on Liberal reforms. In 1911, there were more than
      40 Labour MPs, however they remained the fourth party in the House of Commons with limited
      impact on politics. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   Discuss the reasons for the growth of nationalism and liberalism in the German states during the
      Vormärz period.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons for
      the growth of nationalism and liberalism in the German states during the Vormärz period. Reasons
      may predate the timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
      Candidates may refer to the growth of nationalism as a response to the earlier Napoleonic
      occupation, but that other events, in particular the Rhine crisis of 1840, contributed to nationalism.
      Some may argue that other reasons for the growth of liberalism were a reaction to the political
      structures of the individual German states themselves as obstacles for representative government
      or the support that the professional classes and intelligentsia gave to these ideas. Other relevant
      factors may be considered, such as the impact of the German confederation, the Zollverein, the
      role played by the Austrian Empire in fuelling nationalism and liberalism. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   Evaluate the contribution of Garibaldi to the unification of Italy.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of Garibaldi to the
      unification of Italy weighing up the strengths and limitations of his contributions. Candidates may
      argue that his military contributions in the numerous wars of independence, particularly the
      Sicilian/Neapolitan campaign of 1860, were significant in the process of unification but might
      evaluate the relative importance of different actions. Some may argue that his obsession with
      Rome, from the Roman Republic in 1849 to the numerous attempts to gain control of the city
      thereafter, helped highlight its importance as a symbol of a fully unified Italy. Some may argue that
      while Garibaldi’s contributions were significant the actions of Cavour and Victor Emmanuel in
      European diplomacy were a greater contribution to unification. Other relevant factors may be
      addressed, for example Cavour’s use of Garibaldi’s actions for his own goals, the decline of the
      Austrian Empire or the need for economic consolidation and administrative centralization that
      pushed Italy towards unification. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union (1855–1924)

23.   Compare and contrast the rule of Alexander II and Alexander III.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences in the
      reigns of the two tsars. Candidates may choose to examine domestic policies, the nature of their
      rule and foreign policies. The major difference was that Alexander II was a reformer and Alexander
      III a reactionary; some may argue that both were autocrats. There should be reference to
      Alexander II’s major reforms and how Alexander III reversed them to some extent. For example,
      the appointment of Land Captains by Alexander III undermined the zemstvo, he also increased
      church influence over education as well as increasing censorship. Both were keen to promote
      economic growth (emancipation of the serfs, the development of railways and the promotion of
      industrialization) and there may be some discussion as to how far this was achieved. In foreign
      policy both were concerned to recover Russian status as a great power (Russo-Turkish War,
      membership of the Dreikaiserbund) and both were keen to extend Russian influence in the
      Balkans. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.


24.   “The Bolshevik seizure of power was not based on widespread popular support.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      Bolsheviks did not have huge popular support when they seized power in Oct/Nov 1917. To agree
      with the statement there could be discussion of the extent of popular support for the Bolsheviks,
      they had majorities in the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets but only gained 25% of the vote for the
      Constituent Assembly. There may also be discussion of Lenin’s decision to seize the opportunity
      presented by the disintegration of the Provisional Government and the careful planning of Trotsky
      to ensure the Bolsheviks gained political power swiftly with the help of the Red Guards. It may be
      argued that the Bolshevik seizure of power was a political conspiracy. Some may argue that there
      was popular support to some extent; the unrest in Petrograd indicated discontent with the
      Provisional Government and the lack of resistance to the Bolsheviks showed a measure of support
      for Bolshevik actions. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported
      by appropriate evidence.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   To what extent was the decline of the Ottoman Empire the most significant long-term cause of the
      First World War?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that the decline
      of the Ottoman Empire was the most significant long-term cause of the First World War.
      Candidates may refer to the decline of the Ottoman Empire as a major reason for geopolitical
      expansion on the part of all, or nearly all, the major powers. Some may argue that the importance
      of the “Eastern Question” and the rivalry between Russia and Austria-Hungary that developed as a
      consequence of the decline of Ottoman power was a major cause of the war. These tensions were
      also fuelled by key political and economic interests in the region. Some candidates may mention
      that the political vacuum that the Ottoman Empire left, after the loss of Balkan territories in the
      Balkan Wars, had an emboldening effect on Slavic nationalism which contributed to the outbreak of
      war. Some may argue that Austria–Hungary’s annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908 angered
      the Russian Empire and increased tensions between the two major alliances. Other relevant
      factors may be addressed, for example, German imperialism and expansionism, or the general
      atmosphere of militarism linked to the arms race, but with a focus on the issue in the question.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


26.   “The strategic errors of the Central Powers were the most significant reason for their defeat in
      1918.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the strategic errors of the Central Powers were the most significant reason for their defeat in
      1918. Candidates may refer to military tactics and errors such as the Schlieffen Plan; events such
      as the battle of the Marne or Verdun; or unrestricted submarine warfare by Germany, which could
      be considered a cause of the US entry into the war and significant to their defeat. Some may argue
      that the continuation of German offensives in 1917–1918 contributed to their defeat or that the
      weakness and different power balance between the Central Powers and the Entente was a
      significant reason. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for example, the internal domestic
      challenges within the Central Powers, the crumbling of Germany’s allies or the differing levels of
      economic resources on both sides. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 14: Inter-war domestic developments in European states (1918–1939)

27.   “Hitler’s pre-war social and economic policies had popular support.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Hitler’s pre-war social and economic policies had popular support. Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of social and economic policies, or they may prioritize their assessment of one. However,
      both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the New Plan of 1933, the
      Four-Year Plan of 1936 and attempts at autarky, the extent to which these resolved economic
      depression or unemployment together with their relative popularity. Some may argue that social
      policies such as the Nuremberg Laws were largely popular but obviously not with the Jewish
      minority. Candidates may refer to opposition being present but that it was either ineffective or not
      significant in size and scope. Some may argue that the Catholic Church opposed some Nazi
      policies such as the removal of crucifixes from schools. Some policies were unpopular with youth
      groups, in particular the Edelweiss Pirates, who rejected joining the Hitler Youth. Others may argue
      that despite the various plebiscites supporting the Nazis, the nature of the Nazi state means it is
      difficult to judge the level of popular support. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


28.   To what extent were economic conditions in Spain the main cause of the Civil War in 1936?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the view that economic
      conditions in Spain were the main cause of the war in 1936. Causes may predate the timeframe
      but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to the lack
      of economic development; the asymmetrical nature of development and the north–south divide
      such as minifundios and latifundios; and the failure of the 1932 Agrarian Reform Act to effectively
      address the land question. Some candidates may argue that the poverty and inequality of the
      peasants and large rural populations were used by radical political organizations such as the CNT
      (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo) or FAI (Federación Anarquista Ibérica) to gain support. Other
      relevant factors may be considered, for example events such as the Bienio Negro or the Asturian
      Uprising, and the fear of revolution, which mobilized right-wing parties such as CEDA
      (Confederatión Espanola de Derechas Autónomas) leading to political polarization. Others may also
      argue that causes were linked to the inability of Socialist-Republican leaders such as Azaña or
      Largo Caballero to effectively address political and economic grievances; or the failure of sections
      of the Right to accept the Second Republic. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented
      clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 15: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   “The Paris peace treaties (1919–1923) caused more problems than they solved.” Discuss with
      reference to two treaties.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the Paris peace treaties (1919–1923) caused more problems than they solved. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of two treaties or they may prioritize their discussion of one. However,
      both treaties will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to the general principles and
      political considerations of the treaties that led to hostility and instability; the contradiction of the
      principle of self-determination, such as the Anschluss which was forbidden by Versailles. Some
      may argue that the problems emerged from the fact that the defeated powers were not invited to
      the negotiations in Paris or that the harshness of the various treaties in terms of war reparations or
      territorial changes became important grievances for Austria, Hungary and Germany leading to
      demands for revision of the treaties. Some may argue that security guarantees were not sufficient
      such as the failure of Versailles to safeguard France against a future German attack. Some could
      argue that the treaties did solve some problems of national self-determination such as the
      establishment of an independent Poland and the Baltic states. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions
      will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


30.   “The main aim of Russian/Soviet foreign policy in Europe between 1919 and 1941 was to promote
      collective security.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that the main aim of Russian/Soviet foreign policy in Europe between 1919 and 1941 was to
      promote collective security. Candidates may argue that the Treaty of Rapallo in 1922 and the
      Treaty of Berlin in 1926 helped resolve tensions between Germany and the USSR, advancing
      collective security in the early part of the inter-war years. Candidates may refer to individual non-
      aggression pacts (i.e. with France and Czechoslovakia) as well as the USSR’s entry into the
      League of Nations in 1934 as also promoting collective security. Some may argue that Soviet
      disillusionment with the British and French appeasement of the fascist powers affected collective
      security and altered the aims of Russian foreign policy. Other relevant factors may be addressed,
      for example the non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939; Soviet involvement in the Spanish
      Civil War and the breaking of the non-intervention pact in 1936 could be seen as not pursuing
      collective security. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   “Propaganda was not a major factor in Stalin’s maintenance of power between 1929 and 1953.”
      Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that propaganda was not a major factor in Stalin retaining power in the Soviet Union for 24 years.
      In challenging the statement some candidates may discuss the cult of personality with Stalin
      presented as Father of the People and Generalissimo during the Second World War. This
      emphasis on Stalin as a great figure who was leading the Soviet Union to prosperity, security and
      victory overshadowed other politicians thereby maintaining his dominance. In agreeing with the
      proposition, it could be argued that it was his dominance of the Communist Party and his
      willingness to use the party and the NKVD to purge potential rivals such as Kirov, the old
      Bolsheviks in the Show Trials and even war heroes such as Zhukov, that ensured his continuing in
      power. In the post-war period, Stalin was able to invoke Cold War tensions to reassert control. It
      may be argued that propaganda was a product of his power rather than a tool to maintain his
      position. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by
      appropriate evidence.

32.   Evaluate the impact of political and economic developments in post-Soviet Russia between 1991
      and 2000.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the consequences of political and
      economic change in post-Soviet Russia, weighing up the strengths and limitations. The move to
      market economics with the “shock therapy” of abandoning price controls led to rising prices,
      unemployment and homelessness. The key economic impacts were uncertainty, inflation and a
      poor standard of living for large numbers of the population. With the privatization of state
      enterprises, the oligarchs emerged and there was industrial decline because of the lack of
      investment, increasing crime and corruption. From 1993 onwards, politics became less democratic
      following the attack on the White House (the Russian Parliament building). The new constitution
      gave the presidency enormous power and limited that of the Duma. There was an element of
      democracy as parties were still functioning, but they were increasingly subject to interference from
      the state. The fact that Boris Yeltsin was able to virtually nominate his successor is an indication of
      the level of presidential power. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and
      supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   “The breakdown of the wartime alliance was the main reason for the division of Germany by 1949.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      breakdown of the wartime alliance was the main reason for the division of Germany by 1949.
      Candidates may refer to the continuous series of meetings between the major powers after 1945 in
      which major differences emerged; the initial agreement around unity of the German state breaking
      down in the Potsdam Conference; larger issues of cooperation between the occupational forces
      were never fully resolved. Some candidates may argue that the Moscow Conference of Foreign
      Ministers in 1947 showed considerable disagreement between Soviet demands for reparations and
      the Western policy of making Germany self-sufficient or the Soviet division of Berlin being directly
      linked to no final agreement around reparations. Other relevant factors may be addressed, for
      example Cold War tensions or Stalin’s desire for a buffer zone between east and west could be
      considered equally important in the division of Germany. Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will
      be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.


34.   Examine the role of the Marshall Plan in the reconstruction of France and West Germany
      (1945–1963).

      The question requires that candidates examine the interrelationship between the Marshall Plan and
      the reconstruction of France and West Germany (1945–1963). Candidates may offer equal
      coverage of France and West Germany, or they may prioritize their examination of one. However,
      the reconstruction of both countries will be a feature of the response. The plan consisted of $1.4
      billion of economic assistance for West Germany but the figure was higher for France. Some may
      argue that it sparked the industrial renewal of France as it received $2 billion in grants and was the
      second highest beneficiary of Marshall Aid. Candidates may refer to the interrelationship between
      the Marshall Plan and the political imperative of stopping the spread of communism. This was the
      case with the reconstruction of West Germany, as it was bordering the Soviet sphere of influence.
      Candidates may explore its impact regionally in catalysing economic unity in Europe by helping to
      spark the birth of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). Other relevant
      interrelationships may be considered, for example the link between aid and economic recovery as
      France began to recover even before the Marshall Plan was put in place. Candidates’ opinions or
      conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   Discuss the reasons why Tito was able to resist Soviet control of Yugoslavia.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the reasons why
      Tito was able to resist Soviet control of Yugoslavia. Candidates may argue that one reason for his
      successful resistance to Stalin’s plans for the Yugoslav economy was his development of his own
      brand of communism. He denationalized industry and put workers in control, which improved the
      economy. Some may argue Tito’s introduction of a semi Marxist system with capitalist elements
      and his internal popularity as a war hero were key factors that helped him resist Soviet control.
      Some may argue that his foreign policy initiatives and membership of the Non-Aligned Movement
      were also reasons for his successful resistance. Others may argue that the Soviet Union was
      distracted by events in the rest of the Eastern bloc and was unable to invade Yugoslavia.
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.


36.   “Walesa was the main reason for successful Polish resistance to Soviet control.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      Walesa was the main reason for successful Polish resistance to Soviet control. Candidates may
      refer to the early resistance attempts by Walesa in the 1970s, when he mobilized workers’ strikes.
      Candidates may refer to his role as founder of the Solidarity movement, which became a major
      challenge to Soviet control. Jaruzelski imposed martial law in 1981 and banned Solidarity,
      however, by 1988, Walesa was able to form the Solidarity Citizens’ Committee. This became a
      political party and won the June 1989 elections, becoming the first non-communist government in
      the Soviet bloc. Other relevant factors may be considered, for example the various resistance
      groups and many other civil organizations, such as the Church, that resisted Soviet control..
      Candidates’ opinions or conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate
      evidence.
