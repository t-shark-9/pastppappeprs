  Marks         Level descriptor



  0             The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.



                The response displays little understanding of the demands of the question. The
                response is descriptive in nature and where examples are referred to, they are
  1–2
                factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
                Terminology used is incorrect or inaccurate.


                The response displays an understanding of the demands of the question, but these
                are only partially addressed. There is some explanation, but this is not fully
  3–4           developed. Examples used are generally appropriate and relevant but do not always
                support the explanation.
                The use of relevant terminology is mostly accurate, with some inconsistencies.



                The demands of the question are met. The response contains a well-developed
  5–6           explanation, which is effectively supported by appropriate and relevant examples.
                The use of relevant terminology is accurate throughout the response.

                                              Section A
Hinduism

1.   “But he, whose intellect has no discrimination and whose mind is not under control and who is
     always unclean, does not reach that goal [moksha] and remains in samsara. But he, who knows,
     who has his mind always under control and who is clean, reaches that goal from which he is not
     born again.”
                                                        The Upanishads and Sri Sankara's commentary,
                                                     Sitarama Sastri, S., tr; Ganganatha Jha, 1898, p.52

     (a)   Identify three teachings in this passage.                                                 [3]

           •   A person who has no discrimination or knowledge remains in samsara.
           •   A person whose mind is not under control remains in samsara.
           •   A person who is unclean remains in samsara.
           •   A person who knows reaches the goal [moksha].
           •   A person whose mind is always under control reaches the goal [moksha].
           •   A person who is clean reaches that goal [moksha].
           References to not being a good enough person should be credited.
           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain why the atman (self or soul) may be condemned to samsara (cycle of life). [6]

           • Hindus believe humans are caught in samsara (cycle of life).
           • They are caught in samsara because of their actions, the result of which can be explained
             through the principle of karma; the good actions have a good fruit or consequence; bad
             actions have a bad fruit or consequence.
           • Karma means “deed” or “act” and is essentially the principle of cause and effect.
           • Karma is not fate because people have free will.
           • The atman (self or soul) acquires bad karma through bad or selfish actions.
           • In this case the atman will have an endless cycle of samsara.
           • The atman acquires good karma through good or selfless actions.
           • In this case the atman has the chance of getting nearer to or achieving moksha.
           References to the atman not being condemned to samsara should be credited.
           References to the diverse views of the significance of the atman should be credited.
           Accept other relevant answers. Marks should be allocated according to the
           markbands on page 3.

Buddhism

2.   Text removed for copyright reasons




     (a)   Identify the three paths of action that are mentioned in this passage.                   [3]

           • Guarding your speech
           • Restraining or controlling your mind
           • Restraining or controlling your body.

           Also accept “Doing no evil” and following the teachings of the wise ones. If candidates refer to
           mind and body together the two marks should be credited.

           Accept other valid points.

           Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3].

     (b)   Explain how these three paths of action relate to the Noble Eightfold Path.              [6]

           • The Noble Eightfold Path consists of: right view; right thought or intention; right
             speech; right action; right livelihood; right effort; right mindfulness; right
             concentration.
           • These can be split into three categories: wisdom; morality; meditation.
           • The three paths of action in the passage relate to morality, meditation and wise ones.
           • Guarding your speech is similar to “right speech” in the Noble Eightfold Path.
           • Restraining your mind is part of meditation in the Eightfold Path.
           • Restraining your body is part of right action.
           • Doing no evil relates to right speech, right action and right livelihood.
           • So the three paths of action are closely related to the Eightfold Path and can help
             a person reach enlightenment.
           Accept other relevant answers. Marks should be allocated according to the
           markbands on page 3.

     […] Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtain the fruits of peace.
     Twenty-four hours a day, they worship and adore You. In Your Sanctuary, with Your
     Support, they subdue [overcome] the five villains [vices].”

           • In order to realize their divine spark, they also have to cease to be manmukh (the
             follower of the ego).
           • To cease to be manmukh and suffer from the five vices, a Sikh must become
             gurmukh (one who is focused on God and lives by the teachings of the gurus).
           • The way to become gurmukh and overcome the five vices is to lead a life
             according to the teachings of the Guru Granth Sahib:
                 a. Nam japna (continual meditation on God’s name)
                 b. Kirat karna (sewa/doing good deeds; earning an honest living)
                 c. Vand chakna (sewa/to share one’s wealth with others).

             or none who have lived in accordance with Christian values.

             beautiful place where people who have lived good lives are united with their
             families and friends, where angels sit on clouds playing harps and saved souls

              • Allah is the ultimate and absolute power over all of creation.
              • Authoritative texts, such as the Qur’an, stress the importance of submitting to the
                will of Allah.
              • Attributes given to Allah show he is a king, guardian, nourisher and guide to human
                beings. Humans reflect this relationship through their acts of submission to Allah.

                the path.
              • Allah gives guidance on all practical and spiritual matters to guide Muslims through
                the path.
              • How Muslims have submitted themselves to Allah will be considered on the Day of
                Judgement.
              • Submission to Allah is the First Pillar.

           • Taking no action in Taoism means not interfering with nature or the Tao.
           • When the Tao is not interfered with, there is balance and peace in the world.
           • Yin and yang are in balance when the Tao is not interfered with.
           • When humans act, they do so in opposition to the Tao with selfish ends and so
             create conflict.
           • The best way is to live in harmony with the Tao and to take no action unless it is
             in harmony with it, and “go with the flow”.
           • Since Taoists see peace and harmony as important, “taking no action” is also
             seen as important.

Jainism

8.   “It is better to observe vows and austerities that lead to birth as a celestial [heavenly] being
     than to lead a vowless life of sensual [physical] pleasures that leads to birth as an infernal
     being.”

     “Knowing that on contact with the body even pure objects are rendered impure, and that the
     body is home to many afflictions and woes, to provide it with the objects of pleasure makes
     no sense.”
                                                                       Golden Discourse 3; 18 (adapted)

     (a)   Identify three teachings in these passages.                                                  [3]

           • If a person keeps vows and austerities this can lead to rebirth as a celestial being.
           • If a person does not keep vows and lives a life of sensual pleasure this can lead to
             rebirth as an infernal being.
           • Contact with the body makes pure objects impure.
           • The body is home to afflictions and woes.
           • It makes no sense to give the body sensual pleasures.

     (b)   Explain Jain beliefs about what causes the jiva (soul) to be weighed down within
           ajiva (the world of matter).                                                                 [6]

           • The jiva (soul) is condemned to samsara and, as a result of the collecting of
             karma, is weighed down within ajiva (the world of matter).
           • The collecting of karma results from harming living beings and indulging in
             sensual pleasures.
           • To prevent the collection of karma, a life of asceticism and non-harming is
             necessary.
           • Until all karma is worn away, the soul is weighed down in this world of matter and
             cannot move on.
