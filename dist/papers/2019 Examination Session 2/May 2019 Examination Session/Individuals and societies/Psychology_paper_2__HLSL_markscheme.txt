 Paper 2 assessment criteria

 Criterion A — Focus on the question                                                              [2]

 To understand the requirements of the question students must identify the problem or issue
 being raised by the question. Students may simply identify the problem by restating the
 question or breaking down the question. Students who go beyond this by explaining the
 problem are showing that they understand the issues or problems.

Marks       Level descriptor

 0          Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

 1          Identifies the problem/issue raised in the question.

 2          Explains the problem/issue raised in the question.



 Criterion B — Knowledge and understanding                                                        [6]

 This criterion rewards students for demonstrating their knowledge and understanding of
 specific areas of psychology. It is important to credit relevant knowledge and understanding
 that is targeted at addressing the question and explained in sufficient detail.

Marks       Level descriptor

  0         Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            The response demonstrates limited relevant knowledge and understanding.
1 to 2
            Psychological terminology is used but with errors that hamper understanding.

            The response demonstrates relevant knowledge and understanding but lacks detail.
3 to 4
            Psychological terminology is used but with errors that do not hamper understanding.

            The response demonstrates relevant, detailed knowledge and understanding.
5 to 6
            Psychological terminology is used appropriately.
                                                 –4–                M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion C — Use of research to support answer                                               [6]

Psychology is evidence based so it is expected that students will use their knowledge of
research to support their argument. There is no prescription as to which or how many pieces
of research are appropriate for their response. As such it becomes important that the
research selected is relevant and useful in supporting the response. One piece of research
that makes the points relevant to the answer is better than several pieces that repeat the
same point over and over.

Marks      Level descriptor

0          Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

           Limited relevant psychological research is used in the response.
1 to 2
           Research selected serves to repeat points already made.

           Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
3 to 4     partly explained.
           Research selected partially develops the argument.

           Relevant psychological research is used in support of the response and is
5 to 6     thoroughly explained.
           Research selected is effectively used to develop the argument.
                                                    –5–                 M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D — Critical thinking                                                                   [6]

This criterion credits students who demonstrate an inquiring and reflective attitude to their
understanding of psychology. There are a number of areas where students may
demonstrate critical thinking about the knowledge and understanding used in their responses
and the research used to support that knowledge and understanding. The areas of critical
thinking are:
• research design and methodologies
• triangulation
• assumptions and biases
• contradictory evidence or alternative theories or explanations
• areas of uncertainty.

These areas are not hierarchical and not all areas will be relevant in a response. In addition,
students could demonstrate a very limited critique of methodologies, for example, and a
well-developed evaluation of areas of uncertainty in the same response. As a result a
holistic judgement of their achievement in this criterion should be made when awarding
marks.

Marks       Level descriptor

0           Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            There is limited critical thinking and the response is mainly descriptive.
1 to 2
            Evaluation or discussion, if present, is superficial.

            The response contains critical thinking, but lacks development.
3 to 4
            Evaluation or discussion of most relevant areas is attempted but is not developed.

            The response consistently demonstrates well-developed critical thinking.
5 to 6
            Evaluation or discussion of relevant areas is consistently well developed.



Criterion E — Clarity and organization                                                            [2]

This criterion credits students for presenting their response in a clear and organized manner.
A good response would require no re-reading to understand the points made or the train of
thought underpinning the argument.

Marks       Level descriptor

0           Does not reach the standard described by the descriptors below.

            The answer demonstrates some organization and clarity, but this is not sustained
1
            throughout the response.

2           The answer demonstrates organization and clarity throughout the response.
                                                      –6–              M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Abnormal psychology

1.   Discuss validity and reliability of diagnosis.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review that
     addresses various aspects of validity and reliability of diagnosis. Although a discussion of
     both validity and reliability is required, it does not have to be evenly balanced to gain high
     marks.

     Relevant classification systems in the discussion of validity and reliability of diagnosis
     include, but are not limited to:
     • Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM)
     • Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD)
     • International Classification of Diseases (ICD).

     Examples of research that could be used include, but are not limited to:
     • Nicholls et al.’s (2000) studies of inter-rater reliability
     • Seeman’s (2007) literature review on the reliability of diagnosis
     • Wakefield et al.’s (2007) study on the validity of diagnosis
     • Silverman et al.’s (2001) study on test-retest of anxiety symptoms and diagnosis
     • Rosenhan’s studies of diagnostic validity.

     If a candidate discusses only validity or only reliability, the response should be awarded
     up to a maximum of [3] for criterion B: knowledge and understanding. All remaining
     criteria should be awarded marks according to the markbands independently, and could
     achieve up to full marks.
                                                  –7–                 M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

     • cultural norms
     • different approaches to treatment
     • cultural acceptance of treatment.


     If the candidate addresses disorders in general, rather than specific disorder(s), award up
     to a maximum of [4] for criterion B: knowledge and understanding.
                                                  –9–                 M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Developmental psychology

4.   Contrast two theories of cognitive development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the differences
     between two theories of cognitive development.

     Theories may include, but are not limited to:
     • Piaget’s (1936) theory of cognitive development
     • Vygotsky’s (1978) theory of sociocultural cognition
     • Bruner’s (1956) theory suggesting that thinking is the result of cognitive development
     • the information-processing approach to cognitive development
     • neurobiological explanations
     • Kohlberg’s (1958) theory of levels of moral development.


     Contrasting points may include, but are not limited to:
     • cultural contexts
     • gender differences and considerations
     • strengths and limits of the theories
     • empirical support and criticism of the theories
     • application of the theories.

     If the candidate provides only an implicit contrast, the response should be awarded up to
     a maximum of [2] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded
     marks according to the markbands independently, and could achieve up to full marks.

     If the candidate chooses a theory that is not specific to cognitive development (eg Bowlby,
     Erikson), award up to a maximum of [4] for criterion B: knowledge and understanding.
                                                  – 10 –              M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


5.   Discuss the role of peers and/or play in development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires the candidate to offer a considered review of the
     role of peers and/or play in development.

     Relevant studies may include but are not limited to:
     • Fagot’s (1985) study on gender-specific toys and play
     • Hughes’s (1999) study on learning social skills through role play
     • Todd et al.’s (2016) study on preferences for gender-type toys
     • Russ’s (2004) study of a child’s capacity for cognitive flexibility and creativity developed
       by role play
     • Bradley’s (1985) study on social cognitive development and toys
     • Bradbard et al.’s (1986) study of the influence of sex stereotypes on children’s
       exploration and memory
     • Albert et al.’s (2013) study on peer influences in adolescent decision-making.

     Topics for discussion may include, but are not limited to:
     • gender specific toys and clothing in gender identity development
     • the role of toys in cognitive development
     • the role of peers in modelling behaviours
     • the role of peers and play in gender role development
     • the role of peers and play in cognitive development
     • research into types of play and the effect on social development
     • the role of play in learning about co-operation and competition.

     Candidates may discuss one aspect of the role of peers or play in development in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may discuss a larger number of aspects of the role of
     peers and/or play in development in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both
     approaches are equally acceptable.
                                                – 11 –             M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   Discuss the role of attachment in development.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of the role
     of attachment in development. Candidates may address the role of attachment in
     childhood and/or in any later stage of life.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Bowlby’s research (various dates) on how maternal deprivation can affect an individual
     • Ainsworth et al.’s (1978) studies showing how different types of attachment influence a
       child’s attachment pattern
     • Van Ijzendorn and Kroonenberg’s (1988) study on how cross-cultural patterns of
       attachment influence development
     • Pratt and Norris (1994) – positive attachment in early relationships leads to positive
       reports on current social relationships
     • Hazan and Shaver (1987) – similarities between romantic love as experienced by
       adults and the characteristics of attachment
     • Rossi and Rossi (1990) – people who grew up in cohesive families tended to establish
       positive relationships with their own partners
     • Sternberg and Beall (1991) – many adults find that their relationships vary: with one
       partner, they experience an insecure bond, but with the next a secure one.

     Discussion may include, but is not limited to:
     • cultural considerations
     • the role of deprivation in attachment
     • short-term versus long-term effects in attachment
     • the type of bond can vary with different partners
     • methodological considerations of the supporting studies.

     Responses referring to research with animals, such as Harlow’s studies with rhesus
     monkeys, are relevant but must be linked to attachment in humans. Responses that do
     not explicitly make any link to human behaviour should be awarded up to a maximum of
     [2] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria should be awarded marks
     according to the markbands independently, and could achieve up to full marks.
                                                  – 12 –              M19/3/PSYCH/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Health psychology

7.   To what extent do dispositional factors and/or health beliefs affect health?

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the influence that
     dispositional factors and/or health beliefs have on health.

     The topics related to health are likely to come from one of the following (from the
     psychology guide):
     • stress
     • obesity
     • addiction
     • chronic pain
     • sexual health.

     Relevant research may include, but is not limited to:
     • Reed’s (1999) study relating to pessimism and HIV-related symptoms
     • Kearney et al.’s (2006) study of stress and the immune system
     • Weinberger et al.’s (1981) study on health beliefs and smoking behaviour
     • Polivy’s (2001) false hope theory regarding dietary goals and optimism
     • Gatchel’s (2017) study on fear avoidance belief and chronic pain
     • Chapin’s (2010) study on the role of optimistic bias in adolescent risky sexual practices
     • Festinger’s theory of cognitive dissonance in relation to health-related behaviour
     • optimism bias in relation to health behaviour.

     It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address other relevant factors in order to
     respond to the command term “to what extent”.

     Candidates could choose to discuss the extent to which dispositional factors or health
     beliefs affect one, or more than one health-related phenomena. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

     Candidates may address a small number of factors and/or health beliefs in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may address a larger number of factors and/or health
     beliefs in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally
     acceptable.

8.   Evaluate one or more studies related to explanations of one or more health problems.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires the candidate to make an appraisal of one or more
     studies related to explanations of one or more health problems by weighing up the
     strengths and limitations. The focus of the evaluation should be upon the study/studies,
     not the explanation of health problems. Although both strengths and limitations should be
     addressed, this does not have to be evenly balanced.

     The health problems are likely to come from the list in the psychology guide, namely:
     • stress
     • obesity
     • addiction
     • chronic pain
     • sexual health.

     Relevant studies include, but are not limited to:
     • Sohl and Moyer’s (2007) study on the effectiveness of the Health Belief Model
     • Dunn et al.’s (2011) study on the effectiveness of the theory of planned behaviour.

     Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
     • methodological, cultural, and gender considerations
     • contrary and supporting findings
     • applications of the research study
     • ethical concerns regarding the study
     • validity and reliability of the study.

     If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
     should be awarded marks according to the markbands independently, and could achieve
     up to full marks.

     In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, marks awarded for criterion B should refer
     to definitions of terms, theories and concepts. Overall, this includes knowledge of the
     specific topic and general knowledge and understanding related to research methods and
     ethics (for example definitions of relevant terms in research methodology or ethics in
     research).

     Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a study/studies and
     assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the question – this doesn’t
     have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still the aim or the conclusion
     should be linked to the topic of the specific question.

     Criterion D assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the
     study/studies.

9.   Discuss one or more ethical considerations related to promoting health.

     Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires the candidate to offer a considered review of
     ethical considerations related to promoting health.

     Relevant ethical considerations discussed may include, but are not limited to:
     • cultural factors affecting health promotion
     • the accuracy and validity of the research used to develop health promotion such as
       “Fear-arousal factors” that are designed to scare people into healthy behaviours
     • deception.

     Relevant studies include, but are not limited to:
     • McNeely et al.’s (2002) study on promoting school connectedness and adolescent
       health
     • Job’s (1988) study on effective and ineffective use of fear in health promotion
       programmes
     • Ruiter et al.’s (2014) review of research on fear appeal in promoting health
     • Carter et al.’s (2011) study on evidence, ethics and values in promoting health
     • Wallace and Forman’s (1998) study on religion’s role in promoting health among
       American youths.

Psychology of human relationships

10.   To what extent does the sociocultural approach contribute to the understanding of
      personal relationships?

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “to what extent” requires candidates to consider the contribution of
      sociocultural factors to the understanding of personal relationships.

      Relevant factors which may be addressed include, but are not limited to:
      • gender and cultural norms (for example, the role that culture plays in the formation and
        maintenance of relationships, violence, or perception of attractiveness)
      • proximity
      • similarity
      • reciprocity
      • modelling
      • social identity.

      Relevant studies may include, but are not limited to:
      • Buss et al.’s (1990) study of cultural factors in attraction
      • Newcomb’s (1961) field study of attitudes, similarity and liking
      • Markey and Markey’s (2007) study on romantic ideals, romantic obtainment and
        relationship experience.

      It is appropriate and useful for candidates to address biological and/or cognitive factors in
      order to address the command term “to what extent”.

      Candidates may consider a small number of sociocultural factors in order to demonstrate
      depth of knowledge, or may consider a larger number of sociocultural factors in order to
      demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

11.   Discuss origins of conflict and/or conflict resolution.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of origins
      of conflict and/or conflict resolution.

      Origins of conflict may include, but are not limited to:
      • competition
      • perceived injustice
      • misperception.

      Relevant factors related to conflict resolution may include, but are not limited to:
      • styles of conflict resolution
      • co-operation
      • negotiation
      • conflict management
      • reference made to social cognition theory and Subido methodology.

      Relevant theories/studies could include, but are not limited to:
      • Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT)
      • in-group identity model
      • dual concern model
      • Deutsch’s theory of co-operation and competition
      • Sherif’s (1966) field experiment on competition in groups
      • Chambers and De Dreu’s (2014) study on egocentrism and misunderstanding
      • Sternberg and Dobson’s (1987) study on resolution of interpersonal conflicts
      • Sternberg and Soriano’s (1984) study on styles of conflict resolution.

      Discussion may include but is not limited to:
      • the role of egocentrism
      • the effectiveness of the conflict resolution style
      • gender considerations
      • cultural considerations.

      Candidates may consider a small number of origins in order to demonstrate depth of
      knowledge, or may consider a larger number of origins in order to demonstrate breadth of
      knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

12.   Evaluate one or more studies related to promoting prosocial behaviour.

      Refer to the paper 2 assessment criteria when awarding marks.

      The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
      strengths and limitations of one or more studies related to promoting prosocial behaviour.
      Although both strengths and limitations should be addressed, it does not have to be
      evenly balanced.

      The concept of promoting prosocial behaviour refers to any method that develops
      prosocial behavior (i.e., Subido Methodology) or a more general application of a model
      investigating factors investigating prosocial behavior (i.e., Social Cognitive Theory
      suggesting the use of TV or video games).

      Relevant studies related to promoting prosocial behavior may include, but are not limited
      to:
      • Luiselli et al.’s (2005) study evaluating the effectiveness of positive behavioral
          interventions and supports
      • Elliott et al.’s (1999) study on the effects of the Responsive Classroom programme on
          students in elementary school
      • Kleemans et al. (2015) study on the impact of prosocial television news on children’s
          prosocial behaviour in the Netherlands
      • Flook et al.’s (2015) study on promoting prosocial behaviour in schoolchildren using
          mindfulness
      • Layous et al.’s (2012) study on prompting prosocial behaviour in pre-adolescents
      • Pollock’s (2014) field study done in Rwanda, concerning Subido methodology.


      Evaluation may include, but is not limited to:
      • validity/reliability of the study/studies
      • supporting and/or contradictory studies
      • productivity of the study in generating further research
      • cultural and gender considerations
      • application of the research.

      If the candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
      awarded up to a maximum of [3] for criterion D: critical thinking. All remaining criteria
      should be awarded marks according to the markbands independently, and could achieve
      up to full marks.

      In questions that ask for evaluation of studies, marks awarded for criterion B should refer
      to definitions of terms, theories and concepts. Overall, this includes knowledge of the
      specific topic and general knowledge and understanding related to research methods and
      ethics (for example definitions of relevant terms in research methodology or ethics in
      research). Marks awarded for criterion C assess the quality of the description of a
      study/studies and assess how well the student linked the findings of the study to the
      question – this doesn’t have to be very sophisticated or long for these questions but still
      the aim or the conclusion should be linked to the topic of the specific question. Criterion D
      assesses how well the student is explaining strengths and limitations of the study/studies.
