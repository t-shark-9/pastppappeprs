           Answers may include:
            definition of supply, supply curve
            diagram to show a shift in supply to the left
            explanation of two of: increases in the costs of factors of production; increases in prices of
             related goods; increased indirect taxes; other factors such as: changes in regulations,
             objectives of the business, the weather, labour disputes, etc
            examples of factors reducing supply in practice.

     (b)   Discuss the view that imposing an indirect tax on gasoline (petrol) is the most effective
           way of reducing the market failure caused by cars.                                          [15]

            examples of where a government has applied such taxes
            synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

           Discussion may include: the disadvantages of indirect tax on gasoline, such as: effects
           on the rate of inflation, equity (some stakeholders affected more than others) and the
           importance of price elasticity of demand (PED) in affecting the incidence of the tax.
           Consideration of other policies that can be used, such as: subsidies to public transport,
           subsidies for electric car producers, government providing infrastructure for the use of
           electric cars (eg charging points), advertising (eg encourage the use of public
           transport) and government regulations to reduce car use.

             pressures
            synthesis and evaluation.

           Evaluation may include: the disadvantages of using particular supply-side policies, such as:
           the impact of market-based polices on equity, not as effective with demand-pull inflation, the
           impact of interventionist policies on the government budget and the time lags associated with
           supply-side policies. The advantages of supply-side policies, such as: increased real GDP,
           increased employment, more effective with cost-push inflation and possible improvement in
           economic efficiency. Consideration of deflationary monetary and fiscal policies as alternative
           policies to reduce inflation.

4.   (a)   Explain the various phases of the business cycle.                                         [10]

           Answers may include:
            definition of business cycle
            diagram to show the different phases of the business cycle and possible trend line
            explanation of the business cycle in terms of the different short-run phases ie boom,
             recession, depression/slump and recovery, and long-term trend
            examples of specific countries being in different phases of the business cycle.

           NB Examiners should be aware of variations in the business cycle diagrams candidates
           might draw and should be flexible in crediting the diagrams drawn by candidates.

     (b)   Discuss the view that economies will always return to the full employment level of
           output in the long run.                                                                 [15]

            definition of full employment, full employment level of output
            diagrams to show the two different views of the economy

             full employment level of output in the long run
            examples of situations where economies either have or have not returned to full
             employment in the long run
            synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

           Discussion may include: consideration of the Keynesian view that an economy can remain
           stuck in a deflationary gap, consideration of the role of government, consideration of the
           word “always”.
