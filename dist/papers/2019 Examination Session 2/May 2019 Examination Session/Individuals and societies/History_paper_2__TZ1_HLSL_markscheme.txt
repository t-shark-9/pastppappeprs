Markbands for paper 2

 Marks     Level descriptor
 13–15     Responses are clearly focused, showing a high degree of awareness of the demands and implications of the
           question. Answers are well structured and effectively organized.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context, and
           there is a clear understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used effectively to
           support the analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the
           question).
           The response contains clear and coherent critical analysis. There is evaluation of different perspectives, and this
           evaluation is integrated effectively into the answer. All, or nearly all, of the main points are substantiated, and the
           response argues to a consistent conclusion.
 10–12     The demands of the question are understood and addressed. Answers are generally well structured and
           organized, although there is some repetition or lack of clarity in places.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are placed in their historical context,
           and there is some understanding of historical concepts.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant, and are used to support the
           analysis/evaluation. The response makes effective links and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response contains critical analysis, which is mainly clear and coherent. There is some awareness and
           evaluation of different perspectives. Most of the main points are substantiated and the response argues to a
           consistent conclusion.
 7–9       The response indicates an understanding of the demands of the question, but these demands are only partially
           addressed. There is an attempt to follow a structured approach.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is mostly accurate and relevant. Events are generally placed in their historical
           context.
           The examples that the candidate chooses to discuss are appropriate and relevant. The response makes links
           and/or comparisons (as appropriate to the question).
           The response moves beyond description to include some analysis or critical commentary, but this is not sustained.
 4–6       The response indicates some understanding of the demands of the question. While there may be an attempt to
           follow a structured approach, the response lacks clarity and coherence.
           Knowledge of the world history topic is demonstrated, but lacks accuracy and relevance. There is a superficial
           understanding of historical context.
           The candidate identifies specific examples to discuss, but these examples are vague or lack relevance.
           There is some limited analysis, but the response is primarily narrative/descriptive in nature rather than analytical.
 1–3       There is little understanding of the demands of the question. The answer is poorly structured or, where there is a
           recognizable essay structure, there is minimal focus on the task.
           Little knowledge of the world history topic is present.
           The candidate identifies examples to discuss, but these examples are factually incorrect, irrelevant or vague.
           The response contains little or no critical analysis. The response may consist mostly of generalizations and poorly
           substantiated assertions.
 0         Answers do not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.


Examiners are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses
given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that
the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
considered (for example, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success),
then examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
as such, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a
candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

Topic 1: Society and economy (750–1400)

1.   Evaluate the role of women in two societies, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of women in two societies.
     The two societies must be from different regions but they may or may not have been
     contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two societies, or
     they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both societies will be a feature of
     the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the
     economic role of women, for example their role as craftspeople or traders. Women in leadership
     roles may be discussed, for example Eleanor of Aquitaine or the Regent Dowager Liu Zhangxian in
     their respective regions. Alternatively, candidates may discuss women’s occupational roles or their
     role in intellectual and/or religious life. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly indicated but
     there does not need to be an equal focus on each.



2.   With reference to two societies, each from a different region, to what extent were developments in
     architecture the most significant cultural and intellectual development?

     The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that
     developments in architecture were the most significant cultural and intellectual development in two
     societies. The two societies must be from different regions but they may or may not have been
     contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may refer to developments in military, religious or
     civic architecture, the use of new materials, the influence of expanding cultures such as Islam, or
     the impact of changes in wealth and status. While other relevant factors, for example,
     developments in music, science, and art, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
     on architecture. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the suggestion, but their
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence and sound argument.
                                                 –5–                 M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 2   Causes and effects of medieval wars (750–1500)

3.   With reference to two medieval wars, each from a different region, discuss the view that long-term
     causes were more important to the outbreak of war than short-term causes.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the suggestion
     that long-term causes were more important than short-term causes to the outbreak of two medieval
     wars. The two medieval wars chosen must be from different regions but they may or may not have
     been contemporaneous with each other. Causes may predate the timeframe but they must be
     clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer equal coverage of long-term
     and short-term causes, or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both
     aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
     Candidates may refer to longstanding tension, for example over control of trade routes prior to the
     Hundred Years’ War, or over religious differences as in the case of the Crusades. While other
     relevant short-term factors, for example succession issues, resentment over policies, or personal
     flaws as in the case of Henry VI during the War of the Roses, may be referred to, the bulk of the
     response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


4.   “Religious change was the most significant effect of war.” Discuss with reference to two medieval
     wars.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of religious change
     as an effect of two wars. The two wars may or may not be from the same region and they may or
     may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The changes discussed may extend
     beyond the timeframe, but they must be clearly linked to the issues raised in the question. A
     comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of the
     Crusades on Europe and the Middle and Near East, or the Spanish conquests in the Americas.
     While other relevant factors, for example cultural, economic or political change, may be deemed
     more significant, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  –6–                 M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 3   Dynasties and rulers (750–1500)

5.   Evaluate the model and methods of government and administration used by one ruler.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the model and methods of government
     and administration used by one ruler, weighing up their strengths and limitations or otherwise.
     Candidates may offer equal coverage of the models and methods used, or they may emphasize
     their evaluation of one; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may
     refer to the model of government and the extent of the centralization of power, such as the Ming
     Dynasty in China, or otherwise, as in the case of the feudal system in Europe, or the Shogunate in
     Japan. When discussing methods of administration, candidates may refer to the establishment of
     an efficient structure, such as that of the Mongols; with the creation of a loyal army, for example,
     that of the ‘Abbasids; with the implementation of a common religion, or the introduction of a primary
     language of administration, for the example, by the Incas. Both strengths and limitations must be
     clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.



6.   With reference to two examples, to what extent did dynasties and/or rulers overcome the
     challenges they faced?

     The question requires that candidates offer a balanced review of the extent to which challenges
     were overcome. The two rulers may or may not be from the same region and they may or may not
     have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of examples
     of challenges that were overcome and those that were not, or they may emphasize their discussion
     of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
     may or may not be used. Candidates may discuss successes and failures in war, the extent to
     which internal challenges were overcome, or the impact of economic policies. They may discuss
     the patronage of education and culture, religious policy, or administrative reforms. Candidates’
     conclusions will be presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.
                                                  –7–                 M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 4   Societies in transition (1400–1700)

7.   Evaluate the role of women in two societies, each from a different region.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of women in two societies,
     referring to both societies throughout. The two societies must be from different regions but they
     may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may refer to the roles of
     female leaders such as Isabella of Castile or Elizabeth I of England, or women such as Chinese
     empresses Ma and Xiaozhuang, who supported their husbands. There may be reference to
     women’s position in the European workforce, especially in domestic service, or their legal status in
     patriarchal societies, such as China. Candidates may refer to the role of women in the slave
     system in the Americas, their role as farmers and traders in Africa, or the wide variety of roles,
     sometimes of high status, of women in Arab society. Both strengths and limitations must be clearly
     indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.



8.   With reference to two societies, each from a different region, evaluate the impact of cross-cultural
     exchange.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of cross-cultural exchange,
     which may be positive or negative. The two societies must be from different regions but they may
     or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Impact may extend beyond the
     timeframe but it must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
     equal coverage of the two societies, or they may emphasize their evaluation of one of them;
     however, both societies will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not
     be used. Candidates may refer, for example, to the social and cultural impact of the Spanish
     conquests in the Americas, the impact of Chinese pre-eminence in world trade at the beginning of
     the period or the burgeoning West African slave trade. Candidates may evaluate the impact of the
     spread of Islam in Africa, or of European settlement in North America. Both positive and negative
     effects must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal focus on each.
                                                  –8–                  M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 5    Early modern states (1450–1789)

9.    Compare and contrast the political organization of two established states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the political structures of two established states, referring to both throughout. The two states need
      not be from different regions but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each
      other. Candidates may refer to the level of centralization of governance, bureaucratic hierarchies
      and their privileges, for example in the Russian Empire or the Ming administration. They may also
      compare and contrast the limits of power and the role of counsellors and regents, for example the
      relationship between Louis XIII and Richelieu in France or Sri Sudachan in the Ayutthaya Kingdom.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.


10.   With reference to two colonial empires, evaluate the role of competition and conflict during the
      colonial race.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the role of competition and conflict
      during the colonial race. The two colonial empires may or may not be from the same region and
      they may or may not have been contemporaneous. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the
      two colonial empires, or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both
      aspects will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the competition over areas to be conquered and the conflicts over the
      delineation of the territories, for example the conflicts between Spain and Portugal in South
      America. They may refer to conflicts, for example the Chinese response after the Portuguese
      conquest of Malacca, or to wars, for example the Anglo–Spanish War or the Burmese–Siamese
      War. Both importance and limitations must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an
      equal focus on each.
                                                  –9–                   M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 6     Causes and effects of early modern wars (1500–1750)

11.   “Economic factors were the most important cause of war.” With reference to two early modern
      wars, each from a different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that the
      most important cause of early modern wars was economic factors. The two wars must be from
      different regions and they may or may not have been contemporaneous. Causes may predate the
      timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may offer
      equal coverage of both wars, or they may emphasize their assessment of one of them. A
      comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to disputes over colonies,
      competition for resources or access to labour, as economic factors, for example the Ethiopian–
      Adal War or the Spanish Conquest of the Aztec and Incan empires. While other relevant factors,
      for example political and religious aspects, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain
      on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement.

12.   To what extent did mercenaries have an impact on the outcome of two wars?

      The question requires that candidates make a balanced review of the role of mercenaries in the
      outcome of two wars, weighing up their importance or otherwise. The two wars may or may not be
      from the same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Candidates may review the impact of mercenaries in the Dutch War of Independence, and Gustav
      II Adolf’s largely mercenary army in the Thirty Years’ War. They may also review the role of
      Portuguese mercenaries in the Burmese–Siamese War (1547-1549) and Ethiopian–Adal War
      (1529–1543). It would be valid to comment on wars where mercenaries played little part, such as
      the Japanese invasion of Korea (1592–1598). While other relevant factors that affected the
      outcome of wars may be referred to, such as tactics, logistics or numerical superiority, the bulk of
      the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.
                                                  – 10 –                M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 7     Origins, development and impact of industrialization (1750–2005)

13.   Discuss the view that the production of iron and steel was the most important factor in the
      industrialization of two countries.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of the
      production of iron and steel in the industrialization of two countries. The two countries may or may
      not be from the same region and their processes of industrialization may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the importance of iron
      and steel, or they may emphasize their evaluation of one; however, both aspects will be a feature
      of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to how
      improvements in iron production allowed countries, such as the United Kingdom, to make better
      use of their resources and satisfy their own market. Developments in iron and steel also led to
      mass production, and the development of railway systems and steamships. While other relevant
      factors, for example transportation, power, mass production or communication, may be referred to,
      the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question.


14.   “The most significant effect of the growth of cities and factories was social change.” Discuss with
      reference to two countries, each chosen from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the social impact
      of the growth of cities and factories in two countries. The two countries must be from different
      regions. The growth of cities and factories may or may not have occurred at the same time.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two countries, or they may emphasize their discussion
      of one of them; however, both countries will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach
      may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the impact of cities and factories on family life,
      on public health, and on rural society (as resources may have been diverted to cities, and rural
      depopulation may have occurred). The growth of factories may have affected the nature and
      quality of housing, and the relationship between employer and employee. There may also be
      discussion of transport issues, such as congestion, and the development of suburbs.
                                                   – 11 –               M19/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Topic 8     Independence movements (1800–2000)

15.   “External factors had the most significant impact on the growth of independence movements.”
      Discuss with reference to two independence movements.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the role of
      external factors in fostering the growth of two independence movements. The two independence
      movements may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two independence movements, or
      they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both movements will be a feature of
      the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. External factors may include the
      role of foreign ideologies or foreign intervention, for example the role of the US in Cuba's
      independence, or the influence of Communism in Vietnamese independence. While other relevant
      factors, for example internal factors such as leadership, ideology, social, political and economic
      problems may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised in the
      question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

16.   “Political problems were not a significant challenge to new states in the first 10 years of
      independence.” With reference to two new states, to what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the statement that
      political problems were not a significant challenge to new states in the first ten years of
      independence. The two states may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or
      may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the
      two states or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both states will be a
      feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used. There may be
      discussion of the extent to which political stability was established after independence, and the
      ability of pre-independence movements to provide effective government once in power. The
      challenge of establishing new political structures may be considered. Candidates may agree, partly
      agree or disagree with the statement.

Topic 9    Evolution and development of democratic states (1848–2000)

17.   Compare and contrast the conditions that encouraged the demand for democratic reform in two
      states.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the conditions that encouraged the demand for democratic reform in two states. The two states
      may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. The conditions may predate the timeframe of the world history
      topic, but they must be clearly linked to the demand for reform. Candidates may refer to the role of
      the aftermath of war, as in the case of Japan after the Second World War, or political upheaval, as
      in the case of democratic states that emerged after the demise of communism. Some democracies
      emerged as their colonizers withdrew, for example, states in Africa and South America. Candidates
      may refer to the need to represent the emergent social classes in, for example, Western Europe.
      Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal
      number of each.


18.   “The development of democracy led to significant social reform.” Discuss with reference to two
      democratic states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement
      that democracy led to significant social reform in two states. The two states may be drawn from the
      same region and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. Candidates
      may offer equal coverage of the two states or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them;
      however, both states will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may refer to the role played by democratic development in educational reform,
      discussing for example how far education was extended across all racial groups in post-apartheid
      South Africa, or reforms of health services such as the National Health Service in the United
      Kingdom (where universal free healthcare was established), or Medicare in the US (a much more
      limited reform). There may be discussion of the extent of provision of welfare to the unemployed or
      the sick. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Topic 10   Authoritarian states (20th century)

19.   “The use of force was the most important method used to maintain power in authoritarian states.”
      Discuss with reference to two authoritarian states.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      The two authoritarian states may or may not be drawn from the same region and they may or may
      not have been contemporaneous with each other. A comparative approach may or may not be
      used. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two authoritarian states or they may emphasize
      their discussion of one of them; however, both authoritarian states will be a feature of the
      response. Candidates may refer to campaigns against political enemies and the use of torture,
      executions, prison and censorship, for example Mao and the Cultural Revolution, or Stalin and the
      Purges. They may also refer to the role of paramilitary forces or special police, for example Hitler
      and the Sturmabteilung (the SA) and the Gestapo. While other relevant factors, for example
      propaganda, economic and social policies, or charismatic leadership, may be referred to, the bulk
      of the response will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree
      or disagree with the statement.

20.   Compare and contrast the impact of the policies of two authoritarian states on women.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and differences between
      the impact of policies on women in two authoritarian states. The two states may or may not be from
      different regions and they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The
      impact may extend briefly beyond the timeframe of the world history topic but it must be clearly
      linked to the issue raised in the question. Candidates may refer to, for example, Castro’s
      educational policies and provision of childcare, Mao’s marriage law, Hitler’s policies towards
      female employment, or Peron’s reforms of maternity rights. Both similarities and differences must
      be clearly indicated but there does not need to be an equal number of each.

Topic 11    Causes and effects of 20th-century wars

21.   “Foreign powers did not determine the outcome of civil wars.” Discuss with reference to two civil
      wars, each from a different region.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the view that
      foreign powers did not determine the outcome of civil wars. The two civil wars must be drawn from
      different regions but they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other.
      Candidates may offer equal coverage of the two civil wars or they may emphasize their discussion
      of one of them; however, both wars will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may
      or may not be used. Candidates may discuss, for example, the roles of Germany and Italy in the
      Spanish Civil War, or the roles of the US and the USSR in the Chinese Civil War. While other
      relevant factors, for example tactics and leadership, may be referred to, the bulk of the response
      will remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates’ conclusions will be presented clearly
      and supported by appropriate evidence.


22.   Examine the effects of the peacemaking processes that followed two 20th-century wars.

      The question requires that candidates consider the effects of the peacemaking processes that
      followed two 20th-century wars. The two wars may or may not be drawn from the same region and
      they may or may not have been contemporaneous with each other. The consequences of the
      peacemaking process may extend beyond the timeframe of the world history topic but they must
      be clearly linked to the named peacemaking processes. A comparative approach may or may not
      be used. Candidates may refer to treaties that put an end to hostilities and actively pursued future
      peace, such as the Treaty of San Francisco (1951). Conversely, candidates may consider
      settlements that were later revised, such as the Treaty of Sèvres (1919), which was replaced by
      the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), or treaties that contributed to post-war instability such as the effect
      of the Treaty of Versailles on Weimar Germany. The effects of peacemaking may be political,
      territorial, economic, social, or a combination.

Topic 12   The Cold War: Superpower tensions and rivalries (20th century)

23.   To what extent did the policy of peaceful co-existence improve superpower relations up to and
      including 1964?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the suggestion that the
      policy of peaceful co-existence improved superpower relations to 1964. Consequences on
      superpower relations may extend beyond the timeframe of the world history topic but they must be
      clearly linked to the issue of peaceful co-existence. Candidates may offer equal coverage of
      improvements and deterioration in superpower relations, or they may emphasize their assessment
      of one of them; however, both aspects will be a feature of the response. Candidates may refer to
      Khrushchev’s reference to peaceful co-existence in 1956. Conversely, candidates may refer to
      Cold War crises during this period, such as Poland and Hungary (1956) or the U2 crisis in 1960
      and the war in Congo (1961), and so argue that superpower relations deteriorated. The Cuban
      Missile Crisis (1962) may be discussed as both a crisis and a relaxation of tension. Do expect
      candidates to go up to 1964 and the forced retirement of Khrushchev. While other relevant factors,
      for example the roles of Eisenhower and Kennedy, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question.
24.   “The impact of Cold War tensions was mainly economic.” Discuss with reference to two countries
      (excluding the USSR and the US).
      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the statement.
      The two countries chosen (and these must exclude the USSR and the US) may or may not be
      drawn from the same region and the periods discussed may or may not have been
      contemporaneous with each other. Candidates may offer equal coverage of the impact of Cold War
      tensions on both countries or they may emphasize their discussion of one of them; however, both
      countries will be a feature of the response. A comparative approach may or may not be used.
      Candidates may refer to the economic impact of the participation in or exclusion from aid
      programmes, for example the Marshall Plan, or the impact on commerce of trade links/limitation
      with rival countries. Candidates may also refer to internal conflicts lengthened by superpower
      involvement, such as the Vietnam War, and the associated war costs. While other relevant factors,
      for example social, political or cultural effects, may be referred to, the bulk of the response will
      remain on the issue raised in the question. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with
      the statement.
