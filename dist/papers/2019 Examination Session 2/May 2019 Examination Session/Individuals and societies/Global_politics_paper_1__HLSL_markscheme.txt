Unit 2     Human rights

Bulleted lists in this markscheme indicate likely points that candidates may include in their answer: they
are not exhaustive, and examiners should credit other valid points not listed.

Nature and evolution of human rights: Developments in human rights over time and space

1.   Identify what Source A says about the nature of human rights.                                       [3]

     Answers may include the following:
     • The cartoon shows that migrant Roma are seeking support using rights upheld by an
       intergovernmental organization (IGO), namely the EU.
     • The cartoon shows that human rights laws should be applicable to all, but in fact rights are
       not always applied or protected equally.
     • The cartoon shows that that human rights can be contested or resisted by a state and
       illustrates the “expulsion” of people.
     • The cartoon shows a tension between the rights upheld by the EU and those actually
       guaranteed by the (French) state.
     • The cartoon shows that political polls can potentially influence a government to deny
       human rights.

     Award [1] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3]. Other relevant points not listed can
     also be rewarded.
                                                –4–                M19/3/GLPOL/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   With explicit reference to Source B and to one example you have studied, suggest
     why free movement of people is viewed as important.                                          [4]

     Answers may include, but are not limited to:
     • Source B frames free movement as a human right, which enables people to live, travel
       and migrate freely.
     • Source B illustrates that free movement of people is associated with greater mixing of
       people, and with tolerance and the promotion of peace.
     • Source B shows that free movement in Europe has been regarded as an important
       economic right to promote economic growth.
     • Source B shows that movement of people in Europe is also an important political right
       which may not be dependent on capacity to work.
     • Freedom of movement may be associated with the need to flee to a state and seek
       asylum which is also increasingly important in many unstable countries and regions.

     Valid examples from own knowledge may include, but are not limited to:
     • The importance of free movement to people facing persecution within states.
     • The importance of free movement in boosting the receiving economy through travel and
       tourism, or more generally through the circulation of skilled labour and ideas.
     • Freedom of movement within and between states is associated with a globalizing
       economy and increasingly complex and interconnected world.


     Other relevant points not listed can also be rewarded. Candidates are not expected to make
     four separate points in order to achieve full marks. For each valid point a maximum of [2]
     may be awarded, up to a total of [4]. If there is no reference to another example studied
     award a maximum of [3].

3.   Compare the challenges to human rights as described in Source C and Source D.                       [8]

     Potential points of comparison:

     Challenges to rights
     • Both sources make reference to fundamental and universal rights being undermined.
     • Both sources mention that universal rights are ignored or undermined when it is
       convenient to do so to achieve other purposes. This pertains to state and non-state actors
       looking to gain power over a population or specific group of people
     • Both sources suggest that actors are not applying human rights laws. Source C suggests
       that France’s counter-terrorism action might not be rooted in, and comply with
       international law including human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. In Source D the
       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not being applied by Facebook
     • Institutions or entities that appear to exist to make people’s lives better (the state, as seen
       in Source C, or a social media platform, as seen in Source D) are willingly ignorant of, or
       not paying due regard to, human rights conventions. This conflicts with their supposed
       purpose of protecting or providing people with improved livelihoods.

     Contested rights
     • Both Source C and Source D are comments made by representatives of the United
       Nations and draw attention to the undermining of rights. Source C shows that the
       enjoyment of fundamental human rights including liberty, privacy, association, movement
       and religious freedom are potentially undermined by anti-terror legislation
     • Source D also makes the point that the universality of rights is being contested across
       much of the world. It is under broad assault from terrorists, authoritarian leaders, and
       populists and those who claim to back “traditional values”.

     If the view of only one source is discussed award a maximum of [4]. For a response which
     focuses significantly on one source with only minimal reference to the other source, award a
     maximum of [5]. For responses that discuss the sources separately, rather than in a running
     comparison, award a maximum [6]. No marks are to be awarded for points of contrast.

     Award [2] per effective point of comparison up to a maximum of [8]. For an [8] response
     expect detailed comparison but do not expect all of the points above, and allow other valid
     points.

4.   To what extent do you agree with the claim that conflict poses the greatest threat
     to the evolution of rights? Use all the sources and your own knowledge.                          [10]

     Question 4 is assessed according to the markbands that follow, in conjunction with these
     marking notes.

     Source material may include, but is not limited to:

     Source A
     • An increasingly common consequence of conflict is flight of people (ie Syria). Source A
       suggests that the EU, of which France is a member state, is not meeting the needs of
       migrants and may be ineffective in guaranteeing freedom of movement.
     • As a counterclaim Source A makes no reference to conflict, and suggests the Roma
       already experience challenges to securing their rights regardless of the context of war or
       terror. Roma are not from outside of the EU, but rather are a persecuted minority residing
       within the EU.

     Source B
     • Source B provides a counterclaim in that conflict might create rights. World War II gave
       rise to the concept of free movement and to economic and political rights associated with
       European citizenship in order to preserve peace.
     • As a further counter point, Source B shows that these rights have continued to evolve
       throughout a significant period after this major conflict.

     Source C
     • Source C illustrates how major security threats (terrorism) in France are impacting on
       existing human rights.
     • Source C states the “indisputable necessity of providing security for all citizens”, the
       implication is that security concerns can override human rights at times.
     • Source C implied that dealing with conflict (counter terrorism) in a state (France) may
       negatively impact on the rights of minorities (Muslims).
     • Source C shows that major security threats in France are also linked to a wider, ongoing
       conflict, namely the “War on Terror”.
     • As a counterclaim Source C notes that effective counter-terrorism measures and the
       protection of human rights are not conflicting goals and suggests that the state and the
       UN are committed to addressing this challenge.

     Source D
     • Source D makes reference to conflict in Libya where the UN cannot maintain a presence
       and observe or comment on the nature of rights violations. This illustrates how conflict can
       severely impact on the most universal of human rights, despite decades of progress.
     • Similarly, Source D suggests that the valuable impact of international conflict
       (World War II) on the formation of rights is diminishing with time and the very legitimacy
       of rights is being questioned.
     • In contrast, Source D refers to challenges other than conflict and makes reference to a
       basic failure by organisations to communicate rights, thus limiting their future
       development.
     • Source D also shows that large non-state actors can undermine rights in peacetime.
     • As a counterclaim, Source D refers to a range of other actors who can negatively affect
       human rights “authoritarian leaders, populists and those who claim to support “traditional
       values”.

Own knowledge may include, but is not limited to:
• As a counterclaim, states themselves are the greatest threat to rights. They may defy laws
  and weaken resolve by other states.
• Answers may refer to the blurred nature of contemporary conflict and terrorism and its
  wider societal impact on the upholding of rights – ie populist language by leaders, and a
  climate of fear, xenophobia and racism.
• Conflict hinders cooperation and may reduce equitable participation in the development of
  laws and rights.
• As a counterclaim – although conflicts are common and expose mankind’s worst
  behaviours, specific rights have evolved to prevent such collateral damage to people
  ie legislation to protect women from sexual violence or to protect refugees. Human rights
  conventions developed in response to conflict themselves limit the effect of conflict on
  rights.

If only source material or only own knowledge is used, the response can only be awarded a
maximum of [6]. To achieve the maximum [10], responses must refer to all four sources.

Do not expect all of the above, and reward other relevant points not listed.
