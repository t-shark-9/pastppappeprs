     Overview

     The World Driverless Vehicle Federation (WDVF) is a multinational, apolitical organization that
     has been set up to promote the research, development and deployment of self-driving vehicles.
     It is recognized by world bodies and governments, and represents groups from over
 5   75 countries that are interested in the development of driverless vehicles. The WDVF links
     more than five thousand members from academia and industry. Within the WDVF there are
     12 advisory committees and over 50 working groups.

     As driverless vehicles form part of a much larger socio-technical system, the WDVF is
     organized into two tiers: socio-economic and technical, see Figure 1. The advisory committees
10   work across both tiers and address the wider issues linked to driverless vehicles, whereas
     the working groups are more specialized and focus on a particular area of interest, such as
     developing sensors. Some of the working groups may be sponsored by third parties that are
     developing the technologies that will be linked to driverless cars.

     Current situation

15   A number of influential organizations have carried out research into driverless vehicles, such as
     Intel, Apple, Tesla, Google, Volvo, Toyota, Hyundai and Uber. Many countries are also striving
     to facilitate the adoption of these technologies.




                                                                                                              Turn over
                                                 –4–              M&N19/3/ITGSX/H P3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     Currently there are many technologies that provide assistance to the driver up to level 2 on the
     Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) scale, such as automated braking and speed control,
20   see Figure 2. The crucial change occurs between levels 2 and 3, where control passes from
     the driver to the vehicle. Research into vehicles at level 3 has identified a number of problems
     that seem difficult to resolve, so research and development is now mainly focusing on levels 4
     and 5.

                             Figure 2: The ﬁve levels of vehicle autonomy

                                            Level 0 - No automation
                                            Full driver control.



                                            Level 1 - Driver assistance
                                            Vehicle can assist or take over control of basic systems
                                            (such as speed control).



                                            Level 2 - Partial automation
                                            Vehicle can fully control of steering, acceleration and
                                            lane position in some situations (for example, on a
                                            freeway).

                                            Level 3 - Conditional automation
                                            Vehicle can take full control in certain situations and
                                            monitors trafic to alert the driver when they are required
                                            to take control of the vehicle.


                                            Level 4 - High automation
                                            Vehicle has full control for the duration of a trip.
                                            The driver can still override automation if required.



                                            Level 5 - Full automation
                                            Vehicle operates without human driver at all times.
                                            No driver assistance or oversight is required.

     The coordinating committee of the WDVF meets annually, and the chair of each advisory
25   committee provides a report on its current findings and proposed development plans. The most
     recent meeting, WDVL 24, was held between 3 and 8 March 2018 in San José, Costa Rica.
                                                 –5–              M&N19/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

     Technical
     Loykie Ropartz, the chair of the technical advisory committee, provided the following information
     in a brief overview of the technologies associated with driverless vehicles and the driverless
30   vehicle ecosystem:
     • Driverless vehicles are an example of ubiquitous computing.
     • Driverless vehicles are equipped with a number of sensors and control systems, depending
        on their level of autonomy. Figure 3 shows some of the sensors that may be found in a
        driverless vehicle.

35   • Driverless vehicles with full autonomy need to continuously perform a considerable number
       of activities simultaneously. For completely safe fully autonomous driving, the position of
       the driverless vehicle needs to be known to within a few centimetres and the vehicle must
       be able to determine its relationship to all the other objects in its immediate vicinity. The
       precision of the interaction of the driverless vehicle with the elements in the ecosystem will
40     be dependent on the quality of the hardware and, critically, on the processing power available
       in the driverless vehicle’s “brain”. The decision-making of the “brain” of the driverless vehicle
       needs to be faster, more accurate and less prone to error than a human brain in order to
       minimize the risk of accidents occurring.
     • A driverless vehicle can minimize the risk of accidents by:
45     ◦◦ being able to perceive the car’s immediate environment using sensors
       ◦◦ making the correct driving decisions using a rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) system
       ◦◦ having a low latency.
     • Future driverless vehicles that will operate from SAE level 2 upwards will require the
       development of reliable communication between the driverless vehicle and its environment.
50     These driverless vehicles will need to:
       ◦◦ know the car’s exact location using an accurate GPS linked to precise maps
       ◦◦ communicate with other vehicles using a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol
       ◦◦ communicate with the immediate road infrastructure using a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
           protocol.




                                                                                                  Turn over

55   Figure 4 shows the driverless vehicle ecosystem and the communications using V2V and V2I
     within the driverless vehicle ecosystem.

     It is estimated that in 2017 there were 64 million kilometres of road globally. Loykie commented
     that it would be desirable for these roads to have infrastructures suitable for driverless vehicles.

     Social
60   The social advisory committee, led by Dheepa Dev, consists of representatives from each of
     the 75 participating countries. They meet to discuss the impact of driverless vehicles in their
     countries and to consider how their societies will be affected at a national, local and individual
     level. The committee members are excited about the opportunities that driverless vehicles can
     bring to their countries.

65   With many countries having aging populations, improved transportation for those unable to
     drive will bring many benefits, leading to a significant increase in quality of life. Safer roads, due
     to a reduction in the number of accidents, will be advantageous for their struggling healthcare
     services.

     There may be other benefits to citizens. Commuters can make more effective use of their
70   journeys to and from work, carpooling may flourish and cars can be used 24 hours a day.

     Ethical
     Diane Kreps, the chair of the ethical advisory committee, wants to ensure that the design of
     driverless cars is based on sound ethical principles. Diane’s group is investigating the ethical
     decision-making that will occur when a driverless vehicle encounters a potentially hazardous
75   situation. She has been advised that there are a variety of ethical decision frameworks that
     could be adopted, which may affect the rules that driverless cars follow or the rate at which
     higher levels of automation can be introduced. The question about who may be accountable if
     an accident occurs has already involved many lengthy discussions.
                                                 –7–           M&N19/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Economic
 80   The initial prototyping of driverless vehicles has taken place in a number of economically
      developed countries. In these countries, the initial research has been carried out by
      multinational companies that are able to absorb these costs. The economic advisory committee,
      led by Carlos Piqué, is investigating the feasibility of introducing driverless vehicles into
      countries that have not been able to participate in the early research. There may be significant
 85   economic benefits for less economically developed countries.

      Environmental
      The environmental advisory committee discussed the potential for more efficient use of vehicles
      and of having fewer vehicles on the road. Members thought these changes could lead to many
      benefits for communities, such as less pollution, less congestion and more society-oriented use
 90   of land and buildings.

      Route-finding software installed in the driverless vehicles will ensure that the most
      environmentally friendly route is chosen. This will aim to route the driverless vehicles to where
      a constant speed can be maintained and congestion can be avoided. Carole Rossignol, the
      president of WDVF, has suggested that investigation into route-finding software should be
 95   outsourced to third parties and should not be part of the task of the WDVF.

      Legal
      Carole is keen for governments to develop legislation addressing the liability issues that would
      result when driverless cars on public roads are involved in accidents. Currently, the introduction
      of legislation is very piecemeal, with some countries or states having limited legislation in place,
100   while others have very little or none. Differences in the level of legislation between countries
      or states would hinder the introduction of driverless vehicles. There are differences between
      highway codes, driving license regulations, insurance requirements and road safety education
      in each country. The committee realizes the complexity of harmonizing the legal practices of so
      many countries.

105   Political
      It is critical for organizations and lobby groups to engage with politicians and law-makers as
      driverless vehicles evolve, especially during the transition stage, which will necessarily involve
      cooperation between all stakeholder groups.

      Challenges faced

110   The coordinating committee of WDVF has concluded that the introduction of driverless vehicles
      provides many opportunities, but there are a number of potential obstacles to overcome.

      Ethical challenges
      Diane Kreps reported that:
      • the ethical decision-making framework used by driverless cars needs to address the potential
115      for human and environmental harm
      • implementing ethical decision-making frameworks in a driverless car will be problematic
      • different countries may have different perceptions of what is ethical
      • unanimity about exactly what constitutes an ethical decision is rare.




                                                                                                Turn over
                                                         –8–               M&N19/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Social challenges
120   Dheepa Dev reported that:
      • there is concern about the extent to which the population will trust and use driverless vehicles
        at different levels of the SAE scale
      • many societies and infrastructures are built around car culture, and this may radically change
        with a shift to driverless cars.

125   Economic challenges
      Carlos Piqué reported that:
      • level 5 driverless cars are designed to drive along all types of roads, and governments would
        like to have infrastructure added to as many roads as possible to facilitate the introduction
        of driverless vehicles at earlier stages of the SAE scale. This will include locations beyond
130     urban areas and freeways. There is concern that upgrading existing roads will incur
        significant infrastructure costs
      • driverless vehicles should be affordable. The economic advisory committee is liaising with
        governments over possible strategies to encourage the adoption of driverless vehicles
      • the increasing amount of potentially expensive software could need constant upgrading.
135     This could lead to significantly increased costs for a range of stakeholders
      • the introduction of driverless vehicles may lead to changing patterns of employment
      • the development of driverless vehicles and their infrastructure must be appropriate to the
        local circumstances of each country.

      Legal challenges
140   Carole Rossignol reported that:
      • there will need to be a framework for determining accountability if a driverless vehicle is
        involved in an accident
      • currently each country or state has its own laws for the use of vehicles. Will it be necessary,
        or possible, to harmonize the laws on the use of driverless vehicles between countries?
145   • regulations determining safety standards in driverless vehicles will need to be produced,
        such as the use of seat belts and the physical layout of the driver/occupant space.

      Carole concluded that the coordinating committee is concerned about whether large
      multinational companies and politicians will be able to work together to overcome the difficulties
      at local, national and international levels.
