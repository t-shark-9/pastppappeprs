Critical Thinking – explanation, analysis and evaluation

These trigger words often signal critical thinking. The bold words are the key terms in the various
criteria.
Explanation – Because, as a result of, due to, therefore, consequently, for example
Analysis – Furthermore, additionally, however, but, conversely, likewise, in addition, on the other hand,
whereas
Evaluation ‫ –ؘ‬My opinion, overall, although, despite, on balance, weighing up

Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

If candidates answer more than the prescribed number of questions:

• In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
  Disregard incorrect answers.

• In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts eg “describe two kinds”,
  mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions, one description and
  one identification, or two identifications.

• In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations eg “explain
  two reasons”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two full explanations,
  one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

1.   (a)   Information is communicated between a driverless vehicle and the road infrastructure.

           (i)    Identify one piece of information communicated from the driverless vehicle to the
                  road infrastructure.                                                                    [1]

                  Answers may include:
                  • speed of car
                  • information about the car e.g. size, car specifications
                  • exact location of car
                  • route information.

                  Do not accept - distance between the vehicle and object/infrastructure.

                  Award [1] for identifying a piece of information that could be communicated from
                  a driverless vehicle to the road infrastructure.

           (ii)   Identify one piece of information communicated from the road infrastructure to
                  the driverless vehicle.                                                                 [1]

                  Answers may include:

                  From road infrastructure to driverless vehicle (pushes out a signal that informs
                  the car of):
                  • information about traffic e.g. congestion
                  • road conditions ahead e.g. colour of traffic lights, lane markings, road signs
                  • construction zones
                  • parking availability
                  • variable speed limits
                  • breakdown/accident ahead
                  • toll booths.

                  Do not accept - weather conditions as this is not explicitly linked to the conditions
                  of the road.

                  Note to examiners:
                  Road infrastructure is defined broadly and includes not only physical objects near
                  or on the road but digital communications equipment used to communicate to and
                  from a central traffic monitoring centre, and other possible communication
                  devices. But excluding vehicle to vehicle communications as infrastructure is
                  deemed as being static and permanent.

                  Award [1] for identifying a piece of information communicated from the road
                  infrastructure to the driverless vehicle.

(b)   Outline one economic advantage of the introduction of autonomous vehicles.                 [2]

      Answers may include:
      • cars can be used during the day and night
      • which leads to a more productive use of the car

      • car-pooling is made easier
      • so no need to buy a car / savings on cost of car and running of car

      • the best route for can be used
      • which saves fuel due to shorter route / less congestion

      • driverless cars will lead to fewer accidents
      • saving money on medical expenses, hospitals and possible reduced insurance costs

      • cars can be used 24 hours a day
      • so less need to build car parks and garages

      • increased productivity
      • as people can work in the car / less road congestion due to fewer cars on the roads

      • public transport/taxis/delivery trucks may not use human drivers
      • long term cost savings as salaries do not need paying, reductions in costs lead to
        higher profits or reduced prices for customers

      • attracts Investors
      • introduction of countries producing autonomous vehicles– may attract foreign
        investment and improve on country’s GDP.

      Do not accept - countries having invested in autonomous vehicle research and
      development saves costs for other countries will do not need to invest in this research.

      Economic gain from the sale of (internally or exported) autonomous cars (not linked to
      the use of the autonomous vehicle).

      Notes to examiners:
      Economic is defined as less cost, financial benefits or greater productivity due to time
      saving and more effective use of time. Economic benefit must not be general, e.g.
      greater productivity, as it must be linked to the use of autonomous vehicles.

      Award [1] for identifying each economic advantage of the introduction of autonomous
      vehicles and [1] for the development of the economic advantage identified up to a
      maximum of [2].

2.   Explain the function of both GPS and LIDAR in a fully autonomous vehicle at level 5 of
     the SAE scale.                                                                                          [6]

     Answers may include:

     GPS
     • identification of function – provide accurate position of the car
     • explanation / development of that function
        o position is identified so that it can be located on the in-built maps
        o position is identified so that it can communicate its location to other vehicles and road
            infrastructure, including a central location
        o GPS guides the vehicle to the destination
        o the GPS receiver in the car will use three or more satellite signals to triangulate and
            hence to locate the position of the car
     • further development of that function related to level 5 – level 5 vehicles autonomous cars
       need to know their location so that they can use the in-built maps and other information to
       steer the car safely without the need for the occupant to take action.

     Award [1] for identifying the function/role of GPS, [1] if function/operation is described in the
     context of a car and [1] if its function is linked to its role in a fully autonomous vehicle at level
     5 of the SAE scale up to a maximum of [3].

     Without reference to the autonomous nature of the car maximum [2] marks.

     LIDAR
     • identification of function – to provide data about the location, size and movement of
        objects that surround the car
     • explanation / development of that function
         o LIDAR (Light Imaging, Detection And Ranging), short and long-range radar, that will
             provide 360-degree “vision” and the ability to determine the precise distance to the
             objects it “sees”
         o uses the pulse from a laser to collect measurements which can then be used to
             create 3D models and maps of objects and environments
         o it could create a 3D image/map of the car’s surroundings, enabling it to better able to
             more easily calculate a path to avoid objects
         o LIDAR has beams tht point high enough to detect tall objects, road signs as well as
             navigating up and down slopes
         o LIDAR can measure the speed and distance of another object
     • further development of that function related to level 5 – the information about the location
        and nature of objects outside the car is required so that the autonomous car can avoid
        colliding with them without the need for the occupants to take action.

     Note to examiners:
     Different technologies include: Sound waves (Sonar or Ultrasonic), Electromagnetic waves
     (Radar), light rays/non-visible laser beam (LIDAR)

     Award [1] for identifying the function/role of LIDAR, [1] if function/operation is described in
     the context of a car and [1] if its function is linked to its role in a fully autonomous vehicle at
     level 5 of the SAE scale up to a maximum of [3].

     Without reference to the autonomous nature of the car up to a maximum of [2].

     Mark as [3] + [3].

3.   Discuss whether it will be possible to develop an ethical framework that could be used for
     driverless cars in a number of different countries, such as China, India, USA and Germany.          [8]

     Answers may include:

     Reasons that it would be possible to develop
     • a rule based ethical framework such as Deontology/Markkula (Santa Clara) ethical
       decision making will work in all countries:
        road rules have largely been standardised across the world
        countries largely agree that the priority of human life above damage to buildings and
           other objects
     • the brain of the driverless car would be programmed to anticipate problems a long way
       ahead and stop if it senses that its rules would not cope with the situation, hence by-
       passing the lack of rules
     • if the law courts agreed on blame/liability for accidents if there is a sudden situation like a
       child coming out from behind a car the driverless car would be able to react faster than a
       human; but if not, it should be treated as an “accident” with no blame to the car as
       happens now
     • If the driverless cars had the feature to transfer control when conditions of public roads did
       not meet the standards required for autonomous cars e.g. out in the country of a less
       economically developed country where there are rough tracks and often unsealed roads.
       Again, by-passing the problem of developing a set of universal rules for all situations
     • consequence based rule framework (such as Consequentialism):
        a simple rule that in the case of human life being in danger no matter what happens the
           lesser damage to human life is the choice. However, this is a calculation of the “lesser
           of
           two evils” that humans do not cope with well either.
     Reasons that it would not be possible to develop as the one set of rules would not be
     applicable to all countries
     • working at the macro/intranational level it may be possible to write a set of overarching
       principles, but these overarching principles may be no more than very general statements
       such as “the driverless car should not cause harm”. These may be effectively meaningless
     • Deontology focuses on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves which may be
       based on indigenous knowledge of that country, trying to change this for countries to be
       aligned would be very difficult
     • there are too many exceptions for each country, for example:
        road rules in all countries (ie working at the macro level), and even cities, have
           variations to suit eg at a roundabout, unusual turning rules, unusual right of way rules
           at intersections, that are based on historical circumstances. There is no way that all of
           them could be included in a driverless car at the micro level
        in some countries it may be culturally significant to not harm animals due to religious
           reasons or cultural priorities to farm animals
        in some countries the priority could always be set to pedestrian and the driver would
           always be to blame if something happened
     • consequence based rule framework:
        the many different practical situations may not able to be included in the rules
           programmed into the brain of the driverless car
        and the brain of the computer would have problems working out all the consequences
           and balancing them out.
                                             –8–                  M19/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Example Evaluative Comments
In effect, you would get the worst of both worlds. The macro approach would be too generic
and the micro approach would create such a long list of criteria that have to be met, the
driverless vehicle would not be able to go above 4 mph. In effect it would not add utility and
the proposed venture would fail.

Overall, the rules and situations are generally very common in all countries. The brain could
be programmed with these standard set of rules that would cover agreed international road
rules and have an add-on pack that can be downloaded for each country. This is the same
as a human driver needing to learn the rules of a country when driving a car there. Also, the
best way is not to try to develop a universal framework, but for each country to have rules
that limit the use of driverless vehicles to situations where its brain can cope.

Expecting the driverless car to be able to overcome all the problems humans have is
unrealistic given the state of the technology, as it is unrealistic to expect humans to be able
to cope all the time.

Note to examiners:
The two main ethical systems that can be used in driverless cars are rules based and
consequence-based system. Virtuous ethical systems are unlikely to be applicable as the
values included would need to be programmed as a rules system which is very difficult to do
due to the impreciseness of the definitions of virtuous behaviour, which are probably more
varied than the differences in road rules across a range of countries.

Utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism with the most ethical choice being the one that
will produce the greatest good for the greatest number. Utilitarianism is a theory in
philosophy about right and wrong actions. It says that the morally best action is the one that
makes the most overall happiness or "utility" (usefulness).

4.   A government has decided to allow fully autonomous cars to operate on its roads despite the
     concern of some citizens that not all of the potential problems have been resolved.

     Evaluate the decision of this government to allow fully autonomous cars to operate on
     its roads.                                                                                       [12]

     Answers may include:

     Some reasons to ALLOW fully autonomous vehicles to operate on public roads
     • Technical - the roads would have infrastructure that would allow the car to be aware of
       other vehicles and items near or on the road. The public roads would have information
       communicated to it about the conditions of the road and traffic ahead. The candidate may
       specify a range of infrastructure that could be involved
     • Technical/ethical -fail-safe mechanisms have been put in place if the driverless car itself
       has problems or the infrastructure is damaged or malfunctions.
     • Legal - the road laws have been modified to take into account the way driverless car
       operates
     • Legal - the insurance issues related to the accountability of the driverless car in case of
       accidents have been solved
     • Legal - the legal liability of the occupants, owners, developers, etc of driverless car have
       been solved
     • Technical/ethical - fail-safe mechanisms have been put in place if the driverless car itself
       has problems or the infrastructure is damaged or malfunctions
     • Ethical - the role of the occupants in controlling the vehicle in emergencies and hazardous
       situations have been solved
     • Economic - the use of the driverless car will provide economic benefits such as car
       sharing, less parking facilities, etc
     • Economic – potential cheaper public transport to efficiently transport citizens around the
       country
     • Economic – impact on jobs required for autonomous cars/infrastructure
       development/maintenance and manufacturer
     • Technical/phycological - the brain of the driverless car has been trained to make “ethical”
       decisions when hazards appear, and these have been accepted by the public
     • fail-safe mechanisms have been put in place if the driverless car itself has problems or the
       infrastructure is damaged or malfunctions
     • Social- provides a greater range of transport for those who can no longer drive e.g.
       elderly, disabled – improves the well-being of a country's citizens.
     • Government may benefit from the tracking/surveillance advantages from having access to
       autonomous vehicle/infrastructure information e.g. help in tracking criminals,stolen cars
     • Environmental – less pollution as autonomous cars may be electric and/or use of
       carpooling/reduced congestion.

     Some reasons to NOT ALLOW fully autonomous vehicles to operate on public roads
     (usually, a contrast pair to the above)
     • Technological - some public roads might have features that the driverless car is not
        capable of understanding and responding too, e.g. on a country road with no edges
     • Technological/financial - not enough infrastructure has been put in place to facilitate the
        use of driverless cars
     • Technical - not all vehicles on the road would have the ability to communicate with the
        driverless car
     • Technical - the brain of the driverless car may not be trained enough to handle all the
        many circumstances that can happen on a public road

• Technical – the security of data transmission between cars and infrastructure has not
  been fully tested or is not robust – leading to potential threats while driving
• Legal - the legal liability, insurance and accountability laws and regulations have not been
  fully worked out
• Psychological – the public and the citizens are not emotionally ready/do not trust to be
  using or driving alongside driverless cars.

Note to examiners:
The reasons to allow fully autonomous vehicles on public roads need to be related to legal,
economic, technological, financial, psychological and ethical problems that could be handled
by the driverless car on a public road, and vice versa for reasons to not allow the driverless
car to be on public roads. The candidate may pair the individual positives and negatives as a
contrast or put them into two groups which may not match identically. The difference would
be accounted for in the conclusion. As this is a government decision, candidates should
develop their arguments based on the impact at a community or country level.
