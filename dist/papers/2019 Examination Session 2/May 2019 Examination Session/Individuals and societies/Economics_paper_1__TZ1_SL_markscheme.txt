Microeconomics

1.   (a)   Explain the concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus.                       [10]

           Answers may include:
            definition of consumer surplus, producer surplus
            diagram to show consumer surplus and producer surplus
            explanation that consumer surplus is above equilibrium price and below the
             demand curve, and that producer surplus is below equilibrium price and above
             the supply curve
            examples of consumer surplus and producer surplus.

     (b)   Examine the view that the best allocation of resources, from society’s point of view,
           occurs where the marginal private benefit equals the marginal private cost.             [15]

           Answers may include:

           demerit goods, asymmetric information.

     (b)   Evaluate the view that the most effective way in which the government can encourage

             particular economy
            synthesis and evaluation (to what extent?).

           Evaluation may include: inappropriateness of using policies to increase AD against
           structural, frictional and seasonal unemployment, consideration of the use of supply-
           side policies to tackle structural, frictional and seasonal unemployment, consideration
           of the use of monetary policy, problems associated with the use of expansionary fiscal
           policy, consideration of the words “best”.

           NB where no alternative policies are considered a maximum of Level 3
           should be awarded.

4.   (a)   Explain the role of improved productivity in achieving economic growth.                   [10]

           Answers may include:
            definition of productivity, improved productivity, economic growth
            diagram to show a shift of short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) to the right
             and/or long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) to the right or use of a production
             possibility diagram
            explanation that improved productivity will reduce unit costs of production in the SR
             and shift the SRAS to the right, leading to an increase in gross domestic product
             (GDP) and short-run economic growth; and/or an explanation that improved
             productivity will increase the productive capacity of the economy in the LR,
             thus shifting LRAS to the right and causing long-run economic growth
            examples of improved productivity in relation to a particular economy.

           NB if no explicit and precise understanding of productivity is demonstrated,
           a maximum of Level 2 should be awarded.

(b)   Discuss the view that economic growth can only be achieved at the expense of other
      macroeconomic objectives such as a low and stable rate of inflation and equity in the
      distribution of income.                                                                 [15]

      Answers may include:
       definition of economic growth, inflation, low and stable inflation, equity in the
        distribution of income
       diagram to show growth through either an increase in aggregate demand (AD) or a
        shift of LRAS to the right, or any other relevant diagram
       explanation of how economic growth might conflict with other macroeconomic
        objectives, such as low and stable prices and a more equitable distribution of
        income and/or low unemployment, a satisfactory balance of payments (external
        balance) and environmental objectives
       examples of instances where growth has improved or worsened one or more of the
        above macroeconomic objectives
       synthesis and evaluation (discuss).

      Discussion may include: circumstances in which growth might positively impact on
      price stability and the distribution of income and/or unemployment and the balance of
      payments, the different impacts of short term and long-term growth, consideration of
      the word “only”.

      NB At least two macroeconomic objectives need to be considered. Where only one is
      considered, without any evaluation, a maximum of Level 2 should be awarded. Where
      only one is considered, with evaluation, a maximum of Level 3 should be awarded.
      Thus, Level 4 requires two objectives and some evaluation.
