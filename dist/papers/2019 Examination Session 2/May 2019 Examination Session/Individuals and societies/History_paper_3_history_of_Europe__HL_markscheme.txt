Apply the markbands that provide the “best fit” to the responses given and award credit
wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer indicates that the demands of the question
are understood and addressed but that not all implications are considered (for example,
compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners
should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme.
Responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.
If you are uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact
your team leader.

Section 1: Monarchies in England and France (1066-1223)

1.   “The Norman invasion introduced many changes to the government and administration
     of England.” Discuss.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
     statement. There may be some comparison of Anglo–Saxon and Norman rule linked to
     the notion of change in the question. The Norman system was based on the Anglo–
     Saxon counties and Hundreds and directed from the centre as had been the case in
     pre-Norman England. The greatest changes were in personnel with all the earls and
     officials of the royal household being Norman by the end of William’s reign. Latin
     became the official administrative language. There may be reference to the Domesday
     Book, which was designed to record land tenure in order to improve tax gathering but
     was not a significant change and was written at the end of William’s reign. Other
     relevant factors such as castle building and the feudal system may be discussed as
     factors contributing to government and administration.


2.   Examine the role of Philip II in gaining Normandy for the French Crown.

     The question requires that candidates consider how, and how far, Philip II was
     responsible for the French gaining control of Normandy by 1204. Candidates may
     examine the relationship between the Dukes of Normandy and the French throne, for
     example while the Dukes of Normandy paid homage to the kings of France, they were
     largely independent. During Richard I of England’s absence Philip seized some
     Norman territories. However, Philip was unable to defeat Richard and was seeking a
     truce when Richard died. Candidates may point out that at this point Phillip was largely
     unsuccessful, John’s succession was acknowledged and the English were firmly in
     control. John’s marriage to Isabella of Angoulême caused problems, and his treatment
     of Norman nobles and maladministration of the Duchy led to increased support for
     Philip. By 1204, Philip controlled most of the Angevin Empire. John struggled without
     success to regain his power and was defeated at Bouvines in 1214. Some may argue
     that Philip’s determination led to success, others that John’s mistakes were the most
     significant factor.

Section 2: Muslims and Jews in medieval Europe (1095–1492)

3.   Discuss the reasons for the fear of Muslim power in medieval Europe.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
     reasons why Muslim power was feared in medieval Europe. Reasons may predate the
     timeframe but they must be clearly linked to the issue raised in the question.
     Candidates may refer to the sense of cultural insecurity that resulted from Muslim
     expansion into Christian territories, and note that it coincided with the decline of the
     Byzantine Empire. The rising power of the Ottoman Empire, as a rival to medieval
     European states, and repercussions from the Crusades may also be considered.
     Institutions such as the Papacy feared losing political power as a consequence of
     rising Muslim power. The influence of Islamic culture and civilization on medieval
     Europe that clashed with Christianity and contributed to the ever-growing distrust of
     Islam as a religion are also possible examples.


4.   Discuss the effects of the persecution of the Jews in medieval Europe.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of
     changes that occurred in medieval Europe as a result of the persecution of the Jews.
     Candidates may refer to the Jews’ integral role within societies, despite religious
     differences, prior to persecution, and candidates may refer to the economic role played
     by Jews. The resultant destruction of Jewish communities due to their expulsion from
     various European cities may be considered, along with the impact of anti-Semitic laws
     against Jews and their customs, such as “blood libels”, which, in some cases, led to
     higher taxation and restrictions imposed on worship. Forced—or willing—conversions
     to Christianity across Europe during pogroms or periods of severe persecution may
     also be referred to. Further effects of persecution meant that many Jews fled en-
     masse to newly formed Slavic states and Poland for refuge. There they acquired
     prosperity and practised their religion.
                                                   –7–     M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 3: Late medieval political crises (1300–1487)

5.   Discuss the reasons for the fall of ducal Burgundy.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
     reasons for the fall of ducal Burgundy. Candidates will focus on the death of Charles
     the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477. After this event, Louis XI annexed much of
     Burgundy to the French Crown. Charles the Bold’s daughter, Mary was married to
     Maximilian I of Austria and as a result, the northern Burgundian territories came under
     Habsburg rule. Some candidates may argue that Charles the Bold pursued too
     aggressive a policy in trying to annex Lorraine to link the northern and southern
     regions of Burgundy and that he alienated some potential supporters. Others may
     stress the difficulty of the Burgundian position in the late 15th century, situated as it
     was between Habsburg domains to the east, and the growing power of Louis XI’s
     France to the west. Candidates may stress the abilities of the opponents of Burgundy
     in this period, especially those of Louis XI.


6.   Evaluate the causes of the Wars of the Roses.

     The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the causes of the Wars of
      the Roses, weighing up the importance of different reasons. These reasons could be
      divided into long- and short-term. For long-term causes, candidates could refer to the
      dynastic rivalry caused by the overthrow of Richard II in 1399, giving a justification for
      the Yorkist rebellion against Henry VI in later years. Candidates may discuss the role
      of bastard feudalism and the importance of overmighty subjects such as the Earl of
      Warwick. For short-term causes, candidates may refer to the weakness of Henry VI
      and the unpopularity of his advisers; especially after English military defeats in
      France, for example Castillon in 1453. Candidates may argue that the events of the
      Coventry Parliament of 1459, when attainders were issued against leading Yorkists,
      gave them little alternative but to rebel.
                                                 – 8 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 4: The Renaissance (c1400–1600)

7.   Compare and contrast the forms of government in Milan and Florence.

     The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and
     differences between the forms of government in Milan and Florence, referring to both
     throughout. Candidates may refer to types of Renaissance characteristics that were
     present in the governments, such as republicanism, individualism and humanism.
     Florence was a republic, with a constitution that limited the power of any one social
     group, and ensured that no one person or group could have complete political control.
     Political power resided in the hands of middle-class merchants, a few wealthy families
     and the guilds. Some may argue that the Medici family had nearly as much power as a
     monarch. Milan was a military state and government became hereditary under a
     succession of powerful Sforza dukes. Attempts to install a republic proved
     unsuccessful. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does
     not need to be an equal number of each.


8.   Examine the reasons for the spread of the Renaissance in one European country
     excluding Italy, Burgundy and Germany.

     The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
     reasons for the spread of the Renaissance in one European country excluding Italy,
     Burgundy and Germany. Reasons may include that travel across the continent
     became safer after the end of the Hundred Years’ War. There was relative peace in
     northern Europe in the late-15th century resulting in an increase of trade across the
     continent and the spread of humanist ideas. The decline of feudalism allowed people
     more freedom to explore changes in society and new ideas in arts, sciences, and
     philosophy. Invasions into the Italian peninsula exposed European rulers to
     Renaissance perspectives and they borrowed ideas from Italy as they looked for ways
     to increase the sophistication of their courts.
                                                       – 9 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


    Section 5: The Age of Exploration and its impact (1400–1550)

    9.    Discuss the significance of Henry the Navigator as an enabler in the Age of
          Exploration.

          The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
          significance of Henry the Navigator as an enabler in the Age of Exploration.
          Candidates may refer to his importance as a key figure in 15th century Portuguese
          politics and to his sponsorship of exploratory sea voyages. He has been viewed as a
          main initiator of the Age of Discoveries, as well as a founder of the Atlantic slave trade.
          Henry the Navigator was responsible for the early development of Portuguese
          exploration and maritime trade with other continents and, under his sponsorship, the
          Portuguese circumvented the Muslim land-based trade routes across the western
          Sahara, eventually leading to the first private mercantile expeditions. His expeditions
          also explored the coast of Africa, most of which was unknown to Europeans at that
          time. Under his direction, the caravel was developed, and he is also credited with
          furthering knowledge of geography, mapmaking and navigation through his school.


    10.   “The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) was of limited significance.” Discuss.

          The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
          statement. Candidates may refer to the treaty’s importance in dividing Latin America,
          as well as establishing Spain’s position in the western Pacific until 1898. It also
          established boundaries in the New World for the quarreling European powers. The
          treaty also ensured Portugal and Spain could exploit their allocated parts of the globe
          without interfering with each other. A significant impact of the treaty was the precedent
          it set in dealing with local indigenous peoples of colonized lands. However, the treaty
          quickly became obsolete in North America, Asia and Africa, affecting colonization, and
          it was ignored by European nations. Other powers and affected peoples were
          confused by the treaty’s unclear lines of demarcation. Candidates may agree, partly
          agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 6: The Reformation (1517–1572)

11.   Discuss the reasons for the Peace of Augsburg (1555).

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      reasons for the Peace of Augsburg in 1555. The Peace of Augsburg allowed rulers in
      Germany to choose either the Catholic church or Lutheranism for their domains.
      Residents who dissented from their rulers’ choice could emigrate. Candidates could
      refer to the fact that there had been prolonged warfare between Catholics and
      Protestants from 1546. In spite of military success at Mühlberg in 1547, Charles V
      found Protestantism difficult to eradicate. Attempts to codify religious practice, such as
      the Augsburg or Leipzig Interims, failed to gain the support of German Protestants.
      Diplomatically, Charles V faced renewed challenges in the early 1550s. The League of
      Torgau of German Lutheran Princes meant that Elector Maurice of Saxony had
      abandoned Charles V. From 1552, Henri IV of France assisted the League against
      Charles V. In addition, Charles V faced attack from the Ottoman Empire. For both the
      Catholic and the Protestant sides, the Peace of Augsburg was a welcome end to
      conflict.


12.   Evaluate the impact of Protestant ideas in one of the following: England; Scotland;
      France; The Netherlands.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the impact of Protestant
      ideas in any one of England, Scotland, France or the Netherlands. Different types of
      Protestant ideas, for example Lutheranism, Anabaptism and Calvinism, may be
      evaluated depending on the country chosen. Candidates may address the political
      impact of Protestant ideas notable in their country of choice. In England, Henry VIII
      broke from Rome in part due to Protestant ideas, which gradually generated support
      from some of the population for a reformed church. In Scotland, after a period of
      persecution, reformers led by John Knox gained control and King James VI was
      brought up in the Protestant faith. In France, the persecution of Protestants led to the
      Wars of Religion and the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of Huguenots in 1572. In
      the Netherlands, William the Silent converted to Calvinism and led the Dutch rebellion
      against the Spanish. Less directly political impacts could also be discussed including
      changes in religious observance in some cases.
                                                  – 11 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 7: Absolutism and Enlightenment (1650–1800)

13.   Evaluate the political impact of Enlightenment ideas in two of the following: Germany;
      England; Scotland; France; Spain; the Dutch Republic; Italy.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal by weighing up the political
      impact of Enlightenment ideas in two of the named countries. The political impact may
      extend beyond the timeframe, but the effects must be clearly linked to the
      Enlightenment. Candidates may offer equal coverage of both countries. A comparative
      approach may or may not be used. Candidates may refer to the ideas of the
      philosophes, which influenced political views, such as principles of religious tolerance,
      separation of church and state, and the social contract, all of which were seen in
      France. Ideas of enlightened despotism became popular in a number of European
      countries. Other relevant factors, for example social and economic effects, may be
      referred to.


14.   “The growth of cities was the most significant social and economic change in the
      Enlightenment era.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. Candidates may offer equal coverage of social and economic changes, or
      they may prioritize their discussion of one aspect. However, both aspects will be a
      feature of the response. Candidates may discuss the economic change that resulted
      from the development of industry and capitalism. Social changes may include the
      change in lifestyle that emerged out of a flourishing new breed of middle classes and
      traders. The demise of the mercantilist system was arguably the most significant
      economic change, brought about by laissez-faire economics. Candidates may agree,
      partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 8: The French revolution and Napoleon I (1774–1815)

15.   Evaluate the reasons for the Thermidorean reaction.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the
      Thermidorean reaction. Candidates may initially outline the Thermidorean reaction as
      the execution of Robespierre and his followers on 10 Thermidor (28th July) 1794.
      Candidates may refer to the rising numbers of executions and the National Convention
      turning against the Committee of Public Safety. This was partly due to fear that they
      would be the next to be accused and executed, especially after Robespierre’s speech
      of 8 Thermidor, in which he talked of suspects but did not name them. In addition, in
      the summer of 1794 there was division within the Committee of Public Safety, following
      Robespierre’s criticism of Billaud Varenne and Collot d’Herbois. Candidates may also
      refer to revenge as an important reason, as many people, from Royalists to
      Dantonists, wanted revenge for the excesses of the Terror. Candidates may point out
      that the Thermidorean reaction did not end with the death of Robespierre – there were
      attacks on Jacobins in the “White Terror” in 1794–1795.


16.   Examine the impact of the domestic policies of Napoleon I on France.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      impact of the domestic policies of Napoleon I on France. Candidates may refer to the
      Code Napoleon, the 1801 Concordat with the Church, the establishment of the Banque
      de France, some degree of meritocracy, especially within the Army, education reforms
      and the repression of opposition. Candidates may argue that Napoleon’s domestic
      policies had a generally positive impact, as there was stability after the upheavals of
      the 1790s and the Concordat provided a settlement with the Catholic Church.
      Candidates may highlight the longer-term benefits for France, including the
      consolidation of the achievements of the Revolution and establishment of the lycées.
      Alternatively, candidates may argue that some domestic policies were negative. They
      could highlight the censorship and repression used. Although this is not a question on
      Napoleon’s foreign policy, candidates may comment on the domestic effects on
      France of years of war, including conscription of men of military age and the burden of
      taxation.

Section 9: France (1815–1914)

17.   “Economic factors were the main reason for the 1848 Revolution in France.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. In agreeing with the statement, candidates may refer to the impact of
      economic hardship in France in the 1840s. The potato blight of 1845 and the failed
      wheat harvest of 1846 led to increasing food prices and economic hardship. In Paris
      there was unemployment and hunger between 1847 and 1848. Alternatively,
      candidates may disagree with the statement and look at non-economic reasons for the
      1848 Revolution in France. These could include the unpopularity of Guizot, Louis
      Philippe’s Chief Minister and a growing movement in favour of political reform (the
      Banquet Movement). Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the
      statement.




18.   “The threat of Boulangisme to the French Third Republic was exaggerated.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. For context, Boulanger was Minister of War between 1886 and 1887,
      establishing his own political movement in 1888. There were rumours he would lead a
      coup against the Third Republic. Candidates could agree with the statement and point
      out that no coup attempt was launched, that Boulangist deputies were few in number
      and there were considerable divisions within the movement. Alternatively, candidates
      could stress the relative weakness of the Third Republic; the corruption associated
      with the Presidency of Grévy meant that many turned against mainstream parties. In
      addition, many in France also desired “revanche” against Germany after the defeat in
      the Franco-Prussian War. Boulanger capitalized on these patriotic sentiments
      especially in what was seen as his victory over Bismarck over the Schnaebelé Affair in
      1887. Candidates may agree, partly agree or disagree with the statement.

Section 10: Society, politics and economy in Britain and Ireland (1815–1914)

19.   Evaluate the reasons for the emergence of Chartism.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the reasons for the
      emergence of Chartism, weighing up the significance of different reasons. The
      People’s Charter was published in May 1838. Candidates may focus on political and
      economic reasons. Evaluation of political reasons may include reference to the failure
      of the 1832 Reform Act to extend the franchise further, or the decision to prosecute
      trades unions (Tolpuddle Martyrs). Evaluation of economic reasons may include
      reference to the impact of economic depression, the fear of unemployment—and the
      workhouse—and the relative failure of factory reform. Candidates may also highlight
      the regional differences between Chartism in London and Chartism in Wales, the North
      and the Midlands. Candidates may also address the ways in which Chartism in the late
      1830s differed from the Chartism of 1848.


20.   To what extent was pre-First World War unrest a challenge to the British government?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the
       suggestion that pre-war unrest posed a challenge to the British government in the
       years before 1914. Candidates may focus on any or all of the following: labour unrest,
       the Irish Question and the impact of women’s suffrage movements. Candidates may
       highlight the use of military force against strikers at Tonypandy. Alternatively, there
       could be an examination of the seriousness of the situation in Ireland following the
       Curragh Incident of March 1914. Candidates may also point out that once war was
       declared in August 1914, the established order was maintained. So, perhaps the
       threats of unrest were not as serious as they had appeared.
                                                    – 15 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 11: Italy (1815–1871) and Germany (1815–1890)

21.   “Garibaldi was the most significant leader in the process of Italian unification.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. Candidates may refer to Garibaldi’s key contribution, which was to lead the
      Thousand Red Shirts in an expedition to Sicily, defeating the Neapolitan forces in a
      series of battles from May to October 1860. Candidates may argue that aside from his
      military success, Garibaldi’s political decision to accept the unification of Italy under the
      Piedmontese monarchy was also very significant. Garibaldi’s role in defending the
      Roman Republic in 1849 could also be mentioned as a source of inspiration for Italian
      nationalists. On the other hand, some candidates may challenge the statement and
      highlight the role of other leaders in Italian unification, for example Cavour, Mazzini,
      Victor Emmanuel II, or even Napoleon III. Candidates may agree, partly agree or
      disagree with the statement.


22.   Evaluate the importance of Bismarck’s policies in the achievement of German
      unification by 1871.

      The question requires that the candidates make an appraisal of the contribution of
      Bismarck’s policies to unification. The main focus is likely to be on Bismarck’s
      diplomacy in the wars of unification against Denmark in 1864, Austria in 1866 and
      France in 1870. He isolated other countries and made them appear to be the
      aggressor, for example his manipulation of the Ems Telegram (Dispatch) in July 1870.
      Candidates may also highlight his role in passing military reforms through the Prussian
      Parliament in the 1860s. Alternatively, candidates may argue that other factors, aside
      from Bismarck’s policies, led to German unification by 1871. These could include
      Austrian weakness, the economic and military growth of Prussia from 1815 and
      economic co-operation under the Zollverein from the 1830s onwards. The growth of
      German nationalism may also be discussed. The failure of the Frankfurt parliament
      between 1848 and 1849 arguably showed that Germany would only be unified under a
      monarchy.
                                                  – 16 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 12: Imperial Russia, revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union
     (1855–1924)

23.   To what extent did the reforms of Alexander II change Russian society by 1881?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the
      suggestion that the reforms of Alexander II changed Russian society. The main
      reforms such as the Emancipation of the Serfs and local government reform should be
      examined in relation to their impact on Russian society. Candidates may argue that the
      most radical change was to the principles that governed Russian society; the idea of
      freedom of the individual was introduced with the abolition of serfdom and the notion of
      equal justice with legal reforms. Candidates may argue that Russian society remained
      hierarchical with the monarchy, Church and nobility at the top and the peasantry,
      despite notional freedom, still largely enslaved by the Mir and the obligation to pay
      Redemption Dues. Other major reforms include education and military reforms, and
      their impact on society could be considered.


24.   Compare and contrast the causes of the February/March and October/November
      Revolutions in 1917.

      The question requires that candidates give an account of the similarities and
      differences between the causes of the two revolutions. Candidates may refer to issues
      such as the problem of weak ineffective governments that were blamed for the
      difficulties caused by the First World War, including continued defeats and the high
      number of casualties. In the case of the February/March Revolution, the Tsar lost the
      support of the military and was forced to abdicate. Similarly, Kerensky had lost military
      support and the Bolshevik coup easily overthrew the Provisional Government. Other
      linked causes, such as economic problems, food shortages and poor working
      conditions may also be examined. Some may argue that the major difference was the
      level of popular agitation for revolution. February 1917 saw a spontaneous popular
      revolution with various mass demonstrations (International Women’s Day) and strikes
      (Putilov Armaments Workers), whereas events in October/November arguably
      constituted a coup d’état carried out by the Bolsheviks with limited popular
      involvement. Both similarities and differences must be clearly indicated but there does
      not need to be an equal number of both.

Section 13: Europe and the First World War (1871–1918)

25.   “German foreign policy did not lead to the outbreak of the First World War.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. Candidates may refer to Balkan nationalism as a key cause, along with the
      Alliance System which arguably made it easier for a local conflict to lead to a
      generalised war. Some may argue that it was Germany’s clumsy diplomacy, for
      example the Moroccan Crises, that caused tension, rather than the policies themselves.
      To disagree, it could be argued that Weltpolitik and the naval race with Britain
      contributed to a suspicion of Germany’s intentions. Candidates may also argue that it
      was a failure to resolve the July Crisis in 1914 that led to the outbreak of the war.


26.   Discuss the factors that led to the defeat of Germany and the other Central Powers in
      the First World War.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      factors that led to the defeat of Germany and the other Central Powers. Candidates
      may refer to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and other strategic and tactical errors
      made by Germany and the other Central Powers. These may include the decision to
      invade Belgium bringing Britain into the war, unrestricted U-boat warfare which
      antagonized the US, and the failure of the Spring Offensive in 1918. Domestic
      instability and weak governments in the Central Powers may also be considered.
      Economic factors such as the impact of the Allied Blockade could be discussed. The
      entry and role of the US was also important, as it brought in new resources against the
      weakened and war-weary Central Powers.

Section 14: European states in the inter-war years (1918–1939)

27.   “Germany experienced a “Golden Era” during the Stresemann years (1924–1929).” To
      what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the
      statement. Reference may be made to foreign policy, for example the signing of the
      Locarno Accords and joining with the League, and argue that, internally, resentment
      about Versailles was reduced. The introduction of the Rentenmark stabilized the
      currency and the Dawes and Young Plans reduced the burden of reparations.
      Hindenburg’s election in 1925 reduced criticism from nationalists, and there were no
      attempts to overthrow the Weimar Republic. Candidates may argue that economic
      recovery was based on short-term loans and there was a budget deficit for much of the
      period, and that “Germany was dancing on the edge of a volcano”. Unemployment
      remained high and an agricultural depression began in 1927. Politically, no party
      gained a majority and governments were coalitions, albeit formed of pro-Weimar
      parties. Candidates may agree, disagree or partially disagree with the statement.


28.   Evaluate the successes and failures of Mussolini’s domestic policies between 1922 and
      1939.

      The question requires that candidates make an appraisal of the strengths and
      limitations of Mussolini’s policies in Italy in the given period. Responses may identify
      Mussolini’s aims in order to make a judgment on success. There should be
      consideration of political, economic and social policies. Politically, Mussolini’s aim was
      to remain in power and establish a one-party dictatorship. He had consolidated his
      political power and Italy had become a one-party state by 1926. Candidates may argue
      that there were still key institutions, such as the Church and monarchy, that limited his
      power. Economic policies considered may include the various “Battles” and how far
      they contributed to Mussolini’s goal of autarky (note the Battle for Land and Quota 90).
      Social policies to be considered may include those aimed at improving education and
      those targeting the youth. The Battle for Births and the impact of Dopolavoro may also
      be addressed and candidates may consider how far a Fascist society was developed.
      Candidates may argue that successes were largely superficial. Many policies were
      damaging, especially economic ones; however, politically Mussolini was successful as
      he remained in power until 1943.

Section 15: Versailles to Berlin: Diplomacy in Europe (1919–1945)

29.   “In the 1920s, the League of Nations was successful in Europe.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates give a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. While other relevant factors, for example the structure and membership of
      the League may be referred to, the bulk of the response will remain on the issue raised
      in the question. Candidates may point out that the League was dominated by Britain and
      France and some powers were not yet members (Germany, the Soviet Union). League
      successes may include the establishment of organizations such as the International
      Court of Justice, the International Labour Organization and organizations that helped
      refugees/displaced persons. The League resolved several international disputes (the
      Åland Islands, Polish/German disputes over Silesia and the Greek invasion of Bulgaria).
      Evidence against success may include the fact that the League did not intervene in
      some disputes, as these were resolved by the Conference of Ambassadors (Corfu and
      Vilna). Additionally, some major international agreements, which aimed to maintain
      peace, such as Locarno and the Kellogg–Briand Pact were not League initiatives.
      Arguably the League was more effective on social problems than political ones.


30.   Examine the contribution of economic and strategic factors to the Allied victory in 1945.

      The question requires that candidates consider the interrelationship between economic
      and strategic factors and the Allies’ victory in Europe. Factors such as Hitler’s poor
      leadership could be discussed but the bulk of the response must be on the issue raised
      in the question. Economic factors may include the extent to which combatants had the
      resources to fight a long war. The Allies had the industrial resources and manpower of
      the US, the British Empire and the Soviet Union; Germany relied on gaining new
      resources by conquest and the hope that it would be a short-lived war. Other factors
      may include the mobilization of the Allied Home Fronts, or the strategic decision to
      concentrate on the Battle of the Atlantic and naval and airpower. Other strategies that
      were significant include the Soviet “scorched earth” strategy and the opening of the
      second front (D-Day). It would be legitimate to discuss the strategic mistakes of the Axis
      powers, such as overstretching their resources in the Mediterranean and North Africa.
      Candidates may argue that economic factors were, in the long run, more important than
      strategies.

Section 16: The Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia (1924–2000)

31.   “Stalin’s control of the Communist Party was the main reason for his victory in the
      struggle for power (1924–1929).” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. Candidates may agree with the statement, by noting that the Party was
      more important than public opinion in the emergence of leaders. Stalin’s role as
      General Secretary was crucial as he controlled membership and was able to fill the
      party with supporters (note, for example, the Lenin Enrolment), and used party rules to
      weaken opponents (the Ban on Factions). Candidates may argue that the weakness of
      his opponents was crucial. Trotsky lacked party support, missed Lenin’s Funeral and
      his military links aroused suspicion. Further, he was unwilling to split the party. For
      their part, Kamenev and Zinoviev did not initially see Stalin as a threat. Candidates
      may focus on Stalin’s political flexibility, he advocated different policies at different
      stages, such as during the Triumvirate, the elimination of the Left Opposition and then
      the Right Opposition. The struggle for power was carried out behind a debate within
      the party on economic policy. By 1929, he supported the policy of Socialism in One
      Country and collectivization.


32.   To what extent were Gorbachev’s policies responsible for improved East–West
      relations between 1985 and 1991?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the
      suggestion that Gorbachev’s policies changed Cold War relations. There may be
      reference to domestic policies such as Perestroika and Glasnost, but they must be
      linked to the issue of improved relations. Gorbachev’s New Thinking based his
      diplomacy on human rights, non-violence, and ending the arms race. Candidates may
      consider the results of the various summit meetings between 1985 and 1988 leading to
      the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in Washington in 1987, which came
      into force in 1988. Candidates may argue that Gorbachev’s willingness to make
      concessions (accepting the zero–zero option) was vital to improved relations, while
      other candidates may argue that Reagan’s receptiveness to improved relations was
      also important, despite the fact that he caused some difficulties in refusing to abandon
      Star Wars. In 1989, Gorbachev abandoned the Brezhnev Doctrine and withdrew
      Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the Iron Curtain collapsed and, at the Malta Summit, it
      was stated the Cold War had ended. Candidates may argue that Gorbachev needed to
      end tensions to gain US aid to help reforms at home, others that he genuinely wanted
      to remove Cold War tensions.
                                                   – 21 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 17: Post-war western and northern Europe (1945–2000)

33.   “The Marshall Plan was essential to the reconstruction of France and West Germany
      between 1945 and 1963.” Discuss.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      statement. The Marshall Plan contributed to the division of Germany by 1949. In the
      initial stage of reconstruction, Marshall Aid financed the rebuilding of industrial plants,
      but it was arguably the policies of Adenauer that encouraged further investment and
      growth. He insisted that profits should be invested and the Works Law (1952) ensured
      good labour relations, both of which contributed to the “economic miracle” in West
      Germany. France received 18% of the total amount of Marshall Aid and this
      contributed to initial reconstruction of industry, however, there was little impact on
      agriculture. Some may argue that Marshall Aid provided some resources and the
      model for the Monnet Plan that led to continued modernization and development in the
      1950s. Candidates may argue that closer European integration with the establishment
      of the European Coal and Steel Community was more important than Marshall Aid for
      full reconstruction and economic growth.

34.   To what extent did Spain experience economic and social change during the Franco
      regime between 1945 and 1975?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the idea that
      Spain underwent both social and economic change. In the 1950s, Spain’s economy
      was stagnant with low foreign trade (only 4% of GDP), tight government regulation and
      frequent food shortages. Socially, Spain was conservative as the Church dominated
      social attitudes and education. The position of women was restricted as wives were
      not allowed to work or travel without permission. In 1959, the Stabilization Plan
      encouraged foreign trade and investment, which led to industrial growth. The Ministry
      of Tourism was established and encouraged foreign visitors with its lack of visa
      requirements and favourable exchange rates – by 1967, income from foreign tourism
      totalled 11% of GDP. Social change also occurred with some state welfare provision in
      areas such as housing and health. Urbanization increased and a consumer society
      emerged. Tourism also changed social attitudes as society became less conservative
      and more secular. Women made up 30% of the work force by 1974 which was a
      significant social change. The middle class grew to 33% by 1974, reducing the
      economic and social divisions in Spain.
                                                  – 22 – M19/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/EU/M


Section 18: Post-war central and eastern Europe (1945–2000)

35.   To what extent did the Soviet Union dominate central and eastern Europe between
      1945 and 1955?

      The question requires that candidates consider the merits or otherwise of the
      suggestion that the Soviet Union dominated central and eastern Europe between 1945
      and 1955. Candidates may refer to examples of the Soviet Union’s aim for complete
      state control of economic life, through COMECON and Stalin’s agricultural ambitions in
      the Five Year Plans. Following the war, the Soviet Union removed many resources
      from central and eastern European countries. Control was also sought militarily, for
      example through the Warsaw Pact and repression of any opposition. The Soviet Union
      trained Communists, dominated satellite governments, and established Comintern, all
      of which may be considered examples of political domination. There may be reference
      to the presence of Soviet troops in “encouraging” the establishment of friendly
      governments. Candidates could argue that Soviet domination was limited, for example
      Czechoslovakia until 1948 and Yugoslavia.

36.   Discuss the reasons for the collapse of Soviet control in central and eastern Europe.

      The question requires that candidates offer a considered and balanced review of the
      reasons for the collapse of Soviet control in central and eastern Europe. Candidates
      may refer to examples of dissent such as the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 and “Prague
      Spring” in Czechoslovakia in 1968 as being indicative of long lasting resentment.
      Economic reforms in a number of satellite countries also paved the way for the Soviet
      collapse in central and eastern Europe. Other factors, such as increased nationalism
      and growing independence from the Soviet Union, for example in the case of Romania,
      may also be addressed. In the case of Poland there was significant support for the
      Solidarity trade union movement. Gorbachev’s abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine
      led to the collapse of Soviet control of Eastern Bloc countries.
