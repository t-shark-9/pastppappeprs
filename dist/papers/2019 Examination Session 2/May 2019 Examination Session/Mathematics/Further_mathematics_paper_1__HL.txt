Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer with no working. Answers must be
supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions found from a graphic display
calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs are used to find a solution,
you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be
given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised to
show all working.
