Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is
incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working.
You are therefore advised to show all working.

     A large group of students sit two Mathematics examinations, P1 and P2. Mr Brown, their
     teacher, wishes to carry out an early statistical analysis of the results so he selects 10
     students at random and he marks both papers submitted by these students. He obtains the
     following results. You may assume that the pairs of marks follow a bivariate normal distribution.

                       P1     50    62    51      77     72    43        83   69   72   53

     (a)   Mr Brown decides to carry out a test to investigate whether or not the mean marks on
           the two papers will turn out to be equal. He defines the following hypotheses

                                               H0 : d = 0 ; H1 : d ≠ 0

           where d denotes the difference in the mean marks on the two papers.

           (i)     Carry out an appropriate test, stating the degrees of freedom, the value of the
                   test statistic and the p-value.

           (ii)    State your conclusion in context.                                                     [7]

     (b)   Mr Brown now wishes to investigate whether or not there is a positive association
           between the marks of the students on the two papers.

           (i)     State suitable hypotheses.

           (ii)    Determine the value of r , the product moment correlation coefficient of these data.

           (iii)   State the p-value and interpret it in context.                                        [5]

     The triangle T is isosceles with AB = AC = d and BÂC = 2θ . In parts (a) and (b) you are
     required to draw a diagram to illustrate the situation.

     The following diagram illustrates another circle which is outside the triangle T .
     It is tangential to [BC] , and also to the other two sides [AB] and [AC] which have been
     extended. This is called the escribed circle of T which has radius ρ , centre E and points of
     tangency D and F .
