20.   William Bateson and Reginald Punnett used the sweet pea (Lathyrus odoratus) in genetics
      studies in the early 20th century. Pure-breeding plants that produced purple flowers and long pollen
      grains were crossed with pure-breeding plants that produced red flowers and round pollen grains.
      The resulting offspring all produced purple flowers and long pollen grains. Two of the F1 generation
      plants were crossed. The table shows the ratio of phenotypes in the F2 generation.

      What is an explanation for these experimental results?

      A.   Purple flowers and long pollen grains are dominant and the alleles have assorted
           independently.

      B.   The genes for flower colour and pollen shape are linked and all plants producing
           long pollen grains are recombinants.

      C.   The genes for flower colour and pollen shape are linked and all plants producing
           red flowers are recombinants.

      D.   Plants producing purple flowers and round pollen grains arose through crossing over.

      B.   The monarch caterpillar feeds on maize leaves, which contain Bt toxin.

      C.   Bt toxin kills the plants that the monarch caterpillar usually eats.

      D.   Bt toxin is in maize pollen, which blows on to plants that the monarch caterpillar eats.
