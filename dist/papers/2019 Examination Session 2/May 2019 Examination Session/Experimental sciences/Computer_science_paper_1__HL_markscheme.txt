Subject details:        Computer science HL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 75 marks.
           Maximum total = 100 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
semi-colon (;).

An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
accepted.

Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as that
in the markscheme then award the mark.

Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got correct,
rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic slips.
In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is
used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this with
“FT”.

 of             eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses      descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed     In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the         explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.

(d)   Award [3 max].
      Award [1] for stating a feature of a static/dynamic data structure
      Award [1] for stating a difference to dynamic/static data structure
      Award [1] for an explanation

      Memory is allocated to the static data structure in compile time (a pre-set amount
      of memory/fixed size);
      Memory is allocated to the dynamic data structure at run-time;
      The size of a static data structure can never change during run-time whilst the
      size of dynamic data structure can be randomly updated during run time which
      makes efficient use of RAM;

      Memory allocated to the static data structure is always available in order to be
      used by the data structure and elements can be accessed either directly or
      sequentially;
      Whilst direct access to elements in the dynamic data structure is not allowed and
      elements should be accessed sequentially;
      So in some/most cases algorithms which use dynamic data structures are slower
      (during execution) than algorithms with static data structures;
                                                                                           [3]

      (b)   Award [3 max].

            Example 1
            A dedicated operating system for a mobile phone will take up less storage space
            than a full-sized operating system;
            This will allow the device to function more quickly;
            Because it doesn’t contain features that aren’t needed;

            Example 2
            A dedicated operating system for a mobile phone can be customized;
            Benefits the end users;
            As they deal with a familiar interface;

            Example 3
            The dedicated OS is designed specifically for the mobile phone (hardware
            equipment);
            This avoids compatibility issues;
            While a generic operating system is designed for multiple types of hardware
            (which can lead to compatibility / various issues);

                                                                                               [3]

      (c)   Award [5 max].
            A desired temperature is input/pre-set by the user;
            Sensors detect temperature;
            And regularly/continuously send (temperature) readings to the microprocessor;
            The microprocessor compares the actual readings with the pre-set (by the user) /
            input temperature;
            If the temperature is too hot/too cold the microprocessor sends signal to
            actuator;
            To adjust temperature (no need for complex details regarding actions of a
            heating/cooling system);

      Centralized system allows control at a central point, which is then transmitted to
      the various rooms whilst distributed system allows individual control of settings at
      each unit / room so is more flexible // Centralized system will have same or
      constant temperature throughout the home whilst distributed system allows
      individual control of setting at each room;

      Easier to control settings centrally whilst distributed system is more complicated
      to control remotely (due to limited / no connectivity of the control system);

      Centralized system is more difficult to install due to the connectivity required
      between the various components whilst distributed system is easier to install due
      to fewer connection issues;

      If a computer system / or any connection fails in the centralized system, the
      whole system is not able to function correctly whilst the distributed system as
      whole would still function correctly;

      Centralized system is cheaper / has lower operational cost whilst distributed
      system is expensive as it requires additional hardware / software;

      Centralized systems are difficult to expand whilst distributed systems are easily
      expandable because self-sufficient systems can be added or removed at any
      point in time without affecting the overall system;                                    [3]
