Option A — Vergil

Extract 1      Vergil, Aeneid 12.928–952

1.   (a)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not
            been communicated adequately, and vocabulary and grammar are not rendered adequately.
            Award [0] if the work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     (b)    Aeneas is elsewhere described as violent in battle (acer in armis) [1]; rolling his eyes (volvens
            oculos) [1]; capable of wild grief (saevi doloris) [1]; vehement (adverso sub pectore) [1] and
            burning with rage (fervidus) [1]. Reluctantly accept tune…mihi? and Pallas…Pallas if
            explained fully as stylistic points. Do not accept evidence taken from Turnus’s fears, eg
            corpus spoliatum, ne tende odiis, or from dextram repressit, unless it is explained explicitly as
            a check on his initial savage instinct.

     (c)    Mark only for length of syllables. Award [1] per line if all correct; [0] otherwise.

     (d)    Award [1] each up to [2] for any of the following: Turnus asks Aeneas to pity (the old age of
            his father) Daunus (Dauni miserere senectae) [1]; return him/ his body to his family/people (not
            ‘the Rutulians’) (me / corpus redde meis) [1]; and not to extend his hate (ulterius ne tende
            odiis) [1].

                                                                                                    Total: [10]
                                                    –4–                   M19/2/LATIN/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Option A — Vergil

Extract 2      Vergil, Eclogues 6.1–26

2.   (a)    Because they want to hear a song [1]; but he has cheated them in the past [1]. Do not
            accept ‘refused’ for luserat: an element of cheating/trickery must be at least implicit.

     (b)    She paints his forehead and temples (frontem et tempora pingit) [1]; with red/blood-coloured
            berry/mulberry (stains) (sanguineis moris) [1].

     (c)    The poet’s vocation is portrayed through numerous literary devices emphasizing the different
            kinds/genres of poetry and their associated divinities, qualities, and contexts. Accept a range
            of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the argument. Then
            award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the following scale: [2] if
            the argument is supported by 3–4 developed points; [1] if the argument is supported by 1–2
            developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points or if no details
            from the text are given. Points, which must address the question, may be taken from
            anywhere in the extract but will probably come from its first part. They may include:
            • Graecism recalls Theocritean origin of the genre (Syracosio)
            • quasi-religious vocation of the poet by reference to the relevant Muse (Thalia)
            • anastrophe, word-placement of prima … nostra … Thalia
            • metonymy/hendiadys (reges et proelia)
            • the poet directly influenced by the deity expressed by the vivid/enjambed /‘cum-historicum’
               (Cynthius aurem vellit)
            • contrast/antithesis (pinguis ovis, deductum carmen) to show the herdsman’s call to poetry
               is at least as importance as his husbandry
            • golden line (agrestem...Musam) to show the poet’s desire to create polished poetry
            • litotes draws attention to the deity’s direct inspiration on the poet: non iniussa cano
            • repetition (te Vare te) to highlight that pastoral poetry also can have a worthy objective
            • accept repetition of si quis (9) if linked to the question, eg by exploring the relationship
               between poet and reader
            • direct address by a divinity (“Tityre …”)
            • apostrophe/invocation of the Muses (pergite, Pierides)
            • alliteration drawing attention to key themes (pastorem pascere pinguis … deductum dicere)
            • contrast/juxtaposition of poetic themes (tristia condere bella—agrestem meditabor Musam)
            • diction that evokes key generic qualities (agrestem Musam, tenui arundine, captus amore
               leget).

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

Option B — History

Extract 3      Caesar, De Bello Gallico 7.80

3.   (a)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are
            rendered correctly. Award [2] if the meaning has been communicated, and vocabulary and
            grammar are rendered adequately despite inaccuracies. Award [1] if the meaning has not
            been communicated adequately, and vocabulary and grammar are not rendered adequately.
            Award [0] if the work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors above.

     (b)    To cover/protect/assist/go to the aid of their retreating troops (suis cedentibus succurrerent)

            equitum impetus sustinerent) [1].

     (c)    The fact that they were acting / the engagement was taking place in public / in front of
            others/everyone ((quod) in conspectu omnium res gerebatur) [1]; the fact that nothing,
            whether shameful of creditworthy, could be hidden ((neque) recte ac turpiter factum celari
            poterat) [1]; desire for praise (laudis cupiditas) [1]; fear of scorn (timor ignominiae) [1]. Any
            two.

     (d)    They made a charge against the enemy/Gauls (in hostes impetum fecerunt) [1]; in close
            formation (confertis turmis) [1]; drove them back / before them (eos propulerunt) [1]. Do not
            accept evidence from elsewhere in the extract.

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

            (southern) Tuscany; in the Chiana Valley; in (western) Etruria; near/west of Perugia/Perusia;

            of the option).

     (c)    Hannibal's strategy and tactics are highlighted by Livy through various stylistic features.
            Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the
            argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the
            following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3–4 developed points; [1] if the argument
            is supported by 1–2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed
            points or if no details from the text are given. Points may include:
            • Hannibal’s cunningly directed violence highlighted through careful diction: otiose omni,
               intensive prefix in pervastat...

            Ovid is nearly driven to seize his love (vix a te videor posse tenere manus) [1]; OR (unlike a
            centaur) the poet does not live in the woods (nec mihi silva domus) [1] and his limbs do not
            fuse into (the body of) a horse / he does not have a horse’s legs (nec equo mea membra

            (ridentem audit) OR she is pleased with his rival (ridentem) [1]. Accept that his rival
            attends/ogles Lesbia repeatedly (identidem) [1].

     (b)    lumina refers to his eyes (the identification must be present even if implicit) [1]; accept any
            reasonable analysis, such as: the poet faints, suffers a dizzy spell, becomes blinded by the
            sight of the girl (presume figurative sense), etc [1].

     (c)    Catullus highlights the effects of love by focusing attention on its physical effects and
            repercussions. Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point
            supporting the argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the argument

            argument is supported by 1–2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by no
            developed points or if no details from the text are given. Points may include:
            • anaphora (ille) shows obsessive focus on the envied rival
            • hyperbole (par esse deo, superare divos) highlights the strength of desire-induced jealousy
            • chiasmus (te spectat, audit ridentem) highlights the object of desire
            • juxtaposition (ridentem, misero) shows the odd effect of Lesbia’s pleasure on the lover
            • enjambment (eg omnis | eripit sensus; tenuis | flamma) highlights the senses/symptoms
            • the effect of seeing the object of desire is instantaneous (simul adspexi)
            • hyperbole (nihil est super mi) shows the poet noticing Lesbia to the exclusion of all else
            • asyndeton / list shows the combined effect of sense experiences (with Latin from 9-12)
            • word choice/diction highlights the effects of desire (torpet; demanat; tintinant).
            • anaphora / repetition of otium (13-15) highlights how desire can distract, or how
               distraction leaves room for desire
            • apostrophe to himself (Catulle, line 13) warns Catullus of the dangers of otium / the need
               to focus on other things
            • Each physical effect is highlighted by the mode of expression:
               • lingua sed torpet (9): hyperbaton reflects faltering speech
               • flamma (10): the metaphor reflects the change in temperature
               • sonitu suopte (10): the alliteration reflects the rushing sound of blood in the ears
               • Accept that the onomatopoeia of tintinant (11) makes the effect on the sense of
                  hearing more vivid
               • EITHER nocte (12) left to the end/anastrophe OR the juxtaposition/contrast of
                  lumina nocte (12) shows how complete the darkness is OR how utterly overcome the
                  poet is

                                                                                                      Total: [10]

            Africa/Morocco.

     (b)    Tettius Caballus was a famous buffoon/comedian [1]; this is a hyperbolic claim about
            Caecilius’s self-perceived greatness/wit/talent [1]; or similar relevant analysis.

     (c)    Award [3] if the meaning has been fully communicated, and vocabulary and grammar are

            that a new universal flood is feared [1]. Any two.

     (b)    This is the Regia/royal palace in the Forum Romanum/Via Sacra/built by king Numa [1]; the
            residence of Julius Caesar as Pontifex Maximus, whom Augustus will avenge [1]; it was
            located on low-lying ground at the foot of the Palatine Hill and so would be affected by the
            feared flood [1]. Award [1] mark for any other valid explanation. Any two.

     (c)    Horace emphasizes the topsy-turvy or uncertain nature of the ages through a range of
            stylistic features. Accept a range of substantiated answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any
            point supporting the argument. Then award up to [2] for the coherence and clarity of the
            argument using the following scale: [2] if the argument is supported by 3–4 developed points;
            [1] if the argument is supported by 1–2 developed points; [0] if the argument is supported by
            no developed points or if no details from the text are given. Points may include:
            • repeated /is/ (satis, terris, nivis, grandinis, misit) evokes hissing wind and so frightening
            • alliteration of /rr/ (terris, rubente, terruit) reflects rolling thunder
            • epithets / enjambment highlight the negative (eg rubente dextera; dirae grandinis; grave
                saeculum, pavidae dammae)
            •   sacras iaculatus arces: extreme anger of city’s patron
            •   repetition / metrically isolated terruit urbem highlights fear/uncertainty
            •   grave promoted in its clause highlights the negativity of the Flood
            •   Anastrophe / enjambment (rediret saeculum) reflects the apparent return to a feared past
            •   adynata highlight the topsy-turvy world (piscium summa genus haesit ulmo; superiecto
                natarunt aequore dammae); accept interpretation as light-hearted
            •   alliteration of /p/ (Proteus pecus) highlights the strange / unnatural event contemplated
                (accept interpretation as light-hearted treatment)
            • vivid appeal to the reader’s recent experience (perfect vidimus) to portray terrifying
                flood/natural disaster
            • enjambment highlights suspense and danger (retortis | undis)
            • the supine deiectum attributes malevolent purpose to the river (frightening upset of
                normality
            • ancient/venerable sites (monumenta regis, templa Vestae) are singled out for destruction,
                reflecting the anguish caused by the reversal of the city’s fortunes
            • the overthrow of normality is so great/disturbing that Jupiter himself seems to disapprove
                (Iove non probante)

                                                                                                     Total: [10]

     (c)    Strength of body (vi corporis) [1]; the virtue (not strength) of the spirit (virtute animi) [1].
            NB: ‘vine corporis an virtute animi (virtue of the mind and strength of the body)’ = [1]. Do not
            accept planning (consulto) and action (facto).

     (d)    Award [1] each up to [3] for any stylistic feature and effect supported by the relevant Latin
            text, such as:
            • archaism (summa ope, maxume, consulto, facto, divorsi, agitabatur, lubidinem) portrays his
                writing as weighty/traditional/virtuous/proverbial
            • simile (veluti pecora) serves to disparage those who do not strive for excellence
            • metonymy (ventri) further disparages/animalises the idle
            • asyndeton / contrast / parallel (animi imperio, corporis servitio; alterum cum dis, alterum

            •   contrast (brevis, longam) shows the importance striving for excellence in the time available
            •   alliteration (fluxa atque fragilis) highlights the fragility of glory and praise
            •   variatio (gloria est, virtus habetur) highlights the contrast

            •   alliteration (vi, virtute) highlights the contrast between the two qualities
            •   chiasmus (incipias, consulto, consulueris, facto) shows the careful relationship between
                thought and action
            • juxtaposition / polyptoton (alterum alterius) shows the interdependence / equal importance
                of thought/mind and action/body
            • variatio (pars, alii) shows the difference in policy among different kings
            • tricolon (subigere, habere, putare) shows the progressive decline of man
            • polyptoton / repetition (maxumam gloriam in maxumo imperio) highlights the obsessive
                pursuit of power.
                                                                                                        Total: [10]

Extract 10      Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 3.44.7–12

10.   (a)    Because Quirites refers to the citizens as a body [1]; because phrases like fides Quiritium
             and ius Quiritium (use of Latin terms not required) invoke the legal rights of the citizenry [1].
             Accept also evidence from elsewhere in lines 1-3, eg: Verginia’s father and betrothed were
             both well-known and respected [1]; their friends’ regard for Verginius and Icilius caused them
             to support Verginia [1]; the unfairness of her treatment earned her the support of the
             crowd [1].

      (b)    Verginia was born into his household (domi suae natam) [1]; but subsequently smuggled into
             Verginius’s household (in domum Vergini translatam) [1]; and fathered on him (suppositam
             ei) [1]. Any two. Disregard any other details.

      (c)    Livy uses a variety of stylistic devices to highlight the power imbalances between men and
             women, magistrates and citizens, or victims and villains. Accept a range of substantiated
             answers, awarding [1] up to [4] for any point supporting the argument. Then award up to [2]
             for the coherence and clarity of the argument using the following scale: [2] if the argument is
             supported by 3–4 developed points; [1] if the argument is supported by 1–2 developed
             points; [0] if the argument is supported by no developed points or if no details from the text
             are given. Points may include:
             • alliteration of /p/ (pavida puella) highlights the girl’s helplessness
             • adjective choice (pavida) conveys Verginia’s insecurity
             • enclosing word order (nutricis fidem Quiritium implorantis) emphasizes the power of a
                unified citizenry to protect individuals from villainous behavior
             • chiasmus (Vergini patris sponsique Icili) shows that it is these men’s patriarchal functions
                that earn Verginia the people’s support
             • diction (turbam indignitas rei virgini conciliat; a vi tuta erat) highlights the
                (damaging/serious/violent) nature of the villain’s actions or the vulnerability of Verginia
             • parallelism / repetition (domi suae natam furtoque inde in domum Vergini translatam)
                highlights power of men to control women
             • Initial position of notam / theatrical/fictional diction (fabulam, auctorem argumenti) conveys
                the manipulation of the powerful
             • inverted usual word order (dominum sequi ancillam) shows the prosecutor’s attempt to
                overturn the vindiciae secundum libertatem (accept ‘presumption of innocence’ as a
                modern equivalent term)
             • the evil choice (famae prius quam libertatis periculum) focuses attention on the imbalance
                of power suffered by unprotected citizens
             • contrast of iure and vi emphasizes the different nature of the powers that the powerful can
                employ against citizens.

                                                                                                    Total: [10]

Instructions
Section B is assessed by the assessment criteria found below and published in the subject guide.

Criterion A (Range of evidence) assesses to what extent the evidence represents both prescribed
passages and supplementary reading. A candidate is expected to:
• use relevant examples from the prescribed passages to support the response (candidates are not
   expected to provide exact quotes)
• demonstrate knowledge of historical, political and cultural contexts beyond those embedded in the
   prescribed passages.

Criterion B (Understanding and argument) assesses how well the response demonstrates understanding
of the chosen option. Ideally, a candidate will:
• build a critical analysis that responds directly to the prompt in a clear, logical and imaginative way
• fully address the contexts and background knowledge pertinent to the examples related to the chosen
    option.
