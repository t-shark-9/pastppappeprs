 How effectively and accurately does the student use language?

           Command of the language is limited and generally ineffective.

Clarification

Word count
At HL, students are required to write a minimum of 250 words in section A and 150 words in
section B. Failure to write the minimum number of words will result in a [1 mark] penalty under
criterion A. There is no penalty for exceeding 400 words in section A or 250 words in section B: the
whole text should be taken into consideration in the award of marks.

Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.

SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.

FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).

GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are
needed, but do not appear.

A good answer will have very few language gaps, if any, and slips or flaws very rarely affect
meaning.

Question 5: Science and technology

 How correctly does the student produce the required text type?
 To what extent are the conventions of text types appropriate?

  Marks    Level descriptor
    0      The work does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.
           The text type is not recognizable.
      1
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are not used.
           The text type is hardly recognizable or is not appropriate.
      2
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are very limited.
           The text type is sometimes recognizable and appropriate.
      3

           The text type is generally recognizable and appropriate.
      4
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are evident.
           The text type is clearly recognizable and appropriate.
      5
           Conventions appropriate to the text type are effective and evident.

To gain maximum marks [5], all of the bulleted conventions must be applied.
To gain [3], more than half of the conventions must be applied.

Note: Examiners are reminded that Criterion C bullet points are marking notes, not mark schemes.
Therefore, where one or more bullet points are only partially fulfilled (eg appropriate register
generally used but not consistently, there is an opening salutation but no closing salutation etc),
some credit/recognition may still be given. In such cases, examiners should consider the work
holistically and use their professional judgements, with reference to the criteria, to arrive at the
final marks.

Expected conventions of the text type are as follows:

Question 1: Letter to the editor

     will adopt a semi-formal to formal register
     will adopt an appropriately serious tone
     will give opinions in an interesting and engaging style
     will include a greeting and a closing salutation
     will refer to the original article/issue raised.

Question 2: Informal email

   will adopt a consistently informal register
   will adopt a lively, engaging style, perhaps with some “youth-speak” eg “I’m good”, “Can’t wait”
    etc
   will maintain clear sense of address to a specific person
   will have opening salutations
   will have closing salutations.

Question 3: Pamphlet

     will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
     will have an engaging title

      email address.

   N.B.: Graphic design as such is not marked

Question 4: Blog entry

     will adopt a semi-formal to informal register
     will have an engaging title for the entry (i.e. not the title of the blog in general)
     will include first person statement and/or narration
     will show awareness of the reader, eg through direct address, a lively and interesting style etc
     will have a closing statement, eg invitation to comment, a conclusion drawn etc.

Question 5: Article based on an interview

     will adopt a semi-formal register
     will have a relevant headline/title
     will have an introduction and a conclusion
     will use a style aimed at involving and interesting the reader
     will refer to the interview (e.g. including direct quotations); it will not be a verbatim transcript.

Question 6: Imagine how boring life would be if everybody were perfect and the same.

           addresses poorly or not at all the central issue of sameness and perfection in
            relation to boredom
           provides little or no explanation of what “perfect” and “the same” are taken to mean
           presents an unclear or incoherent view of the statement: whether agreeing or
3–4         disagreeing, or considering pros and cons of both sides (which may include
            discussing how lively it might be when people are different and imperfect)
           provides few, or unclear, reasons for the viewpoint
           links arguments very poorly or not at all.
           addresses vaguely or inconsistently the central issue of sameness and perfection
            in relation to boredom
           provides fairly limited explanation of what “perfect” and “the same” are taken to
            mean
5–6        presents a rather unclear view of the statement: whether agreeing or disagreeing,
            or considering pros and cons of both sides (which may include discussing how
            lively it might be when people are different and imperfect)
           provides reasons for the viewpoint that are not very clearly explained
           links arguments unclearly and ineffectively at times.
           addresses to some extent the central issue of sameness and perfection in relation
            to boredom
           provides some explanation of what “perfect” and “the same” are taken to mean
           presents a reasonably clear view of the statement: whether agreeing or
7–8
            disagreeing, or considering pros and cons of both sides (which may include
            discussing how lively it might be when people are different and imperfect)
           provides reasons for the viewpoint that are competently explained
           links arguments reasonably clearly and effectively.
           addresses directly the central issue of sameness and perfection in relation to
            boredom
           provides a coherent explanation of what “perfect” and “the same” are taken to
            mean
9–10       presents a clear and coherent view of the statement: whether agreeing or
            disagreeing, or considering pros and cons of both sides (which may include
            discussing how lively it might be when people are different and imperfect)
           provides reasons for the viewpoint that are clearly explained and well-supported
           links arguments clearly and effectively.

   Note: Some candidates may choose to “imagine” and describe a world of perfection. While
   such an approach would not be the usual ‘argued opinion’, it should be accepted, and
   marked according to the extent to which the description is “coherent”, “clearly explained and
   well-supported".

   The marking instructions on IBIS allow for “unexpected or unconventional approaches (e.g.
   argument presented within an invented or fictional context) provided that there is a clear link
   to the key idea(s) in the stimulus”.
