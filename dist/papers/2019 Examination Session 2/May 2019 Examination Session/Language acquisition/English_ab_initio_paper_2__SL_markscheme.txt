                                              Section A
Criterion A: Language
• Does the student demonstrate an ability to use the language effectively and accurately?
• Does the student use spelling, calligraphy (see “Glossary of terms”), vocabulary and
  grammatical structures correctly and accurately?

 Marks    Level descriptor
   0      Language inaccuracies completely obscure communication.
   1      Language inaccuracies often obscure communication.
   2      Language is generally accurate and does not obscure communication.
   3      Language is mostly accurate and communication is clear.

Clarification
Word count
At ab initio level, students are required to write a minimum of 50 words in section A (with equivalents
in non-Roman script languages). There is no penalty for not writing the minimal word target in
section A.
Language
Not all errors have the same importance, and examiners should bear this in mind. Some errors
affect the communication of meaning significantly, and others do not. Also, some errors indicate a
fundamental lack of command of the language, while others may simply indicate a moment of
forgetfulness.
SLIPS – mistakes at all levels of difficulty, but erratic and occasional – eg the candidate normally
forms past tenses well, but occasionally forgets “-ed”.
FLAWS – errors occur more regularly, particularly in certain structures – eg past tenses are formed
correctly quite often, but are not really reliable, and there may be basic confusions (eg past simple
versus present perfect).
GAPS – some structures are rarely correct, or simply don’t appear – eg the past tenses are needed,
but do not appear.


Criterion B: Message

 Marks    Level descriptor
   0      No relevant information has been conveyed.
   1      Some relevant information has been conveyed.

Criterion C: Format

           •   Each part is worth 2 marks.
           •   Total marks for information = 6

    2. THEN assess the structure and use of cohesive devices.
           •    1 mark for a logical structure (paragraphing)
           •    1 mark for the successful / appropriate use of cohesive devices.
                Candidates must use a minimum of three to be awarded one mark.
                Cohesive devices include: first, second; then, next, because, also, but, if, or, however;
