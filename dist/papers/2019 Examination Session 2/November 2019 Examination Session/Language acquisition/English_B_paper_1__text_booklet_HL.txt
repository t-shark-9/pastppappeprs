  Recycle & Reuse: Cleaning up after the holidays
  By Liz Swafford

  I’m eagerly awaiting Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve. But I’m
  also dreading having to clean up. Figuring out what to do with all
  those items replaced by new Christmas gifts can be quite a chore,
  too. To help keep me on track, I always like to use my six favorite “re”
  methods.

  Recycle involves collecting specific types of materials so
  manufacturers can make new products we can use again. After a
  party, collect your glass bottles, aluminium beverage cans and plastic
  bottles and put them in separate bins. Each of these will go on to have
  a new life as a new product.

  [ – X – ] means utilizing things over and over again instead of throwing them away. A plastic water
  bottle, for example, can be refilled time and again. Similarly, you can store wrapping paper, boxes
  and gift bags that are still in great condition to be used again next year.

  [ – 2 – ] means using less so there is less to dispose of later. For example, plan your festive meals
  and buy only the amount of food you will actually be consuming to avoid having leftovers to throw
  away later. This measure also includes wasting less energy during the holidays. For instance, you
  can switch from incandescent light bulbs to energy-saving ones.

  [ – 3 – ] is a word loved by do-it-yourself enthusiasts! It involves reusing in a creative way. Pretty
  gift boxes can be transformed — they can become desk organizers or other sorts of containers.
  Those holiday greeting cards are perfect for making next year’s gift tags or even festive
  decorations. No matter what you make, such items take on a second life and become useful
  instead of ending up as waste.

  [ – 4 – ] is a word that makes you think of exchanging unwanted gifts at the shop where they were
  originally bought. But there is another variant to this: donating. If you have received an unwanted
  gift, you can usually give it to a local charity. However, call ahead to find out if your particular item
  will be accepted. Usually charities accept used items, but a minority are more particular and only
  accept unopened products in their original packaging.

  [ – 5 – ] is a word that may make some feel uncomfortable, especially during the holiday season.
  It’s hard to say no to a generous friend or colleague when they’re offering a gift or snack.
  However, you can still avoid buying products that are over-packaged or designed for single-use
  only. Never use plastic forks and straws and paper napkins: make use of their washable and more
   durable counterparts instead.

         5 things we learned from
         one of the world’s biggest
         surveys of young people
         By: Callum Brodie

        Almost 25 000 people aged between 18 and 35 from 186 countries and territories took part in
         this year’s Global Shapers Annual Survey. It showed that 55.9 % of respondents believe their
         views are not being taken into account before important decisions are made. The results of
         the survey compiled for the World Economic Forum offer an interesting insight into how young
         people view the world and its challenges. Here are five more things about their values we
         learned from the survey:

        [–X–]
         Of all the issues affecting the planet today, young people are most alarmed about the impact of
         climate change and the general destruction of nature. This is the third year in a row that climate
         change has been voted the most serious global issue. Perhaps unsurprisingly considering the
         current level of global instability, wars and inequality were respectively listed as their second
         and third biggest anxieties.

        [ – 13 – ]
         The recent rise of fake news around the world may go some way towards explaining why
         distrust for the media is growing among young people. Just over 30 % of survey respondents
         said they trusted the media, compared to almost 46 % who said they didn’t. In addition, 22.7 %
         of young people are uneasy about the potentially harmful influence of corrupt politicians and
         government officials, and the growing power of multinational corporations.

        [ – 14 – ]
         There is a common misconception that millennials are workshy. On the contrary, the Global
         Shapers Annual Survey does, in fact, establish that young people are very career orientated.
         Only around 16 % said they would be eager to sacrifice career and salary to enjoy life. To
         underline the point that young people are hardworking, the survey found that a majority of
         respondents (81.1 %) would be willing to move overseas in order to advance their career.

        [ – 15 – ]
         Technological advances in recent years have begun to spark concerns among the general
         public that employers will seek to supplant human workers with robots. However, most young
         people (78.6 %) believe that technology will create jobs rather than obliterate them. When
         asked to name the next big technological trend, 28 % of survey respondents said that artificial
         intelligence will make the most significant impact. Nevertheless, only 3.1 % of respondents
         would trust robots to make decisions on their behalf.

        [ – 16 – ]
         According to the survey, almost three quarters said they would welcome refugees to their
         country. When asked how governments should respond to the international refugee crisis,
         more than half stated that more should be done to include refugees in the national workforce.
         They believe they are living in a time of widespread uncertainty and see the growth of
         isolationism. Nonetheless, the vast majority of young people see themselves as simply
         “human”, as opposed to identifying with a particular country, religion or ethnicity.

                        An extract from Jim the Boy
                 During the night something like a miracle happened:
          Jim’s age grew an extra digit. He was nine years old when he
          went to sleep, but ten years old when he woke up. The extra
          number had weight, like a muscle, and Jim hefted* it like a
    5     prize. The uncles’ ages each contained two numbers, and
          now Jim’s age contained two numbers as well. He smiled and
          stretched and sniffed the morning. Wood smoke; biscuits
          baking; the cool rivery smell of dew. Something not quite
          daylight looked in his window, and something not quite
  10      darkness stared back out. A tired cricket sang itself to sleep.
          The cricket had worked all night. Jim rose to meet the waiting
          day.

                Jim’s mother opened the stove door with a dishrag.
          Mama was tall and pale and handsome; her neck was long
  15      and white. Although she was not yet thirty years old, she wore a long black skirt that had
          belonged to her mother. The skirt did not make her seem older, but rather made the people
          in the room around her feel odd, as if they had wandered into an old photograph and did not
          know how to behave. On the days Mama wore her mother’s long clothes, Jim didn’t let the
          screen door slam.

  20               “There he is,” Mama said. “The birthday boy.”

                 Jim’s heart rose up briefly, like a scrap of paper on a breath of wind, and then quickly
          settled back to the ground. His love for his mother was tethered by a sympathy Jim felt
          knotted in the dark of his stomach. The death of Jim’s father had broken something inside
          her that had not healed. She pulled the heaviness that had once been grief behind her like a
  25      plow. The uncles, the women of the church, the people of the town, had long since given up
          on trying to talk her into leaving the plow where it lay. Instead they grew used to stepping
          over, or walking inside, the deep furrows she left in her wake. Jim knew only that his mother
          was sad, and that he figured somehow in her sadness. When she leaned over to kiss him, the
          lilac smell of her cheek was as sweet and sad at once as the smell of freshly turned earth in
  30      the churchyard.

                   “Oh Jimmy,” she said. “How in the world did you get to be ten years old?”

               “I don’t know, Mama.” Jim said, which was the truth. He was as amazed by the fact as
          she was. He had been alive for ten years: his father, who had also been named Jim Glass, had
          been dead for ten years and a week. It was a lot to think about before breakfast.

                  Editorial: Pain of cyberbullying is all too real




         By Andrew Stone

         Bullies once confined their behaviour to the schoolyard. The intimidating use of digital
         technology has changed all that.
         According to government research, 1 in 10 New Zealanders has received some sort of
         offensive communication over the internet at some point. That number doubles for those aged
   5     between 18 and 29. Other studies show that as many as 1 in 3 high school students have
         endured repeated cyberbullying or harassment.
         Social media, video sharing sites and interactive apps provide an environment where abusive
         trolls co-exist with all the thrilling experiences that the online world delivers.
         What has become clear in the past few years is that the malevolent use of digital technology
  10     is having a pervasive and damaging impact. The effects may leave victims, especially young
         teenage girls, deeply scarred. The impact of cyberbullying on this section of the population
         cannot be underestimated. Increased truancy, failure at school, depression and other
         significant mental health issues have all been linked to hateful posts.
         A year ago, the Harmful Digital Communications Act took effect. Since then, the authorities
  15     have launched 38 prosecutions for offences such as sending harmful private emails or text
         messages. All this shows the legislation was necessary.
         Three of those convicted have been jailed, such was the seriousness of their offending. Their
         punishment sends a signal that the courts recognise the harm cyberbullying can cause.
         The next step comes in November when Netsafe, an online safety organisation, begins its
  20     work. Its role includes advising the public which steps they can take to sort out a problem, as
         well as investigating and attempting to resolve their complaints.
         Its intervention is meant to clear up complaints swiftly and can advise victims on how to obtain
         court orders for unresolved cases.
         Much can be done on the prevention side. Social media giants are accepting that they need to
  25     be responsible in the way they manage digital technology.
         Parents and schools have a special responsibility to oversee the digital behaviour of
         young New Zealanders. The Ministry of Education has a funding deal with Netsafe for their
         programme of cyber education and safety in schools and the wider community.
         Parents need to reassure children they can be safe and secure from cyberbullies and convey
  30     their unconditional support to troubled youngsters.
         However, it is too early to say to what extent the Harmful Digital Communications Act has
         already had any measurable impact on cyberbullying.
