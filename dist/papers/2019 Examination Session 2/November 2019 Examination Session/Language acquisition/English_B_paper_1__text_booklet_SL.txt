              The School Leaver: The challenge of getting
                            your ﬁrst job




        For young people of today, getting a job is a challenge. Because, whether you look for work
         immediately after ﬁnishing school or after further studies, the message is clear: you need a
         job to make getting a job easier.

        One manager, Richard Clarke, put it bluntly in a recent interview: “If I get a CV from
         somebody without a record of part-time work then I won’t consider it, even if it shows good
         grades and qualifications.”

        For Mr Clarke, experience of work shows that the individual can work with others, come to
         work on time, take instruction and show innovation.

        So, how do we get over the “experience problem”?
         Our applications need to stand out, to be memorable and to prove we have some
         work-related skills. The dream application for employers has three positive features: good
         grades, a part-time job, and something extracurricular which looks good.

        Therefore, what do you do when the job requires experience that you don’t already have?

        Here are some ways you might address this problem:

         1.    Get a part-time job. It shows you can be punctual, take instruction, be part of a team
               and take some responsibility.

         2.    [ – X – ]. Volunteering is the easiest way to fill the gap and get hands-on experience.
               Try to volunteer in the field you would like to work in, or a related area.

         3.    [ – 5 – ]. Work out what skills you have, then tailor them to the role you’re applying for.
               Helped organise the school ball? That could be financial and event management.

         4.    [ – 6 – ]. Start to build the number of people who know you are looking for a job.
               Someone may be able to be a positive reference for you.

         5.    [ – 7 – ] before applying for a job. Find out what the organisation does, so that they
               know you’re keen. If you don’t show interest, why should they hire you?

             Choose Love: The shop where you can spend hundreds and walk away with
                                                     nothing
         BY JULIA RAMPEN




                                        Removed for copyright reasons




         “There is a lot to be said for giving people their dignity.” – Choose Love
         Turn off one of London’s main streets, and you’ll come to a small, bright shop on a corner.
         It could be any shop, but there’s a difference. The items on display on the table in the
         middle of the room include life jackets and silvery emergency blankets.

   5     Welcome to Choose Love, where you can come in and shop as much as you want, but not
         take a single thing with you.

         The shop is owned by the charity Help Refugees, who were founded in 2015. While many aid
         agencies have been active for years in conflict zones such as Iraq and Syria, Help Refugees
         focuses on Europe. It currently operates in the Greek islands, Serbia and Calais.

  10     In the shop, all the items displayed on the table represent a part of a refugee’s journey.
         Generally, visitors to the shop pause at the first item they see – a child’s winter jacket. “It’s
         the first day of snow in Calais,” says Tom Steadman, the shop director. “Children are there
         with nothing. On the Greek islands, there are babies on the floor sleeping with no blankets.”
         According to Help Refugees, around 50 % of arrivals on Greek islands are children.

  15     The child’s winter jacket is the most popular item in the shop, and every time a visitor buys
         one, the money is used to buy a child a jacket in Calais or another place of need. But raising
         money is only part of the experience of visiting the shop. As we move from one object to
         another, Steadman keeps up his running commentary.

         “[ – X – ], the average time people spend in a refugee camp is five years.” [ – 16 – ], he moves
  20     to the following section of the table, [ – 17 – ] he points to some things so ordinary I hadn’t
         noticed them – a toothbrush and some other bathroom items. “Many people in Serbia have
         a skin disease [ – 18 – ] they have nothing to wash themselves with. [ – 19 – ], we need to
         give people their dignity.”

          Study Suggests Social Media Attracts People Who
          Need an Ego Boost
          According to a new study from the
          University of Michigan, people who need to
          boost their ego are drawn to social media
          sites like Facebook and Twitter.

   5      The study examined people for evidence
          of having an excessive admiration of
          themselves – or narcissism – and checked
          the results against their conduct on social
          media. It found that people who show a
  10      narcissistic tendency spend more time on
          Twitter and Facebook, posting their own
          messages and reading each post and
          comment of others. The study also found an
          interesting contrast between ways in which narcissistic college students use social media as
  15      compared to older adults.

          “Among college students, we found that those who scored higher for narcissism posted
          more often on Twitter,” said Elliot Panek, a researcher who worked on the study. “On the
          other hand, middle-aged adults with these tendencies posted more frequent status updates
          on Facebook.”

  20      According to Panek, college students with narcissistic personalities gravitate towards Twitter
          because they tend to over-evaluate the importance of their own opinions. “It allows them to
          not only broaden their social circles but also to use it as a kind of megaphone to broadcast
          their thoughts on a wide range of topics and issues,” Panek said.

          For adults, meanwhile, Panek says that Facebook serves as a mirror. “It’s about curating
  25      your own image; how you are seen, and also checking on how others respond to your
          image,” he said. “Most middle-aged adults have already formed their social selves, and they
          use Facebook to gain approval from those who are already in their social circles.”

          The sample size for the study was fairly small: for the student section of the study,
          researchers spoke to 486 undergraduates, three-quarters of whom were female. As for the
  30      adult subjects, only 93 people – “mostly white females” – participated. The average age of
          adult participants was 35.

          The study concludes that a high percentage of frequent social media users show
          narcissistic tendencies. However, at this point, the researchers have not figured out why
          social media and narcissism seem to be connected. It’s a bit like the chicken and the egg.
  35      Does narcissism lead to more social media use, or does using social media make you
          narcissistic?

         This Fifteen-Year-Old is Turning the Tide on Plastic Pollution
         by Sybil Bullock

         Hannah Testa has been working to
         educate and motivate her community to
         take action on ocean plastic pollution.
         She has delivered presentations to
    5    thousands of children and adults across
         the world on how to reduce their plastic
         footprint. Sybil Bullock of Greenpeace
         USA spoke to her.
         [–X–]
  10     People don’t realize how much
         plastic there is in our lives and how it
         is consuming the planet. It is a material that the Earth cannot digest, so it doesn’t really go
         away when you discard it. With the amount of plastic that is disposed of, there is going to be
         a signiﬁcant amount which will end up in our landﬁlls, lakes, and oceans. They are having a
  15     harmful eﬀect on nature and on human health.
         What is the fact you want EVERYONE to know?
         The most shocking statistic is that scientists predict that by 2050, the plastic in the ocean will
         outweigh the ﬁsh! Approximately a truckload of plastic is added to our oceans every minute!
         [ – 35 – ]
  20     We aren’t going to be able to recycle our way out of this problem. I have been educating the
         public on practical ways we can reduce our plastic footprint. As consumers, we can be involved
         by supporting companies that are making sustainable choices. One simple action we can take
         as individuals would be to reduce our reliance on single-use plastics.
         [ – 36 – ]
  25     I decided to contact my local state senator to arrange a face-to-face meeting. It was easy!
         I educated him on the topic of plastic pollution and showed pictures of animals suﬀering due
         to ingesting or being entangled in plastics, because a picture is worth a thousand words. My
         senator loved the idea of an educational event and we ultimately called it Plastic Pollution
         Awareness Day.
  30     [ – 37 – ]
         It doesn’t matter who you are; you can make a diﬀerence. If you dream it and believe it, you are
         halfway there. With the internet and social media, there are many eﬀective ways to make our
         voices heard. We need to care enough to act. If we band together across the world, we can be
         unstoppable. We just need to make it happen!
  35     Check out Hannah’s website for extra inspiration.
