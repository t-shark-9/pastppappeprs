                                        Assessment criteria

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement
to the published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not offered as an
exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be
so heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show an adequate
sense of stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical analysis and pertinent
detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the works,
as well as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers but are unlikely to
be developed.

These apply to all answers below.

A maximum of [5 marks] may be awarded for each of the five criteria.

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors
increase. What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged and
individual essays will usually make themselves clear by showing insight into the implications of the
question and the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first-person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to
demonstrate their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does not
explicitly offer such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly, to ensure that
candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates
to show, as appropriate to the question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character,
setting, structure, voice, etc, are used by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the
question is phrased, candidates must also address related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character
etc, attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                  –4–               N19/1/TEXTP/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be
judged on the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not
exist by itself, but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the
question and by its capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and
coherent essay.

Reminder: in this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a 4, you should ensure that these are well founded before
awarding a 3. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners reluctant
to award 4.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation;
therefore, do not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are
considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.

1.   An adequate to good answer will:
      identify examples of the use of colour in each poet’s work
      attempt to keep colour and how its use reflects emotion and experience as the focus of
       consideration for both poets’ work
      demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of
       the focus of the question
      provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
      ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified, some plausible
       interpretation is provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used
       to reflect the importance of colour
      provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
      use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is
       mostly appropriate

     A good to excellent answer may also:
      judiciously identify and thoughtfully discuss colour and its respective use with purpose and
        clarity
      maintain colour and emotion and experience as the central focus of consideration for both
        poets’ work
      demonstrate strong knowledge and a perceptive understanding of the selected texts
        through the lens of the focus of the question
      systematically ground the analysis in the chosen texts while integrating evidence
        seamlessly into the body of the response
      present perceptive and insightful ideas that are well substantiated with some possible
        evidence of independent and creative thought
      produce a pointed comparative literary analysis that considers effect, specifically to reflect
        the importance of colour
      provide a coherent structure for the response
      use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling
        and sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively
        throughout with an appropriate register.

       work
      demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of
       the focus of the question
      provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
      ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified, some plausible
       interpretation is provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used
       to reflect social tension/s and anxieties
      provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
      use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is
       mostly appropriate.

     A good to excellent answer may also:
      judiciously identify and thoughtfully discuss social tensions and anxieties as manifest in
        each poet’s work within a comparative frame
      maintain social tension and anxiety as the central focus of consideration for both poets’
        work

        seamlessly into the body of the response
      present perceptive and insightful ideas that are well substantiated with some possible
        evidence of independent and creative thought
      produce a pointed comparative literary analysis that considers effect, specifically to reflect
        the poet’s commentary on social tensions and anxieties
      provide a coherent structure for the response
      use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling
        and sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively
        throughout with an appropriate register.

3.   An adequate to good answer will:
      make a sound attempt to define and address the notion of the city. This may include
       anything from the city as a physical landscape to explorations of urban experience, and

4.   An adequate to good answer will:
      make a sound attempt to define and address the notions of strangeness and unfamiliarity.
       The notion of strangeness is subjective, and thus open to interpretation, and therefore a
       range of definitions of the term are possible. This may include anything from cultural
       dissonance to the supernatural and this is permissible if that discussion is plausible and
       relevant to the selected text/s
      attempt to keep strangeness and the unfamiliar as the focus of consideration for both
       poets’ work

       the focus of the question
      provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
      ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified, some plausible
       interpretation is provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used
       to generate a sense of the strange and unfamiliar
      provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
      use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is
       mostly appropriate.

      maintain strangeness and unfamiliarity as the central focus of consideration for both
        poets’ work
      demonstrate strong knowledge and a perceptive understanding of the selected texts
        through the lens of the focus of the question
      systematically ground the analysis in the chosen texts while integrating evidence
        seamlessly into the body of the response
      present perceptive and insightful ideas that are well substantiated with some possible
        evidence of independent and creative thought
      produce a pointed comparative literary analysis that considers effect, specifically to
        generate a sense of strangeness and/or the unfamiliar
      provide a coherent structure for the response
      use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling
        and sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively

      attempt to keep neutrality and observation as the focus of consideration for both poets’
       work
      demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of
       the focus of the question
      provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts

       interpretation is provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used
       to present the poet and her/his observations neutrally
      provide structure and some coherency for the ideas presented with some evidence of
       successful integration of supporting examples
      use language that is clear and coherent with only a few lapses in grammar, spelling and
       sentence structure. Some relevant literary terminology will be used with a register that is
       mostly appropriate.

     A good to excellent answer may also:
      define and explore the notion of a neutral observer with purpose and clarity
      maintain neutrality and observation as the central focus of consideration for both poets’
        work

        seamlessly into the body of the response
      present perceptive and insightful ideas that are well substantiated with some possible
        evidence of independent and creative thought
      produce a pointed comparative literary analysis that considers effect, specifically how the
        poet appears neutral and presents her/his observations neutrally
      provide a coherent structure for the response
      use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling
        and sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively

6.   An adequate to good answer will:
      make a sound attempt to define and address the notion of love. There is scope here for
       the candidate to identify a wide range of forms of love that may include sexual, platonic or
       familial love and these are all permissible if the discussion is plausible and relevant to the
       selected text/s
      attempt to keep love as the focus of consideration for both poets’ work
      demonstrate sound knowledge and understanding of the selected texts through the lens of
       the focus of the question
      provide plausible and relevant ideas that are mostly grounded in the texts
      ensure the literary features of each poet’s work are identified, some plausible
       interpretation is provided and some comparative analysis of how those features are used

        love as a central theme
      provide a coherent structure for the response
      use clear, varied and precise language with very minor to no lapses in grammar, spelling
        and sentence structure. Literary terminology will be used correctly and effectively
