     Maegan designs a decorative glass face for a new Fine Arts Centre. The glass face is made
     up of small triangular panes. The first three levels of the glass face are illustrated in the
     following diagram.

     The 1st level, at the bottom of the glass face, has 5 triangular panes. The 2nd level has 7
     triangular panes, and the 3rd level has 9 triangular panes. Each additional level has 2 more
     triangular panes than the level below it.
