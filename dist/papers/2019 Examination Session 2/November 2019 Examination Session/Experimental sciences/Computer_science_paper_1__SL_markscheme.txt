Subject details:        Computer science SL paper 1 markscheme

Mark allocation

Section A: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 25 marks.
Section B: Candidates are required to answer all questions. Total 45 marks.
           Maximum total = 70 marks.

General

A markscheme often has more specific points worthy of a mark than the total allows. This is intentional.
Do not award more than the maximum marks allowed for that part of a question.

When deciding upon alternative answers by candidates to those given in the markscheme, consider the
following points:

• Each statement worth one point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a
   semi-colon (;).

• An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a “/”; either wording can be
   accepted.

• Words in ( … ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

• If the candidate’s answer has the same meaning or can be clearly interpreted as being the same as
   that in the markscheme then award the mark.

• Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
   correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have not achieved or what they have got wrong.

• Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language; be forgiving of minor linguistic
   slips. In this subject effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

• Occasionally, a part of a question may require a calculation whose answer is required for subsequent
   parts. If an error is made in the first part then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer
   is used correctly in subsequent parts then follow through marks should be awarded. Indicate this
   with “FT”.


General guidance

 Issue            Guidance
 Answering        • In the case of an “identify” question, read all answers and mark positively up to the
 more than           maximum marks. Disregard incorrect answers.
 the quantity     • In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts
 of                 eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two
 responses          descriptions, one description and one identification, or two identifications.
 prescribed       • In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of
 in the             explanations eg “explain two reasons …”, mark the first two correct answers.
 questions          This could include two full explanations, one explanation, one partial
                    explanation etc.

           Cache memory is a memory that a computer microprocessor can access more
           quickly than it can access regular RAM;
           It is integrated directly with the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip which has
           a separate bus interconnect with the CPU;
           and stores frequently used data only until a computer is powered down;
           Thus, when a processor requests data that already has an instance in the cache
           memory; it does not need to go to the main memory or the hard disk to fetch the
           data;

           Cache memory is a small-sized type of volatile computer memory;
           that provides high-speed data access to a processor;
           and stores frequently used computer programs, applications and data;
           Cache memory can be primary or secondary cache memory, where primary
           cache memory is directly integrated to the processor;
           And secondary cache memory is a reserved portion on a disk stores and provide
           access to frequently accessed data/applications from the disk.                       [3 max]

     Abstraction allows us to create a general idea of what the problem is and how to solve
     it;
     Abstraction removes all specific detail, and any patterns that will not help in solving a
     problem. This helps in forming a “model” (If designers don’t abstract they may end up
     with the wrong solution to the problem they are trying to solve);
     Abstraction is widely used because there exist a number of “patterns” in programming
     that keeps repeating in every application/program;
     The pattern corresponding to an issue can be found, then the abstract solution to it can
     be found and implemented, and the problem is solved;
     Most programming languages provide some built-in abstract patterns, which are easy
     to use (some API provides more advanced patterns);

     Abstraction is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in
     order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics;
     In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along
     with encapsulation and inheritance);
     Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about
     an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency;
     The resulting object itself can be referred to as an abstraction, meaning a named entity
     made up of selected attributes and behavior specific to a particular usage of the
     originating entity. Abstraction is related to both encapsulation and data hiding;           [3 max]

           Direct changeover:
           is the cheapest and quickest/the old system is completely switched for the new

           this is straight forward but also the most risky / nothing to fall back on;
           no need to keep data duplicates;
           it allows the organization to change the system when most convenient;
           the employees have very little time in order get use to the new system as the
           change is instantaneous;
           there is a period of time when neither systems are operational;

           Phased conversion:
           method where the old system is still in use but parts of the new system or
           modules are introduced, involves bringing in the new system one step at a time;
           less risky than direct changeover; less risky that the whole system will go wrong/if
           something happens, it will only affect the specific part;
           takes a lot of time;
           employees have enough time for training/to get use to the new system / are
           introduced to the changes in small stages;
           Employees/users could ask for changes which then hold up the installation of the

           share resources such as printers, scanners;

           Communication;
           students/teachers can communicate with people around the world via the

           Interactive teamwork;
           software (like Microsoft Office) enables many users to contribute to a document
           concurrently;

           Flexible access;
           network allows students to access files from different computers (throughout the
           network) (one can begin work on a project on one computer and finish up on
           another);

           Software cost;
           software products are available for networks at a substantial savings in
           comparison to buying individually licensed software;

           Software management;
           load software on the server saves time compared to installing and tracking files
           on independent computers/upgrades are also easier because changes only have
           to be done once on the file server instead of on individual computers;

           Improved network security;

             Interface cards determine the infrastructure of a local area network (LAN);

      Protocols define the rules that govern network communication (for example,
      packet format, type and size, what happens when an error occurs, and which part
      of the network is supposed to handle the error and how);

      Computer networks consists of various types of equipment (such as routers,
      switches, hubs and network interface cards) and the equipment comes from
      different vendors, but they must all work together or the network does not operate
      correctly;

      Protocols work in layers (the highest being what the user sees, and the lowest
      being the wire that the information is transferred along) and these layers
      communicate with each other according to the rules (allowing communication
      to occur accurately and efficiently);                                                  [2 max]

      Data encryption refers to calculations/algorithms that transform plain text into a
      form that is non-readable to unauthorized parties (authorized recipient of an
      encrypted text uses a key and the algorithm to decrypt the data/ to transform
      it to the original plain text version);                                                [1 max]

      Each (wireless network) adapter has a unique label called a MAC address;

      Routers uses these addresses to identify/authenticate computers (routers include
      an option to whitelist or blacklist certain devices based on MAC addresses, so
      access could be restricted to any device which is not in the whitelist);

      One disadvantage is that the whitelist should be amended any time a new device
      is purchased / when access to guests should be granted;

      Also this method is useless against hackers who use programs which intercept
      data passing through network and report the MAC address of any device
      communicating on the network;                                                      [4 max]

      The selection sort algorithm starts by finding the minimum/smallest value in the
      array THREE (containing K elements);
      and moving it to the beginning of the array THREE (element at the first position is
      THREE[0]) / exchanges it with the element in the first position;
      the correct entry is in the first place in the array and the process is repeated on
      the remaining entries / this step is then repeated for the second lowest value,
      then the third, and so on;
      once this has been repeated K-1 times;
      the K-1 smallest entries are in the first K-1 places which leaves the largest
      element in the last place (the array is sorted in ascending order);                   [4]
