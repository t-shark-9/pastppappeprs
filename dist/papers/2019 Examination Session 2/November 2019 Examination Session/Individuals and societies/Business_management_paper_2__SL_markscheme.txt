                                                     Section A
1.   (a)   Define the term margin of safety.                                                        [2]

           In break-even analysis, margin of safety is how much output or sales level can
           fall before a business reaches its break-even point.

           Award [1] for some understanding.

           Award [2] for a clear definition.

     (b)   Using the financial data in Table 1, calculate:

           (i)    the break-even level of output (show all your working);                           [2]

                  [1] can be awarded for the formula on its own OR              .
                                                                          2.5

                  An additional [1] is for the correct answer with working shown.

           (ii)   the percentage of total costs that were fixed costs for last year (show all
                  your working);                                                                    [2]

                                     220 000

                  N.B. OFR rule applies from (i).

                                                                 100 000
                  [1] can be awarded for TFC percentage                 even if the final answer
                                                                 220 000
                  is incorrect.

                  If a candidate has the workings shown (100 000/200 000) and has the answer
                  written out as 45.45, 45.4545, etc. award [2].

                  If a candidate has the workings shown (100 000/200 000) and has the answer
                  written out as 45.5, award [2] award [2].

                  If a candidate has the workings shown (100 000/200 000) and has the answer
                  written out as 45.4 or has a maths error, award [1].

      (iii)   the level of profit for SSH at 2018’s level of production (show all your
              working).                                                                                [2]

              TR  60 000  $4.5  $270 000
              TC  $220 000
              Profit  $50 000

              N.B. OFR rule applies from (i).

(c)   Explain how the introduction of new production methods will affect the total cost
      line in SSH’s break-even chart.                                                                  [2]

      The TC line will shift downwards (by $5000) [1].

      The slope or gradient of the TC line will become flatter (less steep) [1].

      A candidate may draw a sketch to show the impact on TC – this can be awarded
      [2] if it shows TC line shifting downwards and becoming flatter.

      If a candidate says that the total cost line is lower, or something to that affect, award [1].

      If a candidate correctly explains the impact on the break-even point, award [1].

2.   (a)   State two methods of primary market research.                                          [2]

           Types of primary market research include:
            questionnaire/surveys (postal, online, face-to-face)
            focus groups
            interviews (telephone or face-to-face)
            observation.

           Award [1] for each type of market research method identified, up to a maximum
           of [2]. If a candidate names two types of the same method (for example, postal
           survey and online survey), award a maximum of [1].

           Do not accept “Data collected from a business” (or something similar), as
           this wording is insufficiently precise. Many types of data collected from a
           business would be secondary.

     (b)   Calculate, for Option 1:

           (i)   the average rate of return (ARR) (show all your working);                        [2]

      (ii)   the payback period (show all your working).                                      [2]

             Payback period:

             Profit after the first four years is $1 000 000, which means that $100
             remains going into the fifth year, which has anticipated profits of $300.

(d)   Explain one reason why Option 1 may be a less risky investment than Option 2.         [2]

      Reasons that Option 1 may be the less risky of the two investments include:
       Lesser capital outlay. The success of Option 2 relies heavily on strong and
        growing demand year on year. Were that demand not to materialize, the
        returns on the investment would fall and it would take longer to recoup the
        investment cost.
       In the early years, Option 1 has higher profits as a percentage of investment
        than Option 2. Forecasts become more problematic the further out they go in
        years. Option 1 will see a fairly significant recovery of investment in the early
        years, whereas Option 2 is very dependent on demand of 20 % growth
        through five years. Profit of $622 080 is crucial to the success of Option 2.

      Accept any other relevant response.

      Award [1] for identification of a reason why Option 1 may be safer and award [2]
      for an explanation of why Option 1 may be safer. Application is largely built into
      the question.

                                              Section B
3.   (a)   Describe one feature of a multinational company (MNC).                               [2]

            MNCs operate in more than one country. Their headquarters are located in
             one country (home country) while operations are carried out in a number of
             other countries (host countries).
            Because of their international operations, they usually have large physical and
             financial assets and turnover.
            MNCs are often large-sized and exercise a great degree of economic
             dominance.
            MNCs may control production activity with large foreign direct investment in
             more than one developed and developing countries.

           Award [1] for each feature stated and award an additional [1] for a description up
           to a maximum of [2].

           For a statement like “A multinational company operates in two or more countries”
           but with no further description, award [1].

     (b)   Calculate TS’ market share in 2018.                                                  [2]

                       100  10 %
           50 000 000

           Award [1] for the correct answer and [1] for correct working.

           If no workings are shown, but the final answer is correct, award a maximum of
           [1].

     (c)   Explain two disadvantages and one advantage to TS of selling its products
           online.                                                                              [6]

           Like other businesses in the industry, TS may find selling online increasingly
           problematic due to the associated costs. Customer complaints about TS’ website
           and ordering problems are already increasing. Costs of dealing with customer
           complaints, technical issues and delivery problems may increase and reduce
           profit.

           TS’ brand image may be eroded due to its inefficient way of dealing with online
           sales. Its unfriendly website and increasing customer complaints are probably
           eroding its brand image and market share. If TS wants to increase international
           presence and expand its market, it should improve its current online sales
           system.

           On the other hand, TS’ sales and profits can increase by taking advantage of
           e-commerce’s rapid growth. It can also take advantage of a potential market
           opportunity left by the competing businesses in the industry that are experiencing
           problems with online sales.

           TS’ international presence is weak; selling online can help to create brand
           awareness in international markets and reach a worldwide audience with
           relatively low costs.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Mark as 2 + 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for each correct advantage/disadvantage identified and [1] for a
      relevant explanation with application to TS. Award up to a maximum of [2] per
      advantage/disadvantage explained.

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and/or application.

      For example: For an identification/description of an advantage/disadvantage with
      or without application [1]. For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no
      application [1].
      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   With reference to TS, evaluate the two merger options.                                 [10]

      Merging with All Champion:

      Top Star is a manufacturer. Prior to either Option 1 or Option 2, TS had no brick-
      and-mortar retail outlets. The merger with the footwear manufacturer All
      Champion (AC) will produce gains in economies of scale, and will give TS the
      possibility of growing.

      As a multinational company, AC has access to more and cheaper resources such
      as finance. Additional finance will allow for research and development of new
      products. TS will be able to develop the new line of running shoes and expand its
      product portfolio.

      Merging with AC will also allow for rationalization of resources, such as
      concentrating output on one site and concentrating managerial and technical
      capacities. For instance, TS will have access to larger IT and marketing
      departments to improve its website and deal with online sales more efficiently.

      A merger with AC eliminates a strong competitor in the market. The two
      companies might have different strengths and experiences and they, therefore,
      could fit well together. The new merged company will probably be stronger and
      could therefore increase its competitive power in the market. AC´s market share
      (only 10 %) will increase.

      On the other hand, a merger with AC may have a number of drawbacks. In a
      merger process, the smaller company, such as TS, could be cannibalized by the
      larger one. TS’ culture may be dissolved within AC’s way of doing things. There
      are also high chances that some of AC’s factories will be closed, causing
      discontent within the local community. The finance manager is right to be
      suspicious about this merger. TS’ reputation may be hurt due to the possibilities
      of closing factories and sales may fall.

      Merging with a footwear retailer:
      If TS merges with a footwear retailer with a strong presence in domestic and
      international markets, it will secure an outlet for its products. TS will be able to
      increase its domestic market share of 10 % and additionally access the
      international markets, using the experience, knowledge and expertise of the
                                      – 13 –              N19/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


footwear retailer. TS will keep the manufacturing process and then factories will
not close. In addition, the risks of cannibalization of this option are low.

However, this merger may not exclude a strong competitor such as AC.
Production economies of scale will not be gained, as the footwear retailer has no
experience in the footwear manufacturing process.

Overall, merging with AC will give Top Star the competitive edge needed to grow
and develop its product portfolio. On the other hand, merging with a footwear
retailer also has some evident advantages, but it seems that merging with AC
looks like a stronger choice.

It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated
judgment.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

If a candidate evaluates / addresses only one merger option, award a maximum
of [5].

A balanced response is one that provides at least one argument for and one
argument against each merger option.

Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance as long as at
least two arguments are given for each option.

Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in the answer.

4.   (a)   State two types of above-the-line promotion.                                         [2]

           Appropriate types of above-the-line promotion include:
            newspapers
            magazines
            radio advertisements
            television advertisements.

           Accept any other relevant answer, including “advertising on the Internet” or “the
           Internet.”

           Award [1] for each appropriate type of above the line promotion up to [2].

     (b)   Using Table 1, construct a product position map/perception map for all four
           hotels prior to the opening of GR.                                                   [4]




           Award [1] for the overall layout of the map with both axes labelled correctly
           (price: high or low; service: high or low).

           N.B. It does not matter which one is horizontal/vertical.

           The correct positioning is as shown above. Adjust appropriately if a candidate
           makes the price the vertical axis and quality the horizontal axis.

           Award [2] for a correctly labelled position map with two of the companies properly
           placed.

           Award [3] for a correctly labelled position map with three of the companies
           properly placed.

           Award [4] for a correctly labelled position map with all four companies properly
           placed.
                                      – 15 –              N19/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



The position map has been scaled from $155–$245 for the horizontal axis and 3
stars to 5 stars for the vertical axis. If candidates scale the perception map
differently (1 to 5 stars, for example), mark accordingly and per the explanation
for [1], [2], [3] and [4] above.

The candidates were asked to position the four hotels prior to the opening of the
GR. The four hotels represent the full range of the market (at the time, before
GR opened) and, therefore, the positioning should be as shown above.
However, candidates may consider a 3-star hotel to be “middle quality” rather
than low quality because three is the mid-point between 1 star and 5 star. Thus,
some candidates may position the four hotels more toward quadrant one than
they should.

Nevertheless, examiners should have some forbearance: as long as the relative
position of the hotels is accurate, award marks appropriately. For example, the
position map below would earn [4].




N.B. If the relative position is correct but the candidate has compressed the
positions of the four hotels into one quadrant (which would typically be quadrant
1), award a maximum of [3].

(c)   Explain two ways in which GR is able to offer rooms at a lower price than IF.           [4]

      Three ways in which GR is able to have lower costs than traditional hotels
      include:
       more modest rooms, which include smaller room size and less elegant
         furniture
       lower personnel costs, as much of the traditional staff is replaced by kiosks
         and automated billing
       Fewer amenities, like a swimming pool and a high-quality restaurant.

      Accept any other relevant example.

      If a candidate refers to the airport versus city-centre location and assumes that the
      airport location is less expensive, award [1].

      Mark as [2 + 2].

      Award [1] for identification of a way to lower costs and an additional [1] for an
      explanation thereof.

(d)   Discuss possible changes to IF's marketing mix to reduce the loss of customers
      to GR.                                                                               [10]

      Main differences in the marketing mix of the two hotels are:


                           Imperial Falls                     Guest Rooms

                                                Clean, appropriate amenities for
       Product          Elegant/high end
                                                business travellers, though not elegant.

                                                Lower cost, though there is the
       Price            High
                                                membership fee.

       Place            Same/City centre        Same/Near airport.

                                                Both above-the-line promotion and
       Promotion        Limited
                                                social media marketing.

      The question of place is tricky. At one level of argument, place is different than
      location. However, in the case of a hotel, place and location are virtually
      indistinguishable, as hotels are ontologically a venue where customers rent
      rooms for the night. Thus, in the case of hotels, place devolves to location.
                                       – 18 –               N19/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Possible changes to the IF’s marketing mix include:
 Product: Cutting back on amenities and passing some of those savings on to
  customers via lower room rental rates. There are negatives to this tack. First,
  a reduction of amenities could be viewed as a deterioration of the high quality,
  which is currently IF’s USP.
 Price: Reducing the rates that it charges for rooms. If prices are lowered and
  changes are not made in quality of service or amenities, IF could experience
  lower profits. IF would certainly experience lower profits per room. Unclear is
  whether the lower prices would lead to higher occupancy.
 Promotion: Increasing its promotion. IF has three noteworthy features that GR
  does not have: elegance, five-star quality and a central city centre location.
  With greater promotion, IF may be able to attract customers back based upon
  the convenience of being in the city centre and the elegance of staying in an
  old palace.
 Place/Location: It is not very realistic to think that IF would or could change its
  location. Any discussion of location will probably occur under promotion,
  whereby candidates will discuss ways in which IF can, through promotion,
  make their location in the city centre a selling point.

Remember that at standard level, the candidates are not expected to know the
extended marketing mix but rather just the four Ps: price, place, promotion,
product. Candidates should not be penalized if they address the extended
marketing mix.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3 with further
guidance below.

N.B. The marks listed in the far right column are maximum awards. Candidates
could technically have a response that addresses two Ps in a balanced way yet
still lacks the depth, precision, or application for [4] (for example).

5.   (a)   Describe one disadvantage of operating as a public limited company.                      [2]

           Disadvantages of operating as a public limited company include:
            The expense of going public and the ongoing expenses of reporting to the
              government or shareholders.
            Loss of privacy, as the company must report to the public and to shareholders.
            Strategic decisions can take longer, as management has responsibility to
              communicate with the board, shareholders, and, often, other stakeholders.
            Risk of takeover.

           Unless candidates otherwise have elements in their response deserving marks,
           do not award any marks for statements such as “dilution of control” or “the owner
           will not have full control.” Answers such as these two show a significant
           misunderstanding.

           Award [1] for an identification of a disadvantage and another [1] for sufficient
           description thereof.

     (b)   Explain one benefit and one cost to FA of having an autocratic leadership style.         [4]

           In the stimulus it is indicated that FA has an autocratic leadership style. This style
           appears to dovetail with the culture of the less economically developed country.
           Also, the factory is profitable and has been efficient through lower costs. It is
           possible that the leadership style fosters loyalty in this country because of the
           cultural fit.

           The costs to FA include that autocratic leadership may stifle creativity and
           innovation, which could be available in a more democratic system. Productivity in
           Germany could be higher than in a less economically developed country. The fact
           that FA’s leadership is thinking of relocating to Germany indicates that they see
           problems in moving to a new, higher-price segment.

           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1] for each relevant benefit / cost explained and [1] with application to FA.
           Award up to a maximum of [2] per benefit/cost explained.

           [2] cannot be awarded per benefit / cost if the response lacks either explanation
           and / or application.

           For example: For an identification/description of a benefit / cost with or without
           application [1]. For explanation of a benefit / cost with no application [1].

(c)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of FA on the less economically
      developed country.                                                                     [4]

      Positive impacts of FA on the developing country include:
       Provides employment at wages better than those available in the less
        economically developed country.
       Was loyal during the civil war.

      Theoretically possible other positive impacts include:
       Technology and skill transfers from FA’s host country to the less economically
        developed country.

      Negative impacts of FA on the less economically developed country include:
       FA relies on an autocratic leadership style.
       FA does not use the most advanced technology in the less economically
        developed country.
       FA could leave the country, leaving many people who are currently dependent
        on the company out of work.
       FA does not provide the same employee rights provisions or health and safety
        provisions that it would in a less economically developed country.

      Theoretically possible other negative impacts include:
       FA may pollute to a level in the less economically developed country that it
        would not in Germany.

      Mark as [2 + 2]. For [2], candidates must identify a positive and a negative
      impact, explain it, and apply to the less economically developed country.

      Award [2] for a positive impact with application to the less economically
      developed country.

      Award [2] for a negative impact with application to the less economically
      developed country.

      If there is no application to the less economically developed country at all then
      the maximum mark per impact is [1].

(d)   Evaluate the option of building a factory in, and relocating to, Germany.             [10]

      The option of building a factory in and relocating to Germany is a major strategic
      decision. In certain respects, FA would be an entirely different company: new
      products, new processes, new types of workers and new leadership styles, as
      well as a wholly new cultural context. Going into highly sophisticated high-tech
      manufacturing with robots has the potential to position FA for a future of highly
      automated manufacturing. Without making these changes, FA runs some risk of
      remaining stuck in much lower value-added processes, which in the long run are
      less profitable. The risks are very high. The potential rewards are high as well.

      Perhaps a strategy for FA would be not to sell the older factory but to continue to
      operate it and rely on those profits to support the new factory as it gets started.
      Whether FA’s balance sheet is strong enough to operate both factories is an
      open question, as is the question of whether its management has sufficient depth
      to operate two major plants.

      Balance in this context means having two arguments for opening the plant in
      Germany and two arguments against, which could be partially couched in a
      discussion of leaving the old plant open.

                                               Section C
Questions 6–8. Please mark the candidate response using the assessment criteria on pages 4–5.

6.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of globalization
      on business ethics.                                                                          [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
      distribution strategy.                                                                       [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which culture
      can promote or inhibit change.                                                               [20]

N.B. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect
of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
 Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
 Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1  1 arguments are expected per concepts.
 Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
   – therefore accept 2  2 arguments for a balanced response.
 Justification is through logic or data.
 For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
 For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
 Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
 The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
 A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
   between the introduction and the conclusion.
 Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
 One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
 For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
 The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
 Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.
