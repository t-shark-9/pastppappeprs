Prescribed subject 1: Military leaders

Read sources A to D and answer questions 1 to 4. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Genghis Khan (c1200–1227) — Impact: Political impact: administration; overthrowing of existing ruling
systems; establishment of Mongol law/Yassa; move towards meritocracy.

Source A                 David O Morgan, a university professor of Mongol history writing in the academic
                         paper “The ‘Great Yassa of Chingiz [Genghis] Khan’ and Mongol Law in the
                         Ilkhanate” for the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (1986).

Let me first of all outline the view that is usually taken of the Yassa. At some time during his reign and
probably at the quriltai [council] of 1206, Chingiz [Genghis] Khan instituted a code of laws which were
to be binding on his people and their descendants for ever. This was a codification of the ancestral
traditions, customs, laws and ideas of the Mongols, to which Chingiz Khan added further laws of his
own devising. Copies of this great code, the Yassa, were kept in the treasuries of the Mongol princes for
consultation as need arose. No complete copy has survived, but it is possible to assemble “fragments” of
the code from various sources, and by careful study of these fragments the general pattern of the Yassa
can be recovered.

[Genghis Khan] established a rule for every occasion and a regulation for every circumstance; while for
every crime he fixed a penalty. And since the Tartar peoples had no script of their own, he gave orders
that Mongol children should learn writing from the Uighur [a Muslim minority ethnic group]; and that
these Yasas [Yassas] and ordinances should be written down on rolls. These rolls are called the Great
Book of Yasas and are kept in the treasury of the chief princes. Wherever a khan ascends the throne, or
a great army is mobilized, or the princes assemble ... concerning affairs of state and the administration
thereof, they produce these rolls and model their actions thereon; and proceed with the disposition
[deployment] of armies or the destruction of provinces and cities in the manner therein prescribed.

Prescribed subject 2: Conquest and its impact

Read sources E to H and answer questions 5 to 8. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
The conquest of Mexico and Peru (1519–1551) — Impact: Cultural interaction and exchange.

Source E               Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a Spanish soldier who served under Hernán Cortés,
                       writing in his memoirs, A True and Full Account of the Discovery and Conquest of
                       Mexico and New Spain (c1568).

Motecusuma [Moctezuma II] conducted Cortés to an elevated seat at his right hand. Cortés … [revealed
to Motecusuma] the commandments of our God. We were Christians, believing in one true God only,
Jesus Christ, who suffered and died for our salvation. We prayed to the cross as a symbol of that cross
on which our Lord and Saviour was crucified. Those figures, on the contrary, which he [Motecusuma]
considered as gods, were no gods, but devils.

Motecusuma replied: “I am not ignorant of what you have stated concerning the cross. We, however,
maintained silence, as the gods we adore were adored in past ages by our ancestors. We have, once
[and] for all, acknowledged them as good gods, in the same way as you have yours, and therefore let us
talk no further on this subject. Respecting the creation of the world, we likewise believe it was created
many ages ago. We likewise believe that you are those people whom our ancestors prophesied would
come from the rising of the sun, and I feel myself indebted to your great emperor, to whom I will send a
present of the most valuable things I possess.”


Source F               Roberto Cueva del Río, a Mexican artist, depicts an encounter between the
                       Aztecs, the Spanish and Malinche in two panels of the mural The meeting of
                       Moctezuma II and Cortés (1976).

Source G               Miguel León-Portilla, a Mexican anthropologist and historian specializing in
                       ancient Mexico, writing in the academic book The Broken Spears: The Aztec
                       Account of the Conquest of Mexico (2007).

[The rapid spread of] Aztec rule and culture over vast regions was contemporaneous with another
expansionist movement, and the latter, with superior weapons, techniques and tactics, proved much the
more powerful. When the Old World and the New World met face to face, their attitudes towards each
other were very different. The Aztecs thought the strangers were [the ancient god] Quetzalcoatl and
other gods returning from over the sea, while the Spaniards—despite their amazement at the splendors
of Tenochtitlan—considered the Aztecs barbarians and thought only of seizing their riches and of forcing
them to become Christians and Spanish subjects.

This confrontation, vividly described both by the conquistadores and the natives, was something more
than a meeting between two expanding nations; it was the meeting of two radically dissimilar cultures,
two radically different modes of interpreting existence. Spain … was the greatest power in Europe.
The Aztec state had also reached a climax, and its magnificence was evident in its capital city and its
vigorous religious, social, economic and political structure.

Prescribed subject 3: The move to global war

Read sources I to L and answer questions 9 to 12. The sources and questions relate to case study 1:
Japanese expansion in East Asia (1931–1941) — Responses: Political developments within China — the
Second United Front.

Source I               Mao Zedong in an interview with the American journalist Edgar Snow. Mao’s
                       secretary was the interpreter (16 July 1936).

In the anti-Japanese war, the Chinese people would have on their side greater advantages than those
the Red Army has utilized in its struggle with the Guomindang. China is a very big nation, and … if Japan
should succeed in occupying even a large section of China, getting possession of an area with as many
as 100 or even 200 million people, we would still be far from defeated …

As for munitions, the Japanese cannot seize our arsenals [military stores] in the interior, which are
sufficient to equip Chinese armies for many years, nor can they prevent us from capturing great amounts
of arms and ammunitions from their own hands …

Economically, of course, China is not unified. But the uneven development of China’s economy also
presents advantages in a war against the highly centralized and highly concentrated economy of Japan
… It is impossible for Japan to isolate all of China: China’s Northwest, Southwest, and West cannot be
blockaded by Japan.

The central point of the problem becomes the mobilization and unification of the entire Chinese people
and the building up of a united front.

                       China: An Introduction (1984).

In December 1936, Jiang [Jieshi] flew up to Xian in Shaanxi province to press upon Zhang Xueliang
the urgency of completing the “annihilation” of the Communists before confronting the Japanese.
Upon arrival he was kidnapped by Zhang, who had been influenced by the Communists’ argument
that the Chinese were shamefully fighting other Chinese at a time when Japan threatened … At this
point, the Soviet Union intervened. Stalin sent a telegram to the Chinese Communists declaring that
unless they arranged for the release of Jiang he would publicly renounce them as Communists and
declare them to be mere “bandits”. Finally, an agreement was worked out between the Communists
and the Guomindang. Jiang declared that he would firmly lead the national resistance against any
further Japanese demands, and the Communists committed their forces to operating under the national
command and promised to cease their partisan revolutionary propaganda. Jiang was released on
Christmas Eve, 1936, and the Chinese nation seemed again to be moving towards genuine national
unity.

Prescribed subject 4: Rights and protest

Read sources M to P and answer questions 13 to 16. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Apartheid South Africa (1948–1964) — Protests and action: Official response: the Rivonia Trial
(1963–1964) and the imprisonment of the ANC leadership.

Source M                  Timothy Juckes, a professor of psychology, writing in the general history book
                          Opposition in South Africa: The Leadership of ZK Matthews, Nelson Mandela
                          and Stephen Biko (1995).

When the Defiance Campaign had failed to win concessions from the government, and instead
precipitated [advanced] further repressive legislation, the society was further polarized and Mandela saw
the need to prepare the ANC for a period of underground organization. Now, the government crackdown
that began with the treason arrests in 1956 and accelerated after Sharpeville had removed opposition
leaders, outlawed opposition organizations and left people frustrated, demanding militancy from their
leaders. Conditions in the country demanded either submission to the power of the state or resistance
through an underground organization. Furthermore, if the ANC did not coordinate a violent struggle,
suggestions that some frustrated people in urban areas might resort to random, unorganized violence
might be realized, and this could lead to uncontrolled civil strife [chaos].

The activists, therefore, justified the expansion of their opposition to include armed resistance. As
Mandela argued, “fifty years of non-violence had brought the African people nothing but more and more
repressive legislation ... all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us”.

                          Documentary Survey (1991).

The Rivonia Trial 1963 marked an end to an era of growing African nationalist protest. For a time, the
ANC and its allies had openly challenged the National Party regime and had begun to seize the political
initiative, but the government had moved quickly to restore its control. The African political voice was
now effectively silenced.

Rivonia marked the beginning of an era, that of Nelson Mandela as the symbol of the African struggle
for freedom in South Africa. It was not, however, only Mandela’s sentence of life imprisonment but also
his personal testimony that marked the Rivonia Trial ... His trial testimony received wide publicity, first in
news accounts of the trial and then in a collection of his trial addresses published in Britain.

                          The Observer (1 March 1964).

The charges, if proven, can carry the death sentence; therefore a real possibility exists that some of the
accused, including Mandela, could be hanged.

If this were to happen, it would have very large repercussions [consequences]. It would produce the first
African martyrs. It would make the conscience of America and Britain—where Mandela enjoys great
personal prestige—much more uncomfortable. And it would proclaim clearly that South Africa is now in
a state of war. But whatever the verdict, it is clear that the trial will be a landmark in the African political
movement for it is unlikely that Mandela will want to refute [reject] the charge that he has resorted to
violent means …

The Rivonia trial, together with the mass arrests in the Pan-African Congress and the exodus of leaders,
has produced a major setback for the African resistance … The individual African leadership, prominent
for the last 10 years, is now in effect incapacitated [severely weakened] inside the republic …

It is still too early to have a very clear picture of the new leadership that is emerging out of despair. It
does not, astonishingly, seem noticeably anti-white, but it will certainly be less sophisticated, less
moderate and much more secretive than its predecessors.

Prescribed subject 5: Conflict and intervention

Read sources Q to T and answer questions 17 to 20. The sources and questions relate to case study 2:
Kosovo (1989–2002) — Impact: International reaction and impact; International Criminal Tribunal for the
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY); indictment of Milosevic.

Source Q                 An online news report entitled “Milosevic indictment makes history” on the
                         website of the US-based Cable News Network (CNN) (27 May 1999).

The reaction around the world to Milosevic’s indictment was mixed. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said
the bombing would continue until Yugoslavia agreed to the five conditions the alliance set for a bombing
halt … U.S. President Bill Clinton said the indictment would “reassure the victims of Belgrade’s atrocities
in Kosovo, and will deter future war crimes by establishing that those who give the orders will be held
accountable.” In a written statement … Clinton called on all nations to “support the tribunal’s decision
and to cooperate with its efforts to seek justice” …

In Moscow, Russia’s Foreign Ministry called the decision “politicized,” and said it will only complicate
negotiations. But officials in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo told CNN the indictment will “end the tragedy
in the region” …

China—whose embassy in Belgrade was bombed in a misdirected NATO attack—expressed concern
that the indictments could hurt peace talks.

                          Politics and Diplomacy (2004).

In the immediate aftermath of Milosevic’s downfall in October 2000, Western leaders took a conciliatory
[reasoned] tone, choosing not to force the issue [of his arrest] in such a fragile political environment.
The [International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY] Prosecutor, Carla del Ponte,
travelled to Belgrade to press the issue in January 2001; and momentum gradually built, which resulted
in the transfer of Milosevic to The Hague on 28 June 2001. Although the oil embargo and flight ban
were lifted in October 2000, the United States and the United Kingdom were determined to retain key
sanctions until Milosevic was handed over. This policy was not shared by the whole of the European
Union, however; Italy and Germany were alleged to be keen to lift sanctions, and even to grant
immunity to Milosevic. In February, the United States made the provision of an aid package worth $100
million conditional on concrete signs of cooperation and imposed a deadline of 31 March 2001. On
9 March 2001, the United States specified exact conditions, one of which was the arrest of Milosevic
… In the end, the combination of withholding financial assistance and international isolation, coupled
with domestic political manoeuvrings in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and Serbia, led to
Milosevic’s detention and transfer to The Hague. The day after Milosevic was transferred, $1.3 billion
worth of aid was pledged to the FRY.
