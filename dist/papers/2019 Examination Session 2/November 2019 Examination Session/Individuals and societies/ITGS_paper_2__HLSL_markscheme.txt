Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment
criterion has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate
range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels
failure to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

 The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

 The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
   the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
   when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
   should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
   necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

 When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion
   until they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed.
   If a piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and
   the one that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

 Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
   if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should
   award the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

 Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
   acceptable.

 Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
   the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
   a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
   the work being assessed.

 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
   attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
   low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
   other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will
   produce any particular distribution of marks.

 The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

                                           Theme: Health
Criterion A — The issue and stakeholder(s)                                                        [4]

1.   (a)   Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system in the article.

           [1]: for identification of the concern (which does not have to be explicitly named).

           [2]: there needs to be an explicit description of the
           impact/result/consequences/effect/outcome on the trainee surgeon, senior
           doctor, patient, hospital administrators, VR developers.

           Social/ethical concerns may include:
            Reliability and accuracy of simulations: computerized video simulations
             instead of real surgery videos used on simulations – Possible impact may
             provide an inferior learning environment for the trainee surgeon
            Reliability such as the delay to capture the trainee’s movement; Possible
             impact: may negatively affect the trainee’s performance & learning experience,
             reliability/accuracy of sensors – Possible impact: may not give accurate
             readings and negatively affect trainee’s assessment
            People and machines: trainees relying too much on virtual training and not
             being exposed enough to real surgeries – Possible impact: trainee surgeons
             may only experience limited surgical cases and not be well prepared for
             surgery
            Digital divide – not all hospitals have access to virtual training; cost of VR
             equipment; need of strong network infrastructure – Possible impact: patients in
             remote areas may not benefit from surgeons who have undergone this training
            Digital divide – Not enough simulations/number of sessions for trainee –
             Possible impact: Insufficient sessions mean that trainees are not exposed to a
             wide variety of situations
            Policies – create policies that protect the anonymity of the trainee surgeons
             regarding the sharing of recordings – Possible impact: their initial attempts at
             surgery may negatively affect job prospects.

(b)       Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system in the
          article.

          [1]: Who – identification of the stakeholder.

          [2]: What are they doing with the IT system and Where in the IT system
          (technical part).

          Primary stakeholders may include:
           trainee surgeon who uses VR simulated surgeries to gain surgical skills
           trainee surgeon who reviews captured video during the training session to
             analyse the procedure/get feedback on their performance
           senior surgeon (Dr Gerber) who use VR-simulated surgeries to train trainee
             surgeons
           senior surgeon (Dr Gerber) who reviews the captured videos to analyse
             trainees’ performance and plan further training
           senior surgeon (Dr Gerber) who shares the captured videos to use in training
             lectures
           hospital administrator who provides both VR equipment and network
             infrastructure
           IT Department staff in the hospital who must be trained on the use and
             functionality of VR equipment to give IT support to senior and trainee
             surgeons
           developers of VR simulated surgeries who work on updates and
             improvements to the VR system.

          Add any additional marking notes here.

2.   (a)   Describe, step-by-step, how the IT system works.
           IT system: Virtual reality headsets, screen capture software, hand controls and
           sensors.

           Add description of the steps for this IT system.

           [1]: The student may show some understanding of the process but not in a step
           by step approach – using the information in the article and possibly some steps
           missing.

           [2]: The student is able to provide a logical step by step account using the
           information in the article but lacks some details. Must contain at least two major
           steps from the article. No developments present. Best fit if contains
           developments/information beyond the article but not in step by step.

           [3]: The student is able to provide a step by step account which may be detailed
           It must contain at least two steps that go beyond the Article.

           [4]: At least four technical developments that go beyond the Article.

            follow Guided audio instructions on the simulation
            move hand control to perform simulated surgery
            sensors (haptic) to detect touch and pressure on the surgical instruments
            move head to capture the 360 degree surrounding if necessary.

           Recording of the procedure
            initiate screen capturing software
            2D Image from screen is recorded
            training session is saved locally and then resaved to hospital server
            captured video is downloaded and analysed by senior surgeons and by
             trainee
            captured video is shared and used as a training tool.

Answers with additional information to that in the article may include:
VR Headset
 log in to select type of training and to enter personal details
 place headset on head;
 place handset
 load the selected operation
 get reaction from movement such as head tracking
 accelerometer picks up details of the rapidity of the trainee’s hand movements
 sensors allow the duration of the different actions during the operation to be
  calculated
 surround audio recreate body sounds and body reaction to trainees’
  movements
 IR sensors monitor the eye movements
 image reacts according to the movements detected by the sensors
 audio changes according to the head movements
 trainee’s pulse rate recorded to indicate the effect on them during the
  operation.

Recording of the procedure
 uploading to the cloud
 sharing of information via secure web platform with other hospitals to act as a
  teaching tool.

(b)   Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
      described in Criterion A.

      Explaining the link between the concern and specific parts, or whole, of the IT
      system means the student must include how and why the concern has arisen
      from the use of the IT system. The naming of the concern identified in Criterion A
      may be implicit.

      Q2(b) clearly asks for a link to Q1(a), but the link only needs to be generic –
      eg for a specific security concern described in Q1(a), then in Q2(b) the student
      can explain a security weaknesses without reference to the specific concern in
      Q1(a). If the concern addressed in Q2(a) is completely different from that in Q1(a)
      a link cannot be made and hence [0].
      Q2(b) can also be related back to Q1(b) where the who and what and where of
      the IT system usage are described.

      [1]: If the student identifies the relationship between the concern and the IT
      system. This may be a repeat/rewording, of the response to Q1(a) or lack of
      detail for the how and why.

      [2]: How and why the concern can happen must be described in technical IT and
      ITGS terms: eg privacy: responses need to specify how (technical) the data can
      be accessed (similar to some of the steps for Q2(a)) and why it has been allowed
      to be accessed (eg lack of privacy settings – weakness with the technology).

      Answers may include:
       reliability – the latency of the system, does the system react quickly enough to
        the hand movements of the trainee surgeon. Why: sensors are not accurate
       reliability – the accuracy of the sensors, do the sensors accurately record the
        head and hand movements of the trainee. Why: not well positioned/adapted to
        trainee’s head/hand; trainees’ sweat affects readings, etc
       reliability – the accuracy/detail of the VR environment. Why: sound is not
        clear; image on screen is distorted
       digital divide – the network infrastructure that may not be able to support the
        VTR system / bandwidth. Why: simulators images and software are heavy and
        require lots of storage space
       digital divide – power hungry and processor hungry system. Need of extra
        space to save all sessions and simulations. Why: videos will be used for future
        training and need to be saved
       digital divide – may not be able to get technical support for hardware/software
        as the technology is cutting edge. Why: lack of trained technical staff in certain
        countries/areas
       policies – create policies that protect the anonymity of the trainee surgeons
        regarding the sharing of recordings, Why lack of safe authentication of trainee
        and safe storage of logon details and recordings
       policies – one that addresses the legal issues that are associated with newly
        qualified surgeons who have been trained using the VR system rather than the
        “traditional” approach. Why not enough face-to-face training.

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                          [8]

3.   Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders.

     Marking is to be done holistically focusing on determining the correct markband and
     then the level in the markband using the guidelines attached to each markband.

     Impact = result/consequence/effect/outcome on stakeholder – positive and negative.

     The evaluation should focus on the overall impact on all the stakeholders mentioned
     discussing the balance between the positive and negative impacts.

     At least two stakeholders are required for entrance into the top markband.
     [1]: One or two impacts identified.

     [2]: More than two impacts described of either type – positive or negative.

     [3]: Analysis by structure – division into groups eg positive/negatives and/or various
     Stakeholders.

     [4]: At least two negative and one positive impact for at least two stakeholders in order
     to provide a balanced analysis in the top markband. Only one stakeholder analysed or
     unbalanced analysis maximum of [4].

     [5]: Must include some linking analytical connections (between positive/negatives,
     various stakeholders, various issues) and/or and added evaluative comments about
     the implications for stakeholders.

     [6]: Fully analysed and evaluated. Significant analytical connections and evaluation
     comments require clear evidence of additional thinking beyond descriptions and
     structure.

     [7–8]: A conclusion backed by direct reference to the impacts described is needed and
     not just a repetition or summary – it needs to be argued based on the evidence.

Criterion D — A solution to a problem arising from the article                                    [8]

4.   Evaluate one possible solution that addresses at least one problem identified in
     Criterion C.

     Problem must be specified here, but if this is not done here, it must be one of the
     impacts/problems identified in Criterion C. The ONE solution may refer to any of the
     problems. Mark the first solution only.

     [1]: Solution is identified.

     [2]: Solution is described (what, who, where) and the link to article may be implicit,
     which could be a general description eg general policy description similar to that found
     in a textbook.

     [3]: The solution is applied to the problem directly and not generally – how and why it
     solves the problem (first positive evaluation). The solution must be feasible and can be
     applied to the problem, even if not good “quality”.

     [4–5]: At least one more positive evaluation and at least one negative evaluation is
     required. Best fit if description is limited.

     [6]: Fully evaluated strengths and weaknesses requires a balance of at least two
     positive and two negative evaluations.

     [7–8]: Concluding paragraph directly referencing the evaluations. Students may
     propose future developments in response to the evaluations, such as solution/s to the
     negative evaluations, as part of the conclusion – best fit applies if included instead of
     discussion of evaluations.

     Best fit also applies if a student has not fully described the solution or provided the
     minimum four evaluations.

     Answers may include:
      not realistic: Combining face-to-face with VR training
      not realistic: add more sensors (eg: haptic)
      not realistic: instead of computer generated images use footage of real
       operations/use scans eg MRI scans
      latency within the system: faster data transfer
      lack of immediate feedback: teaching information/instruction on the screen on how
       to proceed
      artificial pressure: introduce complications during the simulated operation
      initial expense: government funding or NGO funding
      rely on it instead of real training: policy on the qualification gained from the time
       spent on the simulator (minimum required hours either on simulator and real
       operations)
      lack of patient/doctor relationship: develop communication course/combine with
       face-to-face training
      lack of knowledge of the new system: training to be offered to all involved
      limited number of modules available: policies on the update and upgrading of
       modules
      static learning environment: incorporate AI to create an adaptive learning
       environment.

If the evaluation does not provide any additional information to that in the article, the
candidate will be awarded a maximum of [2].

  0         The response does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

            One feasible solution to at least one problem is proposed and described.
 1–2        No evaluative comment is offered. Material is either copied directly from the article
            or implicit references are made to it.

            One appropriate solution to at least one problem is proposed and partially
 3–5        evaluated. The response contains explicit references to information in the article
            that are partially developed. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology.

            One appropriate solution to at least one problem is proposed and fully evaluated,
            addressing both its strengths and potential weaknesses. Areas for future
 6–8        development may also be identified. Explicit, fully developed references to the
            information in the article are made appropriately throughout the response. There
            is use of appropriate ITGS terminology.
