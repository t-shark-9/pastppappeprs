                                                 Section A
1.    Define the term status and explain how you would apply this term in the context of the
      asylum seekers and refused refugees in the passage.                                                    [4]

      This question requires candidates to demonstrate conceptual knowledge and understanding of the
      term status, and apply it in relation to the text. Stronger responses may also develop a critical
      discussion of the concept.

      Candidates will be expected to provide any conceptualization along the lines of status as a socially
      defined aspect of a person, which entails certain rights and duties in relation to others, making
      clear how statuses are embedded in systems of stratification or inequality. Some candidates may
      refer to status as a position in a social system, relating it to the closely linked notion of role. Others
      may refer to the distinction between ascribed and achieved statuses. Some candidates may also
      well define status as a synonym for social honour or prestige (utilizing Weber), or focus on the
      notion of embodied status, while others might refer to the concept of master status.

      Candidates are expected to apply this concept in relation to the provided ethnographic data in
      order to show how the different groups in the asylum system experience, manipulate and negotiate
      the “truth”, as a consequence of their allocated statuses. In this particular ethnographic case,
      membership of an asylum-seeking group – with its various cultural backgrounds, resources and
      experiences of uncertainty – is the defining element for comprehending the system of power, with
      an unequal distribution of rights and privileges, duties and responsibilities, social values and
      privations.

      There are several examples from the text that can be used to show how the concept of status can
      be applied in this context. In the asylum system, the relationship between asylum seekers and the
      UKBA is hierarchically organized in relation to asylum claims. Candidates may focus on the
      discussion of the rationale for this hierarchy and the implications of such ranking in relation to
      “truth” reflecting a conspicuous structure for status stratification. This stratification of asylum-
      seekers/refugees and UKBA of different statuses is based on patterns of power, with the asylum
      seekers/refugees at the bottom of the scale and UKBA personnel above them. The hierarchy
      established in the asylum system equates patterns of cultural and social power. Inconsistencies
      and irrationality follow this hierarchy and the outcome is a form of institutionalized discrimination
      reflecting differential negotiations of the “truth” given assumed abilities or lack of them and rights.

2.    Explain how the key concept belief and knowledge helps you understand the ethnographic
      data presented in the passage.                                                                      [6]

      The question requires candidates to develop an analysis and explanation of this ethnographic text
      using the key concept of belief and knowledge to help make sense of the ethnographic data. In
      order to do this, candidates are required to demonstrate an understanding of the key concept and
      use it to illuminate certain issues within the context, supporting arguments by making reference to
      the ethnographic data of the extract.

      Candidates may contextualize belief and knowledge in cultural identities, religious or even class-
      related beliefs. They can explain how the negotiation for asylum status is mediated by issues of
      cultural beliefs on the part of asylum seekers. These negotiations may be influenced and given
      direction by a system of meaningful cultural symbols. In regard to this ethnographic material, they
      should make reference to how asylum seekers and refugees conceptualize “lying” and the
      uncertainties and irrationality they experience, in their own cultural terms.

      Candidates can explain how the asylum seekers internalize their fragile position in the belief that
      the system is irrational and requires “lying” and paying lip service to UKBA, given that its standards
      are inadequate to accommodate the cultural diversity of applicants. These understandings may be
      the basis for their making sense of their situation.

        The response offers a common-sense or superficial understanding of the key concept.
1–2
        There is an attempt to relate the key concept to the text, and some ethnographic examples are
        presented but these are only partially relevant.
        The response demonstrates an understanding of the key concept and establishes its relevance
        to the text.
3–4
        There is an analysis of the text using the key concept, although there are some inconsistencies.

        Relevant ethnographic examples from the text are presented to support the analysis.
        The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key concept, discussing this in the
        context of the text.

5–6     There is a clearly explained analysis of the text using the key concept and a detailed
        interpretation of the ethnographic data.

        Clear and explicit ethnographic examples from the text support the analysis.

3.    Compare and contrast the way in which the key concept of power or culture is evident in
      this passage with how it is evident in one other ethnographic example you have studied.
      Make reference to theory in your answer.

      The target societies for this comparative question are varied and many. Candidates are expected
      to show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and draw explicit comparisons.
      In order to do this, responses must demonstrate an understanding of how either the key concept of
      power or culture relates to this ethnographic context. They should be able to establish a relevant
      comparison with any other case or society based on any of these concepts. The response should
      be structured as a comparison and contrast, highlighting similarities and differences.

      This passage focuses on the assessment of asylum seekers’ honesty and “credibility” as well as
      the asylum seekers’ widespread mistrust of UKBA bureaucracy and perceived “irrational” and
                                                   –5–                 N19/3/SOCAN/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     “inconsistent” practices of granting and rejecting requests for asylum. Candidates are expected to
     show an ability to think about the text in relation to other contexts and to draw explicit comparisons
     and contrasts. Either of the key concepts chosen on which such comparison may be drawn should
     be made explicit and clearly linked to any anthropological issue raised by the text. Candidates
     must situate the comparative case in terms of place, author and historical context. The discussion
     should be supported with reference to concepts, ethnographic material and theory.

     Additional guidance:

     The question is broad and allows for a wide array of responses. Some candidates may choose to
     use power to explain this ethnographic account. This key concept may be approached drawing
     from diverse origins – such as Weberian or Marxist ideas – or any other relevant conceptualization.
     Terms such as ideology, hegemony and culture may also come into play. These responses may
     focus on the incoherent practices of reviewing asylum cases resulting in uncertainty and mistrust.

     Some candidates may refer to the concept of ideology related to power relations, to explain the
     relationship between beliefs about fairness and trust and certainty of the immigration system in the
     UK and elsewhere. The focus on ideology may link the institutional emphasis on truthfulness to
     images of asylum seekers as liars and opportunistic cheats, in a discussion of metaphors and
     stereotypes. Some may focus on the power dynamics and highlight how institutional discrimination
     based on a lack of cultural appreciation of diverse cultural and political conditions in the applicants’
     home countries creates mistrust and prevents a coherent and trustworthy immigration policy.

     Those candidates who choose to support their answers by analyzing the ethnographic data
     through the lens of the key concept culture, will likely make reference to the nature of cultural
     diversities – the importance of appreciating the cultures of the refugees’ home countries, the
     beliefs, practices, values, ideas, material conditions and economic life and other domains of social
     and cognitive organization.

     Some responses may focus on the discussion of truth and lying and the author’s statement that
     most bureaucracies encourage at least a massaging of truth. Some candidates will also call
     attention to the challenges of conducting fieldwork in a context where truth is constantly being
     negotiated.

     The responses which focus on culture may also refer to the “culture of disbelief”, the chronic
     suspicion of asylum seekers, the lacking cultural knowledge among UKBA officials and the near-
     impossibility for individuals to meet the ideal of the “genuine” refugee.

4.   Compare and contrast the approaches to research adopted by the anthropologist in this
     passage to the approaches to research used by another anthropologist you have studied.
     Make reference to concepts, ethnographic material and theory in your answer.                        [10]

     While in the previous question the stress of the comparison and contrast needs to be drawn on the
     key concepts which would help to frame the responses, here candidates are expected to show an
     ability to think about the text with emphasis on the methodological and theoretical perspectives of
     the anthropologists as the main principle on which such comparisons should be established.

     For example, candidates may note how the author of this passage investigates the ways in which
     “truth” is constructed by the two sides, by approaching research with a focus on the narratives and
     comments made by the refugees and UKBA, and may compare and contrast this with how another
     anthropologist has approached issues of “credibility”. Other possible answers may compare the
     approach to research in closed institutions with other analytical viewpoints, such as Goffman’s
     study. Also, some candidates may highlight how the author’s approach is based on the symbolic,
     focusing on belief systems, and compare and contrast this approach to another ethnographic work.
                                                    –6–                  N19/3/SOCAN/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      It would also be relevant if candidates note the use of specific terms – “lying”, “trust” – and a
      manifest analysis of the search for certainty. With reference to concepts, it is possible to compare
      how this author analyses truth while other anthropologists that the candidate studied may focus on
      class or gender inequalities in relation to migration.

5.     Why does anthropology matter? Discuss with reference to at least two sources of
       ethnographic material and examples from the passage.                                                  [10]

       This question requires candidates to develop an argument which is built on an understanding of
       the following “big anthropological question”: Why does anthropology matter? This argumentative
       response includes discussion and analysis that should be supported by relevant, detailed
       ethnographic material that gives evidence of the understanding of this big question in different
       cultural contexts.

       This “big anthropological question” should be the very backbone of the response, and be informed
       by the ethnographic material studied. The aim of this question is to facilitate students to think with
       and through ethnographic material; to explore these materials analytically, aided by the focus on a
       “big anthropological question”. A broad variety of ethnographic data can be put forward in order to
       create meaningful responses.

6.   With reference to either stimulus A or stimulus B and your own knowledge, discuss the
     defining features of anthropological ethics.                                                         [10]

     This question requires candidates to develop a response in which they demonstrate an
     understanding of the anthropological ethical issues raised by the stimulus material, and an ability to
     engage in a critical discussion applying the student’s own knowledge of the defining features of
     anthropological ethics.

     If stimulus A is used:

     Candidates have little information to work with and are not aware of all the ethical safeguards the
     ethnographer put in place, so as long as they build an argument based on the evidence available
     then consider awarding marks for any plausible, reasoned, discussion regarding the ethical issues
     raised by the stimulus text. However, don’t reward speculative, general, criticism of the
     ethnographer and their ethical standards.

     Likely issues include:
     • The power differential between ethnographer and participants; participants might have implicitly
        viewed the ethnographer as someone “superior” with whom they ought to discuss distressing
        details from their past despite not wanting to (even if consent is fully explained).
     • The unintended ethical consequences found in ethnographic data gathering; even with brain-
        storming, trouble-shooting, and experience not every ethics scenario is apparent prior to
        fieldwork.
     • Individual field participants may respond differently to an ethics-laden situation, and one should
        not assume that generalisations can be made about ethical safeguards in all cases.
     • While the ethnographer can be assumed to have made every effort to conform to ethics
        guidelines and to have received institutional clearance, their work appears to have been
        beneficial or even cathartic to some participants, while psychologically/emotionally harmful to
        others. Some candidates may discuss the implication of this on the reputation of ethnographic
        research amongst members of the group, and the impact on future research opportunities.

     If stimulus B is used:

     As in the previous response, this stimulus also suggests some relevant ethical concerns. In this
     case, it is likely that candidates will discuss anthropological ethics in relation to the nature of local
     culture and belief system that need to be acknowledged when introducing Western (foreign)
     medical initiatives, demanding a culturally-sensitive approach to alleviate cultural and religious
     concerns. Some responses may discuss issues related with being open and honest. Also, other
     issues that may arise include the protection, data ownership and access of records. Some
     candidates may discuss any of these ethical concerns, stressing the importance of visual media in
     particular.

        and integrates the student’s own knowledge of the defining features of anthropological ethics.

        There is relevant and thorough engagement with the stimulus, and the ethical issue(s)
9–10    presented are fully explained demonstrating excellent understanding.

        A reasoned argument is presented that indicates the student’s perspective on the relative
        importance of the ethical issue(s) in relation to anthropological practice; any minor
        inconsistencies do not hinder the overall strength of the argument.
