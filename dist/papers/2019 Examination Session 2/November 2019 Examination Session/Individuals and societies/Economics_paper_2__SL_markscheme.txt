Responses may include:

A definition of:
• tariffs
• quota
• trade protection
• trade agreement.

Strengths of the trade agreement:
• The trade agreement could raise the EU’s exports to Japan by 34% and Japan’s to the EU
   by 29%, increasing AD and thus creating economic growth and jobs in all economies
   involved (paragraph ) (candidates may argue that the impact on growth is indeterminate
   since net exports may fall with downward pressure on growth in the short run).
• The trade agreement marks a determined effort to overcome problems associated with
   trade protection (paragraph  – combat rising trade protectionism) such as higher prices.
• Will make Japanese car producers more competitive with European and Korean
   producers, increasing employment in the Japanese car industry (paragraph ).
• Lower prices for Japanese consumers of meat, dairy products and wine (paragraph ).
• The loss of trade protection for producers, eg Japanese farmers, will force them to
   become more efficient (paragraph ) if they are to remain competitive.
• The deal will also resolve non-tariff barriers, such as technical requirements and
   regulations, which will increase trade (paragraph ).
• The proposed deal also addresses sustainability (paragraph ).
• It would be easier to sell to European/Japanese consumers, which creates a larger
   market, resulting in expansion of production.
• Consumers in both countries will have access to a wider variety of goods at lower prices
   as a result of freer trade.

Limitations of the trade agreement:
• Trade agreement still allows for some tariff barriers and some non-tariff barriers
  (paragraph ).
• JEEPA faces challenges, as it will have to be passed by the Japanese Parliament, the
  European Parliament and European national governments (paragraph ), so there is no
  guarantee that it will happen.
• The agreement will disadvantage some producers in all economies.
• Possible unemployment in industries where trade protection is reduced, eg the EU car
  industry (paragraph ) and farmers in Japan (paragraph ).
• Korean car manufacturers may lose market share in the EU market to the Japanese
  producers (paragraph ).
• US beef and pork producers might lose market share in Japan because EU producers
  would have better access to the Japanese market (paragraph ).
• Governments will have their tariff revenues reduced.
• Possible infant industries, such as the cheddar cheese industry in Japan, may not be able
  to compete (paragraph ).

Any reasonable evaluation.

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
      a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      To discuss the effects on the economy, candidates might consider the advantages and
      disadvantages related to macroeconomic goals.

      Responses may include:
      A definition/explanation of a “stronger currency”.

 Economic growth:
 • The strong Canadian dollar may cause a decrease in demand for exports and
   an increase in demand for imports, resulting in a fall in net exports and a
   decrease in AD. This may hinder economic growth, which has been increasing
   (paragraph ).

 Low unemployment:
 • The stronger Canadian dollar may result in a decrease in demand for exports
   and an increase in demand for imports, thus raising unemployment in export
   industries and industries that compete with imports.
 • The need to cut costs may result in structural unemployment.
 • If demand for exports is relatively inelastic, as in the case for commodities
   (with reference to Table 1), there may be little effect on unemployment.
 • If demand for exports is relatively elastic, as in the case for manufactured
   goods
   (with reference to Table 1), there could be an increase in unemployment in
   this sector.
 • A stronger Canadian dollar makes it more attractive for Canadians to travel to
   the US, rather than travel in Canada, which may damage the Canadian
   tourism sector (paragraph ) and may lead to unemployment.

 Low and stable inflation:
 • The stronger Canadian dollar will make imported factors of production
   less expensive, resulting in an increase in SRAS and a fall in possible
   inflationary pressure
 • The stronger Canadian dollar may also present a risk of increased deflationary
   pressure from lower priced imports and reduction in net exports (paragraph
   ).
 • The strong Canadian dollar may cause a decrease in demand for exports and
   an increase in demand for imports, resulting in a fall in net exports and a
   decrease in AD, thus a reduction in demand-pull inflationary pressure
   (paragraph ).
 • The effects depend on the PED for exports and imports.

 Current account:
 • The current account deficit is a concern at 3.6% of GDP (paragraph ), and a
   stronger Canadian dollar could lead to an increase in the deficit on the current
   account balance.
 • The effect depends on the PED for exports and imports.
 • The vast majority of Canada’s exports go to the US (Table 2), so the effect of
   the appreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar is likely to be
   significant.

Standard of living
 • Consumers will gain from lower prices of imports, including effectively cheaper
    holidays in the US (paragraph ).

 To reach Level 3, candidates must refer to the particular situation in the Canadian
 economy, not just present the advantages and disadvantages of a stronger currency
 in general.

 Any reasonable discussion.

                providing an explanation that since the government has
                decreased the minimum price, the cocoa producers will supply a
                lower quantity at a lower price, both of which would lead to a

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that includes
      a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses. Opinions or conclusions should be
      presented clearly and supported by appropriate evidence.

      Responses may include:
      • A definition of economic development.
      • The World Bank has identified gender inequality as a major barrier to economic
        growth and economic development (paragraph ), so reducing inequality should
        contribute to improving both economic growth and economic development.
      • Women’s empowerment could lead to an increase of an estimated US$6 billion to
        US$10 billion in its economy in the long term (paragraph ).
      • Côte D’Ivoire has significant gender inequalities in education (paragraphs  and 
        and Table 3).
      • If girls receive an education, they have the opportunity to find a (better) paid job,
        contributing to their family’s income and improving the standard of living.
      • Educated girls are more likely to have economic freedom and choice, allowing them
        to be financially independent.
      • Education will allow girls/women to make informed decisions about family planning,
        leading to healthier families.
      • Côte D’Ivoire has inequalities in access to health care (paragraph ).
      • If the present inequalities in access to health care (paragraph ) were reduced,
        women would have better access, becoming more productive and thus more stable
        and higher incomes.
      • If discrimination against women in the labour force were reduced, some women
        would move into more productive roles or would be more incentivised (paragraph
        ).
      • Women are under-represented in the cocoa industry, which is significant to the
        economy, so if women become more empowered, they may have more
        opportunities in this industry (paragraph ).

• If women are more empowered, they may gain access to the modern inputs and
  equipment that they currently lack (paragraph ), which would improve productivity
  and raise incomes, particularly in agriculture.
• If women are more empowered, they may gain better access to credit, which could
  encourage more entrepreneurship amongst women, leading to increased incomes
  and standard of living.
• Some women in Côte d’Ivoire have been able to borrow money through micro-credit
  (paragraph ) and seem to have benefitted from this, as their decision-making
  power improved, which contributed to their economic independence, in comparison
  to non-borrowers.
• In the long run, increased wages for women will increase tax revenues (paragraph
  ) allowing for more government expenditure on development initiatives.
• If government provides more education for girls, in the short run, this may increase
  the budget deficit adding to the public debt (paragraph ) and restricting future
  government expenditure on development initiatives due to debt servicing costs.

Any reasonable discussion.

      Command term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the strengths and
      limitations. Opinions and conclusions should be presented clearly and supported with
      appropriate evidence and sound argument.

      Responses may include:
      • definition of FDI
      • definition of economic development.

Strengths of FDI:
• Tax revenues from Multinational Corporations (MNCs) may be used by Nepal to achieve
   development objectives.
• Increased exports by MNCs in agriculture, manufacturing and services will generate
   export earnings (paragraphs ,  and ).
• Creation of employment will create higher incomes and improved standards of living.
• Reduced dependence on aid (paragraph ).
• Fills a savings gap (paragraph ).
• Fewer people leaving the country if they can have job opportunities in Nepal
   (paragraph ).
• Technology transfer.
• FDI is a component of AD, so increased AD through increased investment (paragraph )
   means an increase in real GDP.
• Firms may encourage building of more infrastructure, which is needed in Nepal
   (paragraph ).
• Possible training and education of workers to raise human capital.
• MNCs tend to pay higher wages than domestic firms and/or offer an alternative to low-
   paying agricultural jobs, leading to higher incomes for locals.

Limitations of FDI:
• The need for greater labour market flexibility may result in poorer working conditions
  (paragraph ).
• If regulations are relaxed, companies may expatriate more profits, so the benefits will not
  be enjoyed by Nepal (paragraph ).
• If laws are relaxed so that firms can hire more foreign workers, then the jobs might not go
  to Nepalese people (paragraph ).
• Local businesses might be damaged if trade barriers are reduced (paragraph ).
• If environmental regulations are relaxed, this may result in negative externalities of
  production and may threaten sustainability (paragraph ).
• Income inequality may increase as those who obtain employment in MNCs will benefit
  more.
• If tax incentives are given to attract FDI, the Nepalese government will not enjoy the
  benefits of increased tax revenue.

Any reasonable evaluation.
