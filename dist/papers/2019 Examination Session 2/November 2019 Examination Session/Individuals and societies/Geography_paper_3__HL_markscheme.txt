1.   (a)   Using examples, analyse ways in which global interactions can lead to improved gender
           equality.                                                                             [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Gender equality between men and women is manifested in varying ways, including
           income and earnings, access to education, political representation and personal
           freedoms.

           Possible links between global interactions and improved gender equality:
           • Cultural diffusion via global media and social networks (equality as an
             increasingly ‘global’ social norm – in relation to the workplace, gender roles in
             the home, or other areas of life).
           • Economic opportunities for women linked with economic interactions, including
             microlending and work provided by TNCs (outsourcing and offshoring).
           • TNC social responsibility for frameworks and examples of affirmative action.
           • Global social media puts spotlight on certain issues, eg Boko Haram, which can
             spur action.
           • Possible correlation between globalization indices (Kearney) and gender
             indices.

           Do not credit a discussion of lessened gender equality; this is not asked for.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of how different global interactions / flows /
           processes (information, investment, agreements) lead to improved gender
           equality. Another approach might be to analyse, in turn, direct actions and indirect
           influences (such as films and social media).

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of two instances of
           increased gender equality on account of global interactions. Responses that
           neglect the gendered aspects of inequality are unlikely to reach this level.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either a range of different gender equality improvements
           • or a range of different global interactions linked with improved gender equality.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Discuss the opportunities and challenges that global interactions create for different
      transnational corporations (TNCs).                                                       [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      TNCs are a diverse group of businesses, including energy, heavy industry,
      electronics and media providers that operate across national boundaries. The
      discussion could vary according to the type of company being discussed (eg
      media or manufacturing companies). The opportunities and challenges relate
      primarily to access to new markets, but there are also practical, cultural, ethical,
      political and technological opportunities and challenges to discuss – though
      ultimately all are linked with the bigger economic picture of profit. The discussion
      may focus on transnational corporations acting alone or in partnership with
      outsourcing suppliers as part of production networks.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      Opportunities:
      • The growth of emerging economies and new markets for exploitation.
      • The opportunity to successfully deploy strategies, such as glocalization,
        mergers and acquisitions, and joint ventures.
      • Lower production costs in export processing zones and low wage economies,
        either through offshoring or outsourcing.
      • The opportunity to operate within trading blocs with low tariff barriers.
      • The opportunity to maximize profits through tax avoidance strategies.
      Challenges:
      • The challenges of anti-globalization movements / renewed to local production
      • The challenge of global campaigns eg against plastic packaging of products
      • The challenge of national trade restrictions, including protectionism.
      • Physical and human supply-chain risks and the need to re-shore activity.
      • Disruptive new technologies, including 3D printing and cyber-attacks.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured way (AO4).

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the
      statement that examines the balance of opportunities and challenges for different
      kinds of TNC. Another approach might be to critically discuss how opportunities
      and challenges exist in particular places rather than being global in scale.
      Another approach might be to discuss the relative balance of opportunities and
      challenges changing over time (with challenges increasing recently, eg renewed
      protectionism). A good discussion may conclude with a substantiated final
      judgment on the overall balance between challenges and opportunities.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and/or imbalanced outlining of two or
      three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and / or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

2.   (a)   Using examples, analyse the influence of diaspora populations on the cultural identity of
           different places.                                                                         [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           A diaspora is a scattered population of common ancestry or heritage. Widely
           used examples include the global Indian, Chinese, Scottish, Irish, English, French
           and Jewish diasporas amongst many others. A country’s diaspora consists of its
           own overseas citizens, and citizens of other countries who are descended from
           earlier generations of migrants.

           Possible influences of diaspora populations on cultural identity:
           • By their presence, diaspora populations increase cultural diversity in particular
             places where they have become established.
           • Diaspora populations may help to modify the culture of particular places as
             part of a “melting pot” effect; cultural traits including music, language, food and
             clothing may all be modified by the arrival of migrants and establishment of
             diaspora communities (US culture can be analysed as a hybrid culture made
             up of traits contributed by many different diasporas).
           • The physical landscape can be modified by the construction of places of
             worship or specialist ethnic retailers and restaurants.
           • The cultural identity of source countries is affected too: tourism in countries
             such as Ireland caters to the expectations of visitors from the diaspora,
             possibly resulting in the fossilization of source countries’ cultures.
           • Influence may be far greater on particular neighbourhoods than it is on larger-
             scale cities or regions as a whole through the creation of ethnic villages (but
             ghettoization could limit cultural influence on other parts of the same local
             place).

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis that clearly analyses different ways in which
           cultural identity is influenced, including a range of cultural traits. Another
           approach might be to analyse the influence of diasporas on different countries,
           including the source country. Another approach might be to systematically
           analyse different examples of diasporas in varied geographic contexts.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of the way one or more
           diaspora populations have influenced local places.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either the varied ways in which local cultures have been influenced by the
             presence of different diaspora populations
           • or the influence on local culture of diasporas in different geographical
             contexts, such as source and host countries

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   Discuss ways in which communications technology can help and hinder human development
      processes.                                                                        [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated
      according to the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Communications technology includes the internet, email and social networks; it is
      necessary for the functioning of “the internet of things”, drones, artificial
      intelligence, etc. Human development refers not just to economic growth but also
      to broader social, cultural and political changes over time. Human development
      can be studied at a national scale and also at a more local level (development may
      vary between rural and urban areas of a country, for example). Candidates may
      have varying interpretations of what “human development processes” may mean
      and these should be credited wherever relevant. Credit may be given for discussion
      of transportation networks, though an answer which focuses mainly on transport
      networks is unlikely to progress beyond the 5–8 band.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • different strands of human development (and the human development index)
        and ways in which communications could help support literacy, healthcare, etc
      • the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the extent to which technology
        can help support them
      • microfinance and alternative trading networks with developmental goals that
        may rely on communications technology
      • the role of TNCs in creating / spreading wealth and the extent to which they
        rely on communications technology for their functioning and operation
      • the role of communications technology in supporting global shifts that have
        hindered further economic growth in deindustrialized “rust belt” regions
      • the role of communications technology in supporting criminal networks and
        activities with negative effects for people and places
      • near-future technological threats for economies, employment and societies,
        including artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics
      • the disruptive effect of drone warfare in some parts of the world.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement
      that discusses the effects of communication technology on different strands of the
      human development process (economic, social, political, etc). Another approach
      might be to discuss ways in which technology helps or hinders development at
      different scales (local or national), or possible changes over time. A good
      discussion may conclude with a substantiated final judgment on the overall balance
      between “help” and “hinder”.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced and / or imbalanced outlining of two or
      three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis that links together several well-evidenced themes
        from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or ongoing evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and / or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.

3.   (a)   Analyse the reasons why people’s freedom to participate in global interactions varies from
           place to place.                                                                           [12]

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on pages 3 to 4.

           Personal freedoms vary according to people’s identities (of gender, ethnicity,
           religion, age) and locations (democratic or non-democratic states, the presence /
           enforcement or absence of the rule of law in different rural or urban places).
           Participation in global interactions has many possible interpretations, including
           the freedom to use the internet and social media, and freedom to travel globally
           and internationally, freedom to trade or be involved in other internet / economic
           exchanges. Ideally, the focus should be on:
           • people’s freedom to participate in global interactions (“global freedoms”)
                rather than freedoms and rights in general.
           • the freedoms of individuals within societies (weaker answers may be less
                explicit about the personal dimension, eg by analysing state protectionism as
                a 'barrier' to global interactions but failing to show how people’s freedoms are
                affected).

           Possible reasons and place contexts:
           • Government and militia controls on personal freedoms in varying contexts.
           • National trade restrictions that can affect the different freedoms of people to
             establish businesses.
           • The lack of internet freedom in some places (which civil society groups may
             have highlighted).
           • The implications of surveillance on personal freedoms.
           • The impact of anti-globalization movements on the freedoms of supporters of
             globalization.
           • Poverty, gender and age as possible barriers to freedom.
           • Religion as a possible barrier, eg the USA’s travel ban on Muslims.
           • Not everyone has economic freedom to participate due to poverty.

           Good answers may apply (AO2) a wider range of knowledge and understanding
           (AO1) in a well-structured way (AO4). One approach might be to provide a
           structured systematic analysis of different kinds of freedom and possible barriers
           to these freedoms (political, economic, cultural, etc). Another approach might be
           to analyse different kinds of global interaction (internet use, tourism, trade) and
           barriers to these interactions in specific located countries and contexts.

           For 4–6 marks, expect some weakly evidenced outlining of one or two instances
           of restricted “global freedoms”.

           For 7–9 marks, expect a structured, evidenced analysis of:
           • either different ways in which people may potentially participate in global
             interactions
           • or the varied reasons why freedoms are, or are not, available in different
             places.

           For 10–12 marks, expect both of these traits.

(b)   “The negative environmental impacts of globalization are beginning to lessen.” Discuss this
      statement.                                                                               [16]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Marks should be allocated according to
      the markbands on pages 5 to 6. Credit unexpected approaches wherever relevant.

      The environmental impacts or risks include transboundary or more localized pollution,
      carbon emissions and climate change, and broader environmental issues such as
      biodiversity and ecosystem services losses. These impacts are generally accelerated
      for societies undergoing industrialization and demographic transition; an argument may
      be made that post-industrial societies have reduced environmental footprints, although
      this is debatable (due to the offshoring of pollution and carbon emissions). As
      “environmental impact” is a broad category, some impacts may lessen over time while
      others may not. The net environmental footprint of the global economy remains very
      high despite steps taken by some countries.

      Possible applied themes (AO2) include knowledge and understanding (AO1) of:
      • transboundary pollution affecting more than one country
      • localized pollution, including impact along shipping lanes
      • the carbon footprints of industrializing societies, linked with global flows of goods
        and resources
      • the offshoring of polluting manufacturing industries and the growth over time of
        environmentally destructive global agribusiness food production systems
      • reshoring for economic activity and local food sourcing, and the implications for
        carbon emissions
      • attempts by civil society organizations to raise environmental awareness, with
        positive results
      • TNC corporate responsibility frameworks with environmental protection
      • UN Sustainable Development Goals criteria
      • global trade slowdown since 2008 and the implications for the environment.

      Good answers may synthesize (AO3a) three or more of the above (or other)
      themes in a well-structured (AO4) way.

      Good answers may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3b) of the statement that
      discusses different kinds of environmental impacts at varying scales (global, national or
      more local patterns). Another approach might be to critically discuss the varying timescale
      of any positive actions and impacts (some actions have achieved greater success than
      others in recent years). Another approach may be to critically discuss the extent to which
      developed countries have successfully brought about environmental improvements or
      have instead offshored their own carbon emissions by interacting with other places
      (thanks to global shift and global agribusiness). A good discussion may conclude with a
      substantiated final judgment on the overall level of lessening (or not) at a global scale.

      For 5–8 marks, expect weakly evidenced outlining of two or three relevant themes.

      For 9–12 marks, expect:
      • either a structured synthesis which links together several well-evidenced
        themes from the Guide
      • or a critical conclusion (or on-going evaluation) informed by geographical
        concepts and/or perspectives.

      For 13–16 marks, expect both of these traits.
