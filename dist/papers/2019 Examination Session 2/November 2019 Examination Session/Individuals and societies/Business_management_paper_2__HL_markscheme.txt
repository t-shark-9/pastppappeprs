                                               Section A
1.   (a)   Describe one disadvantage for an organization of operating at high capacity
           utilization.                                                                       [2]

           Some of the disadvantages for an organisation of operating at high capacity:
            Workers might feel the pressure / tiredness / mistakes / demotivation, which
             can reduce productivity.
            Machinery is more likely to break down, so production may be halted.
            Higher maintenance costs, due to constant use.
            Inability to respond to a sudden increase in demand, so potential customers
             may be lost.

           Accept any other relevant disadvantage.

           Award [1] for a relevant disadvantage with appropriate description up to a
           maximum of [2].

           For [2] marks responses must link the disadvantage to an outcome as in the
           examples above.

           It is not expected that candidates explain the benefits to any stakeholder.

           Application to the organization is not required.

           Do not credit an example.
                                              –7–                  N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Construct a fully labelled decision tree and identify the best option for Sassy
      (show all your working).                                                                    [6]




      Calculations:

      EMV 1 = (300 000  0.7  250 000  0.3) – 2 00,0 00 = $85 000
      EMV 2 = $150 000
      EMV 3a = (220 000  0.7  170 000  0.3) – 150 000 = $55 000
      EMV 3b = (550 000  0.7  450 000  0.3) – (170 000  150 000) = $200 000

      Best option 3(b) should be followed.

      [0]
      The decision tree does not reach a standard described below.

      [1–2]
      The decision tree is not accurately constructed, and / or the calculations of each option
      are not presented or accurate. However, there is some evidence of a general
      understanding of the model.

      [3–4]
      The principal elements of the decision tree are constructed, but may not be entirely
      accurate. The calculations of each option are largely correct. Allow up to three mistakes
      in calculations and / or presentation for [3].

      Allow for either two errors in calculation or two error in presentation [4].

      For an accurately constructed decision tree with incorrect calculations, award up to a
      maximum of [3].
                                              –8–                 N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



      For an accurately constructed decision tree with EMV calculations, but no working [4].

      [5-6]
      The decision tree is accurately constructed. The calculations of each option are correct
      and well presented. A key is provided. Workings are shown. As well as the rejected
      options [6]. Full marks can be awarded even if the headings of expected return/forecast
      revenue and probabilities are not explicitly written.

      Deduct [1] if a key is not provided.

      Deduct [1] if the best option is not identified either on the diagram OR following the EMV
      calculations.

      N.B. for only correct calculations of all options without a decision tree award a
      maximum of [2].

      Essentially treat the lack of key or rejected options as presentation errors as errors.
      Hence three presentation/calculation errors = [3].

      Apply candidate own figure rule (OFR) throughout this response.

(c)   Explain one limitation for Sassy of using a decision tree as a planning tool.                [2]

      While a general limitation of the decision tree model is the nature of the predicted
      outcome, here the use of the model is even more limited as it has been done by
      the partners who are designers. Due to lack of experience/qualification, they
      ignored the possibility that the economy might deteriorate. The predicted financial
      returns for each option might be inaccurate, especially in the volatile, ever-
      changing fashion industry. Hence, possible bias and different numerical
      outcomes.
      NB. Do not accept “worsening economy” if there is no other reference to the
      stimulus since this is often cited as a generic limitation.

      Accept any other relevant limitation.

      Candidates do not have to cover all of the applicable issue above. One is
      sufficient.

      Award [1] for a relevant generic limitation identified or described and [1] for any
      additional explanation in context.

      [2] cannot be awarded for the limitation if the response lacks either explanation
      and / or application.

      For example:
      For an identification or a description of the limitation with or without application [1].
      For explanation of the limitation with no application [1].
      For explanation of the limitation and application [2].
                                                  –9–                 N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Define the term internal growth.                                                    [2]

           Internal growth occurs when a business expands existing operations rather than
           growing by merging or acquiring other businesses. Typically, internal growth
           occurs when a business expands its capacity and sells to a wider market.

           Candidates do not have to have wording exactly as above.

           Award [1] for some understanding of internal growth (such as “expands existing
           operations”) and [1] for additional wording that gives precision (“rather than
           growing by merging or acquiring other businesses” or “internal growth occurs
           when a business expands its capacity and sells to a wider market”).

           NB. the question is about internal growth and not about growth generically. Do
           not award beyond [1] mark if the response does not make this distinction

     (b)   (i)    Calculate, for MWF, the break-even level of output for 2020.                 [2]

                  Total fixed costs: $130 000
                  Contribution: $100 – $60 = 40

                                      130 000
                  Break-even point:            3250 units
                                        40

                  Award [2] for correct answer and workings. Award [1] for correct process
                  but with a mathematical error.

           (ii)   Construct a fully labelled, to scale, break-even chart for MWF for 2020.     [4]
                                         – 10 –                  N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


        Award marks as follows:
        [1] for both appropriately labelled axes – y-axis must include both costs
        and revenue. The x-axis can be any suggestion of quantity: units, fans.
        Responses should be penalised if using $ sign in x-axis. If x or y axes show
        no units or scale is inaccurate then it follows that TR and TC must also be
        inaccurate

        [1] for accurately drawn and labelled total cost line.

        [1] for accurately drawn and labelled total revenue line.

        [1] for indication of break-even point. OFR applies from part b(i). The
        breakeven value does not need to be stated but the diagram must be
        consistent with the value in b(i) Do not award lines simply drawn from the
        BEP to the x and y axes without further annotation.

        Award a maximum of [2] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight
        edge, or is not to scale.

        If a candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0].

        NB. The Fixed Cost (FC), Variable Cost (VC) and Margin of Safety do NOT
        need to be shown as in diagram.

(iii)   Calculate the profit if MWF sells 3600 window fans in 2020.                           [2]

        Total revenue – Total cost = Profit

        (3600  100) – (130 000  3600  60) = 360 000 – (130 000  216 000)

                                                = 360 000 – 346 000 = $14 000 Net profit

        Alternatively, profit can be calculated using the total contribution – fixed costs.

        Total contribution = 3600  40 = 144 000

        Profit is (3600  $40) – $ 130 000 = $14 000

        Or

        Profit = Contribution per unit X Margin of safety
         = ($100 - $60) X (3600 -3250)
         = $ 14 000


        Award [2] for correct answer and workings. Working does not need to be as
        extensive as shown above. Award [1] for correct process but with a
        mathematical error.
                                                 – 11 –              N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


                                              Section B
3.   (a)   Define the term corporate social responsibility (CSR).                                [2]

           CSR is the decision/attempt by a business to take responsibility for their
           action/activities by considering the interests of and the impact on a wide range of
           stakeholders in society. The business accepts the moral and legal obligations to
           society, not just to investors, that result from its operation.

           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and understanding
           similar to the above answer. The first mark would typically come from awareness
           that there is some morale guidance.

           Award [2] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and understanding
           similar to the answer above. Individual stakeholders do not need to be named to
           gain full marks

           Do not credit an example.

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CM of using a cost-plus
           (mark-up) pricing strategy.                                                           [4]

           One advantage for CM of using a cost-plus pricing strategy is the fact that it will
           be CM that covers all the costs and ensures a certain percentage of profit to be
           made. It is evident given the figures above that CM makes a profit. CM’s ability to
           make a profit ensures long-term survival. CM’s meals are perceived as good
           value for money, hence the strategy is effective.

           Given the increase in competition, CM can be flexible and reduce the margin set
           above the costs. Flexibility in pricing is an important factor when there is an
           economic downturn, as well as increased competition.

           A possible disadvantage is that CM’s costs are likely to be higher than
           competitors who supply non-organic meals. Together with the customers’
           unwillingness to pay a premium price during an economic downturn, CM might
           see a further fall in demand as seen in the fall in total revenue in 2018.

           Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage.

           Award [1] for each role identified and an additional [1] for development with
           application to CM. Award a maximum of [2] per advantage/disadvantage. [2]
           cannot be awarded per role if the response lacks either explanation and / or
           application.

           For example:
           For an identification or a description of an advantage/ disadvantage with or
           without application [1].
           For explanation of relevant advantage/ disadvantage with no application [1].
           For explanation of a relevant advantage/ disadvantage and application [2].

(c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CM of changing its stock
      control method from just-in-case (JIC) to just-in-time (JIT).                             [4]

      A possible advantage for CM of changing the stock method from JIC to JIT:
      As CM buys agriculture produce/ stock, these products need to be well stored
      and possibly refrigerated. Moving to JIT will significantly reduce costs of storage
      and spoilage. The gross profit margin, which has fallen by 2 %, is likely to
      increase rather than decrease. The very high current ratio of 2.4 will fall, as CM
      will not stock financially unproductive assets.

      A possible disadvantage for CM of changing production /stock method methods
      from JIC to JIT:
      Given the nature of the industry, the farmers are likely to prefer CM buying large
      quantities seasonally. Ordering lower quantities when needed might create
      problems/costs for the farmers, who might not prioritize CM any longer. CM will
      also lose its reputation for CSR based on long-term commitment to farmers to
      buy large quantities.

      Moreover, given the unpredictable nature of farming, not having buffer stock
      could result in CM being out of stock with the consequences of losing
      clients/reputation and therefore revenue and profit. CM is likely to lose its
      reputation for flexibility with the retailers in terms of quantity and delivery if not
      enough agriculture produce is available.

      Accept any other relevant/applicable advantage / disadvantage.

      Award [1] for each advantage / disadvantage identified and an additional [1] for
      development with application to CM. Award a maximum of [2] per advantage /
      disadvantage.

      [2] cannot be awarded per role if the response lacks either explanation and / or
      application.

      For example:
      For an identification or a description of an advantage/ disadvantage with or
      without application [1].
      For explanation of a relevant advantage/ disadvantage with no application [1].
      For explanation of a relevant advantage/ disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   Using the financial information in Table 1, evaluate two strategies that CM could
      use to improve its financial position other than changing to a just-in-time (JIT)
      stock control method.                                                                    [10]

      It is expected that candidates make constant reference to/use of the figures and
      other relevant information in the stimulus combined with theoretical
      understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of the possible strategies.

      Some of the possible strategies:

      Reduce cash outflow. CM is facing cash flow crisis as seen by its deteriorating
      acid test ratio of 0.6. Without stock, which contributed to a high current assets
      ratio, CM cannot meet its long-term liabilities. It is evident that there is a big
      difference between debtors and creditors days. CM paid the farmers within five
      days in 2018, which is very quick and got significantly quicker – twice as fast –
      but received money from the retailers after 70 days in 2018, a significant increase
      from 50 days. CM is too generous to retailers with the credit term. Despite the
                                       – 13 –               N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


fact that the relationship with retailers and the suppliers is CM’s competitive
advantage, it is financially dangerous given the decreasing and very low acid test.

Seek alternative suppliers with cheaper agriculture produce might be seen as
an extreme solution, as CM’s relationship with the farmers and the quality of the
organic ingredients are key to its competitive advantage. It might take a long time
to find different suppliers. Perhaps agreeing a longer credit term would be a
better solution. Currently, CM pays after five days. One can assume that the
farmers are likely to prefer a request for a longer pay period than a more drastic
one.

Cut expenses. Gross profit margin is considerably higher than net profit margin
for a manufacturing company and is getting worse over time. CM should look at
some unnecessary expenses like marketing or administration. However, cutting
salaries or staff might impact on the employees’ motivation and cutting marketing
might create some difficulties in competing with the new competitors. However,
going out of business due to lack of cash can be judged as a more significant
threat.
Do not accept better stock control due to JIT.

Tighter credit control. Cash payments only for the retailer will clearly
reduce/eliminate debtor days. The acid test ratio is worrying and CM must take
immediate actions to solve this short-term liquidity problem. However, the
relationship with the retailers might deteriorate and they might start buying
non-organic frozen food from the emerging competitors. It appears that CM’s
bargaining power with the retailer is weak and this option is unlikely to be
successful. One, however, may argue that increasing the creditor days is unlikely
to be met with much objection from its suppliers given the very low starting
figures and long-established trust. CM might also be able to ask its debtors – the
retailers – to pay sooner, even after two months, a demand which is likely to be
seen as reasonable.

Changing pricing policy. CM can possibly reduce the price of its products.
While CM may be more competitive and this strategy may work well given the
economic downturn and the increased competition, CM may suffer losses or a
reduction in profit. However, customers may perceive the frozen organic meals
as even better value for money and increase demand. Moreover, perhaps CM
can withstand a reduction in profit in the short term and we can see that CM is
profitable. The liquidity issue ought to be sorted. CM should prioritize its cash flow
problem first, then deal with a low acid test to generate cash to survive.

Enhance marketing to generate more sales in cash. CM might be able to reduce
its increasing level of stock and reduce stock turnover in days, which has clearly
deteriorated considerably from 20 to 40 days. However, any type of promotion
may incur more expenses, especially in cash. The data indicates that the net
profit margin is considerably lower than the gross profit margin, which indicates
that CM does not control its expenses well.

Improved product portfolio. Perhaps CM should also consider non-organic
meals or other types of products to enhance its portfolio and create more revenue
streams. However, cannibalism can be created – CM may also have to compete
more directly with the increasing number of providers of non-organic frozen
meals. Market research has to be done so perhaps this option is not the most
appropriate one in the short term.

Seeking alternative short term sources of finance. Accept relevant applicable
suggestions like the use of overdraft and short-term loans, to deal with CM’s
short-term liquidity crisis. However, these options are more of first aid rather than
solution to some ongoing problems and are likely to be more theoretical given the
lack of information in the stimulus.

4.   (a)   Describe one feature of a multinational company (MNC).                                 [2]

            MNCs operate in many countries. Their headquarters are located in one
             country (home country) while operations are carried out in a number of other
             countries (host countries).
            Because of their global operations, they usually have large physical and
             financial assets and turnover.
            MNCs are predominantly large-sized and exercise a great degree of economic
             dominance.
            MNCs may control production activity with large foreign direct investment in
             more than one developed and developing countries.

           Award [1] for each feature stated and award an additional [1] for a description up
           to a maximum of [2].

     (b)   Calculate TS’ market share in 2018 (show all your working).                            [2]

                                  firm's sales
           Market share % =                       100
                              total market sales

           5 000 000
                       100  10 %
           50 000 000

           Award [1] for the correct market share number (percentage) [1] for correct
           working.

           If no workings are shown, but the final answer is correct, award a maximum of
           [1].

           Do not credit full marks if the answer is not a percentage.

     (c)   Explain two disadvantages and one advantage to TS of selling its products
           online.                                                                                [6]

           Like other businesses in the industry, TS may find selling online increasingly
           problematic due to the associated costs. Customer complaints about TS’ website
           and ordering problems are already increasing. Costs of dealing with customer
           complaints, technical issues and delivery problems may increase and reduce
           profit.

           TS´ brand image may be eroded due to its inefficient way of dealing with online
           sales. Its unfriendly website and increasing customer complaints are probably
           eroding its brand image and market share. If TS wants to increase international
           presence and expand its market, it should improve its current online sales
           system.

           On the other hand, TS’ sales and profits can increase by taking advantage of e-
           commerce’s rapid growth. It can also take advantage of a potential market
           opportunity left by the competing businesses in the industry that are experiencing
           problems with online sales.

           TS’ international presence is weak; selling online can help to create brand
           awareness in international markets and reach a worldwide audience with
           relatively low costs.
                                             – 16 –               N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Accept any other relevant explanation.

      Mark as 2 + 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for each correct advantage/disadvantage identified and [1] for a
      relevant explanation with application to TS. Award up to a maximum of [2] per
      advantage/disadvantage explained.

      [2] cannot be awarded per advantage/disadvantage if the response lacks either
      explanation and/or application.

      For example: For an identification/description of an advantage/disadvantage with
      or without application [1]. For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage with no
      application [1].
      For explanation of an advantage/disadvantage and application [2].

(d)   With reference to TS, evaluate the two merger options.                                 [10]

      Merging with All Champion:
      The merger with the footwear manufacturer All Champion (AC) will produce gains
      in economies of scale, and will give TS the possibility of growing.

      As a multinational company, AC has access to more and cheaper resources such
      as finance. Additional finance will allow for research and development of new
      products. TS will be able to develop the new line of running shoes and expand its
      product portfolio.
      Merging with AC will also allow for rationalization of resources, such as
      concentrating output on one site and concentrating managerial and technical
      capacities. For instance, TS will have access to larger IT and marketing
      departments to improve its website and deal with online sales more efficiently.

      A merger with AC eliminates a strong competitor in the market. The two
      companies might have different strengths and experiences and they, therefore,
      could fit well together. The new merged company will probably be stronger and
      could therefore increase its competitive power in the market. AC´s market share
      (only 10 %) will increase.

      On the other hand, a merger with AC may have a number of drawbacks. In a
      merger process, the smaller company, such as TS, could be cannibalized by the
      larger one. TS’ culture may be dissolved within AC’s way of doing things. There
      are also high chances that some of AC’s factories will be closed, causing
      discontent within the local community. The finance manager is right to be
      suspicious about this merger. TS’ reputation may be hurt due to the possibilities
      of closing factories and sales may fall.

      Merging with a footwear retailer:
      If TS merges with a footwear retailer with a strong presence in domestic and
      international markets, it will secure an outlet for its products. TS will be able to
      increase its domestic market share of 10 % and additionally access the
      international markets, using the experience, knowledge and expertise of the
      footwear retailer. TS will keep the manufacturing process and then factories will
      not close. In addition, the risks of cannibalization of this option are low.

      However, this merger may not exclude a strong competitor such as AC.
      Production economies of scale will not be gained, as the footwear retailer has no
      experience in the footwear manufacturing process.
                                                  – 17 –               N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



           Overall, merging with AC will give Top Star the competitive edge needed to grow
           and develop its product portfolio. On the other hand, merging with a footwear
           retailer also has some evident advantages, but it seems that merging with AC
           looks like a stronger choice.

           It is expected that candidates provide a conclusion with a substantiated
           judgment.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

           For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
           relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

           If a candidate evaluates / addresses only one merger option, award a maximum
           of [5].

           A balanced response is one that provides at least one argument for and one
           argument against each merger option.

           Candidates may contrast one option with another for a balance as long as at
           least two arguments are given for each option.

           Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
           analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
           stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

           Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
           that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in the answer.

5.   (a)   Describe one disadvantage of operating as a public limited company.                      [2]

           Disadvantages of operating as a public limited company include:
            The expense of going public and the ongoing expenses of reporting to the
              government or shareholders.
            Loss of privacy, as the company must report to the public and to shareholders.
            Strategic decisions can take longer, as management has responsibility to
              communicate with the board, shareholders, and, often, other stakeholders.
            Possible loss of control since shares are available to the public to buy on a
              stock exchange

           Award [1] for an identification of a disadvantage and another [1] for sufficient
           description thereof.

     (b)   Explain one benefit and one cost to FA of having an autocratic leadership style.         [4]

           In the stimulus it is indicated that FA has an autocratic leadership style. This style
           appears to dovetail with the culture of the less economically developed country.
           Also, the factory is profitable and has been efficient through lower costs. It is
           possible that the leadership style fosters loyalty in this country because of the
           cultural fit. Accept the likelihood that workers are less skilled and less educated
           and likely to accept poorer working environment due to high unemployment rate

           The costs to FA include that autocratic leadership may stifle creativity and
           innovation, which could be available in a more democratic system. Also workers
           less likely to accept a demotivating work environment as they have a high degree
           of industrial relations leverage. Productivity in Germany could be higher than in a
           less economically developed country. The fact that FA’s leadership is thinking of
                                             – 18 –               N19/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      relocating to Germany indicates that they see problems in moving to a new,
      higher-price segment.
      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1] for each relevant benefit / cost explained and [1] with application to FA.
      Award up to a maximum of [2] per benefit/cost explained.

      [2] cannot be awarded per benefit / cost if the response lacks either explanation
      and / or application.

      For example: For an identification/description of a benefit / cost with or without
      application [1]. For explanation of a benefit / cost with no application [1].

(c)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of FA on the less economically
      developed country.                                                                     [4]

      Positive impacts of FA on the developing country include:
       Provides employment at wages better than those available in the less
        economically developed country.
       Was loyal during the civil war.

      Theoretically possible other positive impacts include:
       Technology and skill transfers from FA’s host country to the less economically
        developed country.

      Negative impacts of FA on the less economically developed country include:
       FA relies on an autocratic leadership style.
       FA does not use the most advanced technology in the less economically
        developed country.
       FA could leave the country, leaving many people who are currently dependent
        on the company out of work.
       FA does not provide the same employee rights provisions or health and safety
        provisions that it would in a less economically developed country.

      Theoretically possible other negative impacts include:
      FA may pollute to a level in the less economically developed country that it would
      not in Germany. In addition FA may cause an overdependency of the LDC on its
      presence in the country

      Mark as [2 + 2]. For [2], candidates must identify a positive and a negative
      impact, explain it, and apply to the less economically developed country.

      Award [2] for a positive impact with application to the less economically
      developed country.

      Award [2] for a negative impact with application to the less economically
      developed country.

      If there is no application to the less economically developed country at all then
      the maximum mark per impact is [1].

(d)   Evaluate the option of building a factory in, and relocating to, Germany.             [10]

      The option of building a factory in and relocating to Germany is a major strategic
      decision. In certain respects, FA would be an entirely different company: new
      products, new processes, new types of workers and new leadership styles, as
      well as a wholly new cultural context. Going into highly sophisticated high-tech
      manufacturing with robots has the potential to position FA for a future of highly
      automated manufacturing. Without making these changes, FA runs some risk of
      remaining stuck in much lower value-added processes, which in the long run are
      less profitable. The risks are very high. The potential rewards are high as well.

      Perhaps a strategy for FA would be not to sell the older factory but to continue to
      operate it and rely on those profits to support the new factory as it gets started.
      Whether FA’s balance sheet is strong enough to operate both factories is an
      open question, as is the question of whether its management has sufficient depth
      to operate two major plants.

      Balance in this context means having two arguments for opening the plant in
      Germany and two arguments against, which could be partially couched in a
      discussion of leaving the old plant open.
      .
      Accept any other relevant examination.

      A conclusion with judgment is expected.

      Marks should be allocated according to the mark bands on page 3 with further
      guidance below.

      For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to [3]. For more than one
      relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [4].

      Award a maximum of [6] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
      analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
      stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

      Candidates cannot reach the [7–8] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
      that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

      There is considerable stimulus material. Candidates that largely repeat the
      stimulus material with little or no analysis award up to a maximum of [4]

      It is expected that the candidate goes beyond just providing some relevant
      arguments for or against any suggested strategy and finish off with some
      conclusions and judgment.

      Candidates, in order to reach to the top markband, should show clear evidence of

      on business ethics.                                                                          [20]

7.    With reference to an organization of your choice, examine the impact of innovation on
      distribution strategy.                                                                       [20]

8.    With reference to an organization of your choice, discuss the ways in which culture
      can promote or inhibit change.                                                               [20]

NB. Although the question asks for the application of one concept on another, it is still
expected that Business Management content will be aligned with the concepts especially the
second concept (the one being acted on).

Please note that candidates can conclude that there was a minimal impact, however it has to
be based on balanced arguments and evaluation.

Additional guidance in relation to the assessment criteria
For each criterion, the aim is to find the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level
attained by the candidate, using the best-fit model. It is not necessary for every single aspect
of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

 The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance and should be achievable
  by a candidate.
 A candidate who attains a high level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily
  reach high levels of achievement for the other criteria and vice versa.

If only one concept is addressed:
 Criteria A, B, C and E: award up to a maximum [3].
 Criterion D: full marks can be awarded.

Where the question asks for impacts of two concepts on content, examiners must allow for
unbalanced treatment of the two concepts throughout a candidate’s response. One concept
may be more significant than the other.

Criterion B
For [2]: “…connection is not developed” should be treated the same as superficial.

Criterion C
1  1 arguments are expected per concepts.
 Questions 6 to 8 require consideration of the impact of one concept on a second concept
   – therefore accept 2  2 arguments for a balanced response.
 Justification is through logic or data.
 For [2] there is no balance as there are no counter arguments at all, or the arguments are
   all one-sided then this would be unjustified.
 For [3] there are some balanced arguments – some of which are justified.

Criterion D
 Introductions need to be concise and related to the question.
 The candidate’s response does not to have explicit headings for each structural element.
 A body is the area in which the substance of arguments occurs. It is usually located
   between the introduction and the conclusion.
 Fit-for-purpose paragraph means that ideas are presented in a clear academic way. For
   example, one idea per paragraph.

Criterion E
 One example of an “individual” could be an individual consumer or an individual manager.
   However, this cannot be considered with a “group” of consumers or a management team.
 For [4], a balanced response: look at the perspectives of both individual and group(s).
 The chosen individual, group needs to be applicable and relevant to the question with
   specific explanation.
 Candidates need to go beyond stating the stakeholder.

Candidates need not explicitly say “stakeholder”.

Some reflections on Specific Questions

Q6. Although similar in wording to Q7 – there is no selected business content. Therefore,
responses should clearly address some content genre related to, either, HRH, Marketing or
Operations Management. Do not credit ‘Globalisation definitions which simply refer to
expansion overseas – even though the examples used may utilise this. Many candidates
mistake ethical for legal obligations. Many candidates also confuse ethics with culture

Q7. The business content here is quite specific i.e. distribution strategy. Do not credit
responses that simply refer to general marketing. It is acceptable for candidates to choose
logistics companies such as DHL, FedEx, TNT etc. E-commerce is acceptable as innovation
but better responses should put into time/competitive context ie. a high street retailer
introducing an online platform is 2002 is more innovative than one doing it in 2018

Q8. Is worded differently to most of the previous sessions. Both organisational culture or
country culture are acceptable but candidates must be careful to establish changes related to
culture and not some other business factor. Change should be evidence by examples
showing a change from one state to another. Simply stating that a company did something is
relatively meaningless unless it is known what took place before. It is not necessary to
contrast “promotion” versus “inhibition” – it is promotion OR inhibition. However, for full marks
in Criterion C some type of analysis is needed for one state or the other.
