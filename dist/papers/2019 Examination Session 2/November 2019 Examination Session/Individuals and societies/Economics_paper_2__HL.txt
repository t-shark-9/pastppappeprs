2.       Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.


                                         Turkey’s rising current account deficit

          According to forecasts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Turkey’s current account
           deficit is expected to rise from 4.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 to 5.6 % of
           GDP in 2017, with real GDP growth falling from 3.3 % in 2016 to 2.9 % in 2017. The current
           account deficit is perceived to be the biggest problem for Turkey’s economy. An international
           credit agency has reduced Turkey’s credit rating to “negative” because risks to the country’s
           credit profile have risen significantly in recent months.

          Economic activity has been further damaged by several factors, including political
           uncertainty, conflicts in neighbouring countries and trade protection by its trading partners.
           Turkey’s tourism revenues, which contribute 10 % to the country’s GDP, have fallen
           significantly due to security concerns related to terrorist attacks.

          The current account deficit has contributed to a massive depreciation of the Turkish lira
           (Turkey’s currency), which dropped by 20 % against the United States dollar (US$) over the
           previous year. This is a significant problem for Turkey, which relies on a steady inflow of
           overseas investment to finance its current account deficit.

          Part of the problem is Turkey’s dependence on imports, especially energy. Higher import
           costs for energy will further worsen Turkey’s current account deficit and create further
           pressure on inflation (Figure 4).

          The Turkish government has blamed the currency collapse on speculators. The president of
           Turkey has asked Turkish citizens to help. There is approximately US$140 billion worth of
           foreign currency being held in foreign currency savings accounts in Turkey. The president
           wants Turkish people to use their foreign currency savings to support the Turkish lira.
           However, Turkish citizens seem to have ignored his wishes, and bought US$1 billion worth of
           foreign currency in September 2018.

          Analysts believe that the only solution to the falling value of the Turkish lira and the current
           account deficit is an increase in the official interest rate by the central bank. However,
           Turkey’s president has made it clear that he will not accept higher interest rates. In fact, he
           has demanded lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.

Answer one question from this section.

3.   Study the following extract and data and answer the questions that follow.


                            Economic development in two West African countries

         Ghana

        Ghana is the world’s second largest cocoa producer and Africa’s second largest gold
         producer. It is one of Africa’s fastest growing economies and has made major progress in
         achieving persistent economic growth.

        Over the last decade, Ghana has enjoyed increasingly stable and improving democratic
         governance. Four successful elections during the decade have strengthened the
         effectiveness of key national institutions, improved investor confidence and created an
         environment that promotes investment and growth.

        Ghana enjoys a high degree of media freedom; the private press and broadcasters operate
         without significant restrictions. The media are free to criticize the authorities without fear of
         punishment, says the non-governmental organization (NGO) Reporters Without Borders.
         The private press is allowed to express criticism of government policy, which increases the
         accountability and transparency of the government.

        Although Ghana’s growth has been fairly strong, the source of growth has always been
         dominated by commodities and the capital-intensive services sector. Neither of these
         has a direct effect on poverty reduction. Growth in rural areas is often limited by basic
         infrastructure, such as roads. This limits the ability of people in rural areas to access markets
         in urban areas.

         Nigeria

        Nigeria is Africa’s leading oil producer. In 2016, it experienced its first full year of recession in
         25 years. Global oil prices reached a 13-year low and oil production was drastically cut. Oil
         has continued to dominate Nigeria’s growth pattern, but the volatility of oil-dependent growth
         prevents progress in social and economic development.

        On the political front, the transition from military dictatorship to democratic rule has been
         acclaimed as one of Nigeria’s major successes in the last decade. The 2011 general election,
         supported by the United Nations, was widely acknowledged by international observers and
         domestic monitors as one of the freest and fairest elections conducted in the country in
         recent years.

         Ghana and Nigeria

        Both Ghana and Nigeria have cut fuel subsidies in order to reduce their budget deficits. This

                                          Economic growth in Cambodia

          Cambodia has become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia and has now been
           classified as an upper middle-income country, according to the World Bank.

          Export promotion has helped Cambodia to grow. It has used low-cost labour to manufacture
           products for export. This has been helped by the fact that the price of labour has increased
           in China and other Asian countries. Cambodia’s large supply of inexpensive, low-skilled
           labour has attracted much foreign direct investment (FDI) into the production of garments
           and footwear for export and contributed to its economic growth. Last year, there was a
           10.2 % increase in the export of garments and footwear in Cambodia, which makes up 70 %
           of its exports.

          Throughout Asia, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted out of poverty through
           manufacturing jobs that allowed them to better educate their children, who could then have a
           better life.

          However, Cambodia’s manufacturing competitiveness is being challenged by other countries
           in the region, particularly those that manufacture low-cost clothing. A recent increase in the
           minimum wage may also pose problems. Industry representatives have raised concerns
           that the garment industry may lose investors, who may leave to find cheaper places, if the
           minimum wage continues to increase.

          Cambodia needs to further diversify its economy if it hopes to maintain the high growth rates
           it has achieved in recent years. To support diversification, the government has launched
           an industrial development policy aimed at upgrading industry from low-cost, labour-intensive
           manufacturing to production with higher value added. The policy encourages the expansion
           and modernization of small and medium-sized enterprises, stronger regulations and
           enforcement, and a better environment for doing business.

          There remain many challenges to deal with. One of them is growing inequality—there is
           income inequality between urban and rural areas—as well as gender inequality. Women
           continue to face disadvantages in gaining access to higher education, well-paid employment
           opportunities and decision-making roles in government.

          Approximately 30 000 young Cambodians enter the labour force each year but often do not
           have the required skills to meet the needs of the labour market. While a large proportion of
           the labour force is employed, many jobs are informal, vulnerable, unstable and poorly paid.
           There is a critical need to address problems in education and training and to help children
           complete school. While 98 % of children attend primary school in Cambodia, many drop out
           later due to a lack of funds. Only 30 % of young people complete high school.

(Question 4 continued)


             The rapid economic and population growth in Cambodia is leading to significant
              environmental pollution. Environmentalists have identified garment factories as being one of
              the four main industrial activities that significantly contribute to air and water pollution.

        (b)     Using a demand and supply diagram, explain why the increase in the minimum
                wage might affect Cambodia’s garment manufacturing competitiveness against other
                countries in the region (paragraph ).[4]

        (c)     Using an externalities diagram, explain why the garment industry is a source of
                market failure (paragraph ).[4]

        (d)     Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics, evaluate export
                promotion as a strategy for achieving economic development in Cambodia.                         [8]
