                                               Section A

Answer one question from this section.

1.   Sassy

     Sassy, a partnership between fashion designers, produces clothes for teenagers. Capacity
     utilization is very high.

     The partners are considering some strategic changes. After conducting research, they
     presented three options and outlined the costs and expected revenue. They also predicted
     that the economy would either improve or stay the same. The probability of the economy
     staying the same is 0.3.

     The options, costs and expected revenue are given below:

                 Table 1: Information relating to the three strategic options for change

       Option 2: Dissolve the           Not applicable    $150 000

       competitor

       Option 3: Become a               $150 000          Not applicable
       private limited company          (legal costs)
       and:

2.   Mutombo Window Fans (MWF)

     Mutombo Window Fans (MWF) manufactures and sells window
     fans to wholesalers across eastern Africa. Although the business
     began small, it experienced rapid internal growth through aggressive,
     commission-based sales.

     Currently, MWF sells 300 window fans per month. Each fan sells at
     an average price of $100.

                                               Section B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.   Cool Meals (CM)

     Cool Meals (CM) produces frozen organic ready-made meals that are sold to food retailers
     throughout the country.

     CM buys large quantities of organic ingredients from local farmers for its just-in-case (JIC)
     stock control management. It uses a cost-plus (mark-up) pricing strategy.

     CM is known for its:
     y good-quality organic frozen meals, which are perceived as good value for money
     y flexibility with retailers in terms of quantity of meals supplied, credit given and efficient
       delivery at pre-arranged dates
     y corporate social responsibility (CSR) based on a long-term commitment made to farmers
       to purchase large quantities of organic ingredients every four months and pay a fair price
       promptly
     y CM has an excellent working relationship with farmers, who always prioritize CM’s
       requests in terms of quantity and delivery.

     Recently, an economic downturn and increased competition, especially from non-organic
     frozen meal suppliers, has decreased demand for frozen organic meals.

     The finance manager of CM, Kayleigh, provided the following financial information.

                           Table 1: Selected financial information for CM

                                                         2017          2018

                         Gross profit margin             16 %           14 %

(Question 3 continued)

     Kayleigh is worried about the cash flow of CM and suggested the company changes the
     stock control method from just-in-case (JIC) to just-in-time (JIT). She is also looking at other
     strategies to improve CM’s financial position.


     (a)   Define the term corporate social responsibility (CSR).[2]

     (b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CM of using a cost-plus (mark-up)
           pricing strategy.                                                                            [4]

     (c)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for CM of changing its stock control
           method from just-in-case (JIC) to just-in-time (JIT).                                        [4]

     (d)   Using the financial information in Table 1, evaluate two strategies that CM could
           use to improve its financial position other than changing to a just-in-time (JIT) stock
           control method.                                                                             [10]




                                                                                                  Turn over

4.   Top Star (TS)

     Top Star (TS) manufactures sports footwear. Its products are sold through retail outlets and
     online. Sales of TS’ footwear in retail outlets are falling. However, because e-commerce
     is growing rapidly, online sales are increasing. In 2018, TS’ total domestic sales were
     $5 000 000 and total domestic market sales for the same time period were $50 000 000.

     TS must consider several challenges:
     y Some businesses in the sports footwear industry are finding that selling online leads to
       many problems and higher costs
     y TS’ website is not user friendly. Customer complaints about the website and ordering
       problems are increasing
     y TS’ presence in international markets is weak and its product range is limited. The
       directors of TS want to develop a new line of running shoes but the company has
       insufficient finance for research, development and creating brand awareness.

     The directors think that TS should follow an external growth strategy. Two options are being
     considered:
     y Option 1: Some directors propose a merger with a footwear manufacturer, the
       multinational company All Champion, which would allow TS to be more competitive
     y Option 2: Other directors propose a merger with a footwear retailer that has a strong
       presence in domestic and international markets.

     The finance manager believes that merging with All Champion could hurt TS’ reputation.
     TS’ factories may have to close, which the local population may resent.


     (a)   Describe one feature of a multinational company (MNC).                                   [2]

     (b)   Calculate TS’ market share in 2018 (show all your working). 			                          [2]

     (c)   Explain two disadvantages and one advantage to TS of selling its products online.        [6]

     (d)   With reference to TS, evaluate the two merger options.                                  [10]

5.   FrioAire Appliances (FA)

     FrioAire Appliances (FA) manufactures medium-priced and medium-quality refrigerators. It is
     a multinational public limited company. Its factory is located in a less economically developed
     country that has high unemployment, a tradition of autocratic leadership and labour costs
     lower than FA’s home country. The factory is profitable, and FA pays consistently good
     dividends. Market growth for medium-priced and medium-quality refrigerators is limited.

     As part of a strategic objective to increase productivity and to enter a fast-growing market
     for high-priced and high-quality refrigerators, FA is considering building a new factory in
     and relocating production to Germany. This would require closing the factory in the less
     economically developed country. The new factory will:
     y use innovative technologies, including advanced robotics and 3D processes
     y require fewer employees, but those it does require will need to have better skills and
        qualifications.

     Germany has a highly skilled, qualified and productive workforce. The new factory would
     allow FA to reposition its products. However, FA would need to raise significant finance to
     build and equip the new factory.

     FA’s leadership style at the factory in the less economically developed country is autocratic.
     Members of FA’s board wonder whether this style would be suitable for the new factory in
     Germany, where workers have more bargaining power because of their high skill level and
     the labour-friendly cultural traditions. In Germany, FA would have to follow more regulations
     regarding the environment, health and safety, and employee rights.

     FA workers in the less economically developed country are very loyal to FA, which has
     continued operation through a civil war at significant cost to itself (for security). If FA were to
     close in the less economically developed country, the workers would not find such good jobs.


     (a)   Describe one disadvantage of operating as a public limited company.                             [2]

     (b)   Explain one benefit and one cost to FA of using an autocratic leadership style.                 [4]

     (c)   Explain one positive and one negative impact of FA on the developing country.                   [4]

     (d)   Evaluate the option of building a factory in, and relocating to, Germany.                      [10]
