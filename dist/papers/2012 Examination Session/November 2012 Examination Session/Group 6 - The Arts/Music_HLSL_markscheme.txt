     (no score provided)

     Musical structure
     There are many possible interpretations of the structure of this excerpt. Here is one of them.

     0:00    Female singer (soprano) “only you” with light accompaniment.

     0:19    Male singer (tenor) “and there is …”, light accompaniment of woodwinds and more
             present syncopation of strings. At times the singer uses falsetto (“Maria” at 0:29). After a
             short interjection of soprano (“Tony, Tony …”), the tempo accelerates.

     0:43    Soprano joins the tenor in an ascending line that imitates the contour of the male melodic
             line.

     0:48    Strings take more prominence introducing what will be the main tune of the excerpt in a
             climactic moment.

     0:54    Timpani establishes the syncopated rhythm that will be characteristic of this excerpt.
             While maintaining this pulsating syncopation a decrescendo announces the entrance of
             singers.

     0:58    Principal tune (“Tonight”) presented by soprano. The tune is presented a second time
             (1:12) with different ending and different accompaniment (less syncopation activity and
             countermelody in the strings and clarinet).

     1:28    Tenor enters with a melody that reminds the previous melody but, as a contrast, presents an
             overall descending contour. Violins doubling tenor.

     1:42    Tenor takes the melody presented by soprano at 0:58.                Return to syncopation
             accompaniment.

     1:55    Short orchestral interlude. Rallentando and diminuendo.

     Musical terminology
     Some of the words that could be relevant to criterion C include (but are not limited to):
     syncopation, soprano, tenor, duet, unison, crescendo, diminuendo, rallentando, accelerando.

     Musical context
     • Leonard Bernstein.
     • West Side Story (1961).
