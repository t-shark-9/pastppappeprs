Answer all questions, referring to the Source Booklet.

1.    Explain briefly the meaning of the following terms as used in the sources:

      (a)   Globalization (Source A line 23)                                                   [2 marks]

      (b)   Dependency theory (Source B line 3)                                                [2 marks]


2.    Source B states “for the global rich to remain rich, the global poor must
      remain poor” (line 11). To what extent is this statement supported by Sources A and C?   [4 marks]


3.    To what extent is the Human Development Index (HDI) in Source D a satisfactory
      way of measuring development? Identify at least two other ways of measuring
      development that could be used, and explain how these may be better, or worse,
      than the HDI.                                                                            [4 marks]


4.    With reference to the sources and your own knowledge, examine how aid can be
      beneficial to the recipients, but can also create “structures of violence”.              [8 marks]
