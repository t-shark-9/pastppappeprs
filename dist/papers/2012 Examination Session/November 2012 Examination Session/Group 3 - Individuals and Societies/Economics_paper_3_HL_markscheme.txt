                       The idea that they are taxes paid indirectly to the government.

                       An explanation that they are taxes on goods and services
                       (or expenditure taxes or consumption taxes).

           (ii)   price inelastic (paragraph ).                                                 [2 marks]

                       The idea that quantity (demanded) is not very responsive to price.

                   2   Precise definition                                                            2
                       An explanation of any one of the following:
                       • a change in the price of a product leads to a proportionately smaller
                         change in the quantity (demanded)
                       • PED is less than one
                       • % change in quantity (demanded) is less than the % change in price.

            For drawing a correctly labelled negative consumption externality diagram
            with MPB to the right of MSB and an indication of a negative externality or
            for providing an explanation that the consumption of unhealthy foods
            creates external costs in the form of higher health care costs for everyone in
            society.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                          3–4
            For drawing a correctly labelled negative consumption externality diagram
            with MPB to the right of MSB and an indication of a negative externality
            and for providing an explanation that the consumption of unhealthy foods
            creates external costs in the form of higher health care costs for everyone in
            society.

      For full marks, candidates must recognise that there are external costs, not just
      the health costs to the overweight themselves.

      Students may provide a negative production externality diagram with the MSC to
      the left of MPC and the free market equilibrium to the right of the socially
      efficient level of output. If this is correctly labelled and explained in terms of the
      external costs to society, then full marks may be awarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      The vertical axis may be price (or P) or costs and benefits. The horizontal axis
      may be output or quantity (or Q). A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how a tax on foods with a high fat
      content is expected to impact on the market for substitute products with a
      lower fat content (paragraph ).                                           [4 marks]

       1    Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
            For drawing a correctly labelled supply and demand diagram for substitute
            products showing a rightward shift in the demand curve, resulting in higher
            equilibrium price and quantity or for explaining that the tax leads to lower
            quantity demanded of high-fat foods and therefore an increase in demand
            for substitute products which are now relatively cheaper.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
            For drawing a correctly labelled supply and demand diagram for substitute
            products showing a rightward shift in the demand curve, resulting in higher
            equilibrium price and quantity and for explaining that the tax leads to lower
            quantity demanded of high-fat foods and therefore an increase in demand
            for substitute products which are now relatively cheaper.

      Another approach would be to illustrate the effect of a tax on foods with a high fat
      content (decrease in supply) resulting in a decrease in the quantity of fatty foods
      demanded and an explanation that this would lead to an increase in demand for
      substitute products. If this diagram is accurately drawn, with an appropriate
      explanation, then it may be awarded full marks.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      The vertical axis may be price (or P). The horizontal axis may be output or
      quantity (or Q). A title is not necessary.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely consequences of indirect taxes applied to junk food and
      sugary drinks.                                                              [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • explanation of how indirect taxes increase the price paid by consumers, causing
        a decrease in the quantity demanded and/or a switch to relatively cheaper
        products
      • a diagram illustrating the effect of an indirect tax.

      Arguments in favour of the indirect taxes on junk food and sugary drinks or
      arguments why the tax may be effective and/or desirable:
      • a suggestion that if junk food has inelastic demand, the burden will fall mainly
         on the consumers, which is appropriate since they are the ones consuming the
         products
      • higher price of taxed goods may encourage consumers to switch to healthier
         products, which are substitutes (paragraph )
      • a switch to healthier products (fall in demand for unhealthy foods) reduces the
         size of the negative externality and lowers health care costs (paragraph )
      • government earns tax revenues (paragraph ) (this may be shown on a
         diagram)
      • government tax revenues can be used to educate the public about the harmful
         effects of high-fat foods, causing demand for these to decrease (paragraph )
      • low income individuals who are less healthy could become healthier
      • government intervention may be necessary since manufacturers are unlikely to
         voluntarily improve their products (paragraph ).

      Arguments against the indirect taxes on junk food and sugary drinks or arguments
      why the tax may not be effective and/or desirable:
      • foods and beverages have price inelastic demand (paragraph ) because junk
        food is addictive (or healthy food is not seen as a substitute for junk food) and
        so there may be a proportionately smaller decrease in quantity demanded than
        hoped for
      • the tax might have to be very high (and move into the elastic region of the
        demand curve) to have a significant impact on quantity demanded
      • the tax might encourage consumers to buy the high fat content foods in
        neighbouring countries, which would have the effect of not reducing
        consumption and not contributing to higher tax revenues
      • indirect taxes are regressive because they take a higher share of income from
        low-income households and so they affect low income individuals
        disproportionately (paragraph )
      • low income individuals are also affected more than the wealthy because they
        consume more high-fat/sugary foods (paragraph )
      • reduced revenues for producers of high-fat foods and sugary drinks might lead
        to unemployment in these industries
      • low income households may have more price-inelastic demand than high
        income households because such goods are cheaper (paragraph ) and could
        respond by increasing their consumption of unhealthy foods and cutting back
        on their expenditures on healthy foods (paragraph )

        • an increase in demand for healthy foods could increase their price and make
          them even more unaffordable for low income households
        • opposition to the tax (paragraph ) may affect its long term effectiveness.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
        appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the data, then candidates may not be rewarded
        beyond level 2.

        Effective evaluation may be to:

        • examine the impact on different stakeholders
        • discuss advantages and disadvantages
        • prioritize the arguments.

                       • a price set by the government (or an authority)
                       • below the equilibrium price
                       • price cannot go above this price.

           rightward shift of the supply curve, resulting in a lower price and larger
           quantity, or an explanation that the elimination of the government
           monopoly in fodder will lower costs of production for milk producers, an
           increase in the supply of milk and hence a lower price of milk.

  (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
        evaluate the policies the Cyprus government could use to lower prices in the
        market for milk.                                                             [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
        • diagrams to illustrate the effect of policies.

        Policies:
        • price ceilings (paragraph ) (on farmers, fodder producers, processors or
          retailers) to bring down prices of a necessary good quickly
        • privatization and creating a competitive market in the provision of fodder leads
          to more efficient allocation of resources
        • encouraging producers to make voluntary price changes (paragraph ) to
          avoid bureaucracy and opposition
        • breaking up the presumed cartel to create more competition (paragraph )
        • reducing tariffs or other trade barriers to encourage the import of low-priced
          milk
        • providing subsidies to milk producers.

        Disadvantages/limitations of the policies advocated:
        • problems associated with price ceilings (paragraph ) such as excess demand,
          shortages, parallel markets, high administrative costs
        • disadvantages of privatization such as the possibility of higher prices for fodder
        • consumers don’t seem to care about high milk prices as they buy milk from the
          higher-price sources (paragraph ) so to regulate the market may be
          unnecessary
        • lower income for farmers.

                       An explanation that it is:
                       • the amount by which an injection is multiplied to result in a change
                         in GDP that is higher than the injection

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the use of fiscal policy as a method to reduce unemployment
      in the US.                                                            [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • a definition of fiscal policy
      • a diagram showing a deflationary gap
      • an explanation of demand deficient unemployment
      • an explanation of how expansionary fiscal policy may reduce demand deficient
        unemployment
      • use of a diagram to illustrate the effect of expansionary fiscal policy.

      Possible advantages of fiscal policy:
      • works to directly increase spending and may therefore lead to greater
        employment
      • more effective than monetary policy (paragraph ) if consumer and business
        confidence are low
      • increased government spending (e.g. on training) may also have positive
        supply side effects that allow the labour force to become more occupationally
        mobile so that unemployment may be reduced in the future (paragraph )
      • increased spending on infrastructure will result in an increase in the demand for
        labour and promote future economic growth
      • multiplier effect of increased government spending
      • an explanation that such policies are Keynesian, based on the idea that the
        economy may be stuck in a deflationary gap.

      Possible disadvantages/limitations of fiscal policy:
      • increasing the government deficit through higher government spending and
        lower taxes (paragraph ) will lead to increased government debt which will
        have to be financed in the future
      • may have a small multiplier effect if people save rather than spend
        (paragraph )
      • may have a small impact on investment if the deficit leads to crowding out
        (paragraph )
      • may take a long time to take effect by which time the deflationary gap may
        have already been filled with the result that the increased spending is
        inflationary
      • an explanation that fiscal policy is not appropriate for certain types of
        unemployment e.g. structural
      • an explanation that neo-classical economists would say that the economy will
        move towards full employment on its own and that the government
        intervention will cause greater problems for the economy
      • increased government debt increases the risk of debt default or a downgrade in
        the credit rating
      • with negative implications for future government funding/spending and
        employment
      • an explanation of how alternative policies (such as monetary policy or supply
        side policies) may be more effective in reducing unemployment (paragraph ).

  (d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
        evaluate the decision of the Latvian government to maintain the pegged
        (fixed) value of the lat.                                              [8 marks]

        Responses may include:
        • explanation of pegged value of the lat.

        Advantages of maintaining the pegged value of the lat:
        • it is necessary to maintain the value if Latvia is to join the euro (paragraph )
        • a stable currency helps maintain price stability
        • a stable currency supports the competitiveness of firms that are dependent on
          imported inputs
        • a stable currency would make the handling of foreign debt (in euros) more
          manageable
        • a stable currency may prevent widespread bankruptcies which could put a
          major strain on the financial and banking system (paragraph )
        • a stable lat might help prevent a process of competitive devaluations among
          currencies pegged to the euro, whereas potential benefits from devaluation
          would be lost if countries like Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania also devalue
          their currencies (paragraph ).

        Disadvantages of maintaining the pegged value:
        • the need to implement a highly restrictive fiscal policy (to qualify for IMF and
          EU loans) requires cuts in spending on merit goods, with long term
          implications for the population (paragraph )
        • the Latvian government is unable to use expansionary fiscal policy to deal with
          the deep recession (paragraph )
        • the government is unable to use expansionary monetary policy (lower interest
          rates) to help the economy come out of the recession (paragraph )
        • the high value of the lat contributes to a continued trade deficit (paragraph )
          due to uncompetitive exports and lower price imports
        • the need to maintain interest rates at a relatively high level restricts economic
          growth by raising the cost of borrowed money
        • the lower growth makes it hard to finance the public debt (paragraph )
        • the need to maintain high interest rates may be contributing to deflation and
          may result in a deflationary spiral.

Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
appropriate, should be rewarded.

If there is no direct reference to the data, then candidates may not be rewarded
beyond level 2.

Effective evaluation may be to:
• consider short run versus long run consequences
• examine the impact on different stakeholders
• discuss advantages and disadvantages
• prioritize the arguments.

                       The idea that it is a type of capital good.

                       An explanation of any one of the following:
                       • essential facilities that add to the capital stock of the economy
                       • capital typically provided by government to make economic
                         activity possible.

                  An answer that simply gives examples of infrastructure should not get any
                  marks.

           (ii)   multilateral aid (paragraph ).                                              [2 marks]

                       countries.

           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS or PPC diagram showing a
           rightward shift of the LRAS curve or PPC, or for explaining that an
           improvement in the quality of labour (improvement in human capital) as a
           result of investment in health and education facilities, can be expected to
           result in an increase in potential output and can therefore can contribute to
           economic growth.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
           For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS or PPC diagram showing a
           rightward shift of the LRAS curve or PPC, and for explaining that an
           improvement in the quality of labour (improvement in human capital) as a
           result of investment in health and education facilities, can be expected to
           result in an increase in potential output and can therefore can contribute to
           economic growth.

      Either the LRAS or Keynesian AS curves may be shifted.            A maximum of
      [2 marks] may be awarded for the shift of an SRAS.

      Another approach would be an explanation that government spending on health
      and education facilities may increase aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to
      the right contributing to economic growth. If this diagram is accurately drawn,
      with an appropriate explanation, then it may be awarded full marks.

      An alternative approach may be to use a poverty cycle diagram to explain how
      “investment in health and education facilities” may break the poverty cycle and
      contribute to economic growth. If this diagram is accurately drawn, with an
      appropriate explanation, then it may be awarded full marks.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or inflation.
      The horizontal axis may be real output, national output, real national output,
      national income (Y), or real GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations, such as APL,
      CPI, RNO or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

      For a PPC diagram, the axis labels should be any two categories of goods that
      compete for the economy’s resources.

           For identifying (stating or illustrating) any poverty cycle which begins
           and ends with low incomes. One common poverty cycle is an explanation
           that low incomes leads to low savings which leads to low investment which
           leads back to low incomes.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely effects of Malawi’s trade and development agreement
      with the EU.                                                            [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      • an explanation of trade liberalisation
      • an explanation of economic development
      • a diagram illustrating the effect of trade liberalisation (e.g. tariff diagram).

      Advantages of a possible agreement on liberalised trade:
      • benefits of free trade (paragraph ) including development, growth and job
        creation
      • other benefits of free trade include lower prices, increased choice, gains from
        specialization, improved political relations, more efficient allocation of
        resources
      • possible increased exports to the EU leading to an improvement in the current
        account
      • growth of manufacturing can contribute to increasing employment as well as
        economic growth in Malawi
      • growth of manufacturing could be encouraged by tariff-free entry of Malawian
        products into the EU
      • opportunity for Malawi to develop comparative advantage
      • less potential for corruption.

      Advantages of a possible agreement on development:
      • provision by the EU of private sector grants, loans and technical assistance can
        contribute to the growth of a manufacturing sector in Malawi (paragraph  )
      • assistance from the EU in the form of aid for trade (building institutions and
        infrastructure) can also help Malawi take advantage of growing export
        opportunities, contributing to growth (paragraph ).

      Disadvantages of the potential agreement:
      • Malawian exports, consisting mainly of agricultural commodities, may not
        increase much if the EU does not eliminate protection of its farmers
      • tariff cuts will reduce the government’s tariff revenues, leaving fewer resources
        to pursue economic development (paragraph )
      • tariff cuts will eliminate protection of infant industries, and may not allow
        Malawi to develop manufacturing sector (paragraph )
      • existing manufacturing firms in Malawi may not be able to survive because of
        low-cost manufacturing imports from the EU
      • manufacturing exports from Malawi to the EU may be unable to compete with
        low-priced EU products
      • the agreement may make it more difficult for Malawi to diversify into
        manufacturing, “locking” it into long term reliance on low-value agricultural
        commodity exports (paragraph )
      • reliance on agricultural commodity exports subjects farmers to unstable
        incomes (due to low PED and PES for agricultural commodities) as well as
        long term deteriorating terms of trade (due to low YED) with negative effects
        on standard of living, investment, employment, the current account and
        economic growth

        • possibility that the EU may not provide enough assistance for development of
          necessary transport infrastructure as well as health and education facilities and
          research and development (R&D) leading to the development of appropriate
          technologies
        • aid may not necessarily be directed to the areas where it is most effective.
