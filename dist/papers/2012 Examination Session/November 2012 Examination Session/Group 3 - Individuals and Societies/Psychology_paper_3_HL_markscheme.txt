Marks      Level descriptor

0          The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors
           below.

1 to 3     There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
           understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to
           the question. The response makes no direct reference to the stimulus
           material or relies too heavily on quotations from the text.

4 to 7     The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
           accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
           addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
           question. The response makes limited use of the stimulus material.

8 to 10    The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
           the demands of the command term. The answer is supported by
           appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of qualitative
           research methodology.       The response demonstrates a critical
           understanding of qualitative research methodology applied to the
           stimulus material.

1.   Explain considerations that the researcher could have taken both before and after
     the interviews in this study.                                                     [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires that candidates give a detailed account, including
     reasons, for the considerations that the researcher could have taken both before and after
     the interviews in this qualitative study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Considerations in conducting a narrative interview should include methodological
     considerations and may also include ethical considerations.

     Relevant considerations before the narrative interviews in the study could include, but
     are not limited to, the following:
      Choice of interviewer: for example, interviewer should be of the same age and sex as
        the participants.
      Recording the interview: decisions about whether to use a tape recorder or taking
        notes when interviewing.
      Transcription of the data: decisions about how to analyse the data (for example,
        inductive content analysis). Relevant explanation could be that inductive content
        analysis is very useful when analysing large amounts of data in order to discover
        strategies used by the young students to construct their profiles.
      Ethical considerations, for example confidentiality since participants were showing
        their private profile on a social networking site.

     Relevant considerations after the interviews in the study could include, but are not
     limited to, the following:
      Debriefing participants after the narrative interviews so that they are assured that
        their data will not be misused and that their identities will be kept confidential.
      The researcher could ask participants to read the transcripts and/or research report
        and ask them to confirm the researcher’s analysis and interpretation of, for example,
        the identified themes in the construction of identity (credibility check).

     Candidates may refer to the considerations taken by the researcher in the study in the
     stimulus material and/or considerations that could have been taken. Both approaches
     are equally acceptable.

     Responses may explain a smaller number of considerations in order to demonstrate
     depth of knowledge, or may explain a larger number of considerations in order to
     demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     Responses that provide considerations that could be taken only before or only after
     interviews should be awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks].

     Responses that do not address methodological considerations and provide only ethical
     considerations should be awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks].

2.   Explain how reflexivity could be used in the context of this study.                          [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires that candidates give a detailed account, including
     reasons, of how reflexivity could be applied in this study and give reasons and causes
     for why this could be relevant by referring to details of the study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Reflexivity in qualitative research is based on the assumption that it is important for a
     researcher to reflect on his or her own contribution to construct meaning in the research
     process. This could include bringing one’s own biases to a research project. For
     example, a researcher may be biased towards the findings of a study because he or she
     perceives and interprets data through his or her own individual lens (i.e. personal
     reflexivity). Using reflexivity in qualitative research could also include reflections of
     whether a specific method is useful in achieving the aim of the study
     (i.e. epistemological reflexivity). Reflexivity is thus a way to establish
     credibility/trustworthiness.

     Since there is not specific reference to the term “reflexivity” in the stimulus material
     candidates need to rely on their knowledge of reflexivity and apply that to the stimulus
     material.

     In the framework of the study in the stimulus material, candidates may, for example,
     argue the following:
      The researcher could think that it is better to meet face-to-face than interacting
        virtually or that interacting virtually is a fantastic way to present yourself the way
        you want other people to see you. The use of a reflective journal could help to limit
        this bias.
      The researcher could include a description of his or her own experiences with social
        networking sites (or lack of it) and reflect on how his or her attitudes to social
        networking could affect the interview process as well as interpretation of the data and
        potential findings of the study.
      The researcher could use reflexivity in relation to whether the narrative interview is
        the most useful to use to study “constructions of identity” in this study.

     Candidates may make reference to personal and epistemological reflexivity when
     explaining how reflexivity could be used but they do not need to use these terms to
     access the higher markbands.

     Responses that provide an explanation of reflexivity but fail to explain how reflexivity
     could be used in the context of the study in the stimulus material should be awarded up
     to a maximum of [5 marks].

3.   Evaluate the use of narrative interviews in this study.                                       [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
     strengths and limitations of the use of narrative interviews in this study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Narratives are individual interpretations of the world and it is known that such
     narratives influence people’s behaviour. A researcher may choose a narrative interview
     when the research is centred around something very personal because it allows
     participants to “tell their story” as they see it. This could be particularly relevant when
     dealing with how participants present themselves in their profiles on a social networking
     site as they do in this study.

     Relevant strengths in the context of this study could include, but are not limited to,
     the following:
      The participants can use their everyday language and communicate freely when they
        present their profile on the social networking site and give their reasons for choosing
        this particular profile.
      The narrative interview gives the participants the opportunity to present their
        own “reality” because they are not interrupted as much as they would be in a
        semi-structured interview.

     Relevant limitations in the context of this study could include, but are not limited to,
     the following:
      Narrative interviews that may produce large amounts of data are potentially difficult
        to analyse. This could be the case in this study where the researcher needed to
        combine information from the narratives with information from the profiles, for
        example, photographs.
      It can be difficult for a researcher to avoid interfering in the narrative interview by
        asking questions, which may bias the participants’ responses.

     Although both strengths and limitations should be addressed, it does not have to be
     evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Candidates may choose to address semi-structured or focus groups as part of the
     evaluation of the narrative interview applied in this study. This should be given credit.

     If a candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [5 marks].
