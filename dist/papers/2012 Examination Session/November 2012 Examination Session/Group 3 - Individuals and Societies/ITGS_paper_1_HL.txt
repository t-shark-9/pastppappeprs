Answer two questions. Each question is worth [20 marks].
1.    Health and dentistry

      Many dentists have upgraded their IT systems by using a local area network (LAN). This makes it
      possible for the dental technician to take an X-ray of a patient’s teeth and for the dentist to review the
      patient’s X-rays on a monitor in another room.

      The upgraded IT system includes simulation software which allows dentists to view the predicted
      changes in the condition of a patient’s teeth over a period of time, showing the result with or
      without treatment.

      With these upgraded systems, dentists are now using electronic, instead of paper, charts for each
      patient. These charts can be updated by the dental technician on one computer while the dentist views
      them on another.

      The patient can also view their charts on a monitor. This is useful when the dentist would like to
      discuss a treatment with the patient.

(Question 1 continued)

      (a)   (i)   Describe one difference between a local area network (LAN) and a wide area
                  network (WAN).                                                                       [2]

		(ii)            The upgraded IT system is a LAN based on a client/server network. Outline the
                  relationship between the client and the server in the upgraded IT system.            [2]

            (iii) The developers of the upgraded IT system own the intellectual property rights for
                  the system. Define the term intellectual property.                                   [2]

      (b)   Analyse the impacts of implementing the upgraded IT system for the dentist.                [6]

      (c)   To what extent should dentists use simulation software to determine future treatment for
            their patients?                                                                            [8]

2.    Live-brary

      A local library has acquired a lending service called Live-brary that uses Adobe Digital Editions
      software which allows borrowers to access free digital content which can be both read online and
      downloaded to read offline. To borrow e-books from the library, borrowers need to install special
      software to download e-books on to their e-reader, smartphone, tablet or laptop.

      Borrowers create an account to register the software. Activation allows the borrower to either read
      the e-book online through streaming or read offline from the downloaded copy that is “borrowed”
      for a period of 7, 14, or 21 days. If a borrower keeps an e-book for more than the number of days
      allowed, then they must pay a fine for each day over the limit.

                            For screenshot, please refer to www.live-brary.com




      Borrowers will need a device to access the library’s website to download the book. The books are
      available in both EPUB and PDF format. Both formats include digital rights management (DRM).

3.    Voice over internet protocol (VOIP)

      Some countries ban services such as Skype, which use VOIP technology.

      Skype and other operators offering VOIP services bypass telephone networks in favour of offering
      free calls via the internet. These countries have laws that state all calls must pass through their
      national telecom companies.

      Skype has more than 500 million users worldwide and many cell/mobile phone providers now offer
      Skype services.

      Skype has been growing in popularity among individuals and businesses to make cheap or free
      international phone calls. Some governments are concerned that their national telecom companies
      will be losing income and will be unable to track conversations.

      As a result, some countries are calling for severe measures to be taken against citizens using illegal
      VOIP services.

		(ii)                Define the term protocol.                                                                      [2]

		(iii) State two stages where a Skype call can be blocked from reaching the
        intended recipient.                                                                                          [2]

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

4.    Online marking

      An examining organization has been advised that it needs to find an IT system to replace its current
      paper-based system. In the paper-based system the papers are sent to various examiners around the
      world who mark the papers with red ink. When the examiner has finished, they send the marked
      papers to the examining organization.

      The proposed solution is to send the candidates’ handwritten exam papers to a scanning centre
      in Singapore. Once the papers are scanned, they are made available to the examiners online. The new
      system will have the following requirements specification:

            Specification
                                                            IT System Requirement
              Number
                 1          Able to handle the increasing number of students taking the exam each year
                 2          Will speed up the marking and processing of the exam papers
                 3          Will be cheaper than the cost of posting exam papers around the world
                 4          Examiners can view the completed exam papers on their computers
                            Able to provide remote access for the examining organization to monitor the
                 5
                            marking of each examiner
                 6          Will be acceptable to all stakeholders

                                     [© International Baccalaureate Organization, 2013]


      The examiners have to install special client software on their PCs to access these online scans of
      completed exam papers and carry out the marking. They also need to have a reliable broadband
      connection because this system does not allow them to download and store the scanned exam papers
      to be marked offline.

      The examining organization has commissioned analysts from a software development company to
      investigate possible solutions.



                                                                     (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 4 continued)

      (a)   (i)   Identify three stakeholders that should be consulted in the initial investigation.      [3]

		(ii)            Identify three methods that the analysts could use in order to collect information
                  about the current system.                                                               [3]

      (b)   As part of their investigation, the analysts carry out a feasibility study. Explain what
            must be included in a feasibility study in this case to ensure that the final product meets
            the client’s requirements.                                                                    [6]

      (c)   All IT projects, such as that proposed by the examining organization, should be based on
            a requirements specification to meet a client’s needs.

		          To what extent does the requirements specification determine the success of IT projects?      [8]

5.    Software development

      La Vianda is a small supermarket whose manager is looking to develop a loyalty card system that
      allows it to send promotional offers to members. To become a member, a customer fills in a form to
      provide their personal details and information about the kind of products they buy.

      The manager of the store has hired Rodriguez Developers to produce software to support this initiative.
      The developers are intending to use agile methodology in order to produce the necessary software
      and data structures. This is an iterative process that involves the supermarket manager as well as
      the developers. The developers use a variety of modelling techniques in order to discuss plans with
      the manager. The modelling process involves making diagrams such as the data flow diagram below.

Answer one question. Each question is worth [20 marks].

6.    Artificial intelligence (AI) / pattern matching

      Images can be analysed by computer software in order to identify the subject. Most image
      analysis is done by looking for “features of interest”. Such features can be edges, corners or blobs
      (binary large objects).

      An edge can be detected by examining the intensity of colour of a row of pixels and determining
      where there is a sudden change.

      A blob is an area where all the pixels have some feature such as colour or shade that is distinct from
      the background.

      Each image has a set of characteristics, as illustrated by the dots in the picture below, that create a
      unique “signature”. This allows the image to be compared with others.

(Question 6 continued)

      Google has produced a phone app called Google Goggles which can examine an image and from this
      information produce a list of likely locations.

      Google Goggles can recognize faces of well-known people, many products, places and buildings.
      It is not very good at recognizing animals or cars.

      Most cell/mobile phones have a range of features such as GPS and a digital compass. They can also
      detect their location with some accuracy by determining the identity of the nearest cell/mobile phone
      base station.


      (a)   (i)    State three practical uses of edge detection in image processing.                    [3]

            (ii)   Identify the steps that Google Goggles may use to establish the location of the
                   image in the photograph.                                                             [3]

      (b)   Explain why the image recognition system is better at recognizing locations than it is at
            recognizing people.                                                                         [6]

      (c)   To what extent can artificial intelligence software combine image processing with
            cell/mobile phone features to help a tourist get the most out of visiting a city?           [8]

7.    Artificial intelligence (AI) / expert systems

      Steve Jackson is a computer shop owner in Pittsburgh. Many people phone his shop saying their
      computer will not start. Steve realizes that most of the problems could be solved by the owner rather
      than needing him to make a visit to carry out the repair.

      Expert systems can be used in a number of ways to try to resolve problems; they can be created using
      an expert system shell.

      Steve has created a simple chart to help his customers, which is based on a decision tree. He hopes
      to develop it into an expert system that can be used to resolve simple computer problems.

(Question 7 continued)

      (b)   A school has decided to interview students who need advice in choosing their
            diploma subjects. It has purchased an expert system to assist with this. Students may take
            either ITGS or computer science, but not both.

             Both ITGS and computer science require students to have an interest in how
              computers function.
             Both ITGS and computer science require students to have an interest in social and
              ethical issues related to computing.
             Computer science is recommended to those students who enjoy programming.

            Copy and complete the information below to construct a decision tree that could be
            used as part of an expert system in order to automate this subject advice.                    [6]

      (c)   Many schools are using expert systems to help students in making decisions about which
            subjects to take as part of their diploma.

            To what extent is it appropriate to use an expert system as the only method of giving
            advice to a student in their choice of diploma subject?                                       [8]
