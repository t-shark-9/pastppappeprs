Optional Theme A — Freshwater – issues and conflicts

1.   (a)   Describe two processes involved in the transport of a river’s load.             [2+2 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for identifying the process, and [1 mark] for a brief
           elaboration of each process.
           Suspension: particles of finer materials such as clay and silt are held up by
           turbulence and make up most of the total load.
           Solution: the dissolved load, derived from the solution of rocks containing
           carbonates or salts.
           Traction: the movement of the largest particles such as cobbles or boulders
           along the stream bed.
           Saltation: the “jumping”/bouncing of medium-sized particles along the bed.
           Flotation: leaves and twigs carried on the surface of the river.

     (b)   Explain two environmental impacts of agriculture on water quality.              [3+3 marks]
           The environmental impacts could include salinization, agro-chemical runoff,
           pollution of groundwater and eutrophication. For each impact award [1 mark]
           for use of the correct term and a further [2 marks] for development.

           For example, eutrophication [1 mark] is a nutrient enrichment of streams and
           lakes caused by agricultural runoff from nitrate fertilizers carrying excess
           nutrients [1 mark]. This can cause algal blooms and reduced levels of oxygen
           in water [1 mark].
                                                 –4–               N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(c)   “Floodplain management strategies have more costs than benefits.” Discuss this
           statement. [10 marks]

           Responses should discuss how strategies may prevent or exacerbate the flood
           risk, or may do both depending on the hydrological conditions prevalent at the
           time. Possible strategies could include:
           • the construction of artificial levees
           • flood barriers/walls to protect settlements
           • flood relief channels
           • flood basins or zones to absorb floodwater
           • the creation/maintenance/restoration of wetland areas
           • the removal of settlements from flood prone areas
           • afforestation to increase interception
           • enlargement of the channel e.g. by dredging
           • straightening of river channels
           • terracing, soil bunds and contour ploughing to reduce runoff
           • dam construction – though this not always related to floodplains.

           Answers may refer to several strategies in breadth or fewer strategies in more
           depth. The inclusion of floodplain examples is not directly asked for but these
           are expected in responses reaching band D and above.

           Answers that simply describe strategies without discussing whether they
           increase or decrease floods (or both) should not move above band C.
           Responses that present a balanced argument are likely to be credited at bands
           E and F.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                  –5–               N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Describe four differences between the two hydrographs shown on the
           diagram.                                                                             [4 marks]

           Differences could include:
           •     higher peak discharge in the urban area
           •     shorter lag time in the urban area
           •     steeper rising limb in the urban area
           •     the longer peak discharge in the forested area
           •     there may be other features e.g. differences in base flow, urban
              hydrograph has two peaks.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid difference. For full marks there should be some
           quantification.

     (b)   Suggest reasons why the urban and forested hydrographs show different
           responses to the storm event.                                                        [6 marks]

           Answers should refer to the reasons for the rapid response in the urban area due
           to lack of interception, impermeable surfaces (roads, roofs, paving), thereby
           reducing infiltration, and the presence of artificial and rapid drainage channels
           (drains, sewers, flood channels), explaining the rapid rising limb, high peak
           discharge and rapid falling limb on account of overland flow/runoff.

           The slower and lower response in the forested area could be explained by
           higher interception, the retention of water by litter, absorption by root systems,
           high soil and bedrock permeability.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid reason suggested and award additional marks
           for depth of explanation (of the operation of factors and associated processes).
                                             –6–              N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(c)   With reference to a named river flood event, examine the relative
      importance of natural and human causes.                                          [10 marks]

      The flood event should be located and dated by year.

      Possible natural causes could be:
      •     excessive heavy or prolonged rainfall including flash flooding
      •     rapid snowmelt
      •     high antecedent rainfall and/or low rates of evaporation
      •     frozen ground preventing infiltration
      •     relief or basin shape conducive to flooding
      •     the nature of the soil/bedrock.

      Possible human causes might include:
      •     removal of vegetation/deforestation
      •     urbanization of river basins
      •     farming methods that cause soil compaction
      •     river control that reduces flood arrival times downriver
      •     river control that results in higher peak discharge downriver
      •     straightening of river channels
      •     removal of wetland areas.

      Not all of the above need to be included but the causes must be related to the
      named river flood event. Answers that do not refer to an actual event should
      not move above band C. Answers that examine the relative importance of
      human and natural causes are likely to be credited at bands E and F.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                 –7–               N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Optional Theme B — Oceans and their coastal margins

3.   (a)   Identify two reasons shown on the diagram why some coasts advance.                  [2 marks]

           Emergence / an emerging coast [1 mark].
           Deposition / an outbuilding coast [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain why cliffs are often found along retreating coasts.                         [3 marks]

           Sea is gaining/eroding the land to cause a cliff [1 mark]. Award further marks
           for an explanation of two or more processes, or an explanation of the cyclical
           nature of cliff erosion (wave-cut notch and subsequent collapse). Another
           approach may be to argue that a sea-level rise exposes new parts of the
           coastline to erosion/undercutting. There may be alternative explanations.

     (c)   Explain the global distribution of ocean ridges.                                    [5 marks]

           Ridges are a linear belt of submarine mountains / or other definitional
           statement [1 mark]. They occur at spreading (divergent) plate boundaries
           [1 mark] where convection currents in the mantle cause the plates to diverge
           thus allowing magma to rise [1 mark]. The mid-ocean position should be clear
           [1 mark] and additional marks should be awarded for use of examples.

           Other valid developments (including those using a diagram) can be awarded
           marks in substitution for those identified above.

     (d)   Examine how the exploitation of one named oceanic resource has led to
           geopolitical conflict.                                                             [10 marks]

           The question does not specify a particular resource, so candidates may examine
           fish, oil or other mineral resources. There should be some identification of the
           countries involved, the resource, the dispute and the nature of the conflict.

           To reach band E and above, candidates are expected to have used one or more
           detailed, named examples. Potential examples include: Canada, Denmark,
           Norway, Russia and USA over Arctic oil and gas; South Korea and Japan over
           the East Sea/Sea of Japan (either oil or fishing).

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                  –8–              N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   (a)   Outline one economic and one environmental benefit of coral reefs.                  [2+2 marks]

           Economic benefits include a range of tourist activities, fish stocks/nurseries,
           coral sales, economic role as “nature’s flood defence” protecting coastal assets.
           Environmental benefits include maintaining biodiversity/habitats, role in
           marine food webs, carbon sink, environmental role in protecting coastlines.

           In each case, award [1 mark] for identifying a valid benefit and [1 mark] for
           development or exemplification.

     (b)   Explain the function of the oceanic conveyor belt(s).                                 [6 marks]

           An overview of the OCB’s importance would be that it has a vital global role
           [1 mark] in regulating/moderating Earth’s ocean and atmospheric conditions
           (there are other ways of expressing this) [1 mark].

           The remaining [4 marks] should be allocated for more detailed explanation
           either of the causes/functioning of OCB or a more detailed examination of its
           role in specific regions e.g. transferring heat/energy between the Pacific and
           Indian Oceans and the Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic is therefore warmer
           than the North Pacific, so there is likely to be more evaporation, condensation
           and precipitation there. There are other important regional effects too, notably
           cold counter-current returning to the equator, leading to localized cooling in
           equatorial waters. Some aspects of OCB are still not fully understood / science
           is contested, and good answers may reflect on this.

           Also accept wider interpretation of importance for human settlement and
           activities e.g. mild maritime climate of NW Europe.

     (c)   Examine the economic effects of El Niño and/or La Niña events.                       [10 marks]

           El Niño – along with La Niña – is officially defined as a sustained sea
           surface temperature anomaly across the central tropical Pacific Ocean.
           The mechanisms which cause these events are not well understood and are
           not expected to always be well-articulated in candidate responses. Some
           background explanation of the phenomenon may be useful in order to help
           explain the economic impacts.

           There are both direct effects in the local zone of influence and knock-on effects
           in other places. There are both positives and negatives in both instances.

           During normal (non-El Niño) conditions, at the ocean surface easterly trade
           winds move water and lower atmosphere air warmed by the sun towards the
           west. This also creates ocean upwelling off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador and
           brings nutrient-rich cold water to the surface, increasing fishing stocks.

           El Niño events are associated with warm and very wet summers (December to
           February) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador, with the economic
           costs of major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme.
                                      –9–               N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Further afield, El Niño events also result in drier conditions in parts of
Southeast Asia and parts of Australia and the economic impacts of this,
including bush fires, can also be addressed. Fewer tropical cyclones in western
Pacific reduces disaster costs.

Changes to ocean currents can affect local fishing industries along affected
coastlines (for instance, Peruvian anchovies may migrate south to Chilean
waters).

La Niña events are essentially the opposite of El Niño events and are
characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the eastern equatorial
Pacific. Rain on the western coasts of the Pacific is heavier than usual.
Atlantic tropical cyclone activity is generally enhanced during La Niña events.
Economic impacts of all of this may be explored although it is not necessary
for full marks to be awarded.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme C — Extreme environments

5.   (a)   Describe the distribution of hyper-arid and semi-arid regions in Africa.           [2+2 marks]

           Hyper-arid: a very broad band across much of north Africa (may list countries
           but expect a distribution-type comment) [1 mark]. Award [1 mark] for a
           further aspect of distribution, such as smaller distributions in south-west
           (Namibia) and in north-east Africa (accept east).

           Semi-arid: award [1 mark] for each aspect of the distribution that is
           well-described or exemplified (e.g. found either side of the arid in the north);
           encircling the central/D R Congo/humid regions; discontinuous distribution in
           east Africa; widespread in southern Africa, especially in Botswana and
           Zimbabwe.

     (b)   Using located examples, suggest possible socio-economic impacts of
           climate change for arid and/or semi-arid environments.                               [6 marks]

           Climate predictions for arid and semi-arid areas are extremely varied.
           The approach taken will depend on the example used (e.g. some predictions for
           Sahel show increased, not decreased, rainfall).

           Possible economic impacts include reduced crop yields, increased cost of
           irrigation water, cost of imports, the need for more dams etc. Negative impacts
           on economic activity may be linked to increased evaporation, water shortages,
           soil erosion, land degradation etc.

           Social impacts for indigenous populations and settlements could include
           out-migration/loss of traditional nomadic cultures etc., increased prevalence of
           disease, conflict due to resource shortages, etc.

           Award up to [4 marks] for the explanation of a range of socio-economic
           impacts and up to [2 marks] for the effective use of examples.

     (c)   Examine the importance of water in the development of the landforms in
           any one extreme environment (glacial, periglacial, or hot, arid).                   [10 marks]

           For example, in hot, arid areas, water action includes erosion and deposition by
           exotic, endoreic and ephemeral rivers. Flash floods can produce sheetwash.
           Features include canyons, wadis, alluvial fans and bajadas. Water is also
           important in weathering in desert areas (Griggs’ experiments). However, water
           action is not responsible for all desert land forms. Wind action forms dunes
           (barchans, seif, star etc.), deflation hollows, yardangs and zeugens.

           A similar approach is valid for each of the other extreme environments.
           To achieve band E and above, particular landforms should be correctly
           identified and explained in a way that may acknowledge the contribution that
           other processes may also be making.

           For answers examining more than one environment, only the highest scoring
           environment should be credited.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                  – 11 –            N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   (a)   (i)    Define the term freeze-thaw.                                                   [1 mark]

                  The freezing and subsequent thawing of water / when temperature rises
                  above and falls below freezing/0°C [1 mark].

           (ii)   Describe the seasonal variations in the number of freeze-thaw days.            [3 marks]

                  There appears to be two peaks (bimodal): one in late spring and one in
                  Fall/Autumn [1 mark]. There are fewer in the summer and also in winter
                  [1 mark]. Credit attempts at quantification or any other significant detail
                  [1 mark].
                  A list of monthly data should receive no more than [2 marks].

     (b)   Explain the importance of freeze-thaw cycles and solifluction processes for
           the development of periglacial landforms.                                             [6 marks]

           Award up to [4 marks] for an explanation of how either process is linked to the
           development of one or more landforms.              For instance, freeze-thaw
           (and associated frost heave) play a key role in the development of patterned
           ground and pingos (could also include tors or aspects of thermokarst).
           Solifluction is likely to be linked with patterned ground (also possibly lobes,
           terracettes). For the award of the full [6 marks], both processes should be
           included and related to the landform(s).

     (c)   Examine how the physical characteristics of any one extreme environment
           (glacial, periglacial, or hot, arid) affect resource development.                    [10 marks]

           For a periglacial environment, the characteristics are likely to include climate,
           permafrost, hours of daylight, length of winter, waterlogging, poor soils and
           subsidence (thermokarst). There are also a number of hazards such as
           avalanches, rock falls, icings and frost heave. These make resource
           development such as mining and associated infrastructure construction
           difficult. Services need to be provided in insulated pipes called utilidors.
           Waste disposal is difficult because of the low temperatures. Credit other ideas,
           for instance, management or risks associated with resource development,
           e.g. oil spills are broken down very slowly in cold temperatures; or ideas about
           farming / tourism / nature of ecosystem services.

           A similar approach is valid for the other extreme environments. For glacial
           environments, the physical characteristics might include altitude, gradient,
           temperatures, depth of snow/ice, annual snowfall, speed of glacial movement,
           ablation, etc.

           For hot, arid environments, the characteristics might include water availability
           (aquifers, oases), evaporation, type of surface (sand, rock, pebbles), gradient,
           temperature range (diurnal/seasonal) etc.

           To access band E and above, answers should refer to named examples.
           For answers examining more than one extreme environment, only the
           highest-scoring environment should be credited.
           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme D — Hazards and disasters – risk assessment and response

7.   (a)   Describe the atmospheric conditions in the eye and the eyewall of a typical
           hurricane.                                                                  [2+2 marks]

           In the eye the air is shown to be descending/warming [1 mark]. This results in
           calm weather and clear skies [1 mark].
           In the eyewall the air is rising, rotating around the eye / cooling [1 mark].
           This results in strong winds and heavy rain [1 mark].

           Accept other plausible answers such as references to the release of latent heat
           in the eyewall causing rapid uplift / atmospheric pressure variations.

     (b)   Explain the conditions needed for the occurrence of a hurricane hazard
           event.                                                                             [6 marks]

           Valid conditions might include:
           •     warm ocean temperatures of 26/27o C provide the energy for the
               hurricane due to high rates of evaporation that trap latent heat which is
               released when condensation occurs during uplift
           •     suitable distance from the equator – allows the Coriolis force to operate
               giving rotation to the storm
           •     a stable atmosphere with no wind shear – the lack of variable wind speed
               with altitude allows vertical development of the storm to occur
           •     allow other valid conditions such as warm water depth of 50 m
           •     concentrated/vulnerable population in areas where the hazard is likely to
               strike e.g. coastal areas / removal of mangrove etc.

           Answers should consider at least two conditions in detail or more in less detail
           to gain full marks. There should be some acknowledgement of the human
           dimension of the hazard event for maximum marks.

(c)   “Rich countries experience hazard events while poor countries experience
      disasters.”  Discuss this statement with reference to one named
      hazard type.                                                                        [10 marks]

      Answers should distinguish between a hazard (a threat that may cause loss of
      life or damage to property and the environment) and a disaster (resulting from
      a major hazard event and causing significant disruption, losses to life, property
      and ecosystems that the affected community is unable to deal with adequately
      without outside help).

      Answers depend upon the type of hazard chosen but should refer to only one
      hazard type. It is expected that answers will discuss the ways in which rich
      countries are able to introduce measures that mitigate the effects of a hazard
      event thus reducing its impacts while poor countries are less able to do this and
      remain more vulnerable to the impacts of hazard events. It is expected that
      examples of hazard events from rich countries and poor countries would be
      included to illustrate this. Good answers may suggest that rich countries are
      also vulnerable to disasters dependent on the intensity and location of the
      hazard event.

      Answers that refer to multiple hazards should only be credited for the best of
      these. Answers that simply describe hazard events in poor countries and rich
      countries should not move above band D. To reach bands E and F a balanced
      discussion is expected.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

8.   (a)   Describe the changes shown in the graph.                                             [4 marks]

           Award [1 mark] for each valid statement supported by evidence from the graph
           including dates and costs. Possible answers include:
           • a general upward trend in the cost of hazard events (e.g. no events costing
              over $25 billion before 1975, many events costing over $50 billion after 1988)
           • but not a simple rise – there are fluctuations
           • identification of major anomalies/cost events (Kobe, Indian Ocean tsunami)
           • fall in 2000s compared with 1990s
           • there may be other creditable points.
     (b)   Explain the reasons for these changes.                                               [6 marks]

           Answers could refer to:
           • people have more possessions and more valuable possessions over time
           • the increasing value of property and infrastructure over time
           • more people are living in hazard prone areas.

           Award [1 mark] for each valid reason; some development of each reason is
           expected for [2 marks]. Accept other valid reasons but they must include a
           clear explanation.
           Answers that refer to an increase in the number or intensity of hazard events
           over time must give valid supporting evidence.

     (c)   Examine the different types of responses that occurred during and after a
           named disaster. (Do not refer to technological hazards in your answer.)             [10 marks]

           The disaster must be dated and located. How the event resulted in a disaster
           should be explained. The answer should refer to specific short-term (“during”
           as well as possibly before or immediate aftermath), medium and long-term
           responses (“after”) related to the actual hazard event.

           Short-term responses might include: search and rescue, emergency medical
           assistance, provision of security, emergency shelter, food and water and the
           clearing of debris resulting from the hazard event. Medium-term responses
           might include: destruction of damaged buildings, restoration of services such
           as communications, health care, transport and retailing, the return of displaced
           persons and rehabilitation programmes. Long-term responses may include:
           reconstruction, planning for future hazard events in terms of emergency
           response systems, the introduction of measures to mitigate future impact on
           people and property, awareness education and hazard training, the development
           of warning systems and evacuation strategies where relevant.

           There may be alternate approaches – such as an examination of the efforts
           made by different agencies (NGOs, governments, etc.) – and these should be
           credited. Answers that simply describe local responses to a hazard event, as
           opposed to a disaster requiring outside assistance should not move above
           band D. Answers that examine a range of responses may be credited at bands
           E and F. Responses that examine a disaster outside the scope of the syllabus
           (e.g. floods) should be marked on their merits.

Optional Theme E — Leisure, sport and tourism

9.   (a)   Describe the trends shown in the graph.                                             [4 marks]
           •      government expenditure has grown in all areas
           •      south Asia and Caribbean growth higher than world average, Europe
               lower
           •      suggesting a developed world/developing world divergence
           •      the period of divergence begins in mid-2000s
           •      growth flattened for south Asia around 2008–2009
           •      there may be other relevant observations.
           Award [1 mark] for each valid statement up to a maximum of [4 marks].
           Quantification is desirable but not essential given the complex nature of
           indexed data.

     (b)   Using a located example, explain two strategies used to develop tourism in
           low-income countries.                                                               [6 marks]

           Strategies could include government and/or private initiatives. Examples could
           range from a local ecotourism initiative in a low-income country to a
           national-scale promotion. Responsible tourism that safeguards the interests of
           indigenous people may be another approach. There may be other approaches.
           Possible strategies that may be explored include investing in marketing and
           branding, infrastructure (such as airports, roads, communications etc.),
           investment in education and training for local people (very important in
           low-income countries), conserving tourism resources for the future, providing
           subsidies and financial incentives for tourist developments, specific planning
           legislation to support tourist development.
           Award up to [3 marks] for the explanation of each strategy, provided it is
           accompanied by a located example.

     (c)   For a country you have studied, to what extent do the economic benefits of
           tourism outweigh the environmental costs?                                          [10 marks]

           Answers will vary depending upon the case study chosen, but could include
           economic advantages such as employment and investment (as well as benefits
           to overseas tourism operators through leakages, etc.). Increased employment
           in the hospitality sector provides income (albeit often poorly paid and seasonal
           – and a good answer may want to comment on the sometimes debatable nature
           of the economic benefits).
           The other side of the debate should focus on the environmental costs
           (e.g. natural resource consumption), waste (energy and water), loss of habitats
           (e.g. coral reefs, mangroves, etc.) because of development / visitor pressures.
           May use carrying capacity concept linked to trampling, etc.
           There may be other approaches. Answers are expected to compare the costs
           and benefits rather than simply stating them and should arrive at an evaluative
           conclusion at band E. Direct reference to a relevant case study is required to
           access markbands above band D.
           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

10.   (a)   Outline one political and one economic factor that affect participation
            in sport.                                                               [2+2 marks]

            Political factors could include investment in sports facilities, public health and
            education investment, education policies, subsidies for sporting activities and
            governing bodies, legislation.

            Economic factors could include availability of private sports facilities, level of
            public investment in sports facilities, quantity of personal disposable income,
            cost of sporting equipment. Any single factor may have different effects at
            different scales (local, national, international).

            In each case, award [1 mark] for identifying a valid factor and [1 mark] for a
            brief outline of how it affects sports participation. For example, investment in
            public health and education can impact participation because it raises public
            awareness of the personal health benefits of involvement in sport, making it
            more likely for people to participate. Public education also makes people more
            likely to participate because they are frequently prompted to participate by the
            public information.

      (b)   Referring to a national sports league you have studied, explain the factors
            that have determined the home location of its teams.                                  [6 marks]

            Answers will vary depending upon the sport chosen and its context but must
            examine a sports league of national importance. Factors are likely to include
            population density, socio-economic factors, cultural and historical factors,
            government and private investment, and proximity to competing teams.
            There are other valid responses that should be credited.

            Award up to [3 marks] for each factor that is well explained. A wider range of
            factors can compensate for less depth. A generic answer, or one using an
            inappropriate example, should not be awarded more than [3 marks].

      (c)   To what extent can tourism ever be made sustainable?                                 [10 marks]

            Answers may make use of contrasting examples, some successful, some not.
            Answers should show a sound understanding of the concept of sustainability
            (supporting local people while conserving resources for the future).

            Answers are likely to make reference to the pressures resulting from tourism,
            efforts to minimize impact of the tourism activity, including transport,
            accommodation, tourist activities and resource use and waste disposal. These
            efforts should be evaluated rather than simply described as a success or failure
            in order to access the higher markbands.

            Responses may evaluate the effectiveness of tourism in sustaining both
            societies and ecosystems in the long-term.

Optional Theme F — The geography of food and health

11.   (a)   Describe the difference between malnutrition and low calorie intake.                    [2 marks]

            Malnutrition means an inadequate/unbalanced supply of energy, vitamins or
            other food-based nutrients (malnutrition includes both under- and
            over-nutrition) [1 mark]. Low calorie intake is a subset of malnutrition and is
            therefore a condition where people receive insufficient calories to maintain a
            healthy weight [1 mark].

      (b)   Describe the pattern of undernourishment shown on the map.                              [4 marks]

            The highest rate/prevalence of undernourishment (over 50 %) is in central
            Africa [1 mark], especially the DRC [1 mark]. South/southeast Asia is
            generally lower than Africa but higher than Europe/Russia/Australia [1 mark].

            Other important features that may be awarded [1 mark] include: low levels in
            north Africa and south Africa; lower levels in the Middle East; higher value
            (may describe as anomaly) in Mongolia/central Asia.

            For the award of full marks some quantification is necessary.

            N.B. country names are not essential for the award of the full [4 marks].

      (c)   Explain two economic causes of food deficiency.                                       [2+2 marks]

            The economic causes of food deficiency include: price increases in staple food
            items (regardless of why or how they arise, whether from local changes or
            changes in other regions or countries); transition from food-based agriculture to
            non-food commercial or export agriculture; inadequate transport infrastructure
            for food (including food aid) to be supplied and/or distributed efficiently;
            failure to invest in irrigation projects meaning that the area is unable to cope in
            times of low rainfall or drought. Credit other valid causes.

            Award [1 mark] for each valid cause, with a further [1 mark] for its
            development.

(d)   With reference to any one vector-borne, water-borne or sexually
      transmitted disease, compare its geographic impacts at the local and
      international scales.                                                               [10 marks]

      The response will depend on the disease selected. The relative importance of
      local and international scales will differ depending on the disease selected.

      Some diseases, such as river blindness, have a serious local impact (and some
      national impacts) but relatively few or no international impacts. Other diseases,
      such as SARS and A-H1N1 influenza have the potential to impact all scales.
      Knowledge of the biology/pathology of the chosen disease is not expected,
      except in so far as it determines specific impacts of geographic importance.

      Responses accessing band D and above should refer to both scales, though the
      amount of depth for each scale need not be equal. Credit should only be
      awarded for a single disease. In the case of responses which consider more
      than one disease, the disease scoring most marks should be credited.

      Responses reaching bands E/F are expected to show accurate knowledge of a
      disease, and to consider a range of impacts before concluding whether or not
      the impacts are similar at the two scales.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                   – 19 –             N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



12.   (a)   Briefly describe what is meant by “obesity”.                                           [2 marks]

            BMI (Body Mass Index) over a certain number / a form of malnutrition
            [1 mark], usually resulting from energy (calorie) intake exceeding the amount
            required [1 mark].

      (b)   Suggest why heart disease is considered a “disease of affluence”.                      [4 marks]

            Rates of heart disease are lower in poorer countries than in
            richer/wealthier/more developed countries [1 mark]. Award [1 mark] for each
            factor that is explained. These may include dietary factors e.g. a high fat intake
            (especially high saturated fat), high levels of “bad” cholesterol, and obesity.
            Lifestyle factors include insufficient physical exercise, stress levels, preference
            for sedentary occupations, reliance on powered forms of movement such as
            motor vehicles rather than walking, and decision to spend discretionary income
            on particular kinds of food.

            For [4 marks] both dietary factors and lifestyle factors should be addressed.
            A wide range of suggested factors may compensate for depth of explanation.

      (c)   With the aid of a diagram or diagrams, explain the spatial process of a
            disease spreading through “diffusion by relocation”.                                   [4 marks]

            Relocation diffusion involves the movement of individuals [1 mark], taking the
            disease with them to new locations [1 mark] where it continues to spread
            through contact with then more people (e.g. airline passengers) [1 mark].
            Credit other valid points, including an example of a disease such as SARS for
            [1 mark]. Responses which do not include a diagram may not be awarded
            more than [3 marks].

      (d)   Examine the factors which have led to more food becoming available in
            some areas in recent years.                                                           [10 marks]

            Numerous factors can result in more food becoming available.

            The first major group of factors is those related to the improved productivity
            and/or total production of food-related agriculture. These factors include:
            increased area under cultivation as a result of land clearance and/or irrigation;
            higher yields due to better technology (e.g. drip irrigation instead of flood
            irrigation), mechanization, improved varieties (including GM crops and
            livestock).

            Distribution and storage is also important. More food may become available
            because less is lost or damaged in transit as a result of improvements in the
            distribution network (highways, rail, planes) or in the vehicles used
            (e.g. refrigeration). Improved packing methods may also be important.
            Subsidies to local farmers for food crops, and reductions in food exports may
            also raise the amount of food available locally. Equally, a rise in income may
            also increase the availability of food within some sectors of society.
                                      – 20 –            N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



Increased food imports also play a part, and this means that increased
availability of food may depend on the success of harvests a long way away
from their eventual destination.

While changes of climate may bear some responsibility for increased food
availability in some areas, this will normally be restricted to those areas which
were previously suffering from a prolonged condition such as an extreme
drought.

It is expected that responses reaching markbands E/F will consider a variety of
factors, and support their ideas with accurate examples.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   Identify the two major components of urban growth.                                  [2 marks]

            Natural change [1 mark] and net migration [1 mark].

            There may be alternative ways of expressing these two components/processes
            and these should be credited.

      (b)   Referring to the map, describe the relationship between the level of
            urbanization and urban growth rate.                                                 [3 marks]

            The level of urbanization and urban growth rate show a negative relationship
            (i.e. cities with high annual growth more likely to be found in countries at an
            early stage of urbanization or vice-versa) [1 mark].
            This can be exemplified through mention of specific countries or regions
            (e.g. the majority of cities with negative growth are found in Europe and North
            America) [1 mark].
            For a third mark, either name or describe an anomaly (e.g. China and Brazil are
            anomalies because they contain significant numbers of cities with high and
            negative growth) or provide some quantification (e.g. making use of the
            urbanization percentages) [1 mark].

      (c)   Explain the pull factors associated with counter-urbanization.                      [5 marks]

            Counter-urbanization should be defined as a centrifugal movement /
            urban-rural movement (there may be other ways of expressing this) [1 mark].

            The remaining [4 marks] are available for identifying and explaining the pull
            factors such as perceived environmental/social quality, housing
            availability/costs, commuting potential, pursuit of specific employment
            opportunities, amongst others. Either two factors can be well-explained for full
            marks or a larger range in less detail.

      (d)   Discuss the challenges facing one or more cities experiencing rapid growth.        [10 marks]

            Answers are expected to identify the negative consequences of high growth
            rates in urban areas (scale can vary from megacity to smaller cities).
            Expect references to problems with housing, utilities, services, employment,
            public health and communication infrastructure. These problems are in turn
            likely to have economic impacts, as well as environmental impacts.

            At bands E and F expect more than a list of problems. The scale of the
            challenges may be commented on, or the nature of rapid growth making it hard
            for city authorities to manage the growth successfully (and there may be links
            with the concept of sustainability).

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                  – 22 –            N12/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


14.   (a)   Using map evidence, describe two characteristics of Area A which suggest
            it is a high-class residential area.                                     [2+2 marks]

            Possible answers include open space/landscaping, size and density of
            housing/buildings, curved/well-planned streets, cul-de-sacs or no-through
            streets, university, public transport access, lack of negatives (e.g. industry).
            Candidates should be awarded [1 mark] for each identified characteristic and
            [1 mark] for further description, brief justification/reasoning.

      (b)   Using map evidence, suggest three reasons why Area B may be a suitable
            location for a manufacturing activity.                                [2+2+2 marks]

            The area has excellent transport links and a port area providing ease of access
            and import/export, proximity to coast/road/highway, proximity to residential
            areas for labour supply, open space / room for expansion, possibly lower cost
            land (perhaps reclaimed, flood risk, etc.). These may be possible brownfield
            sites that are suitable for development.

            Candidates should be awarded [1 mark] for each identified reason and
            [1 mark] for a brief explanation, provided some mention is made of map
            evidence (grid reference, names, directions, distances etc.).

      (c)   With reference to one named example, evaluate the success of a strategy
            designed to manage pollution in an urban area.                                     [10 marks]

            The type of pollution depends upon the case study chosen, but it should be a
            case study of urban pollution (as opposed to any pollution event).
            Strategies discussed may include water treatment and infrastructure, transport
            strategies, legislation, planning strategies etc.

            The response should explicitly outline the strategy adopted to manage the
            pollution, with reference to specific names and locations.

            Responses should provide a clear evaluation of the management strategy rather
            than simple description. Responses that are limited to description or do not
            make reference to a specific case study should not progress beyond
            band D.

            Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
