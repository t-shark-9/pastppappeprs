1.       (a)   Explain why merit goods are an example of market failure.                   [10 marks]
               Answers should include:
               • a definition of merit goods
               • a definition of market failure
               • a definition of positive externalities
               • examples of merit goods such as education and health care
               • an explanation that the positive externalities associated with the
                 consumption of merit goods leads to their under-provision/
                 under-consumption at market price
               • use of a diagram to show the under-provision/under-consumption of merit
                 goods in a market economy.

               Answers may include:
               • under-provision of merit goods also occurs because people do not always
                 act in their own best interests.

               Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
               which if appropriate, should be rewarded.

(b)   Evaluate the view that high unemployment is the most serious economic
      problem a country can face.                                                     [15 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • the problems unemployment poses for a country in terms of:
        – poverty/loss of income for the unemployed
        – mental and physical health of those unemployed
        – impact on the families of the unemployed
        – negative externalities of unemployment, e.g. crime, social deprivation
        – falling AD and business failure through the “fear” of unemployment
        – negative impact on government finance through higher benefits and
           falling tax revenues
      • an explanation that the seriousness of the problem of unemployment
        depends on the country concerned. For example, the poverty caused by
        unemployment is a serious problem in LDCs without a welfare system
      • comparison with other economic problems that might affect the economy
        such as inflation, growth and income inequality
      • an explanation that short term unemployment is not associated with major
        problems whereas long term structural unemployment can lead to more
        serious consequences
      • an explanation that unemployment can bring benefits for firms who have
        more workers to choose from
      • an explanation that unemployment may lead to more efficient labour as staff
        turnover falls and workers are more motivated to keep their jobs
      • an explanation that unemployment may reduce business costs by lowering
        real wages.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences

      • use of examples to show the impact of a depreciating currency.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
      • consider short-term versus long-term consequences
      • examine the impact on different stakeholders
      • discuss advantages and disadvantages
      • prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
