 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
        processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as evidence
        to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast,
        placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately and
        effectively.

Topic 1   Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   “The role of the peace treaties from 1919 to 1920 in causing the Second World War has been
     greatly exaggerated.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This will probably be a popular question as it offers candidates an opportunity to reflect upon the
     relative importance of the Paris Peace Treaties as causes of the Second World War. Candidates
     may focus upon the terms of the Treaty of Versailles but other treaties do need to be considered
     (Neuilly, Saint-Germain, Trianon and Sèvres). The question asks for a considered evaluation of the
     statement and better answers should assess whether or not it was the peace treaties rather than other
     factors such as: the Great Depression; the rise of Hitler; the failure of the League or perhaps
     appeasement that were, arguably, more important as causes of the Second World War. There is an
     opportunity here for candidates to demonstrate knowledge of historiography. Better answers should
     demonstrate awareness that this question requires consideration of a variety of factors/causes. A
     simple description of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles would be unlikely to score well.


2.   For what reasons, and in what ways, was guerrilla warfare a decisive factor in the outcome of
     two twentieth century wars?

     Popular choices may include the Chinese Civil War, the Vietnam War, the Cuban Revolution or the
     Algerian War. Candidates need to choose two wars and to address both parts of the questions to
     score well.

     When addressing “For what reasons” candidates may include factors such as: the appeal of an
     ideological struggle against an unpopular government; sympathy that may be elicited from abroad
     by the notion of a small, determined group fighting a powerful enemy; support that may have been
     forthcoming from a powerful ally; the ability to form a local network in preparation for an invasion
     force (as was the case in the Second World War, for example).

     “In what ways” allows candidates to consider factors such as: the ability of guerrilla groups to use
     the local terrain to good advantage; the ability to make do with limited resources; the use of classic
     guerrilla techniques such as those written about by Mao or Guevara; the promotion of national
     resistance or religious opposition to an invasion force (as in Afghanistan); links between urban
     guerrillas and guerrillas in the countryside; propaganda etc.

     If only one war is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

3.   Compare and contrast the role of economic factors in the outbreak of two twentieth century
     wars, each chosen from a different region.

     Candidates need to choose two wars and each must be from a different region. It is expected that
     economic factors and their importance in the outbreak of the wars will be analysed and better
     answers may approach the question thematically rather than adopting an end-on or sequential
     treatment. Economic factors may include: competition for resources such as oil or colonies;
     problems arising from unemployment or a recession; unequal distribution of wealth leading to
     domestic conflict; the use of war as a distraction from political unrest resulting from economic
     problems; conflict between rival economic ideologies. These are possible examples of economic
     causes but other factors may be identified and commented upon depending on the wars chosen.

     If only one war or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

4.   Assess the contribution of foreign intervention to the outcome of either the Spanish Civil War
     (1936–1939) or the Nigerian Civil War (1967–1970).

     For the Spanish Civil War, candidates could refer to: the military support provided by Hitler and
     Mussolini to the Nationalists; the transit facilities provided by Portugal to Franco’s forces; the
     provision of oil supplies on credit by private US oil companies as well as the involvement of the
     International Brigades and the USSR on the Republican side. The significance of foreign
     intervention should be assessed critically for a high mark to be awarded. For instance, candidates
     may refer to: the assistance given by Hitler to the transportation of Franco’s troops to Spain; the
     involvement of the Luftwaffe in the aerial bombardment of cities and towns; the contribution of the
     60 000 soldiers sent by Mussolini in specific battles etc. On the Republican side, the willingness of
     Stalin to send arms, with the cost being deducted from the gold reserves sent to the USSR for
     safekeeping, may be mentioned along with the organisation of the International Brigades by the
     Comintern. Some candidates may discuss Stalin’s motives in aiding the Republicans but this is not
     the focus. It is likely that some mention may be made of the purging of the POUM and the way in
     which a Moscow-initiated political conflict with the CNT hindered the effectiveness of foreign
     assistance to the Republicans and an united Republican war effort. Again, expect some detail for
     high marks to be awarded. Candidates ought to examine the contribution of foreign involvement to
     the outcome of the war, rather than simply narrate the events of the war.

     For the Nigerian Civil War the role of mercenaries and aid agencies, as well as the influence of
     France and that of the former colonial power, Britain, could be considered. The uprising of 1966
     was suspected by the North of being an Igbo-led takeover of power by the “Easterners”. Conflict
     followed, with “Northerners” seizing power under the leadership of General Gowon and the East
     splitting off under the leadership of General Ojukwu. The savagery of the war of attrition that
     followed was intensified by Ojukwu’s reluctance to negotiate, despite the suffering of the
     population of the newly declared independent Biafra. Candidates may argue that relief aid was used
     to finance the war and mention foreign mercenaries as an important factor in the training of, and
     support for, both sides. France supplied arms that kept the war going and Portugal allowed Guinea-
     Bissau and Sao Tome to be used as vital links in supply lines to Biafra. Such assistance helped
     sustain Biafra’s war effort until January 1970 but it did not prevent the victory of General Gowon’s
     forces. Some mention may also be made of Nigeria’s purchase of arms from the Soviet Union
     alongside its continuing good relations with the US.

     In both cases, candidates may indentify other factors responsible for determining the outcome of
     either conflict.
                                                  –7–                N12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

5.   Analyse the long-term and short-term causes of either the Nicaraguan Revolution (1976–1979)
     or the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988).

     Whichever conflict is chosen, expect candidates to explain the rationale for their choice of “long”
     and “short” term causes.

     For the Nicaraguan Revolution, candidates may decide that the long-term causes go back to the
     founding of the FSLN (Sandinista National Liberation Front) in 1961/2 or to the initial struggle
     against US influence in the 1920s and the emergence of the Somoza regime. A narrower time frame
     from 1970 onwards would also be acceptable. Some candidates may link the unrest in Nicaragua to
     the Cold War and to events elsewhere in Latin America, such as the Cuban revolution. With regard to
     the growth of the guerrilla movement, the use of propaganda also led to increased support among the
     peasants. The Managua earthquake of 1972 and Somoza’s attempts to control aid money and
     monopolize relief efforts were significant factors in alienating both the poorer sections of the
     population and the middle class. The repression that accompanied the re-election of Somoza in 1974
     was another step in the growth of opposition. The role of the US, especially under President Carter,
     contributed to the weakening of the Somoza regime. In 1978, the assassination of Pedro Chamorro (a
     fierce critic of the Somoza regime), criticism by the Church and a general strike intensified the
     revolutionary struggle. The suspension of military aid from the US, along with increased economic
     problems during uncertain political times, led to the flight of capital. By 1979, popular opposition,
     the armed strength of the FSLN and the international condemnation of the Somoza regime made its
     overthrow possible, leading to the fall of President Somoza.

     For the long-term causes of the Iran–Iraq War, candidates may discuss religious (Shia and Sunni) as
     well as cultural differences (Arab and Persian) as deep-seated sources of tension, alongside border
     disputes, especially in areas of mixed population. The long running dispute over the Shatt al-Arab
     waterway was also a source of disagreement for centuries, although there were some attempts at
     resolution during the 1970s when negotiations took place between Saddam Hussein and the Shah of
     Iran. The issue of Kurdish nationalism could also be considered as a long-running source of tension
     used by Iran from time to time to sow discord within Iraq, as well as disputes over oil rich regions
     such as Khuzestan. Such factors were present over a long period of time but candidates would not be
     expected to go further back than the 1960s and may choose to define “long-term” as the early 1970s.
     For short-term causes, candidates could refer to the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and its impact upon
     regional stability. With the Shah no longer in power, the tentative agreements of 1975 (the Treaty of
     Algiers) were no longer viable and tension also arose over the influence wielded by Iran over the Shia
     population within Iraq. Mention could be made of Iraqi suspicions that Iran intended to overthrow the
     Ba’athist regime by encouraging unrest among the non-Sunni population. Tempers flared over the
     Shatt-al Arab waterway that was attacked by Iran on 4 September, 1980. Iraq dispatched its forces
     across the border into Iran a few weeks later.

     There is much to discuss here and a wealth of detail can be used to support arguments.

6.   In what ways, and for what reasons, did technological developments in air and naval warfare
     contribute to victory in two twentieth century wars?

     Candidates have an opportunity here to demonstrate knowledge of developments that impacted on
     air and naval warfare in two twentieth century wars. Be aware that the Cold War is not an
     appropriate example, although wars fought during that period (Vietnam, Korea etc.) would be
     relevant. Both the First and Second World Wars are likely to be popular choices and it is
     acceptable for candidates to discuss two theatres as discreet wars.

     For air warfare, technological developments may include: radar; the jet engine; vertical take-off and
     landing aircraft; helicopters for use in warfare; transporter aircraft; rocket/missile weaponry etc.

     For naval warfare, candidates may refer to: sonar; submarines; amphibious landing craft; aircraft
     carriers; convoy supply ships etc.

     Candidates should indicate how these contributed to victory and may offer reasons such as: the
     availability and superiority of equipment possessed by one side; the psychological and physical
     impact of new technology on the military and home fronts.

     Candidates should go beyond a description of the relevant technology, demonstrating how it
     contributed (or not) to victory.

     If only one war is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 2   Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   Analyse the reasons for the success and failure of the domestic policies of one of the following
     leaders of a democratic state: Johnson (United States); Menem (Argentina); de Gaulle
     (France).

     Johnson
     There will probably be strong emphasis on “The Great Society” and his efforts to promote
     opportunities for social mobility through educational and economic reform as well as advancing
     civil rights. Candidates may suggest that the policies of “The Great Society” were similar to those
     of Kennedy’s “New Frontier” but that Johnson was more successful in getting these passed through
     Congress. Detailed knowledge may include references to: Medicaid and Medicare; the Civil Rights
     Act; the Economic Opportunity Act; the Voting Rights Act and the Higher Education Act. There is
     room here for analysis and candidates may refer to the racial disturbances of 1967 and the domestic
     response to the Vietnam War.

     Menem
     The focus will probably be upon economic policies as he struggled to rein in inflation and peg the
     peso to the dollar. Candidates may refer to his succeeding President Alfonsin and his decisive
     actions to deal with a serious economic crisis when inflation was over 200 %. Menem reduced
     inflation to single figures and presided over a period of economic growth. He improved relations
     with the US, his linking of the peso to the dollar led to increased exports. Extensive privatisation
     was used to raise funds. Menem acted to limit the role of the military and the possibility of military
     intervention in the government. Military service was abolished in 1994 but he also pardoned those
     involved in the crimes of the military junta, including General Galtieri. Overall, the success of his
     policies was debatable, certainly in the long-term. Failures could include: the public response to the
     pardons offered to the military; the long-term impact of privatisation (with little benefit to be seen
     from the money raised); the impact of a world-wide depression on the peso etc. Accusations of
     corruption involving the President and his officials, including the judiciary, could be mentioned.

     De Gaulle
     Reference may be made to the constitution which established the Fifth Republic and the domestic
     impact of his Algerian policy and decolonisation. The economic policies of de Gaulle emphasized
     increased state involvement and financial reforms were introduced to stabilize the franc, improve
     trade and increase gold reserves. Industrial production expanded, as did exports. Increased
     consumerism during the early 1960s made the government popular but labour relations deteriorated
     and this was among the many causes of riots in 1968. Tight control of the media also gave rise to
     allegations that France was becoming a more “paternalistic”, even repressive, state. De Gaulle’s
     response to the student revolt of 1968 (itself based on grievances associated with overcrowding and
     the need for reforms in education) would be relevant, especially as this led to a crisis during which
     he disappeared temporarily from public view (although the subsequent election reflected continuing
     support for the Gaullist movement). De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after a poor showing in a
     referendum aimed at further constitutional change.

     Whichever leader is chosen, expect detailed knowledge to support a focused analysis and
     assessment of success and failure.
                                                 – 10 –             N12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

8.   In what ways, and with what success, did either India (1947–1964) or South Africa
     (1991–2000) address problems of social and economic inequality?

     For India, as indicated by the dates, attention should be paid to the period immediately after
     independence when Nehru was prime minister. “Social inequality” could refer to the caste system
     and “economic inequality” to the wide disparity of income between rich and poor. Methods used
     by Nehru may include references to the use of central planning to achieve a socialist style economy.
     The three Five Year Plans that were adopted may be mentioned and candidates may assess
     “success” by distinguishing between the rapid industrialisation that took place in the cities and the
     more gradual pace of economic progress in the countryside. There were attempts to nurture “village
     industries”, however, and a considerable share of the budget was allocated to rural development.
     There were problems caused by the lack of capital with which to purchase technology and the
     difficulties that arose from the lack of competition and low quality of goods produced for the
     domestic market. The question does require a focus on how far economic inequality was addressed.
     There is much to discuss here in terms of the relative success of these economic policies and
     arguments may vary, but all should be well supported with detailed knowledge. For “social
     inequality”, legislation was passed to outlaw discrimination on the basis of caste – although the
     effectiveness of this could be questioned. Women’s rights were also a focus of attention although
     how much actually changed could also be open to debate. Educational opportunities at all levels
     were increased and efforts made to address widespread malnutrition.

     For South Africa, the focus is largely on the presidency of Mandela after the end of the apartheid
     regime. Candidates could address measures used to reduce the social and economic gulf between
     the races in South Africa. Methods to reduce inequality could include all changes that intended to
     remove the legacy of apartheid hence a range of reforms may be referred to. Although South Africa
     had a good economic infrastructure, the post-apartheid government inherited a considerable debt.
     Despite the political complexion of the ANC, the intention of the government, after its election in
     1994, was to promote a better standard of living for all through economic growth rather than
     socialist-inspired centralized planning. This approach was chosen partly to attract foreign
     investment. Limited re-distribution of wealth led to disappointment and candidates may argue that
     this reflected the lack of attainment of social and economic equality. Candidates could refer to the
     strikes and protests that broke out in 1995. In the area of social reform, many policies may be
     discussed ranging from the de-segregation of sport to the Truth and Reconciliation Committees that
     were established. There may be some analysis of the success of efforts made to bridge the gulf
     between the races in areas such as education, employment, housing, medical care etc.

9.    For what reasons, and in what ways, did two democratic states, each chosen from a different
      region, address the issue of women’s rights?

      Reasons may include: the impact of war requiring recognition of the greater participation by women
      in the workforce; changing cultural values that allowed women greater social freedom; the
      availability of reliable contraception; the increasing levels of education etc. These could all be cited
      as reasons why women became a more significant social and political constituency.

      Ways could be addressed by references to: the growth of women’s suffrage; legislation that has
      encouraged equal opportunities in education and in the workplace (such as equal pay); health care
      (with particular reference to pregnancy, motherhood and childcare provision). Candidates must
      choose two states from two different regions and better answers will support arguments with good,
      detailed knowledge.

      If only one state or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


10.   “Economic issues rather than weaknesses in the constitution were responsible for the failure
      of democracy in Germany between 1919 and 1933.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      This will probably be a popular question allowing candidates to discuss economic issues and the
      Weimar constitution as factors in the erosion of German democracy.

      For economic issues, reference could be made to: the payment of reparations; hyperinflation in
      1923; dependence on US loans; the Great Depression; the link between economic crisis and the rise
      of political extremism which threatened democratic government.

      For weaknesses in the constitution, references may be made to: clauses relating to proportional
      representation; the role of the President; Article 48 etc. The large number of different governments,
      the nature of the coalitions, the difficulty of passing legislation to deal with economic crises and
      the frequent use of Article 48 especially after March 1930 may all be mentioned. The question
      does ask, “To what extent …?” and candidates may also assess the importance of other factors.
      Candidates may argue that the terms of the Versailles Treaty, the fear of communism, the appeal
      of National Socialism and political intrigue may also have had a significant impact. Do expect
      well-supported answers with good detailed knowledge.
                                                   – 12 –             N12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

11.   Compare and contrast the methods used by the governments of two democratic (multiparty)
      states to deal with political extremism.

      Political extremism would imply the use of violence to publicize certain causes such as religious
      rights or minority rights. Some examples of political extremism may include: the “Troubles” in
      Northern Ireland; protests in France during the Algerian War; the French separatist movement in
      Canada; the Naxalite movement in India etc. Allow any appropriate examples.

      A thematic structure would be particularly effective and candidates may, for example,
      compare/contrast such methods as: the use of military force; the use of legislation to address the
      demands of extremists; the use of increased security measures; propaganda; restrictions on media
      coverage of extremist actions etc.

      If only one state is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


12.   In what ways, and with what success, did one democratic (multiparty) state address the
      demand by minorities for civil rights?

      Candidates may choose any democratic state when answering this question. Minorities may include
      religious, linguistic or ethnic minorities – but reward any appropriate examples that are discussed.
      Methods may include: the passing of legislation to guarantee rights or redress minority grievances;
      the use of “positive discrimination” to promote the employment of minorities; the provision of
      separate (or, in some cases, inclusive) education facilities; funding for places of worship or cultural
      centres; legislation to recognize and preserve minority languages etc. Answers should focus on the
      extent to which such actions met with success in meeting the demands of minorities.

      In some cases, the reactions of the majority towards such legislation could be a relevant area for
      consideration by candidates.

Topic 3    Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   With reference to two leaders, each chosen from a different region, assess how
      ideology and popular support contributed to their rise to power.

      For “ideology”, expect a working definition of the term (the social, economic, political, racial
      beliefs etc. of the leaders) and a strong focus on how it contributed to the rise to power of the
      chosen leaders. Possible points to consider would be the appeal of an ideology such as nationalism
      or communism and how it was presented through propaganda and to which specific audiences. The
      practical application of ideology through, for example, land reform for peasants in China and Russia
      could be discussed. Candidates would need to go beyond a description of ideology and assess its
      importance as a factor in the rise to power of the leaders.

      For “popular support”, candidates could link this to the factor of ideology by demonstrating how
      and why aspiring single-party state leaders were able to tap into popular support. Candidates may
      mention factors such as: the promise to address political, social or economic grievances; the use of
      scapegoats; the appeal to a sense of national community; the exploitation of the perceived failures
      of existing regimes etc.

      If only one leader or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   To what extent did social and economic policies help to maintain the power of either Nasser or
      Perón?

      The main focus of the question is the rule, and not the rise to power, of the chosen leader.

      For Nasser, the period to be discussed would probably range from 1955–1970. His economic
      policies aimed to improve living standards through land reform, the nationalisation of some
      industry and business, the removal of foreign ownership of business and a more centrally planned
      economy. Success was mixed, however, and the hopes of increased prosperity were not always
      met. Social policies could include education, the enfranchisement of women, the secularisation of
      society and the promise of a more egalitarian social system. Again, not all policies met with
      success and the use of force was important in the suppression of opposition. The extent to which
      both social and economic policies contributed to Nasser remaining in power should be assessed in
      relation to propaganda, the promotion of nationalism etc. Candidates may also identify other
      factors such as the United Arab Republic and the impact this had upon Nasser’s popularity.

      For Perón, candidates will probably refer to the period 1946–1955 although some may also consider
      Perón’s brief return to power in 1973. Perón’s economic policies were focused upon the working
      class and the trade unions that were brought under the control of the state soon after the election of
      1946. The stated aim was to establish a more egalitarian society with emphasis upon “social
      justice”. As with Nasser, the role of the state in planning the economy was emphasised. Efforts
      were made to reduce foreign ownership of Argentine industry and resources in parallel with
      protectionist policies as well as price controls. These were not always successful. The economic
      aspects of the constitution of 1949 may also be mentioned when state control over the economy was
      further increased. With regard to social policies, mention may be made of the FEP (Eva Perón
      Foundation) that intended to centralize the distribution of welfare. Candidates may emphasize the
      role of Eva Perón in the many social policies introduced by the government. This would be quite
      appropriate and it is hoped that arguments will be supported with good detailed knowledge.
      Undoubtedly, the role of Eva Perón in supporting the rule of her husband is a relevant factor here,
      as reflected in the mass mourning on the occasion of her death in 1952. Candidates may mention
      the importance of the enfranchisement of women, a political as well as a social policy that certainly
      helped Perón to win a second term in office in 1951. Control over education and the arts as well as
      the media would also be important as this was a way to increase support but also to limit opposition.
      Expect some critical assessment of policies and a strong focus on the question.

15.   Compare and contrast the treatment of minorities in two authoritarian or single-party states,
      each chosen from a different region.

      Candidates would require a detailed knowledge of policies directed towards minorities whether
      religious, ethnic, linguistic etc. It is likely that Nazi Germany will be a popular choice but expect
      some detailed knowledge of the treatment of Jews, for example the application of the Nuremburg
      Laws, the slow build up of pressure from 1933–1939 and beyond. Candidates would need to pay
      attention to the role of the state and so a general description of the horrors of the Holocaust, for
      instance, would not address the question. The treatment of kulaks in Stalin’s Russia would also be
      appropriate, as would the treatment of Sunni Muslims in Saddam Hussein’s Iraq or of ethnic
      minorities in Mao’s China.

      If only one state or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].


16.   Define “totalitarianism” and assess the extent to which it was achieved in Hitler’s Germany.

      Candidates would need a good knowledge of the structure of the Nazi state to provide detailed
      supporting evidence for this question. Candidates must provide a definition of “totalitarianism”
      which could include reference to the leader’s attempt to control every aspect of society from the
      political system to the economy, religion, education, media etc. The focus is on Hitler in power and
      although most candidates will probably address the period 1933–1939, some may, quite
      appropriately, continue to 1945. Possible approaches may be to discuss the level of control
      attempted by Hitler and the extent to which this was achieved. Reference may be made to
      Gleichschaltung and the attempts made to extend the control of the Nazi Party through the ban on
      trade unions and political parties, the destruction of the federal governmental system, the censorship
      of the media, the control of education, the attempted control of the churches, the use of terror etc.

      Additionally, much could be said about the New Plan and the Four Year Plan and their influence
      upon the economy. The role of the Gestapo and the extent to which Germany’s population went
      along with the application of Hitler’s policies may also be discussed.
                                                   – 16 –              N12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

17.   Analyse the methods used by either Castro or Sukarno to deal with opposition.

      Castro
      For Castro there could be reference to the purging of Batista supporters in 1959 followed by a more
      intensive purging of opponents before and after the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. Soon after that,
      all remaining political parties were forced to merge with the official party. The execution and
      imprisonment of political opponents, as a form of terror, was also used to discourage opposition.
      The use of propaganda and the encouragement of nationalism could also be discussed. Detailed
      knowledge could refer to the use of show trials, the establishment of the CDR (Committee for the
      Defence of the Revolution) and the prevalence of labour camps to “re-educate” political (and social)
      dissidents. At different moments, Castro “encouraged” opponents to leave, as shown by the 1980
      Mariel exodus. It would also be relevant to mention the use of propaganda in speeches, posters and
      newspapers as well as campaigns used to promote enthusiasm for party policies, as these did play a
      part in limiting opposition.

      Sukarno
      Sukarno’s main opponents were the Islamist and regional separatist movements and he used
      political control, censorship of the media and a personality cult both to suppress and deflect
      opposition. Although both an ally and an enemy of the PKI (The Communist Party of Indonesia) at
      various stages, Sukarno was able to balance power between the Communists and the military for
      much of his time in power. In addressing “methods”, candidates may refer to the use of force but
      also to political skills such as: his appeal to Indonesian nationalism; the use of the ethnic Chinese as
      scapegoats; the proclamation of Guided Democracy that appealed to the people and the suppression
      of rival parties and their leaders. The army was used to suppress separatist movements in Aceh,
      West Java and South Sulawesi. Education was also used as a way to promote a formidable cult of
      personality. Candidates may argue that, ultimately, Sukarno failed to maintain power and ended up
      a victim of the army under the growing influence of Suharto.

      Whichever leader is chosen, candidates need to examine the methods used and to support arguments
      with good, factual detail. It is not necessary for candidates to mention all of the possible methods
      mentioned here and, indeed, they may come up with other equally valid points.


18.   “In the twentieth century, the rise to power of authoritarian and single-party leaders was due
      mainly to their use of force.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      More than one state needs to be discussed, although there is no limit to how many a candidate may
      choose but expect examples to be supported with relevant detail. Candidates may agree with the
      statement by using examples such as Lenin, Mao or Franco. Alternatively, some single-party states
      emerged as a result of the collaboration between traditional elites and aspiring leaders of radical
      movements. These elites sought to manipulate or use movements for their own benefit. In such
      cases, single-party states came into existence through constitutional means (sometimes
      questionable), for example, Hitler and Mussolini as much as by forceful means.

      This question gives considerable scope for knowledgeable candidates to demonstrate a good grasp
      of the emergence of twentieth century authoritarian and single-party states.

      If only one leader is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Topic 4    Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
           Eastern European states

19.   With reference to either one African or one Asian ex-colonial state, analyse the factors which
      led to the rise of a successful independence movement.

      The rise of independence movements in the twentieth century was often closely associated with the
      two World Wars which progressively weakened the image – as well as the economic and military
      capabilities of metropolitan states. The wars can be seen as catalysts in promoting the desire of
      indigenous populations to attain the freedoms (self determination included) for which – ostensibly
      at least – the victors of both wars claimed they fought. The wars not only radicalized sections of the
      colonized states but also provided, in some cases, the military training which was to be used in
      physical struggles against the colonial power in the post 1945 era (e.g. Indo-China, Algeria).

      These two major wars though were not the only factors promoting success. Effective leadership i.e.
      the ability to mobilize populations on a mass basis and to attract outside attention or world opinion
      through propaganda or successful nationalist campaigns was also important (e.g. India). The
      influence of the United Nations and the Cold War in promoting decolonisation can also be
      examined.

      The specific factors very much depend upon the state selected but a thematic approach is likely to
      be more effective than a chronological narration of the development of a movement – or the life of a
      particular leader.

      N.B. China is not an acceptable example of an ex-colonial Asian state.


20.   Compare and contrast the methods used to achieve independence in the Indian subcontinent
      (India and Pakistan) and Algeria.

      The question can be tackled thematically – by identifying such areas as mass mobilization, the role
      of leadership in confronting the metropolitan state; the appeal to outside/world opinion; the use of
      outside aid (military, financial) in the struggle against the colonial power; economic attempts to
      weaken the colonial regime (boycotts for example and the stressing of the need to purchase
      indigenous products).

      An obvious point that many candidates might focus upon is the question of force. In Algeria the
      struggle for independence was brutal as the French colonial authorities, the nationalist movement
      (FLN) and the colons (settler population) engaged in conflict characterized by the use of terror
      tactics and guerrilla warfare. This contrasted significantly with the Indian National Congress
      campaign under the leadership of Gandhi which emphasized peaceful methods (non
      cooperation/passive resistance). Having said that, the nationalist movement in the subcontinent was
      not a homogenous one. The Muslim League led by Jinnah or the Indian National Army of S C Bose
      did not necessarily eschew violence in their campaigns to attain their respective goals.

      Some candidates may produce “end-on” accounts followed by a concluding paragraph in which
      similarities and differences may be explicitly noted. The important point is the identification of
      explicit comparisons and contrast.

      If only the Indian subcontinent or Algeria is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

21.   For what reasons, and with what results, did challenges to Soviet control in Central and
      Eastern Europe occur up to 1968?

      One approach which could prove popular is the identification of a (chronological) series of case
      studies covering the period from the start of sovietization (1945–1948) up to the end date which no
      doubt candidates will see as culminating with the events in Czechoslovakia (1968). Candidates
      could examine and comment upon such events as: the schism that developed between Moscow and
      Belgrade early in the period; the purging of “Titoist” and “rootless cosmopolitan” elements in states
      such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the late 1940s and early 1950s; the 1953 uprising in East
      Germany (GDR); restlessness in Poland in the 1950s (in particular the Poznan riots of 1956); the
      Hungarian Rising of 1956 and the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia in 1968.

      Candidates could also adopt a thematic approach to the issue of causation/consequences for
      example by identifying the nature of the issues at the root of deteriorating relationships: economic
      problems linked to work norms and/or collectivisation schemes; shortages of material goods
      promoting discontent; ideological splits revealed by interpretations of whether different paths
      (“roads”) to socialism were possible – or permissible in Moscow’s eyes.

      Soviet fears of the weakening of border/defence arrangements due to agitation in “front line” states
      in Central and Eastern Europe often produced a forceful reaction. Not all challenges were crushed
      by force – for example, Yugoslavia and Poland – but candidates need to identify how the challenges
      were met and reasons for that particular reaction. “Results” could be related not only to the
      consequences for groups or individuals which challenged Moscow, but also to how the challenges
      shaped the policies and perceptions of Moscow over the period.
                                                  – 19 –             N12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

22.   With reference to one ex-colonial or post-communist Central or Eastern European state,
      analyse the economic and political challenges it faced after independence and the extent to
      which these challenges were addressed.

      The achievement of independence by former colonial or post-communist Central or Eastern
      European states was frequently accompanied by challenges to political stability and obstacles to
      economic progress. In the case of ex-colonial states, political challenges could include reference to
      the issues of: lack of experience in administration due to the failure of metropolitan powers to
      sufficiently prepare the colony for independence; religious/ethnic/tribal divisions in the population
      which had been either controlled or exploited (“divide and rule policies” of the colonial power);
      external threats from neighbouring states which claimed territory from the new state; the role of the
      military which was often quick to act in terms of carrying out coups “to restore stability”; the
      influence of superpower involvement in the affairs of such states in an attempt to expand their
      sphere of influence etc. The economies of such states were often limited by the fact they had been
      designed by the former metropolitan power as part of a larger imperial framework – hence reliance
      on monoculture and the vagaries of world commodity prices could wreak havoc. Overambitious
      development projects by new governments, the reliance on foreign loans and the continuation of
      neo-colonial exploitation can also be seen as challenges to the state. Obviously the nature of such
      challenges depends upon the case study selected.

      Having identified the state and the nature and extent of the challenges, candidates are required to
      comment on how the state was able (or not) to deal with these challenges to its political and
      economic structure.

      In the case of post-communist Central or Eastern European states, political challenges could relate
      to the transition from the single-party state to the new political systems implemented. In some
      cases such states found themselves either lacking experience – or being governed by movements
      and/or leaders which were effectively the same as the previous regimes – only operating under a
      different label. In certain cases such states also faced problems with minorities and the continued
      existence of institutions (army, internal security forces etc.) which were not always sympathetic to
      the new system. Economically the states had to adapt from the command economies of the past and
      develop new industries and methods of organisation to compete in the post-independence era.
      Restructuring could prove painful. Where new states emerged due to the implosion of the former
      state (e.g. Yugoslavia), the successor states also faced a variety of ills ranging from civil war to
      ethnic cleansing. Again, the state selected as a case study has to also be examined in terms of how
      successfully (or not) it was able to cope with the challenges.

23.   “Independence from Soviet control was the result of the decline of Soviet power rather than
      the strength of the independence movement.” With reference to either Poland or
      Czechoslovakia, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates are required to examine the two factors noted in the question and invited to consider
      (“To what extent”) “other factors” that may be relevant to the independence of Czechoslovakia and
      Poland from Moscow’s control in 1989–1990.

      The nature, extent and leadership of the movements (for example Charter 77 and Solidarity) could
      be examined, along with consideration of the grievances (economic, political) that encouraged their
      emergence and growth. Compared to earlier attempts at questioning Soviet control (these could be
      identified though it is not necessary to go into in detail), candidates need to explain why such
      movements were able to effectively challenge Moscow by the dates noted above.

      The differing reaction of the Soviet Union in dealing with the movements (in comparison with
      previous Soviet responses – e.g. 1968 in Czechoslovakia) could lead to examination of how able
      (militarily, economically and ideologically) the Soviet state was by this period to adopt methods of
      repression to silence challenges. No doubt candidates will focus especially on the new Soviet
      leadership from 1985 and comment upon the pressures Gorbachev was under to respond to an ailing
      Soviet financial and military position.

      Candidates could discuss: the “Sinatra” doctrine of Gorbachev; the impact of his policies of
      glasnost and perestroika not only domestically but also in the satellite states; the economic impact
      of the Soviet–Afghan War; the role of Reagan and US policies; the significance of the Catholic
      Church in Poland etc.


24.   Assess the contribution of the leadership of either Jinnah to the achievement of the
      independence of Pakistan (1947) or Mugabe to the achievement of the independence of
      Zimbabwe (1980).

      Candidates should examine the role played by either leader in the movement for freedom from
      external forces – in the case of Mugabe, from a system of racially based minority rule in Southern
      Rhodesia/Rhodesia and in the case of Jinnah, from what was claimed to be freedom from the
      supposed “tyranny” of a Hindu majority represented by the Indian National Congress.

      “Leadership” could be examined in relation to: the ability to unite disparate groups in a common
      cause (and how this was achieved e.g. by appeals to religious, social and economic fears and
      aspirations); the organisation of political and/or military resistance to the perceived oppressive
      minority/majority; the mass mobilisation of a support base necessary to gain the goal of
      independence; the manner in which the leader was able to appeal to outside elements to strengthen
      the resistance movement and promote its goals etc.

      The invitation to assess the contribution of leadership also invites candidates to note “other factors”
      which may be considered important: the weakness of the opposing force; pressure applied on behalf
      of the movement for independence from external sources; the inability (economically, politically or
      militarily) of the “enemies” of the movements to physically prevent the successful push for
      independence.

Topic 5    The Cold War

25.   Evaluate the importance of each of the following in the breakdown of East–West relations,
      1945–1949: the Potsdam Conference; the sovietization of Eastern and Central Europe;
      the Marshall Plan.

      The invitation to “evaluate” invites candidates to comment upon the relative importance of the
      given issues and candidates who do so should be rewarded.

      Often candidates provide “template”, learned responses which outline the origins of the Cold
      War from 1917 and then launch into descriptions of schools of historiographical interpretation.
      This is not the focus of the task.

      Accurate details of each of the issues are important as the basis for successful consideration of the
      importance/significance of the issues/factors.

      Potsdam occurred in July/August 1945 – after the unconditional surrender of Germany, but before
      the end of the war against Japan. It followed on from the earlier Yalta Conference of February
      1945. Issues raised at Yalta were to prove contentious at the Potsdam meeting. The question of
      what to do with Germany (politically and economically), the growing antagonism over
      arrangements for Poland – and indeed conflicting interpretations of the Declaration on Liberated
      Europe – led to mutual suspicion, especially with the new line up of leaders at Potsdam. News of
      the successful testing of the atomic weapon arguably led Truman to take a more uncompromising
      stance than his presidential predecessor. The failure of US leaders to collaborate with the USSR in
      the development of such a weapon and the manner in which its existence was revealed at Potsdam
      has led to claims that the Soviet Union saw such a weapon (and its subsequent use against Japan) as
      a veiled threat. Relations at Potsdam marked a deterioration in the relationship among members of
      the Grand Alliance, whose raison d’être had been called into question after Germany’s defeat.

      The sovietisation of Central and Eastern Europe from 1945 onwards (specific examples of such
      states should be included) led to claims and counter-claims by both East and West. Whether the
      “liberation” of these states was followed by a deliberate policy of Soviet expansionism in order to
      fulfil an ideological goal on the part of Moscow – or whether the motive behind such expansion was
      defensive in nature could be examined. The assumptions behind the “Long Telegram” of Kennan,
      the significance of the Riga Axioms, the reality of the claims made by Churchill in his “Iron
      Curtain” speech (as compared to the rhetoric) etc. could be considered.

      The Marshall Plan, mooted in June 1947, was one “half of the walnut” of Containment espoused by
      Truman. Candidates could examine the reasons for the credits provided by the US and comment
      upon the overt purpose stated by Marshall, how the Plan was perceived by Moscow and the results
      of the Plan for Western Europe as well as the Soviet reaction (politically and economically:
      Cominform, Comecon etc.).

      Candidates should show knowledge of the issues/factors and apply such knowledge to evaluate their
      role in the breakdown of East–West relations.

      If only one issue is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. If two issues are addressed,
      mark out of a maximum of [13 marks].

26.   Compare and contrast the methods and extent of superpower success in maintaining control
      of their spheres of influence up to 1962.

      The starting date for most candidates will probably be 1945 which marked the end of the Second
      World War and the establishment of a power vacuum in Europe and Asia with the defeat of
      Germany and Japan. The chronological period permits candidates to examine a variety of areas
      (geographically) and also the methods used by Washington and Moscow to maintain their
      respective spheres of influence.

      While some candidates may examine “methods” on a case-by-case basis, reaching some
      compare/contrast conclusion at the end, a thematic approach is also possible.

      “Spheres of influence” – as a concept and as a geographical reality could be clearly identified –
      whether in Europe 1945–48/49 (which witnessed the economic and political division of the
      continent), 1953–1956 (which marked Moscow’s efforts to maintain control over states which were
      restive under Soviet influence – GDR, Poland, Hungary) and also in Asia where the newly
      emergent PRC and leftist agitation in Indo-China and East Asia (Korean peninsula) led to
      superpower involvement. Given the end-date of 1962, candidates also have the opportunity to deal
      with what the US perceived as a challenge to its sphere of interest in the Caribbean/Americas (with
      events in Cuba from 1959 to 1962) or to developments in the Middle East (Suez, Lebanon, etc.).

      If only one superpower is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

27.   For what reasons did the Soviet Union, after the death of Stalin (1953), begin and end the
      policy of peaceful coexistence?

      The term peaceful coexistence was associated with superpower relations as practiced at the time of
      Khrushchev from approximately 1956/57–1961/2 (allow some flexibility in the chronology
      depending on how the candidate may interpret the beginning and ending of this period). Some may
      select the period of Khrushchev’s First Secretaryship from 1953 – or possibly his prime
      ministership from 1958 – as the beginning point, and the U2 incident / failure of the Paris Summit /
      Berlin Crisis leading to the building of the Wall / events in Cuba etc. as the end point. The
      justification for such choices should be made clear and explicit.

      Candidates could define the term “peaceful co-existence” at the outset (noting perhaps the similarity
      with the earlier “New Course” of Malenkov) and explaining the significance of Soviet domestic
      developments (Secret Speech, destalinisation, succession struggle – i.e. linking the idea with
      Khrushchev’s ambitions to become the supreme Soviet leader) as well as noting the dangers
      associated with the increasing development of nuclear arms production by East and West. The need
      for Khrushchev, after 1957, to deliver on promises made to the Soviet population regarding
      consumer/material goods necessitated a reduction of expenditure on weapons production and can be
      seen as connected to the need to improve relations with the West. Khrushchev’s belief that
      socialism/communism was destined to triumph in the longer term without war may be included as a
      reason for his claim that hostile confrontation with the west was unnecessary.

      Just as the motives behind the policy were partly a product of Soviet domestic policies, the ending
      of the process was also linked to the need for Khrushchev to placate the increasingly vociferous
      “Metal Eaters” – the military and Party leaders who had never been convinced of the wisdom of the
      policy in the first place. Opportunities to regain personal prestige at a time when his economic and
      agrarian policies had not proved successful, plus the emergence of a new and inexperienced US
      President (Kennedy) encouraged Khrushchev to act more adventurously. Reference to specific
      issues that served to undermine the peaceful coexistence relationship could be addressed (see
      above).

      The question does not require coverage of détente in the 1970s.

      If only reasons for the beginning or for the end are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12
      marks].

28.   Analyse the role of one of the following in the development of the Cold War: Castro; Mao;
      Reagan.

      While three choices are on offer, Castro is likely to prove the most popular. Candidates need to
      ensure that if Castro is selected, the essay does not end up only as a narrow coverage – in
      narrative/descriptive form – of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Castro came into power three
      years before this and the post-1962 role of his Cuban state and its impact on the development of the
      Cold War – whether in Africa or Latin America – requires attention for answers to reach the higher
      mark bands.

      Candidates who choose Mao can consider: the significance of the establishment of the PRC and the
      importance of this (Washington perceived) “loss”; the importance of the entry of the PRC to the war
      in Korea in 1950; the relationship of Mao’s regime with the Soviet Union – how, why and when
      this changed – and the wider consequences of such a change (US rapprochement with China) etc.

      Ronald Reagan was president of the US 1981–1989. He presided over a period of increased
      defence spending during his time in office. At the outset, his foreign policy was associated with the
      rejection of détente which had been linked with his predecessor President Carter, and the restoration
      of US superiority in conventional and nuclear weapons. Accordingly, the Reagan administration
      became involved in the production of not only neutron bombs but, in 1983, with SDI (Strategic
      Defence Initiative). Increased deployment of cruise missiles in Europe plus the foregoing marked
      Reagan as more “hawkish” than his forerunner in The White House.

      Reagan has been credited by some historians as being a major influence on the decline of the USSR
      and bringing about the end of the Cold War – partly through: his weapons production programme
      with which Moscow could not realistically compete; agreements made with Gorbachev (INF Treaty
      of 1987, agreement on Cuban withdrawal from Angola for example) and also to the strain upon
      Moscow’s resources in the attempt to combat US backed Afghan rebels. Some candidates may
      refer to Reagan’s policies in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Grenada etc. This is acceptable as long as the
      cases are explicitly linked to the task.

29.   Assess the economic and social impact of the Cold War on two countries (excluding the US
      and USSR), each chosen from a different region.

      The Cold War was responsible not only for political confrontation but had an impact on states from
      both sides of the East–West divide. Economically, states which were associated with respective
      blocs could expect to receive aid and encouragement to pursue economic (and social) goals linked
      with the different ideologies of rival powers.

      Candidates are required to focus specifically on two countries. Both may be selected from the East
      or Western bloc – or one from either. Popular choices for a case study are likely to be Cuba,
      Germany (either the period between 1945 and 1949, or in the post 1949 period, the Federal
      Republic or the German Democratic Republic), Korea, Japan, People’s Republic of China.

      Whichever countries are chosen, candidates should explain how involvement in the East–West
      struggle affected the nature and structure of the economy of the state concerned. To what extent did
      the economy of the state benefit because of aid received – and how? Did the country suffer
      economically due to its allegiance in the conflict? Was the country the scene of a proxy war
      confrontation that resulted in economic destruction/dislocation?

      In coverage of “social impact”, candidates could refer to areas such as media, education, religion,
      civil liberties, art and literature etc. linking developments in these areas to the respective
      socio-economic belief systems associated with the Cold War adversaries.

      If only one country or one region is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

30.   “The break-up of the Soviet Union was the unintended result of changes introduced by the
      Soviet leadership from 1985 onwards.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The focus is the break-up of the USSR, not the reason for the end of the Cold War. Candidates
      who produce pre-learned responses on the reasons for the end of the Cold War would be unlikely to
      score well.

      Candidates need to identify the new leadership in 1985 (Gorbachev) and the aims this leadership set
      for the Soviet Union. A key point is the term “unintended”. Better responses will consider whether
      the intention of Gorbachev’s regime was to revive an ailing political and economic system, whether
      the changes were meant to go beyond simple reform, whether changes once inaugurated proved
      impossible to control.

      Policies/programmes associated with the Soviet leadership from 1985 include those of perestroika
      and glasnost. Candidates could investigate the stated purpose for such policies and assess the extent
      to which the regime’s goals were met – or whether the forces unleashed were beyond the
      government’s expectations – and means of control.

      The “To what extent” command invites candidates to consider other factors which may be linked to
      the break-up of the Soviet state. Candidates may refer to: longer standing problems which produced
      a general economic malaise; the significance of the forces of minority nationalism inside the USSR
      (particularly evident later in the Baltic states, Armenia, Azerbaijan for example); the impact of a
      foreign policy requiring major expenditure; the weakening of control over the satellite states of
      Eastern and Central Europe (acting as both a symptom and a cause of Moscow’s declining power).
      The attempted coup of August 1991 by those seeking to turn back the clock and restore Soviet
      power after a period of liberalization, was a failure. By late December 1991, the USSR had ceased
      to exist.
