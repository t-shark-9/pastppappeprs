1.   Describe how older and younger generations in Burma and the U.S.
     understand rap.                                                  [6 marks]
     This is a mainly descriptive question that requires candidates to highlight the similarities and
     differences between older and younger generations’ understandings of rap, particularly in Burma
     but also in the U.S..

     Older Burmese see rap as a continuation or modern manifestation of an earlier indigenous
     call-and-response tradition of musical expression known as thañ ja’. Younger Burmese do not
     naturally make this association and identify rap as a new phenomenon.

     Thañ ja’ are traditionally associated with flirting rituals and socially sanctioned protests, and by
     extension older Burmese may understand rap as having roles in these same contexts. The lyrics are,
     after all, about romance, while the style of delivery is quite confrontational. For younger Burmese
     the content of rap concerns disappointment in love, but beyond this the clothing and accessories
     worn by rappers help them to present themselves as “rich, cosmopolitan and modern” in a culture
     where this remains little more than an aspiration for most.

     Different perspectives exist within U.S. rap too, with some older aficionados knowing of its roots in
     African American call-and-response traditions while “current consumers… have no knowledge of
     those practices.” In this way, these art forms are used and appreciated differently by different
     generations in the same group, as well as across cultures.

     Candidates do not need to cover all of the above points for full marks. They do have to develop a
     reasoned response to the question.

2.   Using theoretical perspectives, analyse how rap is adapted locally in Burma.               [6 marks]

     Burmese rap has been adapted locally/localized in comparison to other possible comparative cases
     where rap is a vibrant cultural form. Keeler focuses on American rap as a comparative case to
     evaluate the local grounding of Burmese rap. The lyrics are one aspect of Burmese rap that appear
     specific to the context. Burmese rap lyrics are mostly about unrequited or betrayed love, and lack
     the crudeness of language and themes found in other rap genres produced in other cultural contexts,
     such as the U.S. Where boasting takes place it is mild. In its localized form Burmese rap is
     rhythmically simple and predictable.

     Keeler proposes that the mild nature of rap lyrics be understood partly as a response to strict and
     pervasive Burmese censorship laws. Government control would block any controversial content
     from being distributed. An equally compelling explanation that he proposes concerns Burmese
     cultural expectations. One Burmese rapper explains that the profanity of Western rap would jar
     Burmese Buddhist sensibilities, bringing shame upon him and upsetting his family.

     Candidates may also note that some aspects of Burmese rap appear as if they are the product of
     global flows. These include the adoption of a certain style of clothing associated with U.S. rappers,
     of the persona of an angry and wild performer, and of a wealthy and cosmopolitan lifestyle as
     positive qualities to aspire to.

     Candidates may refer to theories of globalization and localization, hybridity, scapes, flows,
     creolization and to the work of anthropologists such as Hannerz, Appadurai, Comaroff and
     Comaroff, Eriksen, Sahlins and others.

     This knowledge should clearly refer to relevant theoretical works or perspectives.

              3–4 The response demonstrates some understanding of relevant
                  anthropological issues and concepts or theory, or the response
                  recognizes the viewpoint of the anthropologist, but not all
                  of these.
              5–6 The response demonstrates a critical understanding of relevant
                  anthropological issues, concepts and theory, and recognizes

3.   Compare and contrast how rap has been used by younger Burmese with how
     another group has used a cultural practice from outside of its own culture. [8 marks]

     Candidates may choose any social group in order to develop a comparison. The question requires
     candidates to demonstrate an understanding of how cultural practices are used between societies
     and groups, and are transformed in the process. This transformation is an adaptation to
     local context, but also generates new cultural forms in this local context.

     Candidates are required to use theory and concepts (ideally introduced in their question 2 response)
     to frame their comparison.
