            Land and power: The growing scandal surrounding the new wave of investments in land.

            The new wave of land deals is not the new investment in agriculture that millions had been
            waiting for. The poorest people are being hardest hit as competition for land intensifies.
            Oxfam’s research has revealed that residents regularly lose out to local elites and domestic or
            foreign investors because they do not have the power to claim their rights and defend their interests
     5      in an effective way. Companies and governments must take urgent steps to improve land rights
            outcomes for people living in poverty. Power relations between investors and local communities
            must also change if investment is to contribute to the food security and livelihoods of local
            communities instead of worsening it.

            International investment plays a vital role in development and poverty reduction. Investment can
   10       improve livelihoods and bring jobs, services and infrastructure. Oxfam sees this every day in its
            work and, in some cases, is working with businesses to promote investments that directly benefit
            poor communities. The recent record of investment in land is very different. It tells a story of
            rapidly increasing pressure on land – a natural resource upon which the food security of millions
            of people living in poverty depends. Too many investments have resulted in violations of human
   15       rights and destruction of livelihoods. Without national and international measures to defend the
            rights of people living in poverty, this modern-day land-rush will leave too many poor families
            worse off, often evicted from their land with little or no possibility of justice.

            In developing countries, as many as 227 million hectares of land – an area the size of
            Western Europe – has been sold or rented out since 2001, mostly to international investors.
   20       This interest in land is not something that will pass easily. The land deals, like some in Tanzania,
            Ethiopia and Guatemala, are very often intended to supply foreign food and biofuel markets.
            They can often rightly be called “land grabs”. The root cause of the business and human
            rights problems today lies in the imbalance of power created by globalization. It allows for an
            environment where companies of all kinds can commit wrongful acts and get away with it.

            Dependency theory – is it all over now?

            Once upon a time, there was a passionate debate between free-trade promoters and
            dependency theorists. Free-trade promoters argued that global economic liberalism was the
            best way to ensure universal growth. Those supporting dependency theory saw this relationship
            as exploitative, rather than positive for both parties. As growth picks up around the developing
     5      world, and rich and poor countries appear to grow closer together, ideas of exploitation are seen as
            conspiracy theories in some parts of the world.

            But there are good reasons not to drop dependency theory just yet. Whether or not one believes
            the theory to be relevant to today’s globalized economy, it is an important lens when trying to
            understand our collective history. The fact that some countries seem to be breaking out of the
   10       dependency trap does not mean that a trap never existed.

            Might it be the case that for the global rich to remain rich, the global poor must remain poor?
            This is not a new idea, and it is present in dependency theory with its discussion of the role
            of elites. It is worth remembering the latest statistics, sparking Occupy movements around
            the world, that the gap between the top 1 % and the global 99 % has never been greater.

   15       “Everyone is doing better”, say the people who are doing better. But what about those who aren’t?
            Is their lack of progress the foundation on which the progress of others rests? To answer
            that question, and others, dependency theories may be needed now more than ever.

            Improving the effectiveness of aid

            The world of aid is highly complex and presents real difficulties, given that more than 280 bilateral
            donor agencies, 242 multilateral programs, 24 development banks, and about 40 United Nations
            agencies are working in the development business. The increasing number of private foundations
            and the existence of so many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) add to the complexity.
     5      The large increase in donor activities – including an estimated 340 000 development projects around
            the world – leads us to question current ways of managing the aid business. Indeed, a number
            of factors combine to decrease the effectiveness of aid. They include lack of aid predictability,
            issues of coordination among the large numbers of donors, and aid fragmentation – all of which
            have real implications at the country level.

   10       Lack of predictability. According to a recent survey in any average country only 45 % of aid arrives
            on time, as scheduled by donors. This lack of predictability means that government authorities in
            developing countries will have difficulty planning or responding to citizens’ needs if funding does
            not arrive when new hospitals and classrooms were promised.

            Lack of coordination. Uncoordinated aid also creates problems. In 2005, government authorities
   15       in Vietnam received 791 visits (missions) from donors – that is, more than two a day,
            including weekends and holidays. In Tanzania, for instance, health workers in some districts spent
            almost 25 % of their working days writing reports for different donors. This makes it difficult to
            imagine how civil servants can focus on things that really matter.

            Aid fragmentation. Fragmentation of aid at the country level is getting worse. Fragmentation occurs
   20       not only with the increase in the number of donors but also the increase in donor-funded activities.
            This all too often lays a heavy burden on developing countries and capacities, and reduces the
            sustainability and value of the aid received.
