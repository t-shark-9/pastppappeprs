                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Identify one advantage and one disadvantage of internal recruitment.        [2 marks]

                  Advantages of internal recruitment include:
                   it is generally cheaper and faster than external recruitment
                   it strengthens employees’ loyalty to the company (as they know that
                    they have opportunities for career development within the company)
                   existing employees are already familiar with the practices and culture
                    of the company (no need for long induction processes)
                   other employees and managers know the promoted person better than
                    a newcomer recruited from the outside.

                  Disadvantages of internal recruitment include:
                   the number of applicants will be limited
                   external candidates may be better qualified
                   it might create tension amongst workers (as their new manager might
                    be a previous colleague who is now above them in the chain of
                    command)
                   hiring someone internally will create a vacancy (the position that the
                    recruited person vacates) so further recruitment will be needed.

                  Accept any other relevant advantage or disadvantage.


                  Award [1 mark] for a correct and relevant advantage identified and
                  [1 mark] for a correct and relevant disadvantage identified, up to a
                  maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Describe one method of external recruitment.                                [2 marks]

                  Methods of external recruitment include:
                   employment agencies
                   government-run employment agencies/job centres
                   placement companies (“headhunters”)
                   recruitment from/coordination with local schools and universities
                   advertisements in newspapers, trade magazines, and other media
                    outlets.

                  Accept any other relevant method of external recruitment and description.


                  Award [1 mark] for a correct and relevant external method of recruitment
                  identified and [1 mark] for a description of the method of recruitment,
                  up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)    Prepare a fully labelled break-even chart for WS at its current actual sales
       of 2400 units in the current building.                                                  [5 marks]

       Total fixed costs: $590 000 + 450 000 = $1 040 000

       Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

       Award marks as follows:

       [1 mark] for each appropriately labelled axis (the vertical axis must include
       reference to both costs and revenue) – award a maximum of [2 marks].
       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
       [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total cost curve.
       [1 mark] for the identification of the break-even level of output.

       Award [0 marks] if a candidate produces a table, and award no more than
       [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a straight-edge, or is not to
       scale.

       Ideally, the candidate will draw an arrow pointing to the break-even point and
       label the arrow. However, accept as an “accurately labelled” break-even point
       a vertical line from the x-axis to the break-even point provided that the line is
       labelled “break-even point”.

(c)   (i)    Calculate the contribution of one surfboard in the proposed new
             building.                                                                     [1 mark]

             sales price per unit – variable cost per unit = contribution

             Proposed new building: $1400 – $750 = $650


             Award [1 mark] for the correct answer (working not required).

      (ii)   Calculate the initial forecast profit for WS for its first year of
             operation in the proposed new building (show all your working).               [3 marks]

             Profit can be calculated as follows:
             Sales (no. of units  sales price per unit)                      $4 620 000
             – variable costs (no. of units  variable costs per unit)      – $2 475 000
             – fixed costs (from table)                                     – $1 050 000
             – managers’ salaries (from table)                              – $600 000
                                                                               $495 000

             Alternative method:

              Fixed cost 1 650 000
                                   Break-even = 2538.4615 units
             Contribution   650

             Margin of safety = Output – Break-even
                              = 3300 – 2538.4615
                              = 761.5385 units

             Profit = Margin of safety  Contribution
                    = 761.5385  650
                    = $495 000.025


             Award [1 mark] if the candidate clearly demonstrates an understanding
             of how to calculate the profit (candidate shows revenue – expenses =
             profit).

             Award [2 marks] if the candidate demonstrates that the method is (no. of
             units  sales price per unit) – (no. of units  variable costs per unit) –
             (fixed costs + managers’ salaries) = profit, but with an error in the
             calculation.

             Award [3 marks] if the candidate demonstrates the method (show
             working) and correctly calculates the answer.

             If the candidate produces the correct answer but does not show workings,
             award [2 marks].

             If the candidate uses the alternative method and rounds the number of
             units to 762, accept the profit as $495 300 .

      (iii) Explain why Brent’s accountant forecasted lower variable costs per
            unit in the proposed new building.                                             [2 marks]

            Award [1 mark] if the candidate identifies economies of scale, or
            provides a sufficient description of the concept (even if the candidate
            does not explicitly state “economies of scale”). Just saying (something to
            the effect of) “getting bigger” would not be sufficient to earn a mark.

            Award an additional [1 mark] for applying the concept to WS.

(d)   Using appropriate calculations for the actual units produced (2400) in the
      current building and initial forecasted units produced (3300) in the
      proposed new building, analyse the impact of the proposed expanded scale
      of operation on profits and profitability.                                           [5 marks]

      Using the same approach as for (c)(ii), candidates may calculate the current
      profit for the existing building with actual production levels. The current profit
      is ($1400  2400) – ($800  2400) – $590 000 – $450 000 = $400 000.
      This shows that, when doing a simple comparison with the new building,
      profit would increase significantly (from $400 000 to $495 000, so + 23.75 %),
      a calculation that the accountant probably did in order to justify the expansion.

      In terms of profitability ratio, the profit margins for WS are:
                             400 000 
       current building:                 100 = 11.9 %
                             3 360 000 
                                     495 000 
       proposed new building:                     100 = 10.7 %
                                     4 620 000 
      From these calculations the profitability would slightly decrease. The slight
      decrease is mainly due to the sharp increase in fixed costs.

      The proposed expanded scale of operation has clear impacts on both profit and
      profitability, though Brent Bass would also need to take other factors into
      account before deciding on the expansion, especially as financial gain
      (measured through profit and profitability) does not seem to be his main
      motivation.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

      If the response does not include quantitative data, award a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      If only profit or profitability are considered, award a maximum of [4 marks]:
      to achieve the top markband candidates need to refer to both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(c)   Using financial and non-financial information, examine WW’s decision to
      start producing special-order windows.                                                  [5 marks]

      Producing the “special order” windows would have both advantages and
      disadvantages for the company.

      The financial position of the business is precarious. Although, the gross profit
      margin is 31.83 %, its net profit margin is extremely slim at 0.652 %, so that
      any further deterioration in the company’s position may place it in a loss
      making position.

                             Net profit before interest and tax
      Net profit margin                                        100
                                      Sales revenue

                              45
                                  100  0.652%
                             6895

      The cash-flow position of the business is adequate at the moment. Its acid test
      ratio of 1.25 means that the business has $1.25 of liquid funds for every $1 of
      current liabilities, which is acceptable given a rule of thumb of 1:1 for this ratio.
      Its stock levels are also acceptable and its gearing ratio of only 33.33 % means
      that it is in a position to borrow money to fund any additional finance
      associated with the new special orders.

      As the break even for each order is only 100 units, this suggests that the
      company will not be risking too much financially to take this option if this
      order level is achievable. It will be up to the marketing department to make
      this judgment. The 50 % deposit at the order stage should also ensure that the
      company’s cash flow is adequate during the production process and before the
      units are delivered.

There would be additional costs associated with recruiting an additional
member of staff and this would need to be factored into the issue, but the
business should be able to fund this. Given that the present net profit margin is
so low, producing special orders could be a good idea if these generate a higher
net profit margin for the business. Given that WW is considering making
special order windows because it has underutilized capacity, the business will
not have to borrow additional money to purchase new equipment.

Accept any other relevant examination.


If the response is one-sided and includes only financial or only non-financial
data, award a maximum of [3–4 marks]: to achieve the top markband
candidates need to refer to both.

                                             SECTION B

3.   (a)   Define the term redundancy (lay-off ).                                        [2 marks]

           Redundancy (lay-off) is “the termination of employment where an employee is
           asked to leave through no fault of his or her own” (Paul Clark et al.,
           IB Business and Management Course Companion, Oxford University Press,
           2009, page 391). A payment may be made to staff that are made redundant.

(c)   Construct the position map of Sokol before Andrej made any changes to
      his restaurant.                                                                 [5 marks]




      Award [1 mark] for the overall layout of the map with both axes correctly
      labelled (price: cheap or expensive; styles of food: traditional or modern).
      N.B. It does not matter which one is horizontal / vertical.

      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of Sokol in the quadrant “cheap and
      traditional”, provided that the placement does not imply very cheap or very
      traditional.

      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of Restaurant A in the quadrant
      “modern and expensive”. N.B. the restaurant is described as “very modern”
      and “very expensive” and this needs to be graphically or textually indicated,
      award [0 marks] if this aspect is not clear.

      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of Restaurant B in the same quadrant
      as Sokol (“cheap and traditional”), the placement should be near each other,
      or in the same place and should not imply very cheap or very traditional.

      Award [1 mark] for correct positioning of Restaurant C in the quadrant
      “cheap and modern”, provided that the placement does not imply very cheap or
      very modern.

(d)   Analyse the usefulness of market segmentation and targeting specific
      markets for Sokol.                                                                  [5 marks]

      Market segmentation is useful for Sokol because it helped Andrej see a niche in
      a market and identify a new business opportunity. If he decides to target
      “tourists who are ready to pay higher-than-average prices”, he will have to
      promote his restaurant in publications they may read.

      Targeting a specific market is useful for Sokol because, as part of the process,
      Andrej must understand better who his customers are (“young locals who want
      to eat out with friends”) and will give him insight into their expectations about
      their experiences (for example about atmosphere and product range i.e. type of
      food served in the restaurant) and also how much they may be willing to pay.

      Market segmentation and targeting specific markets however have limitations
      as they only create a limited number of categories (with some stereotypical
      customers); some current or potential customers may not fit these categories.
      The marketing success of segmentation and targeting are highly dependent on
      the quality and effectiveness of the market research conducted. As a small
      business this may not be the outcome

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      It is not expected that the candidates incorporate all of the above arguments.

      If the response is a one-sided relevant approach with no analysis, award a
      maximum of [3 marks]. If only the usefulness is analysed (without reference
      to limitations) award a maximum of [3 marks].

      To achieve the top markband candidates need to refer to both the usefulness of
      market segmentation and targeting specific markets for Sokol.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(e)   Advise Andrej about the most suitable option for Sokol.                             [7 marks]

      Option 1 is a joint venture: this means that Sokol and the new hotel would join
      forces and join resources – for example Sokol could manage the restaurant
      operating in the hotel. The main advantage is that they could help each other
      grow faster, however it would involve creating a new business entity (the joint
      venture) which can be a complex project (to define the exact agreements and
      the terms, for example about revenue sharing). Joint ventures are usually
      created for finite periods of time, which may not be appropriate here.

      Option 2 is a strategic alliance: this means that the two restaurants would
      sometimes work together (for example on specific projects such as the village
      festival), however at other times they would remain competitors. This option
      has the advantage that it will allow Sokol to target a new group of customers –
      those who are prepared to pay higher prices for modern style foods. This is an
      example of diversification. However it may cause some confusion for its
      traditional customers who choose it because it offers cheap and traditional
      meals. This could also make the relationship sometimes difficult between
      Andrej and the manager of Restaurant A.

      Option 3 is a merger: this means that Sokol and Restaurant B would become
      just one entity, even if they still operate under two different names. They could
      have economies of scale (for example when ordering traditional Slovenian
      ingredients from their suppliers), however their local image may suffer because
      of the redundancies. Their market share could consequently go down. Further,
      the market position of the two businesses that may merge is cheap and
      traditional food — this does not fit with Andrej’s future aspirations.

      Accept any other relevant advice.


      It is not expected that the candidates incorporate all of the above arguments.

      N.B. All 3 options have advantages and disadvantages. Candidates are
      expected to have a clear conclusion (and advise Andrej on one course of action)
      – it could be any of the three, as long as the answer is justified.

      If the candidate refers to only one option, award a maximum of [4 marks].

      To achieve the top markband, candidates must formulate a final advice
      (recommendation).

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

4.   (a)   Define the term below the line promotion.                                           [2 marks]

           Below the line promotion refers to techniques that do not use the main media
           such as newspapers, radio, television and the Internet. Below the line
           promotion is generally (though not exclusively) targeted at consumers who
           already have some interest in the product, and, therefore, occur in that context:
           point-of-sale promotions; direct mailings; exhibits in a shopping centre; or
           coupons, refunds, or loyalty cards, among others.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           If the only basis for awarding a mark were exemplification and the example is
           word of mouth, award [0 marks].

           For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain one possible type of diseconomy of scale that P&G may experience
           in the dry cleaning industry.                                                       [2 marks]

           Possible diseconomies of scale include:
            communication costs
            government regulations (which often apply to large/larger companies)
            office politics
            more resources devoted to management
            supplier restrictions (main office may insist on sourcing from particular
             suppliers)
            more difficult to coordinate the business
            productive inefficiency of being too large.

           Accept any other relevant diseconomy of scale and explanation.


           Award [1 mark] for identification of a relevant and correct diseconomy of
           scale and [1 mark] for its explanation and its application to the dry cleaning
           industry. Award a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain two types of primary research that the market analysts may have
      used.                                                                             [4 marks]

      Possible types of primary research include:
       surveys / questionnaires
       interviews (structured, semi-structured or unstructured)
       consumer panels / focus groups
       observation.

      N.B. If a candidate identifies surveys and questionnaires, this situation will
      virtually always be just one type of primary research. The burden of proof that
      surveys and questionnaires are different is on the candidate, and they must
      have clear and valid reasons why they are different.

      Accept any other relevant type of primary research and explanation.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for identification of a relevant and correct type of primary
      research and [1 mark] for its explanation and its application to the context of
      research on the dry cleaning industry. Award a maximum of [2 marks].

(d)   Using the Ansoff matrix, analyse P&G’s entry into the dry cleaning
      industry.                                                                         [5 marks]




      N.B. P&G, relying on the power of its brand, it could arguably be placed in
      any of the four quadrants of the Ansoff matrix. There is no right or wrong
      answer here: any answer may be argued and defended (put another way, how
      one views P&G’s entry into the dry cleaning industry is a matter of
      perspective).
                                      – 20 –            N12/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


At one level, what P&G is doing is extending the product life cycle of its
cleaning products by:
 penetrating an existing market (existing product: Tide soap; existing market:
   a market where Tide has brand awareness)
Or
 taking its existing product (Tide soap) to a new market (the dry cleaning
   industry).

From another perspective, P&G is doing something quite new:
 entering an existing market (that is, where there is Tide brand awareness)
   with a wholly new product (clean, cool, fresh-smelling branded dry cleaning
   stores)
Or
 diversifying by going into a new market (heretofore Tide has not been in the
   dry cleaning business) with a wholly new product (clean, cool,
   fresh-smelling branded dry cleaners).

Accept any other relevant analysis.


If the candidate draws the Ansoff Matrix fully and accurately, but writes
nothing else, award [1 mark]. On the other hand, the candidate does not have
to draw the matrix (though most will) as long as they demonstrate knowledge
of it and use it in their analysis.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

For [5 marks], candidates must demonstrate an understanding that how one
places Tide Dry Cleaners® on the Ansoff matrix is somewhat a matter of
perspective. Candidates must show their understanding that the Ansoff matrix
is a theoretical tool and that real business situations are not as clear cut, or
show an understanding that P&G’s dry cleaning franchise could arguably be
placed in any of the four quadrants of the Ansoff matrix.
                                             – 21 –            N12/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(e)   Discuss franchising as a way for P&G to enter the dry cleaning industry.            [7 marks]

      Franchising has both advantages and disadvantages for P&G.

      The advantages include the following:
       as the franchisees themselves provide most of the finance, this is a relatively
        inexpensive method of expansion for P&G (unlike the acquisition of dry
        cleaning companies)
       if the franchise model works well, there are large profits to be made (not
        only from selling the franchises as well as the royalty payments, but also
        from further strengthening the Tide brand name)
       some of the existing independent dry cleaners may decide to become
        franchisees in order to benefit from the brand (rather than struggling as
        competitors).

      The disadvantages include the following:
       some customers may decide to avoid the Tide franchises for ideological
        reasons, preferring to patronize independent businesses (this is linked to an
        increase of small-scale, anti-globalization actions)
       it seems that P&G does not have any experience in franchises and in the
        dry cleaning industry itself (as the company is rather a manufacturer of
        consumer goods); unlike other businesses (such as McDonald’s®) they may
        not have the expertise to properly manage a franchise (in terms of quality
        control and marketing) though as they are so big (global sales of
        US$80 billion) they could recruit managers who are franchising specialists
       diseconomies of scale are a risk, even with franchises, especially if the
        brand name “Tide” is suddenly affected by a negative image e.g. an accident
        in one of the franchises, then all the franchises could be negatively affected.

      Accept any other valid discussion.


      It is not expected that the candidates incorporate all of the above arguments.

      If the candidate refers to only advantages or disadvantages, award a maximum
      of [4 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

5.   (a)   Define the term multinational company.                                              [2 marks]

           A multinational company is one that operates in two or more countries.
           Generally, this refers to a large-scale global operation that enjoys economies of
           scale and has a powerful brand (McDonald’s®, BMW, Sony®, etc.). However, a
           multinational company can be a much smaller organization that operates in at
           least two countries (in Norway and Sweden, or Belgium and Luxembourg, for
           example).


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding (for example with a reference to several countries of operation).

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding.

           For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain the importance of branding for the decision of Starbucks® to enter
           the Indian market.                                                                  [4 marks]

           The Starbucks® brand is already well known in many parts of the world, even
           in India. The market research shows many Indians, as potential customers,
           have already encountered the name “Starbucks®” (for example in the media, on
           the Internet) so they are familiar with it and will be keen to purchase
           Starbucks® coffee and to patronize Starbucks® coffee shops (including in
           Tata Group’s nationwide hotel chain).

           A key aspect is the fact that Starbucks® is not just about coffee (the drink and
           its taste) nor the coffee shops (the venues and their atmosphere): Starbucks® is
           relying on its world-famous name (hence the idea of “a global brand”) for its
           marketing strategy and to appeal to new customers in a new market.

           Accept any other relevant explanation.


           Award [1 mark] for every valid point (or development of a valid point) up to a
           maximum of [4 marks].

           Accept four separate points, award [1 mark] each, or two separate points which
           are developed for 2+2 marks.
                                             – 23 –            N12/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Explain one PEST factor that may influence the decision of Starbucks® to
      enter the Indian market.                                                             [2 marks]

      Economic factor / sociological factor: the country of India (with its population
      of over 1 billion) is still poor overall, but it is developing fast (with a growth
      rate of 8 % of its GDP this year); this economic development means that there
      is an increasing market of young people with disposable income as potential
      Starbucks® customers (i.e. this is a business opportunity for Starbucks®).

      Political factor: although the Indian government limits the entry of
      foreign-owned retail chains into India, it is possible for foreign companies
      (such as Starbucks®) to form alliances or joint ventures (this is actually a legal
      factor that would appear under L in a more developed STEEPLE analysis).

      N.B. Candidates may refer to their own knowledge of India, especially for
      economic factors; this is not an expectation, however this is acceptable.

      A candidate does not have to say which type of factor (political, economic,
      etc.). A response may open, for example, “A PEST factor that…”.

      Accept any other relevant PEST factor and explanation.


      Award [1 mark] for a basic outline of a relevant and correct factor (which
      could be a repeat or mere rephrasing from the stimulus). Award an additional
      [1 mark] for a development of that idea, i.e. an explanation linking it to the
      decision of Starbucks® to enter the Indian market. Award a maximum of
      [2 marks].

(d)   Analyse one advantage and one disadvantage for Tata Group of forming a
      strategic alliance with Starbucks®.                                                  [5 marks]

      N.B. The question is about the advantages and disadvantages for Tata Group,
      not for Starbucks®. Answers that fail to take Tata Group’s perspective (and
      focus instead on Starbucks® only) should not be awarded.

      Advantages for Tata Group of forming a strategic alliance with Starbucks®
      could include:
       some customers may decide to go to Tata Group retail chains precisely
        because there is a Starbucks® cafe there (especially at the beginning, when
        there is a novelty aspect)
       Tata Group would benefit from the positive image of having facilitated the
        arrival of Starbucks® in India; it can help “westernize” the image of
        Tata Group, both domestically and internationally
       the alliance could also strengthen their other business arrangements (as
        Starbucks® had previously bought coffee from Tata Group) so Tata Group
        might be in a better position to negotiate or renegotiate some contracts (for
        example for the coffee supplied to Starbucks®).
                                              – 24 –             N12/3/BUSMT/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


      Disadvantages for Tata Group of forming a strategic alliance with Starbucks®
      could include:
       Starbucks® is often presented or perceived as an emblem of globalization,
        especially Americanization: there is a risk that some stakeholders might
        disapprove of Tata Group as a consequence
       unlike Café Coffee Day®, Starbucks® is not Indian, so the profits will be sent
        back to the American headquarters; Tata Group could suffer from a
        negative image, as it supports foreign businesses rather than Indian ones.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.


      Candidates are only expected to address one advantage and one disadvantage.

      If the response is one-sided (only one advantage or one disadvantage), award a
      maximum of [3 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(e)   Discuss the decision of Starbucks® to enter the Indian market.                          [7 marks]

      For Starbucks®, the business case to enter the Indian market is clear-cut:
      research and other external factors show that there is a potential demand
      (“young Indians with disposable income”) throughout the country (both in the
      south and in the north). To circumvent the legal impossibility for a foreign
      chain to operate in the Indian market, Starbucks® has found a good method:
      forming a strategic alliance or joint venture with a company (called Tata Group)
      with which they have already done business (purchasing coffee from them).
      Moreover, that group is well established in India and would directly give
      Starbucks® access to a range of venues suitable for its coffee shops, such as
      hotels and retail chains. This all looks very good and promising for Starbucks®,
      however they will need to take some other factors into consideration.

      Market penetration (to refer to the Ansoff matrix) always represents an element
      of risk; Starbucks® has been successful in many countries (e.g. in Europe and
      its native US) though usually in developed countries; India is a different market,
      both economically and sociologically. Will its standardized products appeal to
      Indian customers (e.g. in terms of coffee drinks)? Global brands take time to
      adapt to national cultures (for example McDonald’s® struggled for a long time
      in India until it recently started to offer its first “aloo tikki burger”, which is a
      patty of potatoes and peas flavoured with Indian spices): Starbucks® will need
      to take national/local aspects into account, otherwise it might struggle, after an
      initial enthusiasm due to the arrival of the brand itself.

      If one-sided, award a maximum of [4 marks].

      Accept any other relevant discussion.
