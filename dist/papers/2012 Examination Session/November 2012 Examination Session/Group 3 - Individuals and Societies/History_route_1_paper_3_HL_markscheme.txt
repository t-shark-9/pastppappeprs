 0:       Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:     Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
          appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:     There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
          insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
          than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.        Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is
        well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well-structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   Analyse the causes and the results of the investiture crisis (1075–1122).

     This will be a popular question. Candidates are required to address both parts of the question.
     Responses must be well-structured and supported with relevant detail.

     The causes of the investiture crisis may include, but not be limited to: the crisis originated with the
     Church reform movement of the eleventh century which sought to remove abuses such as simony,
     nepotism and clerical marriage in an attempt to restore the spirituality and reputation of the Church.
     This reform movement wished to eliminate secular interference in the administration of Church
     affairs such as the appointment of bishops by kings and secular control of the election of the Pope.
     Influential church leaders such as Hildebrand (who became Pope Gregory VII) were anxious to
     eliminate lay interference in the Church. The Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV was determined to
     maintain control over the appointment of bishops in order to keep them as loyal vassals, obtain a
     share of the revenue they collected and ensure their political support in disputes with the Church or
     the nobility. He also wished to control the election of the Pope to maintain his power in Italy and
     prevent challenges to his authority.

     This difference in goals led to a confrontation in 1075 when Gregory VII excommunicated
     Henry IV over the question of lay investiture of bishops.

     The results may include, but not be limited to: civil war occurred in Germany as the nobles were
     encouraged to revolt against Henry who was no longer considered the legitimate ruler as a result of
     excommunication. Conflict in Italy and Germany was continuous for the next few years as rival
     emperors and popes struggled for power. Ultimately the Papacy emerged as more powerful as it
     now assumed the right to supervise secular rulers and undermine their authority through
     excommunication and interdict. The Papacy would now play a larger role in the internal politics of
     all nations. The reform movement gained greater strength as well as the movement for the
     independence of the Church.

     The crisis was resolved in 1122 at the Concordat of Worms by a compromise over the appointment
     of bishops.

     If only causes or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

2.   For what reasons, and with what results, did new monastic orders appear after 900?

     Candidates must respond to both parts of the question. Responses must be well-structured and
     supported with relevant detail.

     The reasons for the emergence of new monastic orders after 900 may include, but not be limited to:
     a reaction to the corruption, moral laxity in monasteries and lack of respect for the monastic rule as
     established by St. Benedict. The desire by some religious leaders such as William the Pious to
     restore the spirit of asceticism and devotion of the early monasteries led to the founding of the
     Abbey at Cluny as the beginning of a reform movement. The influence of the Cluniac abbots, Odo
     and Odile inspired reform in many monasteries. There was a powerful secular support for the
     creation of new monastic orders by the Holy Roman Empire. Many individuals in the tenth century
     wished to embrace the ascetic life out of a desire for order, moral improvement, salvation and to
     escape the anarchy and violence of the medieval world. In addition, the formation of new monastic
     orders was inspired by the broad movement for church reform which was beginning to develop at
     this time.

     The results of the creation of new monastic orders may include, but not be limited to: new monastic
     orders such as the Carthusians and Cistercians established rigorous moral standards and discipline
     as examples to the public and other clergy. Thousands of individuals were drawn to join these new
     orders, which gave them great influence and their example of morality, piety and devotion increased
     the reputation and influence of the Church. The Cistercian emphasis on manual labour contributed
     significantly to advances in agriculture and stock-raising which benefited everyone. Pilgrimages
     and the Crusades were given great support by the founding of the military orders such as the
     Templars and the Hospitallers.

     A number of abbots, such as Bernard of Clairvaux, became important advisers to the Papacy and
     secular rulers; their moral stature and reputation gave them enormous respect and influence. Many
     members of the new orders attained high position in the Church and many became pope – this
     added to the movement for Church reform and the desire and ability of the church to expand its
     authority in medieval society.

     Candidates might also point out that the success of the new orders attracted many individuals who
     were not pious but seeking a career and advancement. This, in addition to the rapidly growing
     wealth and power of the monastic orders, led to a return of corruption and moral laxity. The ironic
     result of monastic reform was the need for more monastic reform.

     If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   Why were the Fatimids successful in their military campaigns in North Africa and Egypt?

     This question requires that candidates produce a clear analytical explanation of the reasons for
     Fatimid success in their rise to power. Responses must be supported by relevant detail.

     The reasons for their military success may include, but not be limited to: the support of the Berber
     tribes of Morocco who were particularly formidable soldiers. Fatimid development of powerful
     naval forces that allowed them to spread their influence along the North African coast and acquire
     more wealth and territory. The weakness of the Abbasid Caliphate which was caused by a series of
     challenges to its authority in various parts of the Empire. The increasing discontent of many in the
     Empire with the Abbasids which made them more likely to support a new movement. The work of
     the Ismaili missionaries who recruited many individuals in North Africa to their cause and thus
     gained strength for the Fatimids and weakened the opposition. The fact that the Fatimids began
     their revolt in a remote area far from Baghdad gave them the opportunity to acquire considerable
     strength before expanding their territory. The Ismaili missionaries had actively created networks of
     support in Egypt prior to the arrival of the Fatimid army in Egypt. The Fatimids had a number of
     very capable military leaders who led their campaigns, including the conquest of Egypt.


4.   “Internal conflict rather than external enemies caused the collapse of the Fatimid Empire.”
     To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates must assess the degree to which the Fatimid collapse was a function of their own
     weaknesses rather than conquest by various external enemies. Responses must be analytical in
     nature and supported by relevant detail.

     The internal reasons for their collapse may include, but not be limited to: the Fatimid army and
     bureaucracy were weakened by internal strife amongst different factions (Berbers, Turks, Nubians).
     This led to civil war and the loss of territory such as Syria. The Caliphs lost their power to military
     commanders or viziers such as Badr al Jamali who took over all the caliph‟s power and left him as a
     figurehead. Increasing religious schisms within the Fatimid Empire as the majority Sunni sect
     revived and refused to submit to the Ismaili rulers, in addition the Druze and the Assassins created
     further internal divisions and religious conflict. The Fatimids relied increasingly on a system of
     tax-farming to gain revenue. This led to many local leaders breaking away and declaring their
     independence. Tribal groups in North Africa broke away and the resulting conflict further
     weakened the Empire.

     External reasons for the collapse would include, but not be limited to: the attacks of European
     crusaders who seized territory and reduced the prestige of the Fatimids, the incursions of the Seljuk
     Turks who took over much territory and further weakened their power. The rise of rival Islamic
     leaders such as Saladin who completed the destruction of the Fatimid power.

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   By what methods, and with what results, did Philip II (1180–1223) seek to increase royal
     power in France?

     Candidates must deal with both parts of the question. Responses must be well structured and
     supported with relevant detail.

     The methods he used to increase his power may include, but not be limited to: he continued the
     process of expanding authority that had been begun by previous rulers. He increased his territory
     through marriage and the exercise of feudal rights. He increased his power through exploiting the
     divisions in the Angevin commonwealth and benefited from the death of Richard I and the
     weakness of John to acquire large amounts of territory. He developed relations with towns and the
     bourgeoisie which provided him with income, which in turn allowed him to raise forces to subdue
     many powerful nobles and force them to submit to him. He expanded the bureaucracy established
     by his predecessors and used them to enforce royal regulations throughout France, enforce royal
     laws, collect taxes and report disloyalty. His bureaucracy was composed of middle class officials
     who were natural opponents of the nobility and thus supported the king in his expansion of power.
     He increased his revenues through confiscation from the Jews and the Templars and insisted on the
     rigorous enforcement of his feudal rights from which he gained territory and wealth. He was a
     political opportunist who took advantage of the weaknesses and divisions of his opponents.

     The results would include, but not be limited to: Philip became a powerful monarch ruling a greatly
     expanded territory. His defeat of the Angevins and victory at Bouvines established him as a
     powerful European monarch. He established French central authority and developed the
     bureaucracy and legal systems which supported the monarchy. The power of the nobility was
     reduced.

     If only methods or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

6.   “Military power was not the most important way in which William I (1066–1087) consolidated
     his authority in England.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates will have to assess the various methods that William used to consolidate his authority
     and determine how important military force was to the process.

     The military contribution to William‟s consolidation of power may include, but not be limited to:
     the impact of his military victory and new military technology showed him to be a powerful
     military leader. The death of many Anglo-Saxon leaders including Harold at Hastings, the brutal
     suppression of the rebellion in the North in 1069 intimidated many opponents, his building of royal
     fortresses throughout the kingdom and the maintenance of his own armed forces served to prevent
     armed rebellion.

     The non-military policies that he used to consolidate his authority may include, but not be limited
     to: the maintenance of many Anglo-Saxon laws and customs conciliated the population, restricting
     high positions in government to those loyal to him, ensuring that nobles given land grants were
     loyal only to him and not others. Using the sheriffs to enforce royal ordinances and to supervise
     and report on every part of the kingdom, having himself crowned at Winchester to emphasize his
     position as the rightful ruler, controlling the Church and the appointment of bishops, abbots, etc.
     Establishing an effective central bureaucracy for taxation, legislation and legal matters. Creating
     the Domesday Book which gave him accurate information on the wealth, power and activities of the
     population.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   Explain the contribution and importance of two of the following during the Crusades:
     Nur al-Din; Richard I of England; Templars; Godfrey de Bouillon; Assassins; Baybars.

     Candidates must produce responses which focus on both the details of the chosen individual‟s
     actions and activities relative to the Crusades but also the importance/significance of their actions or
     activities.

     Contribution may include, but not be limited to: military leadership, political initiatives, religious
     influences, formation of alliances, conquest or loss of territory.

     Importance may include, but not be limited to: impact of military leadership including the results of
     victories or defeats, extent to which military goals were achieved, impact of military campaigns,
     impact on the political structure or power, ability to form alliances. The extent to which their
     activities strengthened or weakened their side in the crusading period.

     If only importance or contribution is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


8.   “The crusading movement failed because Europe gave it little support after 1100.” To what
     extent do you agree with this statement?

     This question requires an analysis of the reasons for the failure of the Crusades. Candidates may
     advance a number of reasons but they must address the issue of a lack of European support at some
     point in their response. They may challenge the assertion but must address it in their response.
     Responses must be well-structured and supported by relevant detail.

     Some points on the lack of European support may include, but not be limited to: lack of permanent
     settlers after 1100, the inability of the Crusader States to increase their European populations, the
     diversion of crusading resources (manpower and spiritual) into internal European Crusades such as
     the reconquista and the Albegensian Crusade. The lack of cooperation amongst leaders of Crusades
     such as Philip II and Richard I on the Third Crusade. Monarchs used their military power to fight
     each other in Europe or expand their territories rather than support the Crusades. The ability of
     monarchs and nobles to escape promises to go on Crusades through money payments to the Papacy
     limited military support.

     Other points to explain the failure of the Crusades may include, but not be limited to: increasing
     Islamic unity and strength under Saladin, Baybars, etc., the lack of cooperation amongst the
     Crusader states, poor relations with the Byzantine Empire, lack of central leadership in the
     Crusading states, poor military tactics.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.   Analyse the impact of either Hülegü (1256–1265) or Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane) (1370–1405)
     on the Islamic world.

     Hülegü
     The impact of Hülegü on the Muslim world was considerable. The reasons for this may include,
     but not be limited to: he destroyed the Assassins which had a considerable impact as they had
     caused much disruption and had contributed to the Muslim world‟s weakness against the Crusaders
     and the Mongols. Hülegü captured and destroyed Baghdad and the Abbasid Caliphate. Baghdad
     lost its position as the centre of the Islamic world and the political prestige and remaining power of
     the Caliphs was assumed by the Mamluks in Egypt. His invasion of Syria weakened the Islamic
     power there as the rulers were overthrown and the influence of Damascus was weakened. Again
     more power in the Islamic world was assumed by the Mamluks. Hülegü‟s alliance with Christians
     in Syria further weakened Islam for a period of time. The defeat of Hülegü‟s army by the Mamluks
     at „Ayn Jalut was a turning point in Islamic history as it preserved the empire from further invasion
     and destruction by the Mongols and their Christian allies.

     Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane)
     Tamerlane‟s effects on Islam are difficult to assess as he both supported and attacked Islamic states
     and cities during his four decades of conquest. Many of his wars were against other Muslims.
     These include the Golden Horde, the Ottomans and the Mamluks. This means that he is often seen
     as having a negative and destructive influence in many parts of the Islamic world. He did, however,
     spread Islam to India and he destroyed Christian communities in Armenia and Georgia, as well as
     recovering the city of Smyrna from the Hospitallers. He built Samarkand into a powerful Islamic
     centre of religion and scholarship in central Asia. He remains a heroic figure in Kazakhstan. His
     destruction of the Mamluks and other Islamic groups in the Middle East created a power vacuum
     which made the Ottoman conquests of the region much easier. He had defeated the Ottomans but
     they were not permanently weakened by him and took advantage of the vacuum left by his death to
     increase their power and dominate much of the Islamic world.

10.   Why was the Islamic world not able to resist the Mongol invasion under Genghis Khan?

      The reasons for the lack of resistance by the Islamic world to the challenge posed by the Mongol
      invasion may include, but not be limited to: the Islamic world was seriously divided and had been
      weakened by internal strife and civil war. The Seljuks are an example, as are the defeats and
      internal divisions caused by the Crusades. The breakup of the Muslim world into rival caliphates
      such as the Fatimid caliphate further weakened the central authority. Disputes between the Sunnis
      and Shi‟ites had weakened internal unity further.

      The Abbasid Caliphs were weak and had little support in the Empire – could not organize a
      coordinated response. The Abbasid Caliphs had neglected their armies and allowed them to
      become weak and ill-equipped. Many local Islamic rulers had alienated their subjects through harsh
      taxation and oppressive policies which undermined their loyalty.

      Mongol strengths are also important in the explanation. These include, but are not limited to: the
      Mongol Army was extremely powerful in numbers, training and tactics. The Mongols employed
      psychological warfare which paralyzed opponents and minimized resistance. Mongol rule was not
      seen as oppressive by many individuals in the Islamic Empire and they gave their support to the
      Mongols which further increased their power. The Mongols made alliances with Christians and
      others in order to further their campaigns of conquest.

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   Why was al-Andalus under the Umayyad dynasty (756–1031) regarded as a unique society
      both culturally and economically?

      This response will require candidates to examine the aspects and characteristics of al-Andalus that
      may cause it to be referred to as a unique society. The cultural aspects may include, but not be
      limited to: artistic, literary and intellectual developments and institutions, religious beliefs and
      interactions, ethnic and racial relations. The economic aspects may include but not be limited to:
      the development of industries, trade and technology and advances in all of these areas.

      Economically, material may include, but not be limited to: the extensive irrigation and water
      management technology which excelled anything in Europe and provided an enormous variety and
      quantity of agricultural produce – Europe had no equivalent. The wealth produced by agriculture
      allowed for urbanization and the support of specialized craftsmen whose work greatly expanded
      Spanish trade. Trade brought in wealth but also design ideas and crafts that created unique styles
      and sophistication in architecture, household goods and luxury items. Al-Andalus benefited from
      inputs from the East in many areas – these were further adapted when they reached Spain. The
      wealth of Cordoba exceeded anywhere in Europe, rivalled other Islamic centres and was said to
      have overawed even the Byzantine ambassadors in the ninth century. This wealth and
      sophistication brought many Christians to convert to Islam.

      Culturally, al-Andalus was the centre of intellectual development as a result of the constant influx
      of knowledge from the East but also because of its unique society which brought cooperation and
      interaction amongst Muslims, Jews and Christians in the study of a wide range of topics. The
      Universities at Cordoba and Toledo and the extensive libraries far beyond those of Europe
      encouraged intellectual development. Religious toleration and the presence of a large number of
      Jewish scholars was key to creating a unique environment for intellectual and cultural development.
      Jews were outcast in Europe but had important roles in Islamic Spain. This unique society was
      recognized by Europeans as they migrated in great numbers to learn everything from medicine to
      mathematics to classical philosophy.


12.   Why did the Reconquista succeed?

      Candidates must produce an assessment of the extent to which Muslim weaknesses, as opposed to
      Christian strengths, were responsible for the collapse of the Islamic kingdoms in Spain. Responses
      will be a combination of both factors but candidates may decide to emphasize one explanation over
      the other. All responses must be analytical in nature and contain relevant and accurate content.

      The evidence of Muslim weakness may include, but not be limited to: the collapse of the Ummayad
      caliphate in 1031 left a power vacuum that was not filled by a single ruler, Muslim Spain was
      divided into about three dozen smaller states ruled by “party kings” or Ta’ifas. They fought
      amongst each other for influence and territory. Their rivalries allowed Christian kingdoms to
      increase in strength as they were no longer under attack. Many Ta’ifas made alliance with
      Christians against Muslim rivals which strengthened the Christians and weakened Islam.

Muslim power was increased temporarily by the Almoravid invasion from North Africa but they
failed to unify Muslim Spain and created further divisions. They were replaced by the Almohads
who were a powerful military force but their conflicts with the Almoravids and their focus on North
Africa weakened their rule in Spain and allowed the Christians to recover their strength. Both of
these groups alienated many Muslims in Spain due to their intolerance and strict enforcement of
Islam.

The evidence of growing Christian strength as a source of the defeat of the Muslims may include,
but not be limited to: the conquest of Toledo gave the Christians a boost in morale and was a
significant loss to the Muslims, the increasing numbers of Europeans who came to Spain to
participate in the Crusade against Islam, the increased support from the Papacy and the military
orders in Europe greatly increased Christian strength. This culminated in the battle of Las Navas de
Tolosa which permanently weakened Islamic power. The knowledge gained by Christians from
contact with Muslims helped them improve their armies and expand their wealth and populations.
Their growing confidence in the face of Islamic weakness gave them the determination to continue
the fight. The increased unity and cooperation amongst the Christian kingdoms was also a key
factor.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   Analyse the degree of success achieved by Frederick I (1155–1190) in establishing royal
      authority and control over his territory.

      This question requires candidates to analyse the degree of success that Frederick I achieved in
      making himself an effective and powerful ruler over the Holy Roman Empire.

      Areas to consider may include, but not be limited to: his success in reducing the power of the
      nobility in Germany, establishing an effective central administration and eliminating civil wars and
      internal strife. His ability to control the Church in Germany as well as the outcome of his wars in
      Italy, his ability to control the Italian states and the Papacy should be assessed.


14.   In what ways, and with what results, was royal power challenged in England in the thirteenth
      century?

      This question requires that candidates address both the ways in which royal power was challenged
      and the results of those challenges, in England, in the thirteenth century.

      The major ways in which attempts were made to limit the royal power include: Magna Carta
      (1215), supporting rival claimants to the throne, the creation of a parliament to negotiate limits on
      the king‟s authority in taxation. Documents such as the Provisions of Oxford which attempted to
      extract more concessions from the king and greater authority for Parliament. Armed rebellion
      against Henry III in support of the Provisions.

      The results of these attempts were mixed – Magna Carta was denounced by John but accepted by
      Henry III – this was clear concession that the king‟s power might be limited. The principles of
      Magna Carta were included in the coronation oath and became a method of judging and criticizing
      the monarchy. Magna Carta became a powerful example of the population asserting their rights and
      a precedent for other attempts to limit royal power. The creation of Parliament brought on by the
      king‟s need for money and the baron‟s reluctance to provide it without concessions introduced a
      method of limiting the royal authority to some degree. The concept of absolute monarchy was no
      longer possible. The creation of a Parliament which included the middle class and the gentry
      broadened the support for parliament and made it a more powerful body. The resort to civil war to
      support the concepts of limits to royal power was a powerful threat. Edward I accepted the need to
      summon parliaments to approve taxation and accepted that he would make concessions in return for
      their support.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   Analyse the causes and the results of the overthrow of either Edward II (1307–1327) or
      Richard II (1377–1399).

      Candidates must address both causes and results for either Edward II or Richard II.

      Edward II
      The causes of the overthrow of Edward II may include, but not be limited to: the problems that he
      inherited from Edward I, i.e. war with Scotland, hostility with France. Large debts and a nobility
      made resentful by autocratic behaviour and excessive taxation. His own lack of experience and the
      nobility‟s resentment at the influence of Piers Gaveston led to armed revolt. Reconciliation
      occurred but Edward was determined to recover and increase his power – this led to civil war
      between himself and the nobles wishing to limit the authority of the King. The King was unpopular
      due to ongoing problems with Scotland and losses in territory to France. The decision of the queen
      to oppose him and place their son on the throne forced Edward to abdicate.

      The results of his overthrow include, but are not limited to: his son became king as Edward III,
      there was renewed emphasis on limiting the powers of the monarch especially taxation, Parliament
      increased in power and gained greater control over the imposition of taxes, in addition statutes
      could not be changed by the King alone. The nobility increased its power and the concept that
      kings could be replaced was established – this would lead to further crisis of succession as rival
      groups struggled for the throne. The king‟s council became a more important body in
      administration. It was dominated by the nobility which gave them the opportunity to exercise
      greater power and control over the king.

      Richard II
      The causes for the overthrow of Richard II may include, but not be limited to: he became king at the
      age of ten; administration was now in the hands of the council – great nobles, all of whom were
      increasing their power through the possession of private armies. Richard‟s character did not inspire
      respect or admiration and he alienated many by his assertion of his rights as an absolute monarch –
      this was not popular in England. He faced opposition from his powerful relatives who sought to
      control him and direct the government – he worked with them but resented their influence. Richard
      attempted to reassert absolute authority – he executed a number of those who had exercised control
      over him and confiscated lands of others in an attempt to assert his power, he further alienated the
      Church, the merchants and small land-owners. The Lancastrian family under Henry Bolingbroke
      led a rebellion which captured the King and forced him to abdicate.

      The results may include, but not be limited to: the overthrow of the king by the nobles created a
      sense of power in the nobility who would seek to overthrow a king who displeased them. This was
      attempted in 1403 but failed. Parliament increased its power to control taxation and supervise the
      budget. This was part of the gradually increasing power of Parliament. The king‟s power came to
      rest on his military success both against internal and external enemies. The king was only secure if
      he could maintain a successful foreign policy and expand English territory. The concept that the
      king could be replaced and the nobles were more powerful was a major contribution to the Wars of
      the Roses.

      If only causes or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

16.   Why was France victorious in the Hundred Years War?

      This will be a popular question and will require an analysis of the reasons for the French victory.
      Candidates must present a well-structured response with relevant and accurate content.

      The reasons for the French victory will be found in a combination of increasing French power and
      errors or weakness on the English side. Candidates may choose to emphasize one view more than
      the other but some elements of both should be present for a strong response.

      Reasons for the increasing power of France may include, but not be limited to: an increase in
      confidence and morale provided by the example of Joan of Arc at Orleans – a French victory after
      many defeats. Her martyrdom provided an inspiration for the French. The French monarchy
      gained new confidence and determination. France developed a large professional standing army of
      better quality than the feudal array, other military reforms were introduced to increase the power of
      the king, improve training and weapons. Charles VII was a popular monarch who gained great
      support from the French population. His administration used the superior wealth and resources of
      France to build a large army which could successfully confront the English. The internal divisions
      in France which had allowed the English to win were eliminated.

      The English errors and weaknesses that contributed to their defeat may include, but not be limited
      to: the death of Henry V left a vacuum in political and military leadership; the Duke of Bedford,
      English commander in France, died in 1435 and no replacement of quality was found. English
      occupation was increasingly unpopular in France – many revolts against the occupying forces over
      taxes, etc. England lost their alliance with Burgundy which was a key to their power, the war
      received less support from England where it was unpopular. Henry VI was a weak and unpopular
      ruler.

Fourteenth century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   Examine the impact of the Black Death on both the rural and urban economies.

      The impact of the Black Death on both rural economy and society was severe and widespread.

      The reasons for this may include, but not be limited to: a severe decline in population which led to
      the abandonment of villages and estates, the reduction in land cultivation, the move from cultivation
      to stock-raising due to a shortage of labour. Higher wages for labour, inflation in the price of food
      and food shortages were results.
      The economic organization of feudalism, which was in decline, collapsed more quickly as landlords
      commuted service to rent in order to maintain their labourers. Strife in rural areas resulted from
      peasants demanding higher wages and lords who were reluctant to submit to these demands. Sharp
      divisions and hostility in society resulted including local rebellions and revolts. Many rural people
      moved to towns in search of better opportunity and in response to a demand for labour in urban
      areas. Society was upset as the economic balance of power and structure began to change.
      Feudalism as a means of social organization and structure was greatly weakened. Urban areas
      became more powerful relative to the countryside as a result of shift in population and employment.
      Institutions such as the Church and government lost the respect of the population who sought
      changes in religion, laws and social structure.


18.   Assess the statement that “The Black Death was not the principal cause of the Peasants’
      Revolt of 1381.”

      This will be a popular question. Candidates must assess to what extent the Black Death was a
      major cause of the Peasants‟ Revolt of 1381.

      A clear understanding of the impact of the Black Death on English society and other contributing
      causes of the Peasants‟ Revolt will be needed to construct an effective response. Responses must
      state a clear thesis and provide a well-structured argument in response to the quotation.

      The impact of the Black Death as a major factor could be seen in the economic, social, feudal and
      cultural changes in the life of all social classes. The peasant and working class survivors of the
      plague were wealthier or able to demand higher wages due to labour shortage. The government
      attempts to limit their incomes created considerable resentment and unrest. The feudal system was
      collapsing as a result of the competition for labour and those landlords who enforced it were
      causing resentment. The plague had undermined respect for authority and traditional institutions
      such as the Church which had failed to explain or stop the calamity. Increased criticism of authority
      and church doctrines was becoming common. Religious reformers such as John Wycliff and the
      spread of the Lollard philosophy increased the atmosphere of dissent, undermined the Church and
      called into question traditional structure and authority.

      Other factors that contributed to the revolt may include, but not be limited to: the unpopularity of
      the war in France which required taxation and manpower to sustain it, the spread of egalitarian
      philosophies by individuals such as John Ball which questioned the ruling structure and the
      existence of social classes. The political weakness of government due to the fact that the King was
      a child, the imposition of a poll tax in 1380 was widely resented and seen as oppressive, especially
      by the peasants and workers. The declining feudal system raised expectations and demands for
      changes in society as did the rising urban areas which were dynamic centres for new ideas and
      institutions.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Why were the Ottomans successful conquerors?

      Candidates may discuss any aspect of Ottoman conquests, including the fall of Constantinople and
      Ottoman expansion into central Europe.

      The reasons for their success as conquerors may include, but not be limited to: Ottoman military
      organization which employed large armies equipped with the latest technology and techniques, the
      weakness of their opponents such as the Byzantine Empire and other Islamic states which had been
      weakened by the campaigns of Timur-I-Lang (Tamerlane) and the Crusaders. They were not
      seriously weakened by the invasion of Tamerlane and when he departed they were able to take
      advantage of the power vacuum which resulted. They acquired enormous wealth through conquests
      which expanded their military strength. They attracted much support in areas like the Balkans
      because their rule was less oppressive than previous rulers. This new territory increased their
      wealth and confidence and brought in many recruits. They had a number of skilled military and
      political leaders such as Mehmet II. They did not face any united opposition from Europe.


20.   Assess the impact of the Ottoman conquests on either the Islamic world or Europe.

      Candidates must assess the impact of the Ottoman conquests. They should not describe the
      methods of conquest or produce a narrative history of Ottoman conquests. The response must be
      analytical and be supported by relevant detail.

      The impact of the Ottoman Empire on the Islamic world may include, but not be limited to: the
      Arabic speaking countries all became part of the Ottoman Empire with modest exception in
      Morocco and Saudi Arabia, it was a bureaucratic Empire but also expressed the universality of
      Islam, supported religious law and extended the frontiers of the Islamic world. The power and
      prestige of Islam were expanded as the Ottoman Empire was the most powerful in the world.
      Turkish was established as the language of the ruling elite. Ottoman rulers were strong supporters
      of Shari„a and integrated it closely with the state. There was considerable economic growth as a
      result of rising population but also the orderly society and the rise of trade under the Ottomans. The
      Ottomans emphasized commerce and banking as part of their plan for prosperity. The Ottoman
      emphasis on the growth of cities, public works and education also contributed to new levels of
      prosperity in the Empire. Christians and Jews were encouraged to settle in the Empire particularly
      for commercial and industrial reasons. The Ottomans had considerable cultural influence in
      architecture and public buildings but also in encouraging the Arabic language as a language of
      scholarship, as well as in literature and poetry. The Ottomans supported the Sunni version of Islam
      and, as a result, Shi‟ism was downgraded or persecuted, many left and went to Iran where the Shi„i
      Safavids were reigning and who opposed the Ottomans.

      The impact of the Ottoman Empire on Europe may include, but not be limited to: large amounts of
      European territory became part of the Ottoman Empire, notably in the Balkans and central Europe.
      Ottoman armies posed a great threat to central Europe, reaching and besieging Vienna in the
      sixteenth century, as well as invading Italy. The Ottomans became a force in European diplomacy
      as their support was sought by the French in their struggles against the Holy Roman Empire.
      Europe suffered a psychological blow with the fall of Constantinople, the centre of the Orthodox
      Church there was considerable fear about the advancing power of Islam. The Roman Catholic
      Church became the centre of Christianity as their rivalry with the Orthodox Church was no longer
      in existence.

The rule of the Ottoman sultans became a source of study for Renaissance writers such as
Machiavelli who used the Ottomans as a model for their studies of politics and how rulers should
administer their states. Many books spoke of the merits of the Ottoman state and why it should be
imitated by Europeans. Ottoman military and financial power dominated the Mediterranean and
major trading states such as Venice were forced to seek alliance with them in order to continue to
trade. The Ottoman control of North Africa gave them enormous influence throughout the region.
The Ottoman control of trade routes was one of the incentives for the movement of European
exploration seeking to find an alternative to dealing with the Ottomans for spices, etc. European
states were also worried as many Christians migrated to the Ottoman Empire where there was better
administration and a more tolerant environment, as well as greater wealth and lower taxes. There
was fear in the West that many of the lower classes would prefer the Ottomans to Christian states.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500

21.   “The Italian city states were crucial to the origins of the Renaissance.” Discuss.

      Candidates are asked to analyse the role of the Italian city states in bringing about the Renaissance.
      This may include, but not be limited to economic, artistic, social, political, academic or historical
      factors. Responses must be well-structured and contain relevant content.

      Areas to consider may include, but not be limited to: the wealth of the Italian cities gave them the
      ability to support great numbers of artists, architects and academics anxious to develop new ideas,
      their traditional links to the Roman past gave them ideas in philosophy, etc. that were different from
      those common in Europe, their involvement with the wider world through trade, particularly the
      Byzantine Empire and the Islamic world had introduced a vast range of new products, knowledge
      and ideas to them and to Europe. Their universities were centres for the development of new ideas
      in science, medicine, law and politics which challenged traditional views, their increasingly secular
      outlooks challenged the ideas of the Church in many areas. Their political structures brought new
      ideas on the organization of states and the role of citizens and their rights. The competition
      amongst them created a fertile environment for new ideas and developments. Their commercial
      interests were ready to support new technology as well as knowledge that would increase their
      wealth. Many of their citizens had leisure time in which to pursue new interests, question accepted
      practices and explore new ideas.


22.   For what reasons, and with what results, were the arts promoted by powerful individuals in
      the Renaissance?

      This is a two part question and candidates must address both parts. The arts and artists in this
      response will be understood to include the visual arts, music, architecture, literature, history, and
      philosophy and their practitioners.

      The reasons for the support of the arts by powerful individuals may include, but not be limited to: a
      desire to demonstrate one‟s wealth and power by employing the most successful artists, a desire to
      add to the reputation of one‟s city or to reduce another by luring away their leading artists, a
      genuine interest in advancing one or more of the arts in keeping with the spirit of the Renaissance,
      competitions between individuals and cities encouraged support for the arts, the Church and
      individual popes were anxious to use the new forms to teach their messages and to demonstrate the
      wealth and power of the Church particularly in the age of the Counter-Reformation.

      The results would include, but not be limited to: enormous developments and new ideas in all
      aspects of the arts, art became a more public spectacle through architecture, increased decoration of
      palaces and private homes, vast numbers of artists came to Italy to seek patrons, a myriad of new
      techniques emerged as artists sought favour from patrons, some artists became famous and
      influential as individuals and cities sought their work. The spirit of the Renaissance was translated
      into visual forms which could be more widely seen and appreciated. Conflicts broke out over the
      services of artists which led to wars, intrigues and violence between cities or individuals. Rivalries
      between artists for the support of wealthy individuals led to hostilities and violence on occasion.
      The arts were promoted to a new height in Europe as a result of the intense interest, support and
      wealth of the Italian cities and individuals who supported them.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   “The movement of Western exploration and expansion owed its success to the work of a few
      individuals.” Discuss.

      Candidates will have to comment on the degree to which specific individuals played a key role in
      the exploration movement. They may wish to point out the importance of other factors but must
      address the issue of the significance of specific individuals.

      These may include, but not be limited to: Henry the Navigator, Columbus, Ibn Mahjid, Dias,
      Magellan and Da Gama. They may also include others with whom they may be familiar such as
      John Cabot, Ferdinand and Isabella.

      The nature of their contributions may include: improvements in navigation and cartography,
      research and knowledge of other parts of the world, seamanship, experience in long voyages,
      personal ambition and determination, financial support, as well as being able to rally support from
      influential persons to support voyages of exploration, the spirit of discovery and adventure,
      competition to find better trade routes.

      Responses must be well-structured and supported by specific relevant content.


24.   “The movement of Western exploration and expansion did little to weaken the Islamic world
      up to 1550.” Discuss.

      Candidates must develop a response which shows whether Western exploration and expansion had
      a significant impact on the Islamic world up to 1550.

      There are points that can be made on both sides of the argument and candidates should decide
      which combination of points they wish to include in order to provide a response. In all cases
      responses must be well-structured and supported by relevant detail.

      The points that support the concept that Islam was weakened would include, but not be limited to:
      Western merchants could break the monopoly on the spice trade which cut the profits of Islamic
      merchants. Western ships were attacking Islamic ships in the Indian Ocean and destroying or
      seizing their cargoes. Western nations were establishing settlements in the East to hinder the
      commercial strength of Islam and spreading Christianity to limit the spread of the Islamic faith.
      Islamic states were attacked and under siege from the West. Western states were now more
      powerful as a result of their increased wealth and confidence and were better able to increase their
      attacks on Islam both in the East and in the Mediterranean region. The great influx of treasure from
      America increased the power of Spain which was a state anxious to attack Islam and spread
      Christianity. Western ships were better armed and were able to destroy Islamic fleets and
      settlements particularly in the east. Western colonies such as the Philippines gave them strong
      locations to continue their conquests and take over the spice trade.
                                            – 22 –              N12/3/HISTI/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The points that suggest that Islam was not affected by the explorations would include, but not be
limited to: the Ottoman Empire was still the most powerful state in Europe and was launching
attacks in central Europe, for example against Hungary and Austria, and would do so until the
seventeenth century. The impact of the West in the spice trade and the east was still limited as their
numbers were small. The Westerners did not launch a combined effort but fought amongst
themselves thus weakening their assault on Islam. Much of their efforts were in the Americas
which did not affect Islam directly. The wealth of the Ottoman Empire and its control of land trade
routes from the East were little affected by the West at this time.
