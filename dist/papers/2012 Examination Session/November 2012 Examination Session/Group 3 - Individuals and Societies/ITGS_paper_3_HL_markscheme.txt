Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

If candidates answer more than the prescribed number of questions:

• In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
  Disregard incorrect answers.

• In the case of a “describe” question, which asks for a certain number of facts e.g. “describe two kinds”,
  mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions, one description and
  one identification, or two identifications.

• In the case of an “explain” question, which asks for a specified number of explanations e.g. “explain
  two reasons”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two full explanations,
  one explanation, one partial explanation etc.

1.   The management of the Piedmonte Theatre Consortium (PTC) wants its website to
     be able to show short video clips of forthcoming productions. When a user tried
     to view one of these, the video failed to play and the following error message
     appeared.

     (a)   Outline why the video failed to play.                                                  [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • the video is not a Flash video
           • the Flash player plug-in is an old version
           • there are errors in the Flash script / ActionScript
           • there are errors in the swf file
           • there are errors in the FLV (Flash Video) file
           • the file is corrupt.

           Accept for one mark only: lack of appropriate codec/ plugin/ client-side software
           to play the video

           Do not accept : Lack of the client-side software “Adobe flash player”

           Award [1 mark] for each reason given up to a maximum of [2 marks].

     (b)   Describe one possible solution.                                                        [2 marks]

           Answers may include:
           • uninstall Flash player / install latest version of Flash player – this will ensure
             that it is unlikely that the problem is at the user end
           • upgrade the Flash Player plugin
           • debug Flash script / ActionScript–– there may be errors that prevent the file
             loading
           • correct the corrupted file on the server
           • refresh the page (if the file has been corrupted on transfer from the server, it
             may work on a second attempt)
           • implement a compatible video format by the PTC
           • install a code/ plugin/ client-software that can recognize the particular format.


     Award [1 mark] for each solution given up to a maximum of [2 marks].

2.   Both theatre companies have substantial amounts of data saved in various formats
     in their existing systems. This data includes information such as customer and
     member details and records of previous performances. All of this data has to be
     copied to the new system.

     Explain why the developers might encounter problems when transferring existing
     data to the new system.                                                        [6 marks]

     Answers may include:
     • the data stored may be duplicated / some entities may have the same name but have
       different properties
     • problems of accuracy and time when digitizing/scanning any legacy data which is to
       be included and is currently not in digital format
     • transfer medium failure/ power failure/network connectivity issues
     • fields may be of different data types/lengths
     • the data stored may be duplicated due to existing flat-file database
     • the properties/attributes/fields of the entities or tables may be different
     • the data may need to be “normalized” to avoid data redundancy
     • examples of how data, such as performances/dates may be in incompatible formats
     • methods of coding data will be different, e.g. codes for seat allocation / membership
       types etc.
     • the ETL (Extract Transform and Load) software may not be able to read the existing
       file format.
     • the existing file format may be unknown and would have to be reverse engineered
     • the character encoding/character set/code page/character map/codeset of the files
       may be different so extended characters (eg. accented letters) in text fields could be
       wrongly copied
     • file structures may be different / key fields may be different / may need to create new
       indexes
     • the new system may report relational integrity errors / dependencies may not be
       fulfilled.

     [1–2 marks]
     A limited response that indicates very little understanding of the topic or the reason is
     not clear.

     [3–4 marks]
     A reasonable description of the problems that may arise from data transfer.
     The answer may be unbalanced and lack appropriate reasoning at the lower end of
     the band.

     [5–6 marks]
     A clear, detailed and balanced explanation of data transfer with clear evidence of
     technical understanding.

3.   The PTC website needs to offer a range of functions which are easy to use,
     informative and enjoyable. It is also intended that it should function in a number
     of languages.

     To what extent is there a conflict between the site’s functionality and providing the
     site in many languages? You should make references to suitable sites that you
     have investigated.                                                                    [8 marks]

     Answers may include:
     • The best possible result would be to have all desirable features/functions available in
       all target languages
     • equality of access depends on the same functionality being available in multiple
       languages
     • there are time/cost constraints to consider in adding translations
     • there are many languages therefore pragmatic decisions have to be made about which
       to include as not all user requirements may be possible
     • each additional language may require a significant amount of development time if
       there are embedded media (videos may need subtitling etc or new videos may need
       to be created).
     • when information is changed it will have to be updated in a number of different
       language pages so there is much higher cost of maintenance required for a multi-
       lingual site
     • some languages have totally different constructions, making it impossible to have the
       same paradigm for the site’s design.
     • there may be more considerations involved than just translating text, (for example
       retaining the same meaning, or space limitations on the website for longer text)
     • some characters may not be rendered properly (this is less of a problem than
       previously – Unicode makes it more likely that characters will be rendered properly)
     • many people speak English or one of the main European languages so non-native
       speakers may still be able to use the site and not need a translation to their first
       language.

4.   Two prospective suppliers of the new system for the PTC have different
     approaches for developing the new system.
     • One has already supplied a ticketing system to a theatre company in Germany
       which it says can be modified to suit the needs of the two companies.
     • The other proposes to start from the beginning and develop a new system.

     With explicit references to systems that you have studied, evaluate the merits of
     these two approaches.                                                             [12 marks]

     Answers may include:
     The template/modified solution:
     • available more quickly
     • available more quickly
     • likely to be cheaper
     • likely to have more bugs removed
     • it has been more thoroughly user tested
     • feedback from the previous customer
     • support issues already developed
     • example systems/situations described.
     • certain legal issues may be a factor in weighing up the two options (especially if the
       existing software is copyright).
     • technologies used in the existing system may be outdated but it will be necessary to
       use them in the modified option, whereas a new development will allow the choice of
       the newest technologies, standards and protocols
     • a modified system may have unwanted functionality that cause confusion or security
       issues
     • may need technical staff not present or training the existing staff
     • documentation / Training materials already available.

     The new solution:
     • could be more explicitly tailored to the customer’s needs
     • PTC will have unique problems / better to design in special features from the start
       can use more modern development methodology
     • can adapt to user’s preferred platform
     • more costly and time consuming
     • many new systems developments fail to reach their completion, but altering an
       existing piece of software gives more guarantee that the result will be functional.

     N.B. Many of these points can be expressed in a reverse manner.
