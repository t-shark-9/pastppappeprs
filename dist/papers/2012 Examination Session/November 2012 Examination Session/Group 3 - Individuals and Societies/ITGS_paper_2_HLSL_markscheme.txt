Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate range
of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure
to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
  the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
  when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
  should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
  necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
  they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
  piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
  that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

• Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
  if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should award
  the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
  acceptable.

• Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
  the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
  a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
  the work being assessed.

• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
  attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
  low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
  other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will produce
  any particular distribution of marks.

• The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

                                     Theme: Home and leisure

Criterion A — The issue and stakeholder(s)                                                    [4 marks]

1.   (a)   Describe one social/ethical concern related to the IT system in the article.

           Social/ethical concerns may include the following:
           • loss of privacy due to revealing location using geotagged information or from
             the content of photo(s)
           • loss of anonymity due to identifying the identity of the person through the
             geotagged information and the content of the photo(s)
           • surveillance resulting from observing the patterns of behaviour determined
             from geotagged photos (e.g. always attending certain events at specific times)
           • crimes resulting from cellphone users uploading geotagged photos to social
             networking sites. Examples include:
                  § stalking or other criminal activity related to persons: GPS-enabled
                      cellphones allow date, time and geotagging to locate people
                  § theft: geotagged photos may contain the location of valuable items
           • security concern such as knowing that certain SNS accounts (this could be
             famous or wealthy people) will contain geotagged photos of people and
             locations to build a picture of their movements.

(b)   Describe the relationship of one primary stakeholder to the IT system in the article.

      Primary stakeholders may include the following:
      • cellphone user(s) who upload geotagged photos to a social networking site
      • criminals (i.e. stalkers, cyberbullies, thieves) who commit crimes using
         information obtained from cellphone users’ geotagged photos that are uploaded
         to social networking sites
      • law enforcement officers who need to catch persons who use information from
         geotagged photos to commit crimes
      • persons who work for social networking sites and are responsible for the
         IT systems that allow photos to be uploaded (i.e. security, display of geotagged
         information, policies)
      • persons responsible for developing cellphone features which enable the taking
         of geotagged photos and the uploading of geotagged photos to social
         networking sites.

2.   (a)   Describe, step by step how the IT system works.
           IT system: using cell/mobile phones, geotagging and social networking sites.

           Answers provided in the article include the following:
           • cellphone user takes a photo with their cellphone with geotagging enabled
           • cellphone connects with the social networking site, e.g. Twitter
           • user goes to the photo and clicks upload the photo to the user’s social
             networking account, i.e. Twitter, Flickr, Craigslist
           • criminal downloads the geotagged photo and extracts the date, time and
             geotagged data (latitude and longitude) using either special software or
             browser plug-in
           • geotag data is attached invisibly to photos
           • criminal uses mapping software to locate where the photo was taken and the
             location of the user

           Answers with additional information to that in the article may include the
           following:
           • user inputs user name and password or allows continuous login from the
              cellphone
           • user logs out of the Twitter account if they do not wish to keep an automatic
              login
           • some cellphones prompt if the user wants to use GPS information when taking
              a photo
           • GPS can be disabled on some cellphones
           • how GPS data is collected and attached to the photos – satellites, triangulation
           • some cellphones have apps/services that allow an automatic connection/upload
           • some social networking sites prompt the user if they would like to include GPS
              information when they post a photo, e.g. Facebook
           • cellphone user can add message with the photo in the social networking site
           • criminals can search for patterns in the activities of the cellphone user through
              the geotagged photos that are posted (i.e. times that they do specific activities
              each day or week or month), places that they visit regularly
           • criminals can use code to extract additional information from geotagged photos
              and make relationships (e.g. being away from home or in a particular location
              or with particular persons)
           • can extract information using metadata extraction tool (jpeg geographical info
              is embedded in the metadata) or using a metadata removal tool to delete data
              before publishing them (internet)
           • user has WiFi or 3G or 4G Internet connection to automatically upload or
              manually upload images to social media
           • some websites display the location of the photo based on the geotag data
           • photos are stored on the SNS servers

(b)    Explain the relationship between the IT system and the social/ethical concern
       described in Criterion A.

       Candidates are expected to explain the connection between the concern in
       Criterion A and the relevant part and use of the IT system. Candidates are
       expected to make reference to relevant stakeholders, information technologies,
       data and processes. Candidates will be expected to refer to “how the IT system
       works” using appropriate IT terminology.

       Answers may include the following:
       Cellphone users are not aware that other persons can use the information that
       they are posting with geotagged photos:
       • unaware that they are sending invisible information when they send photos
          from their cellphones (i.e. geotagging, date, time, content information which
          can be combined with the name of their account and any associated messages)
       • unaware of the technologies that they are using i.e. features of their cellphones,
          features on the social networking site that they are using
       • unaware of the range of crimes that can result from analysing online
          information contained in photos (i.e. cyberbullying, stalking, theft).

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                          [8 marks]

3.   Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders.

     A range of impacts needs to be provided. The results of the impacts on stakeholders
     need to be described, refer to a range of stakeholders and include positive and negative
     impacts. The impacts need to be analysed and evaluated and may include the following:

     Cellphone users are not aware of the features that are included in their cellphones and
     how they are used (i.e. could be helpful in some situations):
     • cellphones are pre-set with GPS turned on (i.e. to determine location of the cellphone
       in case of an emergency) and users may not know it
     • user may not know how to use the GPS related programs on their phone in
       emergency situations or that they even exist
     • user may not know that invisible data is attached to photos (i.e. date, time and
       geotagging) which could be helpful (e.g. emergency situations, identifying the
       location and date of a family photo)
     • users need to opt-out of GPS and/or geotagging

     Cellphone users are not careful when taking and posting geotagged photos and include
     content information that can lead to crimes:
     • famous sites or information that locates the user’s location or the location of family
       members or friends
     • ownership of valuable possessions that could lead to theft
     • adding messages to posted photos that provide additional information about the
       location of the photo or being away from home
     • the content of the photo could contain additional information about the location
       (i.e. entrances to homes, security systems used in the home)

     Cellphone users may take photos that indicate that the cellphone user is not at home, but
     others in the house could be at risk during a break-in or theft.

     Criminals can easily extract date, time, and geotagging information from photos:
     • create a planned list of valuable items that they want to steal from a range of
       locations in the house taken from various photos
     • formulate an overview of the routine activities of a person for the purpose of stalking
       or other crime targeted against the person
     • gain information about a person for the purpose of cyberbullying
     • gain information about a person for stalking and other criminal purposes

     Social networking site administrators have an ethical responsibility to:
     • inform cellphone users when they are uploading photos with geotagging
     • not allow messages that can be commonly searched for (i.e. on vacation, on holiday,
       be back )
     • provide an opt-in feature for including geotags when uploading photos
                                              –9–              N12/3/ITGSX/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M




Cellphone manufacturers have a responsibility for:
• informing cellphone users when GPS systems are being used
• providing an opt-in for using geotagging feature
• providing information how to turn-off geotagging

Impact for various situations:
Positive impacts - some are included above.

• easy to find photos in your collection, just find a place on the map and applications
  like iPhoto, Picasa will show you all the pictures taken there
• hence easy to organise photos for times and place
• easy to find when and where a photo was taken
• friends can find out exactly where to go if need or want to
• police and other investigators can use geotags as evidence of location and time
• helpful in emergency situations, identifying the location and date of a family photo
• if you do want friends and relatives to see where you are at any one time, e.g. if on a
  holiday and uploading your holiday photos
• parents (if befriended on SNS) can see the location of their children through the
  posted photos
• to help track down missing persons – can reveal where last seen
• could be used to prove that you were in a certain location and time e.g. police
  enquiries
• geotagging and date/time on photos can help keep information about photos available
  for the future e.g. looking back at old family albums – no more arguments about
  where or when as it is in the file information
• help validate photos taken for the news

Negative impacts for Privacy
Citizens may lose their privacy, because citizens are taking photos and are not aware
that the geo data is being saved with the photo. This impacts the person taking the
photo in a negative way-

• their own location when and where the photo was being taken is revealed to anyone
  on the social networking site and this could be misused
• e.g. stalkers, ‘friends’ on the SNS can build a picture of your personal life of where
  you went and with who
• information in the background may be used, to reveal, who you were with, or some
  valuables where you are
• if you are someone where you should not be or when you should be, this could be
  shared e.g. taking a sick day at work and being posted in a coffee shop
• subject of cyberbulling (mentioned in article)
• could put your other family members at risk


If the evaluation does not provide any additional information to that in the article, the
candidate will be awarded a maximum of [2 marks].

4.   Evaluate one possible solution that addresses at least one problem identified in
     Criterion C.

     Answers may include the following. A multi-part solution is allowed if it enfolds
       interlinked parts of a single problem, e.g. various ways of ensuring security, or
       education of users:

     Solutions to the problem of cellphone users sending geotagged photos from a cellphone:
     • cellphone users can turn off the GPS capability on their cellphones so that it is not
        sent with the photo to the social networking site (i.e. check the cellphone manual on
        how to do this, use a search engine to find forums that provide this information,
        go back to the store where the cellphone was purchased for instructions)
     • cellphone users can turn the GPS capability on when they wish to take photos that
        will be not uploaded to social networking sites
     • cellphones need to send an opt-in alert whenever the GPS system is turned on and the
        user has selected to use the camera
     • cellphone uses turn off the geotagging feature of the camera (but can leave GPS
        running)

     Solutions to the problem of displaying and accessing geotagging information on a
     social networking site:
     • social networking administrators need to inform cellphone users in their policies
        about the risks of uploading geotagged photos
     • cellphone users need to be provided with an opt-in option whenever they upload a
        geotagged photo
     • social networking administrators need to be able to monitor when someone is
        running scripts on their site (i.e. searching for geotagged photos with specific text
        associated with the photos)
     • privacy settings in SNS don’t specifically impact on geotagging, but can restrict who
        can access the geotagged photos
     • SNS sites allows editing or deleting meta data
     • possible future solution: encrypt geotag data before inserting into photo and use
        special program to decrypt with password access - does not seem to be available yet,
        and how it is decrypted needs to be explained

     Solutions to making cellphone users aware of the risks of sending photos to a social
     networking site from a cellphone:
     • cellphone manufacturers need to include warnings with cellphones that include GPS
        technology and cameras
     • parents and teachers (i.e. school parent associations) need to inform students about
        the risks of taking / posting geotagged photos on social networking sites (i.e. if they
        share a geotagged photo with friends, it could be posted even if they do not post it
        themselves, kinds of criminal activity, placing family and friends at risk)
     • law enforcement agencies need to make cellphone users aware of the risks involved
        in posting geotagged photos to social media sites (i.e. special television programs,
        radio broadcasts news articles in local newspapers)
