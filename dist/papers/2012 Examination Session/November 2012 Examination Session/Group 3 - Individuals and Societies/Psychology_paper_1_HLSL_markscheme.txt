                                              SECTION A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Explain how one principle of the biological level of analysis may be demonstrated
     in one empirical study or theory.                                                 [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of an
     appropriate principle and show how this is clearly demonstrated in a study or theory
     relevant to the biological level of analysis.

     Acceptable principles include, but are not limited to:
      behaviour can be inherited
      animal research may increase our understanding of human behaviour
      cognitions, emotions and behaviours are products of the anatomy and physiology of
       our nervous and endocrine systems.

     After briefly outlining the principle and giving a brief summary of one study or theory,
     candidates should make an explicit link between the research and the principle.

     If a response outlines more than one principle, marks should be awarded only to the first.

     If a response includes more than one study or theory, marks should be awarded only to
     the first.

     If a candidate only outlines a principle without any reference to a study, apply the
     markbands up to a maximum of [4 marks].

     If a candidate only describes a study, apply the markbands up to a maximum of
     [3 marks].

     0              The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

     1 to 3         There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
                    understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
                    question.

     4 to 6         The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
                    accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively addressed
                    or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the question.

     7 to 8         The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
                    the demands of the command term. The response is supported by
                    appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of research.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Explain how one biological factor may affect one cognitive process.                          [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of the
     relationship between a specific biological factor and a particular cognitive process, such
     as memory, perception, attention or language.

     Examples of biological factors affecting a cognitive process could include:
      the role of Wernicke’s or Broca’s areas in the understanding and production of
       language
      the role of the amygdala in the storage of emotional memories
      how damage to the hippocampus often leads to both retrograde and anterograde
       amnesia
      the effect of sleep deprivation on a number of cognitive processes, such as memory,
       attention and time perception
      the effect of aging on episodic, semantic and procedural memories
      the role of feature detector cells in visual perception.

     If a response explains more than one biological factor or cognitive process, marks
     should be awarded only to the first.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   Distinguish between the concepts of “emic” and “etic”.                                       [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “distinguish” requires candidates to make clear the differences
     between the two concepts.

     “Etic” and “emic” refer to approaches to studying the role of culture on behaviour.
     Often the terms are also used to describe a piece of research which either is used to
     support the universality of a behaviour (etic) or the fact that it is culturally specific
     (emic). Either interpretation is valid. If the response uses examples to support the
     argument, the link to either the etic or emic concept should be clear.

     Differences could include:
      etic approaches compare cultures; emic approaches describe or explain behaviours in
        a single culture
      etic approaches test hypotheses; emic approaches generate hypotheses
      in etic approaches, the researcher acts as a non-participant observer; in emic
        approaches, the researcher seeks the assistance of members of the community
      etic approaches attempt to find universal explanations of behaviour; emic approaches
        are usually focused on issues particular to a defined culture or community.

     Candidates are likely to include research and/or examples of the concepts for marks in
     the higher markbands but this is not required.

     If a candidate only describes both concepts without explicitly addressing the differences
     between them, apply the markbands up to a maximum of [6 marks].

     Candidates may address a smaller number of differences in order to demonstrate depth
     of knowledge, or may address a larger number of differences in order to demonstrate
     breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

A — Knowledge and comprehension

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of
              marginal relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used
              in the response.

4 to 6        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
              question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in the
              response.

7 to 9        The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding
              relevant to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in
              support of the response.


B — Evidence of critical thinking: application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer goes beyond description but evidence of critical thinking is not
              linked to the requirements of the question.

4 to 6        The answer offers appropriate but limited evidence of critical thinking or offers
              evidence of critical thinking that is only implicitly linked to the requirements of
              the question.

7 to 9        The answer integrates relevant and explicit evidence of critical thinking in
              response to the question.


C — Organization

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        The answer is organized or focused on the question. However, this is not
              sustained throughout the response.

3 to 4        The answer is well organized, well developed and focused on the question.

                                            SECTION B

4.   With reference to psychological research (theories and/or studies), to what extent
     does genetic inheritance influence behaviour?                                            [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “to what extent” requires the candidate to consider the merits or
     otherwise of an argument regarding the influence of genetics on behaviour.

     Candidates may choose a single behaviour (such as intelligence, depression or
     aggression) and look at the strengths and limitations of genetic evidence, or they may
     choose to take a more holistic approach and look at the nature/nurture argument – that
     is, relevant comparison to cognitive or sociocultural explanations. Candidates should
     demonstrate understanding that most behaviours are the result of an interaction of
     biological and non-biological factors.

     Candidates may consider a smaller number of theories and/or studies in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge, or may consider a larger number of theories and/or
     studies to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

5.   With reference to relevant studies, discuss how and why two particular research
     methods (for example, experiments, case studies, interviews, observations) are used
     at the cognitive level of analysis.                                                 [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to give a considered review of the
     reasons for how and why two particular methods are used in studies at the cognitive
     level of analysis. One or more studies can be used to exemplify each method.

     Discussion about “how” the method is used might refer to key features of the method as
     well as how the method was used in specific research. For example, experimental
     studies may identify the sampling and allocation procedures, the independent and
     dependent variables, and the way in which extraneous variables were controlled.

     Discussion about “why” the method is used might refer to the appropriateness of the
     method for the aim, issues of validity and reliability, sample choice and size, ease and
     cost of the procedure, and the generalizability of findings. Candidates may address the
     strengths of the method as well as how it reflects the principles of the cognitive level of
     analysis, i.e. candidates could make clear how the selected research methods underpin
     one or more principles of the level of analysis.

     If the candidate addresses only the “how” or only the “why”, then marks in the top
     markbands should not be awarded for the assessment criteria.

     If a candidate discusses only one research method, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [11 marks].

     If a candidate discusses more than two research methods, credit should be given only to
     the first two discussions.

6.   Discuss ethical considerations related to research studies at the sociocultural level
     of analysis.                                                                          [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review of ethical
     considerations related to specific research studies.

     There are a number of ethical considerations related to research studies at the
     sociocultural level of analysis which may be discussed. These include, but are not
     limited to:
      deception
      protection from physical or mental harm
      briefing and debriefing
      right to withdraw from a study
      informed consent
      anonymity
      confidentiality.

     Ethical considerations may be positive (what guidelines were followed) or negative
     (what guidelines were not followed).

     Discussion of ethical considerations could discuss why deception is used, the difficulties
     of ensuring confidentiality in social psychology research and the role of informed
     consent when studying groups.

     Responses may discuss a smaller number of ethical considerations in order to
     demonstrate depth of knowledge or may discuss a larger number of ethical
     considerations in order to demonstrate breadth of knowledge. Both approaches are
     equally acceptable.

     Responses may discuss a smaller number of studies in order to demonstrate depth of
     knowledge or may discuss a larger number of studies in order to demonstrate breadth of
     knowledge. Both approaches are equally acceptable.

     If a candidate discusses ethical considerations, but does not relate them to research
     studies from the sociocultural level of analysis, apply the markbands up to a maximum
     of [11 marks].
