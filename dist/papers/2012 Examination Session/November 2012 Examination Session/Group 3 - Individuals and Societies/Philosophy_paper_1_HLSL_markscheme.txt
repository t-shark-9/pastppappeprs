                                                 SECTION A

Core Theme: What is a human being?

1.   Passage from the Popul-Vuh

     This passage might encourage a reflection on the extent to which the relation with an origin or creator is a
     central distinctive feature of the human condition. Furthermore the stimulus opens a wide spectrum of issues
     related to human nature, human knowledge and the future of humanity.

     Key Points
     • Existentialism
     • Non-Western approaches to the nature and origin of humans
     • Nihilism
     • Theism
     • Humanism
     • Determinism
     • Gender issues in accounts of the human condition, including politics of relationships (e.g. reference to
       “wives”)
     • The scientific view regarding the origin of humans
     • Humans as imperfect beings
     • Post-modern interpretations of the human condition
     • An approach to society that reflects a “worldview” (not necessarily drawing on a classical philosophical
       school), e.g. cultural and local traditions
     • Religious approaches to the nature and purpose of being human

     Discussion
     • Pessimism and optimism regarding the origin and destination of humanity
     • Perhaps life has no sense. Does this devalue living and make life pointless?
     • Is it a common human activity to search for the meaning of life?
     • The issues of freedom and responsibility for our own existence
     • Can humans be in charge of their own destiny? Is it possible that all aspects of life are predetermined?
     • To what extent do we as human beings need narrations about ourselves?
     • Is there any limit to the variety of interpretations a person might create?
     • How central is gender to an understanding of what it is to be human?
     • Is living one’s life a creative activity?
     • Individual action and destiny vs. collective action and destiny
     • Based upon our nature as humans, will we always know and understand the world and our human
        condition in an imperfect manner?
     • Is the notion of a Higher Being necessary for an account of meaning in the human condition?
     • The relationship between physical attributes and other facilities like speech, strength, and energy in an
        account of the nature of human beings
                                                       –7–                 N12/3/PHILO/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   Picture

     This picture invites an exploration of the human condition with regard to the construction of places in which
     to live, our bodily nature, living in societies, and our relationship with nature and its consequences.
     Moreover, it opens possibilities for discussion of aspects related to human creativity starting with its material
     dimensions, but also as a social and collective activity. It might also raise concerns regarding our
     relationship with the environment in contemporary societies.

     Key Points
     • Interpretations of the human condition: biological and social necessities; social conditioning
     • The spatial dimension of our lives and intersubjectivity
     • For some humans, life takes place “between earth and sky”
     • Architecture and engineering as means of bringing a landscape into being
     • Non-Western approaches to nature and our relation to it
     • Basic emotions related to living in highly populated cities
     • Existentialism
     • Approaches to space, architecture, relation to nature that reflect a “worldview”, not necessarily drawing
       on a classical philosophical school, e.g. artistic or cultural perspectives
     • Human beings in the present world; mass societies, the individual and the collective
     • Artistic, social, political implications of technology in relation to the human condition
     • Ideas of the state of nature and civilization
     • Ways of inhabiting and living in urban and rural environments and their impact on the human condition
     • The relationship between the individual and society
     • The loss of individuality, alienation, isolation

     Discussion
     • Construction and inhabitation as the transformation or manipulation of nature (the existing physical,
        material, and biological environments) to satisfy human needs and goals
     • Are we imprisoned by technological development?
     • How do modern societies relate to nature?
     • Environmental pollution as a result of human action
     • The degrees and modes in which the architectural organization of our daily life might affect our lives and
        our understanding of ourselves
     • Does pollution obscure our possibilities of living a different, better human life?
     • The inevitability of human intervention in nature
     • Is environmental pollution directly linked to, or the result of, specific social, political, economic systems?
     • Do contemporary living spaces threaten individuality? How? Why?
     • How can we understand our personal identity in a mass society?
     • Does the planning of cities reflect the nature of human beings as individuals? E.g. Plato
     • Does increasing urbanization suggest human beings are more at home as social animals in community
        than as individuals?

Optional Theme 1: Grounds of epistemology

3.   Evaluate the claim that reason is the only reliable source of knowledge.

     • The elimination of the senses as a source of knowledge
     • The elimination of revelation as a source of knowledge
     • The consistency of knowledge claims based on reason
     • A priori knowledge and certainty
     • The link between reason and intuition; just “knowing” and the possession of “clear and distinct ideas”
     • Knowledge by definition
     • Self-evident truths
     • The limits of reason in developing new knowledge
     • Reason and analytic truths
     • Necessary truths and contingent truths
     • Cultural variations in approaches to the exclusive reliance on reason
     • The relationship of reason to knowledge in the realms of morality and aesthetics
     • The relationship between reason and metaphysics, e.g. ontological proofs
     • The relationship of reason to absolutism and relativism

4.   Evaluate the claim that we reliably encounter the physical world as it really is.

     This question invites an evaluation of various views on how we have any knowledge of the physical world
     and the associated problems related to these knowledge claims.

     Key Points
     • Problems of perception; assessing encounters with the physical world
     • Is the world constructed by our minds or independent of us?
     • Do we know ourselves to be part of the physical world?
     • Qualities of the physical world that might be mind-constructed; the difference between primary and
       secondary qualities, representative theories of reality
     • Abstract qualities such as beauty that might be dependent on the perceiver and not absolute/fixed in
       nature
     • Naïve realism and the problem of illusion
     • Causal theory; appearance as a sign of reality; the “real” can be directly encountered
     • Idealist theories; only the ideas in our mind or those in the mind of God are real
     • Phenomenalism and a world of representations
     • Strong and weak realism; the physical world does exist but is unknowable; internal realism,
       e.g. perspectivalism
     • The status of reality in sceptical empiricism
     • Constructive conceptual frameworks or linguistic frameworks that establish a “world” that is public and
       agreed upon
     • Nominalism; conceptualism; resemblance and representation
     • The nature of matter
     • Scepticism, relativism
     • Transcendental idealism; a belief that there are real objects and we consciously apply a priori categories
       to our sensory information to construct a real world
     • The relationship of sense-data to the need to verify our claims about a physical world

     Discussion
     • Can there be any certain knowledge of the physical world?
     • How far can we be sure that our mental constructs approximate the physical world?
     • What evidence is there that the physical world behaves according to laws?
     • If we categorize the physical world, how do we know which categories are appropriate?
     • Does scepticism have to produce a relativistic view of the world?
     • Is it possible for sense-data to enable the construction of a consistent physical world given the limitations
        of the sense organs?
     • Does language presuppose an agreed public world that we all encounter?
     • If we all have different conceptual frameworks how can we have the same physical world? If we all have
        the same conceptual framework have we constructed it?
     • Could conceptual frameworks be culturally biased? Could different cultures have constructed different
        physical worlds?
     • If the common sense view of naïve realism is difficult to sustain, why is it the common sense view?

     and the wider environment.

     Key Points
     • The differences between humans and non-humans
     • Conscious choice making as a distinguishing human feature
     • The differences between sentient and non-sentient entities

     • Can liberty and integrity be attributed to non-humans?
     • Do beings who cannot make moral decisions warrant moral consideration? Do entities that cannot make
        moral decisions warrant moral consideration?
     • The recognition by some non-Western cultures of moral obligations towards non-humans
     • How does the protection of human life outweigh the protection of lives of other creatures?
     • On what basis might a hierarchy of non-human life forms establish the limits of moral obligations?

6.   Evaluate the claim that moral progress is possible.

     This question seeks an evaluation of the idea that there could be such a thing as moral progress.

     Key Points
     • The distinction between moral progress and making judgments of moral progress
     • The nature of moral progress; treatment of others, increasing humaneness, increasing happiness,
       increasing awareness
     • Does the development of rational thought lead to moral progress?
     • Changes in moral understanding over time
     • The impact of culture on moral judgments
     • Greater information creating the possibility of increased levels of empathy with possible effects on moral
       understanding

     • Values as more than feelings and choices
     • Conflicts with self-interest theories of ethics
     • Applications of categorical imperatives

     Discussion
     • Is the idea of moral improvement relativistic? Does it deny the possibility of moral progress?
     • Is rational behaviour always moral?
     • Does increased information about consequences lead to moral progress?
     • Does a diversity of moral values across cultures limit progress?
     • Is it possible that some cultures are more advanced morally? What measures might exist to draw this
        conclusion? Might the idea that some cultures are more advanced morally be abused?
     • How far is simple personal approval an indicator of progress and improvement in morals?
     • Are moral actions purely relative? Are they dependent upon the individual and the circumstances? If so,

Optional Theme 3: Philosophy of religion

7.   To what extent is the distinction between moral evil and natural evil justifiable?

     This question invites an evaluation of the success or otherwise of the distinction often made between moral
     evil and natural evil. Answers might challenge the assumption that such a distinction even exists.

     Key Points
     • The usual distinction between types of evil: natural evil, which is not the product of human agency, and
       moral evil, which is the product of human agency
     • Inclement weather that causes crop failure and widespread starvation is an example of causal phenomena
       usually described as natural evil. Should such events be considered evils as against bads?
     • Moral evil is characterized as a harm inflicted on sentient beings, e.g. murder, torture, enslavement,
       prolonged humiliation
     • The distinction between natural evil and moral evil is not to be taken too sharply because human beings
       may act as natural causes, e.g. as carriers of diseases. Moreover, evil that results from natural causation
       may deserve moral condemnation, when those responsible failed to prevent it
     • The idea of human nature. In moral discourse, choices or actions may be qualified as “inhuman”,
       “unnaturally cruel”, or “morally unreasonable”. In political discourse, proposals, policies or conduct may
       be described as violations of “human rights”. In international law, actions may be described as “crimes
       against humanity”. Do these ideas have any connection with the characterization of evils?
     • Interpretations of moral evil, e.g. as a deviation from the good, as illusory, as a necessary contrast for the
       existence of the good
     • The idea that moral evil does exist, and it is the result of common human vices

     Discussion
     • God and the existence of evil
     • Is it legitimate to speak of “natural” evil? Is it not the case that evil entails will?
     • If one argues that there is a human nature or a natural law, the concept of natural evil might be seen from
        quite a different angle
     • Evil and non-theistic religious traditions
     • Non-Western perspectives on evil
     • The extent to which the notion of evil depends on a religious approach to human life
     • Is it useful to distinguish between evil and suffering?
     • The denial of the existence of evil in monistic traditions
     • Possible explanations for the existence of evil from soul-making to soul-deciding perspectives

8.     To what extent might atheism be justified by rational argumentation?

       The question asks for a discussion of reasons for atheism. Furthermore it also allows for a critical analysis of
       atheism.

       Key Points
       • Atheism: the affirmation of the non-existence of God or gods; it suggests positive disbelief
       • An atheist as anyone who denies the existence of any sort of divine reality
       • The idea of God presented by the monotheistic religions as a purely spiritual, supernatural being who is
         perfectly good, all-powerful, the all-knowing creator of everything, as the context for atheism
       • To explain that the traditional arguments for the existence of God are inadequate would be required as
         part of a rational justification of atheism
       • Classical arguments for the existence of God: the cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments
       • Atheistic arguments for the non-existence of God: the argument from evil and suffering
       • Atheists have contended that the idea of God is incoherent
       • The growing power of science in explaining the origins and nature of the world
       • The role of free will in supporting and denying the existence of God
       • Subjectivist accounts of religious belief (e.g. within existentialist traditions)

       Discussion
       • Since many different gods have been objects of belief, might one be an atheist with respect to one god
          while believing in the existence of some other god?
       • The issue of pluralism and reasons for rejecting belief in God or gods
       • The validity and soundness of arguments for atheism
       • Should a distinction be drawn between criticizing the idea of God and criticizing aspects of religions,
          no matter how important these might be?
       • Does the existence of evil provide a moral justification for disbelief in God? Can such moral
          justifications be considered rational arguments?
       • Is it possible to demonstrate the non-existence of anything?
       • Statements purportedly about God, including the statement, “God does not exist”, are simply cognitively
          meaningless
       • Comparison between Western and non-Western reasons for atheism
       • The struggle between atheism and theism; the theistic insistence on an agential explanation of various
          natural phenomena, including the existence of the universe
       • The development of natural sciences and critical social theories and their impact on belief in God
       • How has neuro-theology and neuro-philosophy impacted on both theism and atheism?
       • The distinction between agnosticism and atheism; the distinction between atheism and anti-theism

Optional Theme 4: Philosophy of art

9.   Evaluate the claim that the fundamental criterion by which works of art should be judged is the
     contribution they make to society.

     This question asks for an evaluation of one of the criteria by means of which art may be judged. It allows for
     an evaluation of the relationship between art and the society in which the art is produced. It also allows for
     an evaluation of the roles other criteria might play in the evaluation of art in society.

     Key Points
     • What artists do cannot be seen in isolation from the society in which they work
     • Art functions for social and political utility
     • Art is generally received and judged according to a society’s ethos
     • Art exists, is used, and is evaluated in relation to the religion(s), moral values, ideologies, scientific
       perspectives and philosophies operative in a society
     • Art impacts upon and is impacted by the personal and social aspects of a society and its members; art as a
       cause of change
     • Art contributes to the sense of unity and the feeling of community in a society
     • Marxists see the value of art in its function to serve the revolution by reflecting socio-economic laws
       which underpin class struggle
     • Art as propaganda and manifestation of ideology
     • Art promotes bourgeois and decadent values and perspectives
     • Art for art’s sake vs. art as mouthpiece for societal norms
     • Art as a political tool; art as power; art as a moral force
     • Art and inspiration

     Discussion
     • Must art have a function?
     • Is art useful?
     • Does art ever have a function over and above that of being the object of aesthetic experience?
     • Should art contribute to national or societal identity?
     • Should art serve society? If so, does this entail censorship and control?
     • Should art support ideologies and/or power structures? If so, how and when?
     • Under what conditions, if any, can art maintain independence from the society in which it is produced?
     • Is one of the contributions of art to society that of promoting progress and development? Change?
        Revolution?
     • Should art contribute to society by making its ethos and values more understandable?
     • Should art contribute to the improvement and efficiency of the material aspects of a society?
     • Should art contribute to societies around the world in similar fashions?
     • Should art be judged as being separate from, and contributing to, society?
     • Is there an epistemic distance in properly appreciating art?

10.   To what extent is the imitation of reality the essential function of visual art?

      This question asks for an assessment of one of the essential aspects of visual art. This might include an
      assessment of the relationship between a work of visual art and objective reality. It allows for comments on
      the interpretation of visual art and on the various ways in which visual art can operate or function in a society
      or culture.

      Key Points
      • Visual art does not have only one purpose or function
      • Visual art involves some form of imitation
      • Platonic view of art as imitation: copies of copies where art is doubly removed from true reality,
        e.g. mimesis
      • Aristotelian view of art as imitation: art as the representative appeal to real life via the mind and emotions
      • Neo-Platonic view of art as imitation, e.g. fine art invites and involves the contemplation of divine ideas
      • Renaissance view of artists reproducing ideals and abstract notions in visual form of, for example,
        sculpture and painting
      • Imitation in the visual arts vs. imitation in music, literature, performing arts etc.
      • Imitation as common characteristic vs. imitation as criterion of value vs. imitation as prime function
      • Imitation as convincing illusion: trompe l’oeil
      • Imitation requires a recognition of resemblance and an appreciation of conventions
      • Imitation in art: seeing as vs. seeing in
      • Imitation and imagination: combining the sensory, rational and emotive operations of the viewer
      • Imitation and emotive and non-cognitive aspects of the aesthetic experience
      • Does art construct “reality” rather than copy or describe it?

      Discussion
      • Should visual art imitate or represent reality? Can it do this? To what extent?
      • Should visual art imitate or represent invisible realities, for example, love?
      • Should visual art redefine reality through its representation of it? Can it do that if reality is objective?
      • Are all works of visual art imitative? Should they be? Why or why not?
      • Is artistic imitation or representation a matter of convention?
      • Is what is imitated in visual art limited to what is received from sense perception?
      • What is the aesthetic value of visual art if it is the static imitation or representation of reality?
      • Are the imitative or representational aspects of visual art the same across cultures? Multicultural views of
         visual art
      • Might a work of visual art be equally successful in imitation, expression, execution and purpose?
      • To what extent does inspiration play a role in imitation and representation in visual art?
      • Installation art

Optional Theme 5: Political philosophy

11.   Evaluate the claim that the citizen has a duty to obey the state.

      This question asks for an evaluation of the obligations a citizen has with regard to the state of which he or
      she is a citizen. The question invites an analysis of the notions of the state and its authority over its citizens
      as well as an exploration of the notion of citizenship. An evaluation of the notions of law and legal
      obligation might be included.

      Key Points
      • The notion of citizenship and civic responsibilities
      • The state as sovereign authority: the right of action to issue orders; the right to have the orders obeyed
      • Citizens have prudential obligation: coercive power of the state and the fear of punishment
      • Citizens have obligations emerging from a sense of moral duty
      • Prudential obligation highlights self-concern and strategic reasoning
      • Moral obligation highlights good citizenship and virtuous character
      • Moral and prudential obligation rest on freedom of choice and civic responsibility
      • Social contract theories: duty to obey laws based upon implicit promise
      • Contract of citizenship: acceptance of obligations in exchange for benefits
      • Contract of community: relinquishing of individualism for communal protection by law
      • Contract of government: relinquishing of informal community for organized governmental protection by
        law
      • Theories of consent: collective consent legitimizes civil obligation of all
      • Theories of general will: laws are obeyed since they represent the will of all
      • Theories of justice: obey laws since they provide for equitable distribution of all benefits and burdens
      • Social theories, e.g. Hobbes, Rousseau

      Discussion
      • Does citizenship imply obligations? Why? How?
      • To what extent can a state claim authority over its citizens?
      • Does civil responsibility give rise to moral obligations?
      • Under what conditions ought a citizen choose to disobey the laws of a state?
      • Can there be conditions in which a citizen has no choice but to obey the laws of a state?
      • What recourse does a citizen have if the laws of a state interfere with the rights and privileges of good
         citizenship?
      • Do social contract theories justify the force of law in a state?
      • The notions of citizenship, civil obedience and disobedience in different cultures
      • How do the notions of citizenship, the state and obedience to laws operate in a global context?

      external powers and with final authority over all citizens.” Discuss and evaluate.

      This question asks for a discussion and evaluation of the notion of sovereignty and its relation to territorial
      integrity, political and legal authority and the supremacy and independence of the state amongst, and in
      relation to, other states.

      Key Points
      • Sovereignty as the highest power in a political hierarchy and the obligation of obedience
      • Sovereignty as the final or ultimate power in a political system
      • Sovereignty and the quality of generality over all actions of a group
      • Sovereignty as the highest competence in all legislative, executive and judicial matters

      • Sovereignty and the promotion of the interests of the state
      • Sovereignty and territoriality: geographic integrity vs. expansionist policies
      • Absolute vs. non-absolute sovereignty
      • Internal vs. external sovereignty; internal respect vs. external recognition
      • De jure and de facto notions of sovereignty
      • Sovereignty and the Treaty of Westphalia

      Discussion
      • Is sovereignty still a relevant political notion in the contemporary political climate?
      • Should international law apply to individual sovereign nations?
      • Can sovereignty be understood in a limited manner? E.g. the European Union
      • Should sovereignty stand in the way of notions of civil, political and human rights?
      • Can smaller political groups and minorities survive the power structures of a sovereign state?
      • Can sovereignty operate in a democratic state? How?
      • Does the sovereignty of a state override the sovereignty of political institutions within the state?
      • Should sovereignty be redefined in an international and/or global political context?
      • Can political sovereignty ever belong to the people rather than to the executive?
      • What political arrangement could allow sovereign states to maintain internal and external sovereignty in a
         peaceful manner?
      • Do citizens owe full allegiance and obedience to the sovereign power of their state?

Optional Theme 6: Non-Western traditions and perspectives

13.   With reference to one or more of the non-Western traditions and perspectives you have studied,
      explain and discuss the philosophical understanding of the individual.

      This question invites an explanation and discussion of one of the basic understandings at the heart of
      different non-Western traditions and perspectives. The responses can investigate both the ontological
      approaches to the individual and the possible ethical and societal perspectives that arise.

      Key Points
      • The relation of the self to the notion of the individual; some perspectives denying self while
        acknowledging the existence of the individual
      • The relation of individuals to the general; the sharing of/participating in a natural or supernatural essence
      • The nature of the individual; issues of soul, spirit, intelligence
      • The Buddhist conception of the individual as a being with desire and comprised of basic elements of
        nature; annata – the non-existence of the soul
      • The illusory nature of the separateness of the individual in relation to the rest of nature/creation
      • The relation of the self to the individual (denial of self in some traditions, emergence of self in others)
      • The view of the individual in traditions which deny the self
      • The evolution of individual identity in relation to the community
      • Individual responsibilities; to neighbours, to the environment, to divine beings and other supernatural
        beings and/or phenomena
      • The comparative lack of emphasis on social structures in favour of the enlightenment of individuals
      • Ancestral and tribal traditions

      • The distinction between the individual and the universal in the tradition(s) studied
      • Community and social implications of the idea of the individual in the traditions studied
      • The immanence of the divine and the consequences for an understanding of the individual
      • The individual and enlightenment; the road to enlightenment being within
      • Does the understanding of the individual affect the view of salvation?
      • Ethical implications of the responsibility of individuals for evil acts as opposed to social deprivation or
         other external factors
      • Does the view of the individual hamper or help adaptations to modern globalized society?
      • Modern notions of individualism arising principally in the West; has globalization forced a new
         individualism on non-Western traditions?

14.   With reference to one or more of the non-Western traditions and perspectives you have studied,
      explain and discuss teachings about the transmigration of the soul.

      This question invites an explanation and discussion of a key part of the teachings of non-Western traditions,
      and other perspectives, according to which the soul travels to a new body (or eternity) following the
      destruction of the body. The teaching might also have an ethical element which could be discussed.

      Key Points
      • Transmigration in different traditions and perspectives
      • The ethical and salvation implications of the law of karma (action)
      • The social implications of the karma tradition and the caste system
      • Moksha and liberation due to the eradication of negative karma or strenuous effort, e.g. yoga
      • The release of the soul in different traditions
      • The notion of Brahman
      • Buddhist traditions which do not accept the existence of a soul but speak of a stream of being
      • Nirvana and the nature of human life and continuity
      • Salvation as release, as annihilation, as nothingness
      • Australian indigenous beliefs in the ancestor continually being reborn in infants
      • Ancestral traditions in indigenous American systems
      • Animal possession of sacred souls which are reincarnated, e.g. Indonesia

      Discussion
      • Social and ethical implications of the tradition or perspective studied in light of the teaching on salvation
      • The issue of the possibility of memory of past incarnations
      • The continuity of the person; can identity be preserved if souls transmigrate to new bodies?
      • The relation of the soul to the body
      • Death in the traditions or perspectives
      • Non-material substance in different traditions and perspectives; does it fail the test of modern
         inductive science?

15.   “We get the media we deserve.” Discuss and evaluate.

      This question invites a discussion and evaluation of the issues raised in the modern world by the media.
      Responses might explore not just the traditional areas of print and broadcast media, but also discuss the
      emergence of new web-based media generated by users themselves in social networks or other on-line
      activity.

      Key Points
      • The implications for interaction and understanding from the composition of the modern media

         technological expertise?
      • The reasonable limits of media interest; private lives of celebrities, critical exposure of political figures,
         private lives of public figures etc.
      • Does the media have an impact on our view of social justice?
      • Can any system of regulation be imposed that would not be accused of censorship? E.g. consider

16.   To what extent should any human be concerned about the state of the environment his or her society
      passes on to its successors?

      This question invites an assessment of the issues involved in the relationship of humans to the environment
      of the future. It might invite reflection on issues such as stewardship and responsibility and it might explore
      the nature of human activity and of human domination of the environment.

Optional Theme 8: People, nations and cultures

17.   Evaluate the claim that culture is not only the materials a people create, and what they do with them,
      but is also about their ideas, feelings and expectations about themselves, others and the world in which
      they live.

      This question invites an evaluation of those elements and components that might define culture. It allows for
      both an identification of culture in general, and for an application to a specific culture or cultures.

      Key Points
      • Culture as the totality of learned, socially transmitted behaviour: values, norms, customs, material objects,
        ideas, folkways, mores, taboos, laws, sanctions etc.

      • The interplay of culture and language, e.g. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
      • Culture and ethnocentrism
      • Understanding culture objectively: Max Weber and the verstehen approach; Marxists’ economically
        grounded accounts of culture
      • The development and evolution of culture: cultural innovation, cultural diffusion, cultural levelling,
        cultural universals
      • Material and non-material aspects of culture: material human creations and abstract human creations
      • Ideal culture vs. real culture: perspectives a society professes to hold vs. perspectives a society actually
        practises
      • Cultural lag: the gap between change and adaptation to change in a culture
      • Culture shock
      • Variations within culture: multiculturalism, high culture, popular culture, counter-culture, sub-culture

      Discussion
      • Is it possible to identify all the components that constitute culture?
      • Might culture account for the development and evolution of the human species?
      • Is culture always a matter of conventionally shared perspectives or are there some absolute truths about
         culture?
      • Is it possible to avoid ethnocentrism? How?
      • Is it possible to develop a credible approach to cultural relativism? How?
      • Can anyone ever understand a culture objectively?
      • Are there any cultural universals?
      • What is the impact of a tendency to promote a global culture on the integrity of specific cultures in the
         world?
      • Is it possible to distinguish ideal from real culture?
      • Will all cultures inevitably suffer from cultural lag as a result of the rapid pace of industrial and
         technological developments?
      • Can the variations within a culture, such as counter-cultures and sub-cultures, survive the pressures put on
         them by the dominant cultural perspectives of a society?
      • The influence of location on the possibility of shared culture, e.g. the Balkans, metropolises inhabited by
         different ethnic groups
      • The ways in which cultural patterns of some groups are favoured over those of other groups

18.   Evaluate the claim that nationalism and national character constitute the foundations of personal and
      social identity.

      This question asks for an evaluation of the nature of nationalism, an examination of the role(s) of the notion
      of nationalism in defining national character and an exploration of the function(s) of nationalism in
      establishing identity.

      Key Points
      • Nationalism: sense of superiority, development and defence of one’s country and all supporting beliefs,
        values, ideologies
      • Nationalism: commonalities in cultural and national characteristics, guided by a common ideology and
        driven by a common conception of national destiny; nationalism as basis for “imagined communities”
        (Benedict Anderson)
      • Centrality of the nation in explaining historical developments and political situations
      • Personal interests placed in service of the defence and advancement of the nation/state
      • Nationalism ideologically legitimizes the establishment of the sovereign state which holds the highest,
        ultimate and final authority; is it a construct set up for this purpose of legitimization?

      • Nationalism and sentiments against any violation of national interest or sovereignty
      • Nationalism establishes identity on cultural, ideological and material levels

        global character
      • Nationalism as a malign force: genocide, war-mongering etc.

      Discussion
      • Do all formulations of nationhood rest upon nationalism as the foundational ideology of identity?
      • Does nationalism have a future in an international, multicultural, multi-ethnic global context?
      • Is nationalism an inherently dangerous phenomenon?
      • Is membership in a nation an essential value and good for every individual within the borders of that
         nation? Place of ethnic minorities? Place of racial minorities? Place of religious minorities?
      • Are there positive aspects of nationalism?
      • Does nationalism impede progress and development on the personal, social, cultural and material levels?
      • Does nationalism annul personal identity? Cultural diversity? Ethnic plurality?
      • What is the relation between nationalism and a nation’s religions?
      • Can nationalism successfully define “national character”?
      • Can “national character” define personal identity? Can it preserve personal integrity?
      • What about “dual nationality”?
      • Geographical influences on the development of national identities
      • Might globalization impact on the phenomena of nationalism and national character?
