These sources and questions relate to Camp David and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Agreement.

SOURCE A                 Extract from a speech by Andrei Gromyko, Soviet Foreign Minister, given at the
                         United Nations General Assembly, 25 September 1979.

The separate deal between Egypt and Israel resolves nothing. It is a way of piling up, on a still greater scale,
explosive material capable of producing a new conflict in the Middle East. Moreover, added to the tense
political atmosphere in this and the neighbouring areas is the heavy smell of oil.

It is high time that all states represented in the United Nations realized how vast the tragedy of the Arab
peoples of Palestine is. What is the worth of declarations in defence of human rights – whether for refugees
or not – if before the eyes of the entire world the basic rights of an entire people driven from its land and
deprived of a livelihood are ignored?

The Soviet policy with respect to the Middle East problem is one of principle. We are in favour of a
comprehensive and just settlement, of the establishment of a durable peace in the Middle East, a region not
far from our borders. The Soviet Union sides firmly with Arab peoples who resolutely reject deals at the
expense of their legitimate interests.


SOURCE B                 Extract from Palestine: Peace not Apartheid by Jimmy Carter, 2007. Jimmy Carter
                         was US president between 1976 and 1980 and a key figure in the negotiations at
                         Camp David.

Anwar Sadat withstood the condemnation of his fellow Arabs, who imposed severe though ultimately
unsuccessful diplomatic, economic, and trade sanctions against Egypt in an attempt to isolate and punish him.
Until much later, long after I left public office, neither the Jordanians nor the PLO were willing to participate
in subsequent peace talks with Israel. This confirmed the Israelis’ fears that their nation’s existence would
again be threatened as soon as their enemies could build up enough strength to mount an attack.

For Menachem Begin, the peace treaty with Egypt was the significant act for Israel, while solemn
promises regarding the West Bank and Palestinians would be ignored or deliberately violated. With the
bilateral treaty, Israel removed Egypt’s considerable strength from the military equation of the Middle East
and thus it permitted itself renewed freedom to … confiscate, settle and fortify the occupied territories.

SOURCE C               Extract from the article ‘From June 1967 to June 1997: Learning from our mistakes’
                       by Clovis Maksoud, Arab Studies Quarterly, 1997. Clovis Maksoud is the former
                       Ambassador of the League of Arab States to the United Nations and the United
                       States.

In the 1980s, the Arab world was shocked by a series of traumatic developments that worsened the already
existing complex conditions. Besides the 1978 visit of President Sadat to Jerusalem, which led to the peace
treaty between Egypt and Israel, the fall of the Shah of Iran, and the victory of the Islamic Revolution in
Iran, there was a renewal of inter-Arab disputes and conflicts. With Egypt’s suspension from the League
of Arab States a vacuum was created which nearly paralyzed Arab cooperation, let alone Arab unity.
The coincidence of Egypt’s peace treaty with Israel and the occurrence of the Islamic Revolution in Iran
had a decidedly deep impact on the Arab world in the eighties. The two developments tended to pull the
region apart.


SOURCE D               Extract from Waging Peace by Itamar Rabinovich, 2004. Itamar Rabinovich is the
                       former Israeli ambassador to the United States 1993 to 1996.

The Camp David Accords turned Arab–Israeli diplomacy into a full-blown effort to achieve peace.
By extending diplomatic recognition to Israel, signing a peace treaty with it, and establishing normal
relations with it, Sadat and Egypt violated a taboo that an Arab consensus had strictly enforced for more
than three decades. There were two parts to the Camp David Accords – an Israeli Egyptian agreement
terminating the bilateral dispute between them, and a framework laying down the principles for resolving
Israel’s conflict over the Palestinians and its disputes with other Arab neighbours. But the two parts were
not of equal importance. Begin and Sadat were primarily interested in their bilateral agreement, and both
leaders saw to its strict implementation. Indeed, this was how the Arab world perceived the agreements:
as Sadat’s having betrayed them and made a separate peace with Israel. He was denounced and condemned,
Egypt was expelled from the Arab League, and most Arab states cut off diplomatic relations with Cairo.
