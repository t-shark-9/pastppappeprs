                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   General Diane Pierce uses a situational leadership style (lines 33–34).
           Identify four key features of a situational leadership style.                        [4 marks]

           A situational leadership style has features such as:
           • the leader adapts their style to different situations (hence the name
              “situational”)
           • flexibility (e.g. General Diane Pierce may lead “the Olive Hats” differently
              according to changes in Loyka)
           • it is influenced by the nature of the followers, or the nature of the
              organization, or the nature of the task
           • the leader will sometimes delegate (as General Diane Pierce has done with
              Colonel Michael Donovan about the construction project), but may
              sometimes be more directive (e.g. when a strategic decision needs to be
              made and implemented)
           • it can be presented as a combination of other leadership styles
           • accept any other relevant feature.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct feature identified, up to a maximum of
           [4 marks].

     (b)   Explain why General Diane Pierce decided to order Colonel Michael
           Donovan to carry out surveys and also to organize focus groups
           (lines 97–101).                                                                      [4 marks]

           General Diane Pierce decided to order Colonel Michael Donovan to carry out
           surveys because in addition to qualitative data providing an indication of “local
           community’s opinion” the results should give quantitative data (percentages,
           statistics) to help make a better informed decision about which facility to build,
           a hospital or a university (see Appendix 4). Surveying 2000 local residents
           should provide a “valid and reliable indication of the local community’s
           opinion” as this is a large sample, however the results proved inconclusive.

           General Diane Pierce also decided there was a need to organize focus groups
           because the results would provide more detailed qualitative data, exploring in
           more depth some issues, for example about locals’ resistance to both projects.
           This would help interpret the results from the surveys. As she is aware of
           cultural differences, she also thought that the men and the women of Loyka
           would have different opinions, which is why she wanted focus groups
           composed differently (some of men only, some of women only, and some of
           both men and women).

           Award [1 mark] for reference to a survey as providing quantitative data and
           [1 mark] for mentioning that focus groups provide qualitative data. Award a
           further [1 mark] for an explanation of General Diane Pierce’s decision for each
           research method up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           Award [1 mark] only for generic comments about data collection to make an
           informed decision.

(c)   General Diane Pierce decided to use UWP resources to build either a new
      hospital or a new university campus. Using Maslow’s motivation theory,
      analyse the impact of this decision on both the local population and
      “the Olive Hats”.                                                                            [7 marks]

      Maslow’s motivation theory is usually represented through a pyramid of needs,
      ranging from safety (at the bottom of the pyramid) to self-actualization (at the
      top of the pyramid).

            [Source: Clark, P. et al., 2009, Business and Management Course Companion, page 125,
                                      Glasgow, U.K. Oxford University Press]

      After a period of civil war, the Loykese population needs safety, especially
      security of resources and of property. General Diane Pierce’s project of
      building a hospital also corresponds to the safety needs at the bottom of
      Maslow’s pyramid, about health and security of the family. Her project of
      building a university is higher up on the pyramid model as it would address
      some locals’ needs of achievement and confidence through their studies and
      qualifications, even leading to self-actualization. According to this model, the
      hospital satisfies more basic needs than the university; this could be a factor to
      help General Diane Pierce’s decision.

With regard to “the Olive Hats”, General Diane Pierce is well aware of
their security and safety needs at the UWP Mission where they work.
The community-based military environment also offers the soldiers a sense of
belonging and togetherness. The involvement of Colonel Michael Donovan’s
engineering group would even satisfy their needs for esteem and
self-actualization: “the officers in the Civil Engineering Group were excited by
the opportunity to lead the project”. The soldiers’ “motivation was beginning
to deteriorate” before her arrival, General Diane Pierce has well understood
how to act in order to satisfy a range of needs, not only basic ones for safety
and security, but also more complex ones.

Accept any other relevant analysis.


N.B. Candidates are not expected to draw the model itself. For maximum
marks, candidates must refer to both the needs of the local population and the
needs of “the Olive Hats”.

If the response is one-sided with only the local population or “the
Olive Hats” being referred to then a maximum of [4 marks] should be
awarded.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.
                                                   –8–              N12/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    economies of scale (line 121)                                               [2 marks]

                  Economies of scale are defined as a cost saving which a business
                  experiences when the long-run unit costs or production costs fall as a
                  business engages in larger-scale production.


                  N.B. Examples are not required for full marks provided the definition is
                  accurate.

                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding of economies of scale (with reference to both decrease in
                  cost per unit and increase in production volume).

                  For only a relevant example or application to the case study or statement
                  about bulk buying award [1 mark].

           (ii)   just-in-case stock control (line 140).                                      [2 marks]

                  Stock control is about checking/monitoring the level(s) of inventory
                  i.e. in the case of Kos Palouk’s business: the amount of fresh produce he
                  stores. There are two types of stock control methods: just-in-case (JIC)
                  and just-in-time (JIT). JIC is about keeping a certain level of stock
                  because of emergencies i.e. having a reserve (the buffer stock) just in
                  case (literally) it might be needed (hence the name of JIC).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award
                  [1 mark].
                                            –9–               N12/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain how Kos Palouk’s fixed and variable costs would be affected by
      pursuing Option 2 (lines 150–152).                                                 [4 marks]

      Option 2 is an increase in the scale of operation, though not as radical as
      Option 3. With Option 2, Kos Palouk would sell more produce, so his output
      would increase, yet without major changes to his business.
      • Fixed costs are costs that do not change as output does; an example of a
        fixed cost is the rent of the storage facility, or the lorry loan repayment.
        Pursuing Option 2 would mean an increase to such fixed costs.
      • Variable costs are costs that do change as output does; an example of a
        variable cost is the cost of the products bought by Kos Palouk from farmers
        for resale to the UWP Mission and to the university or hospital. Pursuing
        Option 2 would mean an increase to such variable costs.

      Accept any other relevant example of fixed costs and variable costs in the
      context of Kos Palouk and Option 2.


      N.B. Candidates may refer to economies of scale in their answer. This is
      acceptable as Kos Palouk could well realize economies of scale with Option 2,
      though there is no explicit indication in the case study.

      N.B. Candidates are not required to give a detailed definition of fixed/variable
      costs.

      N.B. Candidates may refer to maintenance costs for the lorry as either fixed or
      variable; accept either.


      Mark as 2 + 2: [2 marks] for fixed costs and [2 marks] for variable costs.

      Award [1 mark] for a clear understanding of the concept of fixed costs/
      variable costs and [1 mark] for relating this accurately to Kos Palouk,
      explaining any change, up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            – 10 –           N12/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for Kos Palouk of pursuing
      Option 2 (lines 150–152).                                                         [7 marks]

      Option 2 has several advantages for Kos Palouk:
      • he would benefit from economies of scale and would earn much more every
        month (he would have personal savings of $950 a month, compared to $100
        with his existing, small-scale business model)
      • once built, the university or hospital will represent a large volume new
        customer, without Kos Palouk having to do much marketing, promotion or
        advertising in order to target that market (first mover advantage)
      • accept any other relevant advantage.

      However, it also has the following disadvantages:
      • there are strong elements of risk: risk for his own safety (the danger of
        driving to remote communities where he may be perceived as collaborating
        with the UWP troops), risk for his own property (as the bank wants his lorry
        as collateral)
      • competition may become fierce, once other local entrepreneurs realize the
        potential and enter the market; if his business is not successful, Kos Palouk
        might regret leaving his safe job at the officers’ dining hall
      • Kos Palouk would need to leave his job at the officers’ dining hall and lose
        his regular source of income
      • accept any other relevant disadvantage.

      Accept any other relevant analysis.

3.   (a)   General Diane Pierce needs to remotivate her troops but cannot offer any
           financial rewards (lines 39–41). Describe two non-financial rewards that
           she could use.                                                                     [4 marks]

           General Diane Pierce could use several non-financial rewards to remotivate her
           troops, such as:
           • Job enrichment: she could give her troops opportunities to use the skills they
              have, which will be the case for the officers when they start working on the
              construction of the hospital or university, as they have said that they are
              excited to do so.
           • Job enlargement / job expansion: she could increase the range of tasks of the
              soldiers, motivating them by a variety of jobs and a change of routine
              (this can be called “job rotation”). As part of their job enlargement, they
              could be more involved in projects with the local population.
           • Empowerment / increased responsibility / delegation: she could give some
              staff (especially officers) more power in decision-making, for example she
              could empower Colonel Michael Donovan by letting him follow his own
              recommendation to build a hospital in 30 weeks.
           • Teamwork: although soldiers are likely to work in teams already, she could
              strengthen the importance of teamwork, for example by having the troops
              build the hospital using cell production.

           N.B. The concepts themselves (e.g. “empowerment”) might not be mentioned
           explicitly in the answer, but candidates may achieve the marks nonetheless.

           Award [1 mark] for each relevant non-financial reward and [1 mark] for a
           description of that non-financial reward in the context of the “Olive Hats”, up
           to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   With reference to Option 3 (lines 153–157), distinguish between a
      wholesaler and a retailer.                                                        [4 marks]

      In a long distribution channel, a wholesaler sells products to a retailer who,
      in turn, sells to customers. Wholesalers do not usually sell directly to the
      public, but to another agent: the retailer. Wholesalers buy and store large
      quantities and resell these in smaller quantities to retailers.

      At the moment there is no wholesaler for the produce that Kos Palouk
      distributes; this means that the produce are bought directly from the farmers
      and sold directly to the UWP Mission. With Option 3, Kos Palouk would
      become a wholesaler: he would start selling to other retailers (other shop
      owners), creating a longer distribution chain.


      N.B. A diagram of the supply chain is acceptable as part of the answer.


      [1 to 2 marks]
      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows some basic knowledge of the
      definitions of a wholesaler and a retailer. Award [2 marks] for a theoretical
      answer that shows some clear knowledge of the difference between a
      wholesaler and a retailer.

      [3 to 4 marks]
      For [3 marks] the candidate refers to Kos Palouk. For [4 marks] the candidate
      refers to Kos Palouk and to the wholesale operation he may set up if he pursues
      Option 3.

(c)   The UWP Mission has ethical objectives (lines 5–7). Examine whether the
      setting of ethical objectives by the UWP will be beneficial.                         [7 marks]

      Organizations may set ethical objectives for several reasons, for instance:
      • in the 21st century, there is an increasing expectation that organizations will
         behave as “good citizens”, hence the concept of corporate social
         responsibility (CSR), which in practice often means setting ethical
         objectives (in the case of the UWP Mission “to create stability, fulfilling the
         UWP Mission’s aim to maintain order, peace and security”)
      • some organizations are aware that their actions and activities may
         negatively affect some stakeholders or the environment, which is why
         setting up ethical objectives will create a counterbalance (for example in the
         short term the UWP soldiers may have to restrict locals’ movements, but as
         a counterpart they will help create longer-term stability).

      However, setting ethical objectives also has disadvantages:
      • in some cases, it can appear as a mere exercise to give the impression that
        the organization is (suddenly) becoming ethical (i.e. what in English is
        called “paying lip service” to a cause), without anything concrete behind it
      • in some cases, it can give the impression that the organization is trying to
        hide some bad practice by drawing attention to what they do well for the
        benefit of the wider society (for example opponents to the presence of
        “the Olive Hats” in Loyka could argue that the ethical objectives are just a
        way to justify the invasion of their land by foreign troops).

      Accept any other relevant examination.

                                               SECTION B

4.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    tertiary sector (line 2)                                                       [2 marks]

                  The tertiary sector of the economy is the sector of services (which is why
                  it is also called “the service sector”) such as health, education or retail.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition of tertiary sector (for example
                  referring only to the term “services”).

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear description that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding of tertiary sector (for example with a reference to
                  “services” and at least one example such as retail/shops).

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award
                  [1 mark].

           (ii)   workforce planning (line 91).                                                  [2 marks]

                  Workforce planning refers to the forecast of future human resources,
                  especially in terms of recruitment and training. It normally involves
                  assessing the current workforce and identifying needs for new skills or
                  knowledge in order to help the organization meet its strategic objectives.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition of workforce planning.

                  Award [2 marks] for a clear description that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding of workforce planning.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the case study award
                  [1 mark].

(b)   Using relevant information from below:

      (i)    calculate the payback period (without depreciation) for Kos Palouk’s
             purchase of a new lorry (show all your working).                              [2 marks]

             43 500
                    = 2.5 years or 2 years and 6 months
             17 400

             N.B. 2 years and 5 months is not the correct answer. If the working is
             correct, award [1 mark] only.

             Award [1 mark] for the correct working and [1 mark] for the correct
             answer.

      (ii)   calculate the average rate of return (ARR) for Kos Palouk’s
             purchase of a new lorry (show all your working).                              [2 marks]

              17 400 
                      ×100 =
                             40 %
              43 500 


             N.B. Award [1 mark] only if the percentage sign (%) is not present.

             Award [1 mark] for the correct working and [1 mark] for the correct
             answer.

      (iii) comment on the results to your calculations from parts (i) and (ii).           [4 marks]

             The payback period of 2 years and 6 months means that it would not
             take long for Kos Palouk to recover enough cash to cover the initial
             investment. Payback periods are often over several years; the payback
             here is short – especially as the useful life of the lorry is almost three
             times longer (7 years). Although the purchase price is very high ($43 500
             i.e. more than 66 times Kos Palouk’s current monthly income), it seems
             that the lorry will enable him to make a higher income (see Appendix 5).

             The ARR of 40 % is very high, which again indicates that this seems to
             be a very good investment, however this is based on optimistic
             assumptions about high returns; the case study states that the bank would
             require the lorry as collateral, so if his revenues are below expectations,
             Kos Palouk may actually lose the lorry; other factors would need to be
             taken into account as part of the investment appraisal.


             Apply Own Figure Rule (OFR).

             Award [1 mark] for each valid point, up to a maximum of [4 marks].

             N.B. To achieve [4 marks], the answer must cover both payback and
             ARR (though not necessarily with [2 marks] for each: for [4 marks] the
                                             – 16 –            N12/3/BUSMT/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


            answer may include more explanations about one calculation than the
            other. It is not marked as 2+2).

(c)   Advise General Diane Pierce whether the hospital or the university should
      be built. Justify your recommendation.                                              [8 marks]

      Several factors would suggest that the hospital should be built:
      • there is an identified need for a hospital (for example the complications
         from the lack of prenatal care have recently increased) and this would have
         immediate, short-term benefits (as opposed to the longer term impacts of the
         university)
      • the results from the survey showed that a slight majority (52 %) prefer the
         hospital (so there is market research evidence)
      • Colonel Michael Donovan (who has coordinated the research and has been
         in the country for longer than General Diane Pierce) recommends the
         hospital
      • it would help the UWP Mission reach its strategic objective to improve the
         image of the Olive Hats and to display their corporate social responsibility
         by improving the healthcare of the Loykese.

      However, some other factors suggest that the university should be built:
      • there is a clear need for a university to train professionals such as teachers,
        nurses, doctors and engineers who will ensure the sustainable future of the
        country of Loyka
      • from a business viewpoint, the university “could also attract private capital
        for future public-private partnerships in research and development”
      • many locals have formulated objections to the hospital (for example about
        the presence of foreign male doctors): the survey showed that 17 % of
        respondents strongly oppose the project (this is a large proportion: more
        than one person in six)
      • the local governor prefers the university; although 10 % of respondents
        strongly oppose it, he may still be able to rally support.

      At the end of their answer, candidates need to have a clear conclusion.

      Accept any other relevant advice and recommendation.


      N.B. The arguments presented must be about Business and Management (for
      example with reference to costs, duration of building operations, survey results
      as market research, stakeholders views etc.); social aspects (e.g. about
      demographics) are useful, but they only provide contextual information.
