Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–2:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
 3–4:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
        insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more
        than poorly substantiated assertions.
 5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity.       Understanding of historical processes may be present but
        underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is
        present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood.
        There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses
        that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
 12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
        applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to indicate some in-depth
        understanding but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is
        sound understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
        different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present
        but not always consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
 15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is
        used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison
        and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively. Answers are well structured and balanced and synthesis is well
        developed and supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
 18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may
        challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high
        level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be
        understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant.
        Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is well structured and well-focused.
        Synthesis is highly developed.

Colonialism in South and Southeast Asia and Oceania — late eighteenth to the mid nineteenth
century

1.   In what ways, and for what reasons, did the British establish colonies in Australia and New
     Zealand from the late eighteenth century up until the middle of the nineteenth century?

     There is wide scope for candidates to reveal their knowledge of the period and relevant comment
     should be rewarded. Early settlement in Australia began after the American War of Independence
     with a main reason being to establish a penal colony to release pressure on the facilities in England.
     The settlers included convicts and their guards, in particular the officers and men of the New South
     Wales Corps who stayed on, a number of the officers taking up land as squatters. Free settlers
     included: merchants and traders; settlers attracted by land and work; the sponsored colonists of
     Western Australia and South Australia; gold seekers and miners. Convictism to New South Wales
     ceased finally in 1851 although Western Australia continued to receive convicts after this date.
     Reasons then can include both push and pull factors out of England and to a new country, although
     the convicts had no choice. Candidates may define settler groups in different ways: ethnic groups
     like the Chinese; political groups; religious groups; agriculturalists; pastoralists (squatters); miners
     and so on, and reasons may differ amongst them. Australia seemed to provide agricultural, pastoral
     and mining opportunities. Among the free settlers were refugees from religious and/or political
     repression such as the German settlers in South Australia. Expect a wide variety of examples and
     give credit for answers which link specific groups to particular achievements or areas of settlement
     and development. The British government saw political and strategic reasons for establishing
     colonies in the region.

     New Zealand was colonized later than Australia. The presence of a strong indigenous culture, the
     Maoris, meant that the majority of early European residents were not permanent settlers but
     transient visitors largely engaged in activities such as sealing, whaling, and forestry. They traded
     with Maori for food, sexual services, and other supplies.

     In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced its plans to establish colonies in New Zealand and
     this, as well as the chaotic situation amongst the settlers there, encouraged the government to stabilise
     their role and establish colonies. In 1840, the British and Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi
     in the Bay of Islands. As with Australia, reasons for British interest included strategic imperatives as
     well as to establish a more effective control. Missionaries were exerting pressure for access into the
     two countries. Britain was motivated by the desire to forestall other European powers, including
     France, and, by the presence of American whalers and traders in the region. The gold rush happened
     from the middle to the second half of the century but can be included as a reason.

     “In what ways” could include a discussion about the establishment of separate colonies. For
     Australia: there were six colonies established, each for a different reason; South Australia was the
     only one free of convict transportation; there were no formal treaties with the indigenous people;
     Victoria was separated from New South Wales in 1851; the Victorian and New South Wales’
     constitutions were ratified by the British government in 1855; the Tasmanian and South Australian
     constitutions in 1856 and Queensland’s in 1859; Western Australia did not get responsible
     government until much later in the nineteenth century. For New Zealand: it was initially considered
     part of New South Wales until 1841; the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi was a formal treaty with Maoris;
     the British government ratified New Zealand’s Constitution in 1852.

     Candidates need to address both Australia and New Zealand, within the time frame of the question.
     Reward relevant knowledge and comment and for higher markbands expect increasingly
     sophisticated analysis based upon sound historical knowledge.

     If only Australia or New Zealand is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

     If only “reasons” or “ways” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


2.   Examine the reasons for French interest in the region in the late eighteenth century, and
     explain how and why they established their political control over Indo–China by the middle of
     the nineteenth century.

     The initial reasons for French interest in the region centered on the desire for trade and to spread
     Catholicism through their missionary activity. Just as other European nations sought trade
     advantages in the region, France too pursued these aims but was thwarted by events at home, the
     French Revolution and the lack of money. The success of British and Dutch imperialism in the
     region inspired the French to pursue the same goals and in the middle of the nineteenth century,
     once they had established some stability at home, France moved into Vietnam. The reasons for this
     were driven by a mixture of motives; economic, strategic and nationalistic, although the pretext was
     the persecution of their missionaries. Between 1858 and 1862 the French captured Saigon and the
     surrounding provinces and created the colony of Cochinchina through a treaty in 1862. Using the
     south as a base, the French moved west and north completing the conquest of Indo–China by 1907.
     (Indo–China – the five territories under French authority: Cochinchina, Annam, Tonkin, Laos, and
     Cambodia.) Through processes of both “assimilation” of Vietnam into the French system
     and “association”, by which they incorporated local Vietnamese practices into their own rule,
     France established political control over Indo–China by the late nineteenth century.

     Expect some discussion of the circumstances of French interest in the region, but candidates need to
     clearly identify “how and why” France was able to gain control over the region by the period
     indicated in the title. There was a limited amount of French activity in the region prior to the
     mid-nineteenth century so candidates who comment on the effects of French rule after 1850 may
     also be given credit.
                                                  –6–               N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


Traditional East Asian societies — late eighteenth to the mid nineteenth century

3.   To what extent is it true to say that the Qing (Ch’ing) Dynasty in China was already in decline
     by the early nineteenth century?

     Candidates may see the paradox implicit in the question in that the reign of the Emperor Qianlong,
     (Ch’ien-Lung) (1735–1796) during the eighteenth century saw the height of the Qing (Ch’ing)
     dynasty’s power. Candidates may also refer to specific details in the reigns of the Emperors
     who came after Qianlong, (Ch’ien-Lung), Jiaqing (Chia-chi’ing) (1796–1820) and Daoguang
     (Tao-kuang) (1820–1850).

     However, the point of the question is that the roots of Qing (Ch’ing) weakness and vulnerability lay
     within the country, leaving it open to intrusion by foreign powers. Candidates may first describe
     the dynasty of the Qing (Ch’ing) including the way the Chinese government functioned. The face
     showed to the world by the Ch’ing (Qing) government in Beijing (Peking) was of wealth and
     power. Candidates may refer to the institutions of the state, including references to mandarins, the
     tribute system and the Imperial examination system amongst others. Corruption within the system,
     economic hardships, natural disasters, the impact of provincialism, the rebellions, such as the White
     Lotus (1796–1804) and Miao (1754–1806) rebellions, all contributed to the belief that the Qing
     (Ch’ing) dynasty was in trouble.

     The timeframe for this question goes up to the early nineteenth century and therefore too much
     discussion about the causes and consequences of the 1839–1842 Opium War is not relevant.
     Discussion about the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864) and/or the Self-Strengthening Movement
     (1861–1894) should not be given credit.
                                                  –7–               N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


4.   Compare and contrast the responses of the Chinese and the Japanese to the arrival of
     Western imperialists until 1868.

     This will probably be a popular question. There are various contrasts with regard to the ways in
     which China and Japan were opened up for trade with the Western powers, but the final outcome of
     unequal trade agreements is essentially similar. Both countries responded in different ways to the
     arrival of the Western powers. Expect a description of the situations in both countries when the
     Westerners arrived, but the command terms require that at least some awareness of the differences
     in actions/attitudes are pointed out with specific evidence provided to support the analysis.
     Chronologically, China will probably be dealt with first, including the McCartney, Amherst and
     Napier missions, the Chinese reactions to Western attempts to secure concessions the Canton trade
     system and refusal of the Emperor to deal with the Western powers. Expect the clash of cultures;
     opium trade, war and the forcing open of Chinese ports. Japan too had handled foreigners through a
     policy of isolation earlier, but in the middle of the nineteenth century, the arrival of Perry and the
     Black Ships led the Japanese to deal with the Americans through treaties. Comparisons can include
     the relative isolation of the two countries and their attitudes towards foreigners; expect some
     similarities to be pointed out, but contrasts as well. These may include greater Japanese interest in
     western learning, for example, based on the difference in government structures and power balances
     between the two countries; the late arrival of Westerners in Japan and Japanese knowledge of what
     had happened in China. The question concludes with the 1868 Meiji Restoration in Japan and the
     onset of the 1864 Self-Strengthening Movement in China.

     Many responses will focus on contrasts, but some comparisons should also be identified for
     candidates to score higher marks.

     If only comparisons or contrasts are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

     If only China or Japan is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Developing identities — mid nineteenth to the early twentieth century

5.   ―Economic exploitation rather than political frustration was the main reason for the
     emergence of a nationalist movement in India between 1850 and 1914.‖ To what extent do
     you agree with this statement?

     This may be a popular question and many answers will, no doubt, narrate the emergence of the
     Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League, but for higher marks, answers will need
     to analyse both economic and political factors from the mid nineteenth century. This is not just a
     question about the causes and consequences of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny). Candidates who
     do not discuss the causes of the Great Revolt (Indian Mutiny) should not be penalized.

     These could include:
     Political factors
     The frustration at the limited access to the Indian Civil Service and, until the 1880s,
     limited participation in government; 1892 Indian Councils – some participation at local level;
     the 1905 partition of Bengal, which led to the Swadeshi movement; the 1909 Morley-Minto
     reforms, which increased Indian participation but it was still limited.

     Economic factors
     These could include the lack of protection for Indian products; the failure to protect the Indian
     cotton industry; the famines such as those in 1899/1900 and the poor response from the
     government; in addition, the 1907 riots in Punjab over irrigation fees.

     Reward analytical and relevant answers which contain detail, insight, perceptive comments and
     perhaps different interpretations, addressing all aspects of the question including the extent to which
     the candidate agrees with the quotation.


6.   To what extent did Thailand owe its survival as an independent state to the wisdom of its
     rulers, Rama IV (Mongkut) (1852–1868) and Rama V (Chulalongkorn) (1868–1910)?

     Candidates should be aware of the role and importance of the characters and policies of
     King Mongkut (1852–1868) and King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) in respect of Thailand retaining
     its independence from European rule. The Thai government was able to survive through a
     combination of good government, diplomacy and luck, until the high tide of European imperialism
     had passed. Details about the diplomacy may include: in 1855, a treaty between Siam and Great
     Britain, a consular jurisdiction established with terms favouring British trade and representation
     following a pattern imposed by European powers through force on many Asian countries. In 1893,
     a similar treaty was signed with France and in 1907, Siam ceded the provinces of Battambang and
     Siem Reap to France and in 1909, the provinces of Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Trengganu to
     Britain. Territorial concessions were made by Siam in order to maintain its independence. “The
     wisdom of ” could also include the policies of the two monarchs: both Mongkut and Chulalongkorn
     modernised the state, introduced reform measures and made timely concessions of the less vital
     heartland of Siam to French and British interests ensuring the survival of Thai independence. Both
     employed Western advisers to assist in the modernization of the country’s administration and
     commerce. Both played off the British interests to the west and south against those of the French to
     the east and made diplomatic agreements, which established Siam as a neutral buffer kingdom
     between the British territories of Burma and Malaya and French Indo-china. Candidates will need
     to ascertain the extent to which Thailand owed its survival to the policies and actions of the
     two kings.

     If only one king is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Early modernization and imperial decline in East Asia — mid nineteenth to the early twentieth
century

7.   ―A turning point in China’s history.‖ To what extent do you agree with this statement on the
     Boxer Rebellion?

     The Boxer Rebellion originated in Shandong (Shantung) province and took on an anti-foreign, anti-
     Christian stance after German intervention there in 1897. The movement swiftly developed as a
     response to the frustration felt by many Chinese to the weaknesses of the dynasty and the defeat by
     the Japanese a few years before. In 1900 the Boxers arrived in Beijing (Peking), gained the support
     of the Empress Dowager and besieged the foreign embassies. Foreign governments, including
     Japan, sent troops, lifted the siege and forced on the Chinese the humiliating protocols of Beijing
     (Peking), huge indemnities, loss of territory and the beginning of the scramble for concessions.
     These events lowered Qing (Ch’ing) prestige even further and encouraged anti-Qing sentiment.
     Russia made gains in Manchuria and Japan raised its international prestige. Candidates may argue
     that the Boxer Rebellion was a turning point because the consequences were significant. Wider
     consequences include: the Late Qing Reform Movement that attempted to implement
     administrative, educational, military and constitutional changes; the railway recovery movement;
     the re-emergence of anti-Qing sentiment; and the growth of revolutionary attitudes, including Sun
     Yixian’s (Sun Yat-sen’s) Alliance League or Tongmenghui (T’ung-meng hui). Some candidates
     may argue that the 1911 Double Tenth Nationalist Revolution was a long term consequence of the
     Boxer Rebellion. Others may mention that it contributed to the later warlordism because of the
     division amongst provincial leaders about how to handle the Boxers. Award discussion based upon
     historical evidence.

     Some candidates may challenge the assumption in the question and argue that the Boxer Rebellion
     was not a turning point and may see other events in the period as turning points: the reconstitution
     of the Tongmenghui (T’ung-meng hui) in 1905; the Qing reforms which may have taken hold if the
     Emperor and Empress Dowager had not died in 1908. Others may look back to the failure of the
     1898 reforms. Award discussion based upon historical evidence.

     Candidate should analyse the Boxer rebellion in depth before identifying other events as more
     significant.
                                                 – 10 –             N12/3/HISTX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/AO/M


8.   Analyse the causes and consequences of the Tonghak Rebellion of 1894 in Korea.

     The causes are relatively simple: agricultural distress, high taxation and the opening of the country
     to the West. The immediate cause was Cho Pyong-gap’s proposed tax changes. The response was
     the Eastern Learning movement and the Tonghak Rebellion. The Tonghak or “Eastern Learning”
     Movement developed as a response to Western ideas which entered Korea even before its opening
     by Japan in 1876. Founded by Ch’oe Ch’u, it incorporated elements from Taoism, Buddhism,
     Neo-Confucianism, traditional Korean Shamanism and Catholicism. It gained popularity amongst
     the peasantry and spread rapidly in the south where risings were crushed in the 1860s and Ch’oe
     was executed. His ideas continued to inspire those who resisted modernization and the increasing
     Japanese influence. By 1894 it had acquired a large following, including those who suffered
     economic hardship from high taxation. It also had an anti-Japanese element. The rebellion of 1894
     was crushed with Chinese assistance, but the Japanese also sent forces, thus precipitating the
     Sino–Japanese War of 1894–1895. The consequences include the stationing of foreign troops in
     Korea and the opening of ports to outside countries. China’s ties to Korea were severed after the
     Sino–Japanese War, and Tripartite intervention forced Japan to give up Liaotíung. Tonghak ideas
     lived on in the Heavenly Way Movement which was an early stimulant of nationalism paving
     the way for truly modern reforms. The Tonghak Rebellion led to Korea’s modern period, but also
     to Japanese control. Expect both parts of the question to be addressed and reward in-depth analysis.

     If only causes or consequences are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Impact of the World Wars on South and Southeast Asia to the mid twentieth century

9.   Compare and contrast the roles of Gandhi and Nehru in the independence movement
     in India.

     Both Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were charismatic leaders who attracted the masses to the Indian
     Nationalist Movement and who played an important role in the achievement of Indian
     independence. Jawaharlal Nehru became recognized as Gandhi’s political heir. Some candidates
     may be confuse Motilal Nehru (father) and Jawaharlal Nehru (son), as both were involved in the
     nationalist movement, and they may wrongly attribute the 1928 Nehru Report in response to Simon
     Commission to Jawaharlal Nehru. Given that the question is not specific enough, candidates should
     not be harshly penalised for this, but obviously to score highly the better candidates should be able
     to distinguish between the father and the son and focus on Jawaharlal Nehru. Answers could
     examine both Jawaharlal Nehru’s and Gandhi’s roles within the development of Indian nationalism
     – the situation in 1919 and by 1935, the emergence of a mass movement. Candidates may identify
     Gandhi’s role in the Indian Nationalist Movement, which may include: Gandhi’s ideas and
     philosophy; his return to India in 1915; first satyagraha campaign (1917); second and third
     satyagraha campaigns; Gandhi’s support for the continuation of non-cooperation; boycott of
     foreign goods; the causes and consequences of the Salt March (1930) and the Civil Disobedience
     campaign; Jawaharlal Nehru became a follower of the ideas of Gandhi, so comparisons could be
     made regarding both men’s support for the non-cooperation movement in the 1920s and beyond.
     Both Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi were jailed for their opposition to British rule. Jawaharlal
     Nehru became the Indian National Congress President in 1929; in 1938, the rift in Congress
     between the more radical Bose and Gandhi was clear and Jawaharlal Nehru supported Gandhi’s
     methods of non-violence. Both regretted the deterioration of relationships between Hindus and
     Muslims and the situation after the Second World War from 1945 to 1947. Both leaders embraced
     secularism, socialist economic policies and a non-aligned foreign policy, which helped them gain
     support in the Nationalist Movement. Both men’s policies challenged the traditional caste system
     and religious discrimination and both leaders shared a common understanding regarding the social
     classes in India.

     Candidates may point out contrasts between the two men in their actions, although comparisons will
     be easier to find. Gandhi concentrated more on the spiritual development of his supporters and
     gradually distanced himself from direct political action, whereas Jawaharlal Nehru brought the
     Indian Nationalist Movement to power in 1947 and became India’s first Prime Minister. In ruling
     from 1947 until 1964, Jawaharlal Nehru is India’s longest serving Prime Minister so his
     contributions to the Indian Nationalist Movement after Gandhi’s death in 1948 may be pointed out.
     The question is about the development of Indian nationalism and the contribution of both leaders so
     expect details from the lives of both men. Expect comparisons and contrasts, although candidates
     may reasonably conclude that both men contributed greatly to the success of the Indian Nationalist
     Movement.

     To score highly candidates should offer running comparisons throughout their response.

     If only Jawaharlal Nehru or Gandhi is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

10.   Compare and contrast the extent to which Japanese expansion in Southeast Asia during the
      Second World War influenced the nationalist movement in two countries in Southeast Asia.

      Candidates will probably choose from Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya or the Philippines.
      The Second World War and Japanese occupation may be seen as a watershed with the pre-war
      period of colonial rule where the nationalist movements initially developed. Although nationalist
      movements did not all follow exactly the same path there are some common themes. There may be
      some discussion of the pre-war situation in order to later assess the impact of the Japanese
      occupation on each country. The Japanese expansion into each country and the nature of the
      occupation will need to be examined. This may include: Japanese atrocities; resistance to Japanese
      rule; the way the Japanese restructured the government (Burma, Philippines); the way the
      Japanese used the colonial administration of the European country occupied by the Nazis
      (Indonesia, Vietnam); the opportunities for nationalists to acquire experience in administration and
      in the military; the impact of Japanese ideas such as “Asia for the Asians”; Japanese support for
      independence from Western colonial rule; the immediate declaration of independence after the
      defeat of the Japanese in an attempt to pre-empt the return of the colonial power (Indonesia,
      Vietnam); the subsequent struggle with the colonial power until the final achievement of
      independence; the development of internal factional fighting and the need for the colonial power to
      unite the country again (Malaya). Candidates may compare and contrast the roles of charismatic
      nationalist leaders: Sukarno (Indonesia); Ho Chi Minh (Vietnam); Aung San (Burma); Datuk Onn
      and Tunku Abdul Rahman (Malaya); Quezon and Osmeña (Philippines). Some assessment of the
      extent to which the Japanese occupation influenced the nationalist movements needs to be
      addressed. Many answers will focus on comparisons, but some contrasts should also be identified.

      If only one country is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

The Republic of China 1912–1949 and the rise of Communism

11.   In what ways, and to what extent, was Yuan Shikai (Yuan Shih-k’ai) responsible for the rise
      of warlordism in China in the early twentieth century?

      Candidates will need to define “warlordism” and some may challenge the assumption in the
      question and argue that its roots may be traced to the decline of the authority of the Qing (Ch’ing)
      central government in the second half of the nineteenth century. However, the role of Yuan Shikai
      (Yuan Shih-k’ai) needs to be examined in detail: his betrayal of Guangxu (Kuang-hsu) in the
      100 Days Reform Movement; his allegiances during the Boxer Rebellion when directives from
      Beijing (Peking) were ignored by provincial leaders who disagreed with them. Yuan’s actions
      during 1911–1912 showed that he had no loyalty to either the Qing (Ch’ing) or the new Republic.
      Candidates should consider the reasons why Sun Yixian (Sun Yat-sen) gave the Presidency of the
      Republic to him in 1912. Problems beset his government; party politics failed; Yuan tried to make
      himself Emperor in 1915, but was thwarted and by the time he died in 1916 the power of the central
      government had been seriously weakened. His example undoubtedly encouraged other military
      commanders to use their armies to establish control over whatever regions they could and
      warlordism continued to plague China after his death. In the period 1917–1926 warlordism spread
      throughout China and the best answers will recognize its precedents and Yuan’s role in perpetuating
      it, with awareness that it persisted well beyond the creation of the Nationalist Government in 1927.


12.   How and why did the Chinese Communist Party survive between 1927 and 1937 despite
      serious threats to its existence?

      Founded in 1921, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) grew out of the successes of the Russian
      Revolution and the inspiration of the May Fourth Movement in China. In 1924 they entered into a
      marriage of convenience with the Nationalists in the First United Front. However, by 1927 the
      Nationalists turned against the CCP and killed many of its members Shanghai, forcing a retreat to
      the rural areas, particularly the Jiangxi Soviet. The CCP were able to survive thanks to the relative
      remoteness of the areas in central China and Jiang Jieshi’s (Chiang Kai Shek’s) concentration on
      consolidating his own power. How the CCP survived was due partially to the ineptitude of the
      Nationalist government and also to the development of the CCP and its power base. Expect
      candidates to comment on the consolidation of Mao’s position in the CCP during this period; the
      failure of the encirclement campaigns against the CCP and in particular the Jiangxi Soviet.
      Candidates could refer to the development of Communist theory to fit the Chinese model, and the
      emergence of the key Communist leaders who were to guide China for the next forty years. “How”
      will also include the tactics employed by the CCP in the face of attacks by the GMD. These
      included the retreat in the Long March (1934–1935) and the securing of a power base in Yan’an
      (Yenan). The GMD problems in running the country in the Nanjing Decade, including their
      awareness of the concerns over the Japanese occupation of parts of China also helped ensure the
      CCP’s survival in this period. Candidates will probably stop after the formation of the Second
      United Front in 1936 and the beginning of the Sino–Japanese war in 1937.

      Responses should focus on the fortunes of the CCP rather than just on the weaknesses of the GMD.
      Expect analysis and factual evidence to address both “how and why” the CCP survived in these
      key years.

Imperial Japan: empire and aftermath 1912–1952

13.   Analyse the factors that led to the rise of militarism in Japan in the 1930s.

      Candidates should recognize that elements in Japanese traditional society and culture encouraged
      militarism and supported expansionism, especially after the successes achieved in the thirty years or
      so prior to this decade. They may also note domestic and cultural factors contributing to militarism.
      Japanese political and military leaders were sensitive to Western attitudes as they attempted to
      achieve great power status and acceptance as equals by the west. Elements in Japan were easily
      offended by real or imagined slights to Japan’s international status and honour and believed that
      Western attitudes were often hypocritical as well as hostile to Japan’s national interests. The 1922
      Washington Naval agreement may be cited as an example of this as well as Western gains after the
      First World War. Candidates may also recognize that Japan had democratic party politics during
      the 1920s, but after the Great Depression, Japan faced severe economic and social problems.
      Militarism appeared to many to supply a solution because weak and corrupt civilian politicians
      appeared unable to address these problems. Many Japanese people were attracted to, and found
      justification for their actions in, the rise of fascism in Europe. There may also be recognition that
      militarism took different forms, ranging from conservative designs for conquest and economic,
      demographic and strategic reasons as well as the radical militarism of younger officers who pursued
      social and economic change and domestic reform, as well as conquest overseas.


14.   Examine the reasons for Japan’s initial victories and for its eventual defeat in the Pacific War
      (1941–1945).

      Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and by May 1942 had control over the Eastern
      seaboard of China, Southeast Asia and many Pacific islands. Japan’s initial victories resulted from
      its well-planned and coordinated surprise attacks by well-trained, experienced forces upon relatively
      weak and unprepared opponents at a time when the European colonial powers were either under
      German domination or, in the case of Britain, facing the threat of invasion. A significant factor in
      Japan’s eventual failure was its inability to win the solid and active support of the colonial peoples
      in the territories it had “liberated” from the European powers. The Japanese slogan “Asia for the
      Asians” did inspire some local nationalist movements, but they viewed the notion of the Greater
      East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with suspicion and saw Japan as another imperialist nation. Other
      factors that contributed to Japan’s eventual defeat were: lack of resources for a long war against a
      rapidly rearmed United States and its allies; overextension of its forces over a large area against
      persistent local resistance; and the loss of its most experienced personnel in the earlier fighting.
      The atomic bombs in 1945 ended an empire which was already doomed.

Developments in Australia and New Zealand, and in the Pacific Islands 1941–2000

15.   Evaluate the policies of the governments of Australia since 1945 in dealing with aboriginals
      in Australia.

      The main changes in attitude occurred after the Second World War and then only gradually. Until
      the 1930s, the approach of all the state governments was one of “protection” whereby most
      Aboriginal people were confined to missions and reserves, largely isolated from white settlement,
      and were regarded as wards of the state. From the 1920s to the 1970s all the state governments
      pursued the policy of removing mixed race children and placing them in institutions before being
      assigned to work in menial jobs. They became known as the “Stolen Generation”. During the
      1940s and after the Second World War, the policy of “assimilation” was adopted whereby
      Aboriginal people would submit to indoctrination in white ways before taking their place in the
      general Australian community. For much of their history Australia’s major parties did not perceive
      a need to have “Aboriginal affairs” policies, but this altered in the 1960s and 1970s as the
      Aboriginal interest came to occupy a more prominent position. For a time, “integration” became a
      policy of the governments and, as attitudes changed, state governments began to amend many of the
      laws that denied Aboriginal people equality with whites, though it was hard to identify the
      distinction between “assimilation” and “integration”. In 1967, all parties supported the proposed
      Constitutional amendment which was passed in a referendum. This gave the federal government
      the right to pass laws for the welfare of the Aboriginal people and to count them in the census as
      Australians. As racial perceptions changed, (assisted by the emergence of some aboriginals into
      public view as artists, athletes and public figures, and as an aboriginal movement developed),
      legislation placing them in a position of equality was enacted. This brought further problems of
      adjustment on both sides. The situation remains complex. Relevant legislation may be state or
      federal, and developments may have occurred at a different pace in diverse areas. The Labor Party
      under Whitlam made the most positive pitch for these interests and, in 1975, they passed the
      Aboriginal Land Rights Act to restore land to indigenous people. In 1992 legislation was enacted to
      recognize native land claims and in 1998, a “National Sorry Day” was introduced to acknowledge
      the wrongs done to the “Stolen Generation”. On 13 February 2008, the new Labor Prime Minister,
      Kevin Rudd formally apologized in Parliament to the “Stolen Generation”. Award credit where
      candidates support their opinions with historical evidence, and knowledge of the specific policies
      enacted with respect to Aboriginals.

16.   ―The British Isles are half a world away; the Pacific Islands are on our doorstep.‖ To what
      extent does this statement explain New Zealand’s foreign policy after 1945?

      Candidates will probably indicate the close links with Britain and its foreign policy but that the
      relationship had changed during the post-war period. Candidates will probably agree that the
      statement explains a lot, especially once Britain proclaimed its retreat from East of Suez and sought
      to enter the EEC (finally accomplished in 1973). Relations with Britain were maintained but after
      the Second World War New Zealand moved into closer links with the United States for defence
      purposes. The Pacific War in particular caused New Zealand to realize that they could not depend
      on Britain for defence and they entered the ANZUS pact (1951) with the United States providing
      for mutual defence. The rise of Communism in East Asia presented another perceived threat and
      again New Zealand joined with others in order to meet it, this time entering the South East Asia
      Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in 1954. Both agreements assumed a policy of forward defence so
      that New Zealand sent forces to fight in Korea and later in Vietnam. New Zealand was an active
      member of the United Nations and of the British Commonwealth and economically, moved to
      closer links with Asia. A growing anti-nuclear stance in the 1970s indicated a growing sense of
      independence and closer links with its Pacific neighbours. New Zealand was instrumental in
      establishing the South Pacific Forum in 1971, which in 1999 became the Pacific Island Forum. This
      group met annually to discuss issues of mutual concern to the region such as economic development,
      tourism, trade, security and education. New Zealand’s foreign policy did not vary greatly and there
      was a degree of consensus amongst the major political parties. Much of New Zealand’s foreign
      policy was focused on the Pacific region and economic assistance was given to projects in the South
      Pacific Island states. In the late twentieth century New Zealand followed an increasingly isolationist
      policy and a strong anti-nuclear stance opposed to French and US policies in the region. Despite
      these foreign policy and economic shifts, membership of the British Commonwealth still remained
      significant to New Zealand. Candidates will have to come to a conclusion about the extent to which
      New Zealand’s foreign and economic policies altered.

Developments in South and Southeast Asia from mid twentieth century to 2000

17.   Explain how developments in both the eastern and western wings of Pakistan between 1966
      and 1971 led to civil war and the emergence of an independent Bangladeshi state.

      The key dates of 1966 and 1971 refer to the issuing of the six point programme of demands/reforms
      of the Awami League under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the intensification of
      regional demands for parity to full-blown independence in the period up to 1971. Candidates will
      probably examine the longer and shorter-term reasons why a majority population actually broke
      away to form their own independent state with the aid of an outside power (India). In addition,
      some will demonstrate relevant knowledge of the inherently inequitable treatment of the eastern
      Bengali population from 1947 onwards, in terms of the economy and linguistic policy, and how this
      resulted in a form of discrimination in the eyes of many East Pakistanis. Developments led to a
      military and political dominance for the West Pakistani elite and within the civil service.
      Candidates will probably outline the demands/grievances contained therein for the formation of an
      East Pakistan militia, a federal constitution, separate currencies etc. Candidates will be able to
      consider why the demand for autonomy had intensified to a higher level by the time of Ayub Khan,
      Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1970 to 1971. The most perceptive and knowledgeable
      answers will demonstrate not only a sound grasp of the issues which were at stake for both
      West Pakistani and East Pakistani leaders from the time of the creation of Pakistan, but are also
      likely to show an awareness of the circumstances in which the state of Pakistan came into existence
      in 1947 and the extent to which the circumstances of its creation (geographic, economic) were liable
      to lead to a viable state, considering the haste with which the subcontinent underwent the process
      of decolonisation. Credit especially those answers which are able to explain the intensification
      of regional demands for parity to full independence in the period 1966 to 1971.


18.   Compare and contrast the political, social and economic developments of any two of the
      following states in South and Southeast Asia in the second half of the twentieth century:
      the Philippines; Malaysia; Singapore; Indonesia; Sri Lanka; Burma.

      This is intentionally a broad question and candidates may choose any two states of the region from
      those given. Answers will need to have a balance between the political, social and economic
      developments of their chosen states. Expect reasoned balanced discussion based on evidence and
      knowledge.

China: the regional superpower from mid twentieth century to 2000

19.   ―The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) was Mao Zedong’s (Mao Tse-tung’s)
      last great effort to impose his will upon China.‖ To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      Mao had been sidelined after the Great Leap Forward and, by 1965, he was concerned that
      Liu Shaoqi (Liu Shao-ch’i) and other pragmatic leaders were departing from his revolutionary
      ideals. The Cultural Revolution began as Mao’s attempt to regain control of China’s media and the
      party apparatus and to discredit those he believed were revisionists leading China down the
      capitalist road. The GPCR was thus both ideological and political. Mao was also aging and hoped
      to indoctrinate the young in revolutionary ideals to discredit his rivals. Candidates may see the
      Cultural Revolution as a power struggle and/or an ideological struggle. By 1970 factions had
      developed which claimed to speak in the name of Mao and the country had descended into disorder.
      Candidates will probably agree that the GPCR was Mao’s last great effort to impose his will, but the
      best answers should show awareness of the complexity of the situation as it evolved with the more
      perceptive seeing that by the end, Mao was being used by rival factions seeking their own ends, and
      may argue that Mao had lost control of the situation. In addition to outlining the events, candidates
      may consider motives, actions and the consequences, arriving at a conclusion which should contain
      an evaluation of the validity of the statement in the title.

      Credit may be given to candidates who challenge the assumption in the question and give evidence
      to support other points of view.


20.   Evaluate the foreign policy of China’s government between 1949 and 1976.

      The question refers to the period following the takeover of power by the CCP after 1949 until the
      death of Mao in 1976, but note that the question refers to China’s government and not to Mao.
      Candidates may evaluate China’s foreign policy by weighing up the strengths and limitations of
      various policies. Areas that candidates may discuss include: 1950 Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty
      and subsequent relations with the USSR; the Sino-Soviet split; China’s involvement in the Korean
      War; the invasion of Tibet in 1950 and further consolidation of Chinese territory; the failure to
      settle the Taiwan question; China’s links to the Non-Aligned movement; China’s influence in the
      under-developed world; initial poor relations with the United States and its allies; rapprochement
      with the USA in the 1970s; lack of international recognition until the 1970s when China was
      accepted into the United Nations

      Candidates will not be able to cover everything, but should be able to provide an evaluation of the
      government’s foreign policy over the timeframe given.

Global impact of the region in the second half of the twentieth century

21.   Analyse the reasons for the success of Taiwan since 1949.

      The Nationalists established themselves on Taiwan (Formosa) in 1949 and initiated political and
      economic reforms, which had been neglected while they were in power on the mainland. A number
      of factors assisted development and growth in the country. This is not a question about economic
      success alone; therefore expect reference to diplomatic and political factors, which affect Taiwan’s
      standing in the region and the world at large. The country benefited from American protection from
      Communist China, and from the lessons learned by the Nationalist Government established there,
      after their flight from the mainland.

      Other reasons could include the following: the Nationalists who fled with Jiang Jieshi
      (Chiang Kai-shek) included many with skills and training; infrastructure and skills remained from the
      period of Japanese rule; land reform established a prosperous peasantry. By 1968 some 90 % of
      farming land was owned by those who worked it. Four Year Plans for industry produced an annual
      growth rate of 9.7 % in the ten-year period after 1963. Taiwan benefited from economic and military
      aid from the United States and from investment from Chinese people living overseas. This prosperity
      and the threat from Communist China lowered demand for political reform. Taiwan also had access
      to highly trained management and business personnel from overseas. Changes in mainland China’s
      economy since the 1980s have provided investment opportunities there for Taiwanese, but political
      and diplomatic relations remain a source of disagreement and possible tension.

      Credit answers that demonstrate sophisticated analysis of Taiwan’s success, taking into account
      factors, international, political, economic and social, which contributed to development together
      with detailed analysis of their changing relevance and importance over time.

22.   With reference to any one country of the region, examine the extent to which religion has
      played a significant role in both regional relations and world affairs in the latter half of the
      twentieth century.

      Candidates need to consider the importance of religion along with other developments in the
      country of their choice. Note that the question asks for both regional relations and world affairs so
      some awareness of the impact of the country of their choice and religion needs to be addressed for a
      high mark. Popular choices will probably be Indonesia and Burma, but reward any appropriate
      choice of country. Burma achieved independence in 1948 and factional rivalry leading to violence
      was prevalent in Burmese politics causing Ne Win to seize power in 1962 and set up a
      Revolutionary Council to govern the country. Burma became a single-party state under the Burma
      Socialist Programme Party, which created an ideology based on a mixture of Marxist and Buddhist
      principles and whose aim it was to make Burma self-sufficient. This led to economic decline,
      isolation and repression.

      Indonesia declared independence in August 1945 under President Sukarno but the war with the
      Dutch only ended in 1949 when independence was officially recognized. The new state was a
      federation of the separate islands and provinces but became a unitary state in 1950. Islam had
      played a significant role in the drive for independence and Sukarno provided charismatic leadership,
      the symbols of nationalism and the national language (Malay) were taught and opposition in the
      outer islands brought under control. Over time, Indonesia’s economic and international standing
      improved and economically the country was booming, but other problems have come with this
      rapid social and economic growth, and religion has been an important factor in the world’s largest
      Muslim state. Tensions between the Islamic majority and minority religious groups such as
      Christians in Aceh have had a significant impact. In recent times, the rise of Islamic
      fundamentalism has become an issue.

      Candidates may consider: the role of Hindu fundamentalism in India or that of Islam in Pakistan,
      Bangladesh or Malaysia; Christianity in the Philippines; or Buddhism and Christianity in Vietnam
      may also be considered. The role of religion in regional relations may be easier for candidates to
      handle but some attempt to address the broader impact must be present to reach the highest
      markbands. Credit answers which address the breadth of the question.

Social and economic developments 1945–2000

23.   In what ways, and with what results, did the role and status of women change in any one
      country of the region in the second half of the twentieth century?

      Candidates should focus on one country in the region and should demonstrate knowledge of the
      changes in women’s roles and status in that country in the second half of the twentieth century.
      Candidates will need to provide specific factual detail and evidence of the results of these changes.
      Some candidates may initially discuss the roles and status of women in the chosen country earlier in
      the century in order to establish that there was considerable change in the second half. The ways in
      which women’s roles changed may be attributed to education, greater social mobility, changing
      economic roles, access to new jobs and careers, living standards, rising expectations, government
      policies and international pressure. Changes in status came when there was a shift in social and
      cultural attitudes in society at large. The results of this may be: changes in family law; property
      rights; inheritance; political representation and participation; leadership; participation in religious
      and community affairs. Candidates may have different views as to the desirability of the changes,
      but should produce an argument based upon analysis and factual evidence.

      If only “ways” or “results” are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


24.   Assess the impact of immigration on any one country of the region between 1945 and 2000.

      Candidates may choose any one country of the region, but popular choices may be Australia or
      New Zealand. Candidates may initially discuss the nature of the society before the immigration
      began and why the immigration took place. Restricted immigration policies and racist attitudes in
      the chosen country may be discussed. The employment needs of the receiving country were often
      the reasons why immigration occurred. Immigration may have contributed to creating the country’s
      post-war prosperity because it allowed the economy to expand rapidly. Migrants were both workers
      and consumers. Social and cultural change may have become apparent by the 1980s and 1990s:
      in food and in the café culture; in liquor licensing laws; in the diversity of sports played; in the
      variety and the appreciation of all forms of the arts; in religious composition. The chosen country
      may have become a much more open and tolerant society, although there may have still been
      instances of racism and discrimination. As immigrants became more settled, their presence might
      have impacted on politics and community affairs.
