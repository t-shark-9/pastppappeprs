content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.


       0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.


       1–3:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
               appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.


       4–5:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are
               mainly inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are
               barely understood and there is minimal focus on the task.


       6–7:    Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
               limited in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will
               understanding of historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only
               partially addressed.


       8–9:    The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is
               present but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive
               in nature. There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation.
               Critical commentary may be present. There is an attempt to place events in historical
               context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a
               structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.


       10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are
              considered. Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present.
              Events are generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes,
              such as comparison and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different
              approaches and interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical
              knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.


       13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
              applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
              produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
              understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
              different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.


       16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of
              the question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is
              used as evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as
              comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
              interpretations are used appropriately and effectively.

Topic 1   Dynasties and rulers

1.   Explain the reasons for the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and the rise of the Abbasids.

     This will be a popular question. Candidates must address both parts of the question in a
     well-structured essay. Responses must address both the reasons for the fall of the Umayyad and the
     rise of the Abbasid dynasties. A simple narrative of events will not score well.

     The reasons for the fall of the Umayyads may include, but not be limited to: the ongoing struggle
     over who should lead the Islamic world. The Islamic world had divided into factions which were at
     war with each other. The Umayyads were often attacked by the Kharijites who wanted a more
     egalitarian state and not an absolute monarchy with wide disparities in wealth and power. They
     were also attacked by the Shiites who wished to have a charismatic imamate with the community
     ruled by members of the Prophet’s family. Umayyad rulers were under constant criticism and
     attack for their corruption, luxurious lifestyle and non-Islamic ways. A growing number of groups
     in the Islamic world supported the idea that the Caliph should come from the family of the Prophet.
     The Umayyads relied on military strength to remain in power and suppressed all rebellions very
     harshly. They collapsed because the economic strength of the empire was failing, the empire was
     too large for their resources and their armies were spread too thinly. Increased number of revolts
     occurred which the Umayyads were not able to suppress. The Umayyads failed to make reforms
     which added to the opposition. This resulted in the spread of the rebellion and defeat of the
     Umayyads in 750 CE.

     The reasons for the rise of the Abbasids may include, but not be limited to: their leader claimed
     descent from the family of the Prophet: this attracted support from many devout Muslims who
     resented the policies of the Umayyad. The Abbasids had gained the support of non-Arab and non-
     Muslim populations who resented the Umayyad polices. The Abbasids promised a return to
     traditional values in Islam and a theocratic state as opposed to the Umayyads whom they claimed
     had become non-Islamic in their desire for absolute power. Their policies promised to be socially
     egalitarian and economically less differential between Arab and non-Arab Muslims.


2.   Analyse the extent to which any one of the following can be considered a successful ruler:
     Charlemagne (768–814); Louis VI of France (1108–1137); Harun al-Rashid (786–809);
     „Abd al-Rahman III of Spain (912–961).

     This will be a popular question. Candidates must state clearly their position on the issue of whether
     their chosen ruler may be considered successful and to what extent. Responses must be analytical
     in format and supported by accurate relevant examples.

     Determining whether a ruler was successful or not may involve a wide range of points which may
     differ somewhat depending on the leader chosen. Some of the elements to consider may include,
     but not be limited to: foreign policy – territorial acquisition or defence, economic prosperity,
     absence of internal strife, expansion of the ruler’s authority, development of legal codes and
     administrative structures, cultural and intellectual development.      Relations with religious
     authorities. Establishing a peaceful transfer of power or succession.
                                                   –5–                 N12/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   “Henry II of England (1154–1189) was successful in establishing and maintaining his
     authority because of his military skill.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates must assess the reasons for Henry II’s success in establishing and maintaining his
     authority as king.

     Candidates must produce an analytical response which states clearly their position and the reasons
     for it. All responses must be supported by relevant and accurate content. Many candidates will
     recognize that Henry used a variety of methods to establish and maintain his authority.

     The military reasons for Henry’s authority may include his successful campaigns in France which
     brought him prestige, wealth and removed opponents. His campaigns also allowed him to reward
     his followers who then supported his authority. His destruction of the power of nobles in England,
     specifically their castles. His ability to prevent the loss of territory to his enemy the King of France.
     His suppression of rebellion and extension of his rule into Wales and Ireland further increased his
     power. The weakness and disunity of his opponents and his own great military skill was also
     important.

     The non-military methods may include, but not be limited to: his administrative and judicial
     reforms increased the power and influence of his government. The establishment of the common
     law and the influence of royal judges were crucial. His oversight of the sheriffs and other officials
     to ensure their loyalty and support was also crucial to the extension of his power. The expansion of
     the royal bureaucracy increased his ability to pass laws, supervise the nobles and collect revenues,
     all of which increased his influence and power.


4.   Assess the role of laws, both secular and religious, in establishing the authority of medieval
     rulers.

     Candidates must be able to analyse the ways in which laws in all forms were used to support the
     position and power of the ruler. This will require a knowledge of the different types of laws in
     existence as well as how they were applied.

     The types of laws that were commonly found would include, but not be limited to: unwritten laws
     based on custom and tradition used to govern the lives of ordinary people, statutes written by rulers
     to establish rules in a society (some original, others adapted from surviving Roman codes). Laws
     and statutes written by the clergy to govern the behaviour of the religious community – not only
     articles of faith but moral codes and rules for behaviour in everyday life.

     Rulers used laws which supported the concept of authority and hierarchy to support their positions.
     They created statute law to further support their authority and created a judicial system which
     would enforce these laws throughout their territories. Royal judges and bureaucrats were used to
     enforce laws and ensure that only the central government could dispense justice. Other forms of
     law were eliminated if they clashed with the needs of the ruler.
     Rulers did use customary or unwritten laws as well especially those which gave power, authority
     and respect to military leaders and land-owners.

     Religious laws also supported rulers as the church supported the concept of hierarchy and obedience
     to superiors and taught that obedience to one’s overlords, both secular and religious, was a
     necessary duty, rebellion was a sin.
                                                   –6–                 N12/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     The Church also sided with rulers in their efforts to increase authority as the Church needed the
     protection and support of rulers to carry out its work, especially in the early medieval period.
     Hence religious laws served to reinforce the desires of rulers for authority over their subjects.


5.   Examine the successes and failures of one female ruler.

     Female rulers were few in number during the medieval period. Their problems, successes and
     failures as rulers mirrored those of male rulers in a number of ways but their gender may have
     added complications to their attempts to rule effectively.

     Candidates must examine both successes and failures of the chosen ruler. Popular examples will be
     Eleanor of Aquitaine, Matilda of England and Blanche of Castile.

     The range of topics to be considered may range from political and economic to social and cultural.
     In addition, the ability of the rulers to influence events such as the Crusades, other wars, or artistic,
     cultural or religious developments may be considered. Their linkage to royal households would
     also be a consideration.


6.   Medieval European and Islamic rulers faced a number of challenges to their authority.
     With reference to one ruler, identify these challenges and assess how effectively they were
     dealt with.

     This will be a popular question.

     The challenges faced by medieval rulers may include, but not be limited to: rival claimants for the
     throne, opposition to their policies from powerful groups in society: nobles, urban areas, tribal
     groups, military factions. Family disputes over power and authority, external invasions, opposition
     from powerful institutions such as religious organizations or individuals. Natural disasters, plagues,
     famines, etc. may have weakened their position and increased opposition.

     Ways in which rulers dealt with challenges may include, but not be limited to: physical elimination
     of rival candidates, alliances with powerful groups in society to increase their power, creation of
     new laws, administrative and taxation structures to increase their influence, wealth and power.
     Developing policies to gain the support of religious leaders and organizations. Development of
     powerful military force to suppress any armed opposition. Successful conquest of new territories to
     add to their prestige, power and wealth. Marriage alliances to increase power or pacify opposing
     groups.

     Responses must address both the challenges faced and how effectively they were dealt with.
     Responses must be in the proper analytical format, supported by relevant, accurate detail.
                                                  –7–                N12/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 2   Society and economy

7.   Explain the reasons for the development of urban areas in medieval Europe.

     This question requires that candidates demonstrate an understanding of the various social and
     economic factors in medieval life that led to the development of urban areas.

     The reasons may include, but not be limited to: settlements which grew up around government,
     military or religious centres in order to provide them with supplies, food, equipment and manpower
     for various tasks. The growth of trade, both local and long distance, created centres for markets and
     production of goods, which led to the formation of guilds and a need for increased labour in these
     places.

     The increase in overseas trade with the East as well as the textile trade and groups such as the
     Hanseatic League created port cities and shipping centres with large urban populations earning their
     money from trade. Changes in agriculture created excess rural population which had to move to
     towns to gain employment. Towns were also populated by runaway serfs seeking their freedom.
     Monarchs encouraged the growth of towns as sources of revenue as well as allies in their struggle
     against the nobility.

     Candidates may point out that many towns continued to exist after the fall of the Roman Empire in
     Italy and the Low Countries where feudalism was weak. In this case they should comment on why
     these towns expanded during the medieval period. The role of ports leading to exchange of goods
     and ideas may also be considered.


8.   Assess the contributions of women to the society and economy of Islam.

     Candidates should identify and assess the significance of the contributions of women to both
     Islamic society and to the economic life of the Islamic world.

     Responses must be well-structured and supported by relevant, accurate content.

     The economic roles of women may include, but not be limited to: agriculture, textile industry, many
     areas of which were dominated by women. In addition, women owned and administered their own
     businesses and property. Other women invested in business enterprises.
     Women had rights to own and inherit property in Islam and as such could take part in business and
     commercial activities. Other women were employed in the service industry as teachers, nurses,
     doctors. Islamic hospitals had female doctors and nurses. Other women found employment as
     entertainers, musicians etc.

     In the social role, women had a prominent place in education as founders of mosques and madrasas,
     scholars, teachers. There was a large increase in female scholars and teachers between the twelfth
     and fifteenth centuries.

     They also had important roles in family life. Their influence would vary depending on the wealth
     status and location of the family.

     Candidates might note that women’s contributions were limited largely to the economic and social
     spheres as they were not permitted to be take an active role in politics. Some of the women wielded
     significant political power through male proxies.
                                                   –8–                N12/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


9.    Analyse the roles of places of worship in the social and economic life of medieval Europe.

      Places of worship may be taken to include: churches, cathedrals, abbeys, shrines and places of
      pilgrimage.

      Candidates must demonstrate an awareness of a variety of ways in which these places impacted the
      social and economic life of people in medieval Europe. Responses must be well-structured and
      contain accurate and relevant detail.

      The economic roles may include, but not be limited to: the construction of places of worship
      provided extensive employment for skilled and unskilled labour as well as supporting the
      development of trade and commerce. In addition, the building of large complex structures greatly
      advanced the technical knowledge of the society. Supplying the needs for food, clothing, luxury
      goods, furniture, etc. of places of worship provided regular economic opportunity to the population.
      Places of worship contributed significantly to the agricultural development and production.
      Supplying pilgrims with food, shelter, and other materials was a lucrative industry in many areas.
      Churches etc. were wealthy as a result of tithes, offerings and other sources of revenue. The ways
      in which they used this wealth could have a large economic impact and social status.

      The social role may include, but not be limited to: places of worship provided education, charity,
      counselling and medical assistance to many in society. They organized many of the celebrations
      and leisure activities of the common people. They provided social meeting places, centres for
      activities for women and children as well as carrying out weddings, funerals and other significant
      family and social events. Their buildings provided shelter in times of war, natural disasters,
      famines, etc.


10.   Why did trade flourish in the Islamic world?

      There are a great number of reasons for the growth and success of trade in the Islamic world. These
      may include, but not be limited to: the creation of a large empire under one government created a
      large economic unit, movement was easy throughout the empire for people and goods, the large
      cities, prosperous countryside and the existence of a well-ordered state encouraged the production
      and movement of goods, the empire stretched from the Mediterranean to the Indian ocean which
      allowed for the development and exchange of many new products and ideas for production and
      encouraged long-distance trade. The existence of a credit system and a stable currency based on
      gold encouraged commerce. The development of new agricultural products and the expansion into
      new territories further encouraged trade. Development of sea routes was also a major factor. The
      social structure of Islam was also a factor as merchants were recognized and respected in the
      Islamic world unlike in medieval Europe. Muslims, as well as non-Muslims, actively participated
      in trading activities, particularly in the Mediterranean.

      Candidates must produce a well-structured essay with accurate, relevant content. Essays must be
      analytic in nature not simply descriptive or narrative. Accounts of the lives of individual merchants
      will not score well.
                                                   –9–                 N12/3/HISTI/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


11.   Explain the design of the model Islamic city.

      The model Islamic city was designed to recognize the distinct elements in daily life and to give each
      its own distinct area in which to function. In addition, residential areas based on differences in
      class, ethnicity, wealth and religion were also laid out as a matter of security and respect for
      differences.

      The fundamental elements were a design which provided for distinct and separate complexes of
      buildings based on function and purpose. These would include the mosque and the buildings
      surrounding and related to it, such as religious schools, religious courts, shrines and shops for holy
      or sacred objects. The marketplace or suq containing the shops, warehouses and banks.
      Government buildings devoted to the police, watchmen and other officials in charge of security.

      Workshops and manufacturing would be on the outskirts of the city. The residential quarters would
      be near or outside the walls. These would be divided by wealth, occupation, ethnicity, kinship and
      religion. These areas would be guarded and protected by gates and walls.

      The most noisy, malodorous work such as butchery and tanning would be furthest from the centre,
      usually near the poor quarters.

      Royal palaces were not located in the city. The rulers wished to control the city but not be too close
      to it for security and health reasons. They maintained their troops, courts and other royal functions
      outside the city.

12.   “The non-economic contributions of women to medieval European society were as important
      as the economic ones.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates will have to display knowledge of both the economic and non-economic roles of women
      and make a judgment as to their relative importance. Response must be well structured and
      supported with relevant detail.

      The economic importance of women is very large in medieval times. They worked on the land,
      operated businesses, workshops and were merchants and retailers in many areas. Some were master
      craftsmen and operated manufacturing establishments on a vast scale. The medieval economy
      would not have functioned very well without the labour, skill and knowledge of women.

      Their non-economic roles were also critical; women of the upper classes were responsible for
      managing their husband’s estates during his absence including conducting the defence of the manor
      in case of attack. Women played a leading role in the education of children much of which was
      done at home. Household management was a key responsibility, from organizing production of
      food, clothing and furnishings to hiring the servants and overseeing the management of the estate.

      Lower class women had similar responsibilities on a much smaller scale but the management of the
      mundane but crucial details of everyday family life usually fell to them.

      Other roles for women included joining religious orders in which they became teachers, providers
      of care to the poor and sick. Many aristocratic women became the inspiration for literature, poetry
      and the whole chivalric tradition of courtly love. Individuals such as Eleanor of Aquitaine were
      rulers in their own right and also were great supporters of culture, artists and musicians. In rare
      cases women even took to the battlefield as, for example, in the case of Joan of Arc, Joan of
      Flanders and others.

Topic 3     Wars and warfare

13.   “Religious differences were not a major cause of the Islamic civil wars (fitna) in the seventh
      century.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This will be a popular question. Candidates must develop a clear thesis with respect to the
      quotation. Responses must be analytical in nature and supported by accurate relevant content.
      Simple narratives about the events of the wars or the individuals involved, will not score well.

      The non-religious causes of the wars may include, but not be limited to: ongoing dissension in the
      Islamic world about how caliphs should be chosen, ongoing disputes about the division of the spoils
      of the conquests, the divisions caused by the policies of Caliph Uthman particularly with respect to
      his appointment of officials, the resentment of the families of Medina who feared a loss of
      influence. A major issue was a dispute over whether the Islamic world should be ruled by central
      government controlled by an absolute monarch or should be governed in the traditional way by a
      council of the leaders of the various tribes.

      Candidates may note that the second fitna had similar causes but may include the issue of hereditary
      succession, the resentment of traditional Islamic centres such as Mecca and Medina about their loss
      of power to Damascus and other centres. The attempt of Husain, grandson of Muhammad to seize
      power as the rightful leader was another cause of the second fitna.

      The immediate cause of the first war was the assassination of Uthman and the seizure of power by
      Ali who represented traditional values, the families of Medina and enemies of the Umayyad family.

      Ali was opposed by Mu’awiyah the governor of Syria who had the support of those wanting strong
      central government as provided by Uthman.

      Religious causes of the war may include, but not be limited to: resentment by religious individuals
      about the change of Islam from a religious state to a more secular and imperial one. Disputes over
      the succession which some wished to be based on religious devotion and connection to Muhammad
      rather than political and military power. Members of Muhammad’s family were regarded as
      divinely selected to succeed the Prophet.

      The rise of the Kharijites showed the hostility of those wishing to preserve strict religious values
      against the more secular rulers who were emerging.


14.   Assess the impact of the Hundred Years War (1337–1396) on either England or France.

      The topics that may be considered under the impact of this war in either country may include, but
      not be limited to: physical destruction, economic impacts including costs, rewards and changes in
      taxation, territorial gains or losses, population changes, effect on the status and power of the rulers,
      political effects including unrest, uprising, protests as a result of the war. The development of a
      sense of nationalism in both countries.

      Candidates must choose one country to discuss and then select the areas in which the war had an
      impact. They should choose a range of topics to assess such as economic, political, social and
      should not limit themselves to a single area. The nature and extent of the impact of the topics
      chosen must be made clear.

      Response must be well-structured and supported by relevant, accurate content. Simple narratives of
      events, battles, etc. will not score well.

15.   Analyse the causes of the Muslim defeat by Christian Europe during the First Crusade
      (1095–1099).

      This will be a popular question. Candidates should recognize that reasons for the Muslim defeat
      will include both Muslim problems or weaknesses and Christian strengths or advantages.
      Strong response will include elements of both in varying degrees. Responses must be analytical in
      nature and contain accurate relevant content. Simple narrative accounts of the events of the First
      Crusade will not score well.

      The reasons for Muslim weakness may include, but not be limited to: the fragmentation of the
      Seljuk Empire in 1092 caused a power vacuum and created internal struggles. The Islamic world
      was divided into many small states as local rulers sought to increase their power, often through war
      with their neighbours. The Fatimid Empire attacked Seljuk holdings in Syria and Lebanon which
      further divided the Islamic world. The Sunni/Shia division created a schism which made unified
      action against the Christians more difficult, there were Christian communities in the Middle East
      which would ally themselves with the invaders. Some Islamic rulers cooperated with the invaders
      in order to defeat some of their Islamic opponents. Tactical errors by Muslim commanders which
      occurred at the siege of Antioch.

      The Christian advantages may include, but not be limited to: their skills as professional soldiers
      bringing new tactics to the Middle East, the skills of their military leaders, their religious fervour
      which inspired their efforts, the assistance of the Byzantine Empire, inspirational events such as the
      discovery of the “Holy Lance of Antioch”.


16.   “Non-military reasons were more important than military ones in explaining the Islamic
      conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries.” To what extent do you agree with this
      statement?

      This will be a popular question. There are a large number of reasons which explain the successful
      conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries. Candidates must take a position on the relative
      importance of the military vs. the non-military reasons (social, political, economic, religious) for the
      conquests.

      Responses must be analytical in nature and contain accurate, relevant content. Narrative accounts
      of the events of the conquest will not score well.

      The military reasons for the conquests may include, but not be limited to: the organization and
      discipline of the Muslim forces, their wide experience and skill in warfare, the skill of their leaders,
      their high morale and determination to succeed. The development of new tactics to take advantage
      of their particular skills and weaponry.

      The non-military reasons may include, but not be limited to: the weakness of the Byzantine and
      Persian Empires as a result of wars against each other, the unpopularity of the Byzantines in the
      eyes of their subjects due to economic and religious policies which were seen as oppressive, the
      tolerant religious policies of Islam attracted many supporters in the conquered land and increased
      the size of the Muslim forces. Christians and Jews gave their support to Islam and deserted their
      former rulers. The Muslim religion gave a great degree of inspiration and confidence to the Muslim
      soldiers.

17.   “The most important cause of wars in medieval Europe was the desire of rulers for more
      territory.” With reference to two wars, explain to what extent you agree with this statement.

      Candidates must select two medieval wars. There are a great number to choose from between
      500 AD and 1500 AD. Popular choices will be the Crusades, the Reconquista, the Hundred Years
      War, England versus France in the twelfth century as well as the wars of Charlemagne, Charles
      Martel and the Holy Roman Emperors.

      In each case, candidates must analyse the causes of the war and show to what extent they feel that
      desire for territory was the principal motive. Candidates may challenge the question and attempt to
      demonstrate that territory had no part in causing the wars that they selected. Responses must be
      analytical in nature and contain relevant and accurate content.

      The other major causes of medieval wars that candidates may wish to mention or emphasize in their
      responses would include, but not be limited to: religion both against heretics or infidels, family or
      dynastic disputes, attempts of monarchs to increase their political power versus nobles or others,
      nomadic invasions or other forms of population movement or migration, struggle for trade routes or
      raw materials. Wars caused by disputes over inheritances or the recognition of a ruler as legitimate.


18.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the Norman conquest of England (1066).

      Candidates must address both parts of the question.

      The reasons for the Norman conquest of England would include, but not be limited to: the claim of
      William to the throne of England, the support provided by the Pope to William’s cause, the military
      strength and wealth of the Duchy of Normandy and the loyalty of William’s vassals. In addition the
      English military problem of having to oppose both a Danish invasion and then meet the invading
      army of William. The lack of discipline of the English militia, the Norman tactics, as well as the
      use of cavalry by William, were factors in the victory.

      The results would include, but not be limited to: William became King of England, Norman laws
      and administration replaced the Anglo-Saxon system. Anglo-Saxons were removed from their land
      and replaced by Norman vassals. The governmental system of the Duchy of Normandy was
      imposed on England. Anglo-Saxons were relegated to a lower social, economic and political status.
      William established himself and his family in firm control of England and used his military force as
      a method to expand his authority. The victory at Hastings made the mounted knight the most
      powerful force on the battlefield.

Topic 4    Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   Explain the reasons for, and the results of, increasing literacy in medieval Europe.

      Candidates must address both reasons and results. Responses must be well structured and contain
      relevant and accurate detail.

      The reasons for increased literacy may include, but not be limited to: the growth of the Church and
      monastic orders that increased the need to educate priests and monks, the increase in schools and
      centres of learning run by monks and priests which educated large numbers of laymen, the
      development of Carolingian miniscule, an easier script to read and write, the demand for more
      literate layman by governments and commercial interests, In addition, increasing wealth allowed
      more leisure time for the education of children and adults. The founding of universities placed
      greater emphasis on knowledge and the need to acquire literacy skills. Libraries became larger as
      did the desire for wider knowledge of history, law, medicine and philosophy particularly as classical
      knowledge began to enter Europe. The development of vernacular literature was both a cause of
      and result of increased literacy as people wished to acquire books and read in their own language.
      The printing press was the major boost to increased literacy as books became more common and
      easier to read.

      The results of increased literacy was greater interest in knowledge which led to further inquiries
      about the world and contributed to movements such as the twelfth century renaissance.
      Governments and merchants able to develop better administrative practices as they had better
      educated and literate clerks to maintain records, keep accounts. Knowledge became standardized
      and more widespread as books increased and were circulated. Intellectual curiosity based on the
      reading of ancient texts and the work of individual scholars led to challenges to religion, greater
      interest in science, the growth of universities and an intellectual class.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


20.   Examine the role of the great mosques in intellectual and cultural development.

      Candidates must be able to develop a well-supported essay which clearly demonstrates the various
      roles played by the great mosques in Islamic society. Relevant and accurate content is essential for
      a strong response.

      The roles played by the great mosques would include, but not be limited to: places of study – a
      number of schools and universities developed in and around the great mosques as the centres of
      intellectual life and religious scholarship. These schools and universities expanded scholarship in
      religious subjects, science, medicine as well as literature. They were the centres for the display of
      art and the inspiration for the further development of Islamic art forms. Their architecture and that
      of the buildings which surrounded them provided models of various schools of architecture,
      examples of which spread throughout the Islamic world. They symbolized the power, wealth, and
      influence of the Islamic world in a great number of cultural and intellectual areas. They encouraged
      the development of various styles of Arabic calligraphy as well as styles of recitation of the Qur’an.

21.   For what reasons, and with what results, did an intellectual golden age occur in the Islamic
      world between the tenth and fourteenth centuries?

      The reasons for the intellectual flowering in this period may include, but not be limited to: the
      wealth of knowledge that had been inherited and acquired by the Muslim world as a result of the
      conquest and their expansion across a wide range of territory and cultures, the respect for
      scholarship established through the religious schools and madrasas developed a large number of
      scholars who were highly respected. Islam had no hostility to scientific inquiry and in fact
      welcomed it as an aide to travel and trade. The impetus in the Qur’an and in the sayings of Prophet
      Muhammad to seek knowledge from all sources, created the quest for learning.

      By the tenth century the wealth of the Islamic world had led to the founding of universities and
      centres of study in many parts under Muslim rule. These incorporated knowledge from their local
      areas such as Persia and India and developed it further. The foundation of houses of wisdom and
      universities multiplied the level of scholars and intellectual debates. The lack of a strong central
      government encouraged a degree of independence and variety in intellectual inquiry supported by
      local dynasties and rulers. The Fatimids were particularly strong in their support of intellectual
      development – Cairo became the leading academic centre in Islam. The Islamic toleration of other
      faiths attracted scholars who added to the intellectual development and growth. Spain would be an
      excellent example.

      The results may include, but not be limited to: the Muslim world was the intellectual centre in
      science, medicine, mathematics and industry. The number of Islamic philosophers and theologians
      increased and some of the most famous lived in this era. Literature, poetry and the arts reached
      great heights as new styles and writers emerged.
      Muslim intellectual achievements became the inspiration for the expansion and modernization of
      knowledge and attitudes in Europe beginning with the twelfth century renaissance and the Crusades.

22.   “The medieval Church discouraged intellectual development in Europe.” To what extent do
      you agree with this statement?

      Candidates must demonstrate knowledge of the varied role that the Church played in intellectual
      development. Candidates may wish to demonstrate that the Church may have both supported and
      hindered intellectual development or they may choose to emphasize one or the other of these
      tendencies and pay less attention to the other. In any event they should be able to recognize that the
      Church’s role in intellectual development was central throughout the period.

      The Church’s role may include, but not be limited to: the foundation of all education and
      educational institutions in the medieval period as well as the creation and maintenance of libraries
      and the production of texts on many subjects. All the great intellects of the medieval period were
      churchmen, universities were staffed by priests and monks. Much of the knowledge of the classical
      world preserved by Islamic scholars was brought to Europe by clerics.

      Many advances in science, philosophy, literature, etc. were the result of clerics such as Roger
      Bacon, Aquinas, Abelard to name a few.

      The role of the Church as a hindrance to intellectual development may be seen in its opposition to
      some aspects of scientific inquiry, its rejection of the challenges of individuals such as Abelard and
      its difficulty in incorporating and accepting the work of Aristotle and other classical and Islamic
      scholars into its beliefs and academic curricula.

      The Church was seen as standing in the way of progress, particularly scientific progress, where new
      ideas clashed with long accepted views of the world. Copernicus is a good example.


23.   Assess the impact of universities on medieval Europe.

      Candidates must address and deal specifically with their impact and influence.

      Responses must be well-structured and supported by accurate, relevant content.

      The impact of universities in medieval Europe may include, but not be limited to: they had a
      powerful influence on theology and canon law. They taught law and trained lawyers in both canon
      and civil law. They trained doctors as well as the new bureaucrats who were administering
      European states. They resurrected classical knowledge and re-introduced the ideas of Aristotle and
      Plato through their relations with the Islamic world. They were centres of learning in science and
      philosophy where new ideas were discussed and adopted. They produced the teachers, writers and
      philosophers who changed opinions and made advances in many areas. Individuals such as Bacon,
      Abelard, Aquinas all taught at universities and influenced many people.

24.   “Without the scholars of Islam there would not have been a twelfth century renaissance.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question deals with the origins of the twelfth century renaissance. Candidates will have to
      assess to what degree the twelfth century renaissance was the result of the arrival of classical
      knowledge by way of the Muslim regime in Spain and how much can be explained from European
      sources independent of the classical influx from Spain.

      The importance of the influx of material, particularly after 1085 and the fall of Toledo, is well
      known. Europe received vast amounts of material by Aristotle, Plato and other Greek and Roman
      scholars in a wide range of disciplines: science, medicine, ethics, metaphysics, philosophy,
      mathematics. In addition, important work in science, medicine, mathematics and related disciplines
      produced by Islamic scholars was also imported. This material created an intellectual ferment on
      many fronts and led to the intellectual developments and changes that are referred to as the twelfth
      century renaissance.

      However, students may wish to point out that new ideas and challenges to traditional views were
      emerging as a result of the study of Roman texts in law, medicine and other disciplines, particularly
      in Italy. The founding of early universities and other academic centres in Italy contributed to the
      origins of the Renaissance. The work of individuals such as Peter Abelard may also be considered.
      In addition, the increase in the wealth of Europe was leading to a more secularized view of the
      world and giving more scope to individuals wishing to inquire into the nature of the world on many
      fronts. The Crusades helped to expose Europeans to many new influences and may also have
      played a role in stimulating curiosity and a thirst for knowledge.

Topic 5    Religion and the state

25.   With reference to two Islamic religious groups or sects, explain how the Islamic world was
      affected by disputes between them and the state.

      Candidates must identify two religious groups who opposed the activities of the state as represented
      by the Caliphs and explain how their beliefs, actions or influence had an effect on Islamic society.

      Responses must be analytical in nature and supported by relevant examples. A simple list of
      opposition groups or their beliefs will not score well.

      Popular groups might include, but not be limited to: Kharijites, Carmathians, Shiites, Sufis,
      Ismailis, Assassins.

      Candidates must briefly explain the beliefs or policies of these groups and then specify the impact
      that they had.

      These impacts may include, but not be limited to: civil wars, uprisings and other violent events,
      struggles for political power, persecution of one group by another, heightened spiritual awareness in
      the population, political breakdown of the Empire into smaller groups, new schools of law and
      interpretations of religious doctrines, division and weakening of the Islamic world in the face of
      external enemies.


26.   Explain the origins of, and the contributions to medieval life, of one itinerant or monastic
      order.

      Candidates must deal with both parts of the question.

      Candidates must identify the reasons for the founding of the chosen order. These may include, but
      not be limited to: the personality and character of the founder, the historical circumstances which
      influenced the founding of the order, the attitude of the Church hierarchy, the condition of the
      Church at the time of the founding of the order and the need that may have existed for such an order
      in the eyes of the Church or the public.

      The contributions will depend on the order chosen but they may include, but not be limited to:
      preachers, missionaries, teachers, inquisitors, providers of charity and medical care to pilgrims and
      the public, models of spirituality and piety. They operated orphanages, hospitals, schools, libraries
      and helped improve agriculture and husbandry. The military orders played a key role in the
      crusades and pilgrimages.

      If only origins or contributions are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

27.   Explain the role of the ulama in the Islamic world.

      Candidates should be able to identify the various roles played by the ulama and their importance in
      the period that they have studied. Responses must be well-structured and supported by relevant,
      accurate content. A simple list of responsibilities or roles will not score well.

      The ulama refers to the body of legal scholars: experts in religious studies and in a broad sense
      refers to the Islamic clergy from the lowest to highest level. They became a class of professional
      religious scholars.

      The ulama were responsible for the development of Islamic law. They wrote the texts,
      commentaries and explanations of the Holy law. They acted as lawyers, judges, and teachers with
      respect to understanding and enforcing Islamic law.

      They were not part of the state bureaucracy in the early years. They were often opponents of the
      state which they saw as sinful and not following Islam. Their moral position gave them enormous
      authority and respect from the population who relied on them for advice and decisions on a broad
      range of social and personal matters. The state recognized their power and gave them control of all
      matters covered by the Holy Law.

      They were able to influence rulers who required their support by demanding that rulers govern in
      accord with Islamic principles. Their popularity amongst the population gave them considerable
      power.

      Rulers were anxious to have their support and tried to involve them as part of government
      administration. This was not very successful as they remained aloof.

      By the twelfth century their roles were changing as more of the ulama began to participate in
      government. They became an arm of the government and as such added to its power and authority.
      Their role as respected religious leaders free of corruption was to some degree assumed by other
      groups such as the Sufi.

28.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Henry II of England engage in a dispute with
      Thomas Becket?

      Candidates must assess both parts of the question.       Responses must be well-structured and
      supported by relevant detail.

      The causes of the dispute can be characterized as both personal and political. These may include,
      but not be limited to: Becket was the king’s chancellor and friend who was appointed to be
      Archbishop of Canterbury in the belief that he would make the Church obedient to the king. When
      this did not happen, Henry felt betrayed by his friend which increased his anger and deepened the
      dispute. The other personal reason for the dispute was that both men were very stubborn and
      unwilling to compromise which prevented an agreement.

      The causes of the dispute involved the king’s desire to have control over the Church, lands,
      appointment of bishops and revenues. This was opposed by the Church which wished to be free of
      royal control and exercise its authority without secular involvement.

      The specific issue arose over the treatment of “criminious clerks”. Henry wanted churchmen
      convicted of crimes to be punished by the royal courts. Becket objected and insisted that they
      should be punished in church courts only. This was a conflict of royal versus church authority.

      Henry had the support of all the bishops except Becket. Henry was enraged and Becket went into
      exile, appealed to the pope and excommunicated supporters of the king.

      Henry retaliated by having his eldest son crowned by the Archbishop of York instead of Becket as
      head of the Church. Becket was outraged and excommunicated more of the king’s supporters.

      A temporary truce brought Becket back to England but he refused to compromise. The king was
      outraged and several of his knights killed Becket.

      The results of the dispute may include, but not be limited to: Becket became a martyr which
      undermined the King’s power and popularity to some degree, Becket became a saint and
      Canterbury was the most important place of pilgrimage in England. The king suffered no real
      penalty, he was reconciled with the pope in exchange for a very light penance. The king was forced
      to yield on the original issue of punishment for churchmen accused of crimes, the papacy now
      became directly involved in the affairs of the English Church and thus increased its power to
      intervene in both religious and secular matters. Henry’s loss of popularity over the Becket affair
      encouraged his wife and sons to rebel against him, further weakening the Angevin commonwealth.

29.   For what reasons, and with what results, did Islam practice toleration towards Christians and
      Jews?

      Candidates must deal with both parts of the question in a well-structured and supported essay.

      The reasons for toleration towards Christians and Jews may include, but not be limited to: Arab
      tradition supported the protection of weaker subjects, Christians and Jews were People of the Book
      and therefore not pagans who were not tolerated. There were pragmatic reasons also, non-Muslim
      subjects had to pay taxes which Muslims did not – conversion would weaken the revenue of the
      Islamic Empire. Mass conversions would have weakened the Arab nature of Islam and undermined
      the faith. Islam saw itself as part of the Abrahamic tradition, and therefore viewed Judaism and
      Christianity as part of a Monotheistic fraternity.

      The results of religious toleration may include, but not be limited to: many Jews and Christians
      deserted their rulers to support the Muslim state, this aided the conquest by the Islamic army and
      weakened their Persian and Byzantine opponents. Jews and Christians lent their expertise to
      Islamic rulers as bureaucrats. Jewish and Christian scholars expanded Arab knowledge in many
      fields and contributed to the intellectual power of the Islamic world. Christians and Jews had been
      among the indigenous populace which Muslims came to rule. Many individuals migrated to the
      Islamic Empire bringing a wide variety of skills. The toleration policy helped preserve peace in the
      Empire and increased the power of the rulers. Muslim, Jewish and Christian cooperation produced
      wealthy, advanced and highly cultured societies such as Muslim Spain and Fatimid Egypt.

      On the negative side, the existence of some Christian communities in the Middle East during the
      Crusading period may have helped undermine Islamic power, as was also the case in Spain.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


30.   Why did anti-Semitism exist in medieval Europe?

      Responses must be well-structured and supported by relevant and accurate content.

      The reasons for anti-Semitism may include, but not be limited to: ignorance and superstition
      resulted in Jews being accused of devil-worship, ritual murder of Christians (especially children).
      Their different clothing and customs provoked further fear and resentment. The rise of religious
      fervour surrounding the Crusades resulted in them being attacked as enemies of Christianity.
      Increased concern over heresy in Europe led to attacks on them as well. Their role as money-
      lenders led to resentment and persecution by rulers, nobles and the general public. They were often
      used as scapegoats by medieval rulers anxious to deflect public anger from themselves or explain
      catastrophes such as the Black Death.
