Answer three questions. Each question must be selected from a different optional theme. (Do not answer
two questions on the same optional theme.)

Wherever possible, answers should include case studies and examples, and where relevant, large, well
drawn maps and diagrams.

Optional Theme A — Freshwater – issues and conflicts

1.    (a)   Describe two processes involved in the transport of a river’s load.                                      [2+2]

      (b)   Explain two environmental impacts of agriculture on water quality.                                       [3+3]

      (c)   “Floodplain management strategies have more costs than benefits.”  Discuss this
            statement.                                                                                                [10]



2.    The diagram shows the response of a stream in an urban area compared with that of a stream in
      a neighbouring forested area after the same rainstorm event. (The basins are of similar size and
      drainage density.)

                                                               Urban versus Forested Storm Hydrographs

            responses to the storm event.                                                                              [6]
