                       An explanation that they are taxes on goods and services (or
                       expenditure taxes or consumption taxes).

           (ii)   price inelastic (paragraph ).                                                 [2 marks]

                        a change in the price of a product leads to a proportionately smaller
                         change in the quantity (demanded)
                        PED is less than 1
                        % change in quantity (demanded) is less than % change in price.

              For drawing a correctly labelled negative consumption externality diagram
              with MPB to the right of MSB and an indication of a negative externality or
              for providing an explanation that the consumption of unhealthy foods
              creates external costs in the form of higher health care costs for everyone in
              society.

      2       Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4

              with MPB to the right of MSB and an indication of a negative externality
              and for providing an explanation that the consumption of unhealthy foods
              creates external costs in the form of higher health care costs for everyone in
              society.

      For full marks, candidates must recognise that there are external costs, not just
      the health costs to the overweight themselves.

      Candidates may provide a negative production externality diagram with the MSC
      to the left of MPC and the free market equilibrium to the right of the socially
      efficient level of output. If this is correctly labelled and explained in terms of the
      external costs to society, then full marks may be awarded.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      The vertical axis may be price (or P) or costs and benefits. The horizontal axis
      may be output or quantity (or Q). A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain how a tax on foods with a high fat
      content is expected to impact on the market for substitute products with a
      lower fat content (paragraph ).                                           [4 marks]

              For drawing a correctly labelled supply and demand diagram for substitute
              products showing a rightward shift in the demand curve, resulting in higher
              equilibrium price and quantity or for explaining that the tax leads to lower
              quantity demanded of high-fat foods and therefore an increase in demand
              for substitute products which are now relatively cheaper.

      2       Correct application of appropriate theory                                       3–4
              For drawing a correctly labelled supply and demand diagram for substitute
              products showing a rightward shift in the demand curve, resulting in higher
              equilibrium price and quantity and for explaining that the tax leads to lower
              quantity demanded of high-fat foods and therefore an increase in demand
              for substitute products which are now relatively cheaper.

      Another approach would be to illustrate the effect of a tax on foods with a high fat
      content (decrease in supply) resulting in a decrease in the quantity of fatty foods
      demanded and an explanation that this would lead to an increase in demand for
      substitute products. If this diagram is accurately drawn, with an appropriate
      explanation, then it may be awarded full marks.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely consequences of indirect taxes applied to junk food and
      sugary drinks.                                                              [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       explanation of how indirect taxes increase the price paid by consumers, causing
        a decrease in the quantity demanded and/or a switch to relatively cheaper
        products
       a diagram illustrating the effect of an indirect tax.

      Arguments in favour of the indirect taxes on junk food and sugary drinks or
      arguments why the tax may be effective and/or desirable:
       a suggestion that if junk food has inelastic demand, the burden will fall mainly
         on the consumers (HL), which is appropriate since they are the ones consuming
         the products
       higher price of taxed goods may encourage consumers to switch to healthier
         products, which are substitutes (paragraph )
       a switch to healthier products (fall in demand for unhealthy foods) reduces the
         size of the negative externality and lowers health care costs (paragraph )
       government earns tax revenues (paragraph ) (this may be shown on a
         diagram)
       government tax revenues can be used to educate the public about the harmful
         effects of high-fat foods, causing demand for these to decrease (paragraph )
       low income individuals who are less healthy could become healthier
       government intervention may be necessary since manufacturers are unlikely to
         voluntarily improve their products (paragraph ).

      Arguments against the indirect taxes on junk food and sugary drinks or arguments
      why the tax may not be effective and/or desirable:
       foods and beverages have price inelastic demand (paragraph ) because junk
        food is addictive (or healthy food is not seen as a substitute for junk food) and
        so there may be a proportionately smaller decrease in quantity demanded than
        hoped for
       the tax might have to be very high (and move into the elastic region of the
        demand curve) to have a significant impact on quantity demanded
       the tax might encourage consumers to buy the high fat content foods in
        neighbouring countries, which would have the effect of not reducing
        consumption and not contributing to higher tax revenues
       indirect taxes are regressive because they take a higher share of income from
        low-income households and so they affect low income individuals
        disproportionately (paragraph )
       low income individuals are also affected more than the wealthy because they
        consume more high-fat/sugary foods (paragraph )
       low income households may have a more price-inelastic demand than high
        income households because such goods are cheaper (paragraph ) and could
        respond by increasing their consumption of unhealthy foods and cutting back
        on their expenditures on healthy foods (paragraph )
       reduced revenues for producers of high-fat foods and sugary drinks might lead
        to unemployment in these industries

         an increase in demand for healthy foods could increase their price and make
          them even more unaffordable for low income households
         opposition to the tax (paragraph ) may prevent its long-term effectiveness.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which
        if appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the data, then candidates may not be rewarded
        beyond level 2.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short run versus long run consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the extent to which price ceilings are an effective means of
      protecting consumers from higher prices.                              [8 marks]

      Responses may include:

      Arguments for price ceilings:
       by keeping the price of basic goods such as food from rising, a price ceiling
        increases the purchasing power of consumers
       price ceilings on basic goods protect people with low incomes.

      Arguments against price ceilings:
       shortages of goods and/or disappearance of goods occurring in markets
        (paragraph )
       there is need for non-price rationing mechanisms
       some consumers, not necessarily the neediest, may benefit
       possibility for informal markets arises (paragraph )
       some firms are forced to close down (paragraph ) so productive capacity of
        the economy is hurt
       quality may decrease in the long run
       some businesses in their attempt to avoid the controls switch to the production
        of other goods making the shortages more severe or change the product, i.e.
        dye the rice (paragraph )
       may lead to more imports putting pressure on the current account
        (paragraph )
       price ceilings do not deal with the root cause of rising prices (paragraph )
       prices may rise dramatically once controls are lifted (paragraph )
       the distorted price signals misallocate resources (paragraph )
       policing costs.

      explaining that the original AD represents the economy under inflationary
      pressures and AD1 represents the effect of the planned contractionary fiscal
      policy. If the diagram and explanation are correct, then these candidates should

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or inflation.
      The horizontal axis may be output, real output, national output, real national
      output, national income (Y), or GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations, such as
      APL, CPI, RNO or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

      Responses may include:
       explanation of contractionary fiscal policy
       diagram to illustrate contractionary fiscal policy
       an explanation of how an increase in taxes and/or reducing government
        spending reduces aggregate demand.

      Advantages of contractionary fiscal policy:
       explanation of how contractionary fiscal policy reduces inflationary pressures
        (paragraph )
       benefits of lower rates of inflation
       contractionary fiscal policy reduces the budget deficit.

      Disadvantages of contractionary fiscal policy:
       cuts in social welfare and unemployment benefits reduce aggregate demand
       redistributive effects of social welfare cuts (paragraph )
       the impact of falling aggregate demand on economic growth and
        unemployment (paragraph )
       the impact of higher taxes on worker incentives and tax revenues
       practical difficulties of applying a tight fiscal policy e.g. time lags, political
        difficulties
       contractionary fiscal policy will further reduce Germany’s imports
        (paragraph )
       continuing risk of recession makes the use of contractionary fiscal policy
        dangerous (paragraph ).

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
        appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the data, then candidates may not be rewarded

        Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short run versus long run consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

          1   Identification of appropriate theory                                          1–2
              For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS or PPC diagram showing a
              rightward shift of the LRAS curve or PPC or for explaining that an
              improvement in the quality of labour (improvement in human capital) as a
              result of investment in health and education facilities, can be expected to
              result in an increase in potential output and therefore can contribute to
              economic growth.

              For drawing a correctly labelled AD/AS or PPC diagram showing a
              rightward shift of the LRAS curve or PPC and for explaining that an
              improvement in the quality of labour (improvement in human capital) as a
              result of investment in health and education facilities, can be expected to
              result in an increase in potential output and therefore can contribute to
              economic growth.

      Either the LRAS or Keynesian AS curves may be shifted.            A maximum of
      [2 marks] may be awarded for shifting the SRAS.

      Another approach would be an explanation that government spending on health
      and education may increase aggregate demand, shifting the AD curve to the right,
      contributing to economic growth. If this diagram is accurately drawn, with an
      appropriate explanation, then it may be awarded full marks.

      An alternative approach may be to use a poverty cycle diagram to explain how
      investment in health and education facilities may break the poverty cycle and
      contribute to economic growth. If this diagram is accurately drawn, with an
      appropriate explanation, then it may be awarded full marks.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum
      of [3 marks].

      For AD/AS, the vertical axis may be price level, average price level, or inflation.
      The horizontal axis may be real output, national output, real national output,
      national income (Y), or real GDP. Any appropriate abbreviations, such as APL,
      CPI, RNO or RNY are allowable. A title is not necessary.

      For a PPC diagram, the axes should be any two categories of goods that compete
      for the economy’s resources.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the likely effects of Malawi’s trade and development agreement
      with the EU.                                                            [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       an explanation of trade liberalisation
       a diagram illustrating the effect of trade liberalisation (e.g. tariff diagram).

      Advantages of a possible agreement on liberalised trade:
       benefits of free trade (paragraph ) including development, growth, and job
        creation
       other benefits of free trade include lower prices, increased choice, gains from
        specialization, improved political relations and more efficient allocation of
        resources
       possible increased exports to the EU leading to an improvement in the current
        account
       growth of manufacturing can contribute to increasing employment as well as
        economic growth in Malawi
       growth of manufacturing could be encouraged by tariff-free entry of Malawian
        products into the EU
       less potential for corruption.

      Advantages of a possible agreement on development:
       provision by the EU of private sector grants, loans and technical assistance can
        contribute to the growth of a manufacturing sector in Malawi
        (paragraph )
       assistance from the EU in the form of aid for trade (building institutions and
        infrastructure) can also help Malawi take advantage of growing export
        opportunities, contributing to growth (paragraph ).

      Disadvantages of the potential agreement:
       Malawian exports, consisting mainly of agricultural commodities, may not
        increase much if the EU does not eliminate protection of its farmers
       tariff cuts will reduce the government’s tariff revenues, leaving fewer resources
        to pursue economic development (paragraph )
       tariff cuts will eliminate protection of infant industries, and may not allow
        Malawi to develop manufacturing sector (paragraph )
       existing manufacturing firms in Malawi may not be able to survive because of
        low-cost manufacturing imports from the EU
       manufacturing exports from Malawi to the EU may be unable to compete with
        low-priced EU products
       the agreement may make it more difficult for Malawi to diversify into
        manufacturing, “locking” it into long term reliance on low-value agricultural
        commodity exports (paragraph )
       reliance on agricultural commodity exports subjects farmers to unstable
        incomes (due to low PED and PES for agricultural commodities) as well as
        long term deteriorating terms of trade (due to low YED) with negative effects
        on standard of living, investment, employment, the current account and
        economic growth

         possibility that the EU may not provide enough assistance for development of
          necessary transport infrastructure as well as health and education facilities and
          research and development (R&D) leading to the development of appropriate
          technologies
         aid may not necessarily be directed to the areas where it is most effective.

        Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
        appropriate, should be rewarded.

        If there is no direct reference to the data, then candidates may not be rewarded
        beyond level 2.

        Effective evaluation may be to:
         consider short run versus long run consequences
         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.
