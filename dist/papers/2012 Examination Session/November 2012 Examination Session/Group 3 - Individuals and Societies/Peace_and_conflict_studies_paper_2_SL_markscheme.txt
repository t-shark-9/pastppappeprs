Candidates should answer two questions, each chosen from a different topic. If two essay questions are
chosen from the same topic, only the best essay will contribute to the final grade.

Paper 2 markbands: The following bands must be used in conjunction with the paper-specific
markscheme that follows.

 0:     The candidate does not achieve the standard described in markband 1–3.
 1–3:   There is very limited understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and
        knowledge is inadequate, usually inaccurate and has little relevance to the question. The essay
        seems to lack any plan and is badly organized. Points are presented as isolated pieces of
        information bearing little relation to each other or to the question. Arguments, analysis and
        discussion are absent.
 4–5: There is limited understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        shows serious limitations. Knowledge is frequently inaccurate and often not relevant to
        the question. There is some attempt to plan and organize the essay, but it is very basic.
        Argument, analysis and discussion are very limited.
 6–7: There is some understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is limited, sometimes inaccurate and not always relevant. There are some attempts to put
        together an answer with relevance to the question. Planning and organization of the essay
        is meagre. Arguments, analysis and discussion are limited.
 8–10: The question is generally understood. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge is
        satisfactory, although not all knowledge is accurate or directly relevant. Planning and
        organization are sufficient. Most of the discussion is presented in narrative form. There is
        limited argument and analysis. The answer shows some evidence of ability to exercise
        critical judgment.
 11–13: There is adequate understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is sufficient, generally accurate and directly relevant. Planning and organization are usually
        effective. The answer largely avoids narrative and shows a thoughtful and critical approach.
 14–16: There is a good understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is satisfactory, accurate and directly relevant. Planning and organization are effective.
        The answer shows a clear ability to exercise critical judgment.
 17–20: There is excellent understanding of the question. The ability to exercise skills and knowledge
        is impressive, highly accurate, directly relevant and effective. The essay is well planned and
        elegantly organized. The candidate has a well-developed ability to construct coherent and
        convincing arguments. At the upper end of this markband, the candidate’s work shows a
        confidence and assurance in the handling of evidence and a well-developed and critical sense
        of judgment.

Topic 2: Social conflict

1.   With reference to theories drawn from social psychology, discuss to what extent prejudice and
     discrimination are inevitable consequences of individual personality traits.

     Candidates are asked to argue whether personality factors are more convincing in explaining
     prejudice and discrimination than environmental or group membership factors. For personality
     theories, they are likely to refer to Adorno et al.’s “authoritarian personality” and Rokeach’s
     “ideological dogmatism”. For environmental and group membership factors they are likely to refer
     to Davis’s “relative deprivation”, Sherif’s “realistic conflict theory” and Tajfel’s “social identity
     theory”. Successful responses are not likely to completely dismiss one set of theories, and will
     argue how the three theoretical approaches are not entirely mutually exclusive.

     If only one set of theories is used, mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for vague generalizations and limited knowledge of theory/theories
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts of theory/theories, with limited analysis
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory discussion, and some critical analysis of theory/theories,
     [14–16 marks] for a well-balanced and well-argued discussion and critical analysis of a range of theories
     [17+ marks] for organized, insightful, well-balanced discussion and critical analysis of a range of theories.



2.   “Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.” To what extent do you agree
     with this statement? You should refer to theories drawn from social psychology, and to
     specific examples, in your answer.

     Candidates are asked to explore how conformity works and how it might pressure people into
     compliance (“jailer of freedom”) and could potentially make whole groups of people stick to
     traditions, preventing progress (“enemy of growth”). Candidates are likely to refer to examples,
     such as Nazi Germany and Sherif’s and Asch’s conformity experiments, to support their argument.

     Candidates should give arguments for and against the statement, but they should not be penalized if
     their answers focus heavily on the one or the other. If arguments are entirely one-sided,
     mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for vague descriptions of conformity, without clear response to the statement and with
     minimal or no use of social psychology or examples
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive answers with poor or one-sided evaluation of the statement,
     with limited reference to either social psychology or specific examples
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory attempts at evaluating the statement with some use of social
     psychology and specific examples
     [14–16 marks] for well-argued evaluation of the statement, with good use and analysis of social
     psychology and specific examples
     [17+ marks] for a highly effective and convincing evaluation of the statement, with wide-ranging
     and analytical use of social psychology and specific examples.
                                                 –5–              N12/3/PCONS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   With reference to theories drawn from social psychology, explain the phenomenon of human
     aggression, and why it is an important topic of study. Use examples to support your answer.

     Candidates are asked to explain aggression using the various theories from social psychology about
     the phenomenon. They should critically assess these theories to assess their explanatory power.
     Examples would be Dollard et al.’s “frustration-aggression hypothesis”, Bandura’s “social learning
     theory” and Lorenz’s “instinct theory”. Examples can be used to further explain the theories and/or
     why it is an important topic of study.

     If no theory is used, or if only one part of the question is addressed (i.e. only the phenomenon of
     human aggression is addressed, or only why it is an important topic of study), mark out of a
     maximum of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for vague generalizations
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive accounts of theories, with limited attempts at explanation,
     and few or no examples, some of which may not be relevant
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory explanation, supported by some analysis of theories, and mainly
     relevant examples
     [14–16 marks] for well-argued explanations supported by focused discussion and analysis of
     theories and relevant examples
     [17+ marks] for thoughtful, valid explanations supported by in-depth discussion and analysis of
     theories and relevant examples.
                                                  –6–                N12/3/PCONS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Topic 4: Transforming conflict

4.   With reference to specific examples, analyse the difficulties of establishing positive peace in
     post-conflict societies.

     It is likely that candidates start with a definition of positive peace, which may be defined as
     “the absence of violence, both direct and structural, thus removing any obstacle preventing people
     from reaching their full potential” or in alternative ways.

     Candidates are asked to refer to specific examples to analyse the difficulties societies encounter
     when dealing with a violent past to work towards positive peace. They are likely to refer to
     tribunals, such as those in Cambodia and Yugoslavia and truth and reconciliation commissions,
     such as those in South Africa and Sierra Leone.

     If only one example is used, mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for vague generalizations with little attempt at answering the question
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive answers with little attempt at analysis of the difficulties, and
     few or no examples
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory, sometimes insightful, attempts at analysis of the difficulties, with
     one or two relevant examples
     [14–16 marks] for clearly argued, usually insightful, analysis of the difficulties, supported by
     relevant, specific examples
     [17+ marks] for clear, in-depth, insightful analysis of the difficulties, supported by a broad variety
     of relevant, specific examples.



5.   With reference to recent development in international law, evaluate the following statement:
     “Genocide is the responsibility of the entire world”.

     Candidates are expected to explore the tension in international law between the notion of
     sovereignty of states and the Responsibility to Protect doctrine which states that if countries are
     unable or unwilling to protect its citizens, the international community should be allowed
     to intervene, if necessary militarily. Candidates are likely to give examples, such as Libya
     and Rwanda.

     Candidates should give arguments for and against the statement, but they should not be penalized if
     their answers focus heavily on the one or the other. If arguments are entirely one-sided,
     mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for vague generalizations about genocide, without clear response to the statement
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive answers with little attempt at analysing the statement or
     reference to development in international law
     [11–13 marks] for a satisfactory, well-argued attempt at analysing the statement with appropriate
     reference to development in international law
     [14–16 marks] for effective, well-balanced, analysis, in support of and against the statement, with
     appropriate reference to development in international law
     [17+ marks] for a highly effective and convincing response to the statement, based on well-balanced,
     and insightful analysis, with appropriate reference to development in international law.
                                                  –7–              N12/3/PCONS/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   With reference to specific examples, analyse the strengths and weaknesses of non-violent
     protest.

     Although this essay relies on the use of specific examples, the very successful responses will almost
     certainly contain a theoretical underpinning, such as Gene Sharp’s “theory of power” and the ideas
     of Mahatma Gandhi. The essays are very likely to start with a definition of non-violent protest.
     Examples could be the American civil rights movement, the Egyptian revolution during the Arab
     Spring and Gandhi’s struggle for Indian independence.

     Candidates should refer to both strengths and weaknesses, but they should not be penalized if their
     answers focus heavily on the one or the other. If only successes or weaknesses are discussed
     mark out of [12 marks].

     [0–7 marks] for vague generalizations without clear reference to specific examples
     [8–10 marks] for narrative/descriptive answers with minimal analysis or reference to specific
     examples
     [11–13 marks] for satisfactory attempt at analysis, supported by some theoretical underpinning and
     specific examples
     [14–16 marks] for well-balanced analysis supported by an effective theoretical underpinning and
     specific, well-chosen examples
     [17+ marks] for well-balanced and wide-ranging analysis, supported by a highly effective
     theoretical underpinning and specific, well-chosen examples.
