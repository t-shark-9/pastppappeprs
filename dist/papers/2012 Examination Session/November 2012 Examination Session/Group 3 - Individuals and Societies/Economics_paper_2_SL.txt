                                         Taxes on junk food and sugary drinks

           Some countries are considering indirect taxes on junk food or sugary drinks to reduce their
            consumption and increase government tax revenues. Over-consumption of goods with a high fat
            or sugar content has negative externalities, because it leads to obesity, serious health problems
            and additional health care costs. The principle behind such taxes is the same as taxes imposed
            on cigarettes and alcohol. These taxes are known as “fat taxes”.

           In the United Kingdom (UK), discussions focus on a tax on processed foods, snacks and
            sugary drinks. Another possibility would be to impose a tax on full-fat milk, butter and cheese,
            in order to induce consumers to switch to less fattening substitute products with a lower
            fat content. Foods with a high fat content are linked to heart disease and premature death.

           In the United States, some states are considering imposing a tax on sugary drinks to raise funds
            for health care. Denmark already has a tax on these drinks and is planning a new tax on some
            high-fat dairy products.

           However, research indicates that such taxes would have a disproportionately large effect on
            low income households. One reason is that low income individuals tend to consume a larger
            amount of foods with a high fat content because these are cheaper. This is an important reason
            why low income individuals tend to be less healthy than wealthier people. It has also been
            argued that low income individuals respond to higher food prices by eating smaller quantities
            of healthy food.

           Food manufacturers have been angered by the idea of a “fat tax”, arguing that the public would
            rebel against it.

           Studies have shown that the demand for most categories of foods and beverages is
            price inelastic. According to a representative of the Food and Drink Federation in the UK,
            “the fat tax may be a perfectly sensible issue to debate, but such a regressive taxation policy
            would reduce the purchasing power of consumers”. He argues that it would be better if food
            manufacturers voluntarily improved their products.

                                                 Price controls in Venezuela

           The Venezuelan government ordered that street vendors who operate within the formal
            economy may only sell basic foods if they respect the government imposed price ceilings and
            guarantee the necessary conditions of “hygiene and healthfulness”.  The law also made official
            the “absolute ban on sales” of basic foods “in the informal market where there is no guarantee
            of selling at the prices established by the national administration”.

           Foods included in the government price controls are rice, wheat flour, pasta, beef,
            chicken, cheese, eggs, sugar, ground coffee and salt amongst many others. Since 2003,
            President Chavez’s government has maintained price controls on roughly 100 food and
            medical products considered basic necessities.

           In Venezuela, food items with price controls sometimes disappear from supermarket
            and grocery-store shelves. Most items can still be found, but only in the informal market.
            As a result of this, resources are being misallocated.

           White rice, the staple food for many Venezuelans, can now only be sold at a price of
            2.15 Bolivar Fuertes (VEF the Venezuelan currency) per kilo. Private companies insist that
            production of a kilo costs 4.41 VEF and that companies will quickly go bankrupt. Some
            companies were colouring the rice they produce in order to avoid the government controls as
            the price ceilings apply only to white rice.

           Another result of the restrictions is that local farmers will not supply the selected food products
            at the government imposed prices thus forcing Venezuela to rely more on imports of these
            products.

           The aim of the Venezuelan government is to reduce the cost of the basic shopping basket of
            ordinary Venezuelans at a time when inflation is running at 20.5 % annually. Critics claim that
            Chavez’s price controls serve as a substitute for more effective anti-inflation policies and fear
            that prices will rise dramatically once controls are removed.

                          Germany’s chancellor: Government to tighten fiscal policy

           The German economy was more severely affected than most by the global recession – few other
            economies depend so much on exports and thus on the global economy. Economic performance
            in Germany is now improving, with many manufacturers struggling to keep up with demand.
            Demand for German machines and automobiles increased rapidly. However, sales are still
            not back to pre-crisis levels, and setbacks cannot be ruled out given the situation on the
            financial markets.

           Not all are happy with the country’s recovery. Critics say Germans are living at the expense
            of others because of the country’s growing current account surplus as a result of the
            weak euro. Furthermore, German policymakers refuse to stimulate domestic demand, which
            would improve foreign producers’ prospects of selling their goods in Germany.

           The German government is instead planning to use contractionary fiscal policy starting
            in 2011, replacing past expansionary policy with spending cuts and, possibly, with tax increases
            to counteract increasing demand-pull inflationary pressures.   The German chancellor told
            reporters, “We can only spend what we have in revenue …”

           The German finance minister said the government’s decision on the budget for the coming
            years will be “in the best interest of our country”. Various options had been discussed ahead of
            the meeting, including some tax increases, cuts in social welfare benefits and cuts in long-term
            unemployment benefits.  Many fear the effects of tax increases and spending cuts.  In addition
            to their contractionary effect they will also worsen income distribution.

                          Europe risks trade war with China over tariff on Chinese car wheels

           The European Commission (EC) has imposed a 20.6 % tariff on car wheels imported from
            China in an attempt to end a decline in sales and production by European companies.
            The EC launched an investigation into Chinese wheel manufacturers after a complaint by the
            Association of European Wheel Manufacturers in June 2009 of dumping by the Chinese.
            Chinese officials denied the claims and warned that any anti-dumping duties imposed could
            raise the cost of repairs for consumers and slow the recovery of the European automotive sector.

           The EC claims that the recession, imports from Turkey and competition between manufacturers
            had all negatively affected European manufacturers, but that dumped imports had
            caused a “significant decrease of production and sales as well as lower prices leading to losses
            for European Union (EU) firms”.

                                           Malawi-EU trade and development

           Malawi and the European Union (EU) have been negotiating an agreement involving trade
            and development. The objectives are to gradually liberalize trade between the two parties and
            provide support for economic development in Malawi.

           However, the talks have stopped as Malawi refuses to sign the agreement in spite of strong
            pressure by the EU to do so. Malawi’s trade minister wants to break the poverty cycle and
            has said that Malawi is at a disadvantage with trade liberalization because it is a country with
            poor infrastructure, low labour productivity, poor technological capacity and unreliable
            public utilities. The trade minister needs assurance that issues like rural roads, health and
            education facilities, and more investment in research and technology development will be
            addressed in the agreement.

           The director of a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), added that the agreement
            would lead to losses in tariff revenues. Tariffs are also needed to protect the growth of the
            manufacturing sector. Also, he fears that trade liberalization with the EU will encourage
            Malawi’s position as an exporter of low-value agricultural commodities, preventing
            diversification of production and exports.  It may also prevent regional trade from developing.

           Representatives of the EU argue that gradual trade liberalization will contribute to development,
            growth and job creation.   Malawi will benefit from the European Development Fund,
            which provides private sector grants, loans and technical assistance.  Also it will benefit from
            facilities to be developed as a result of “aid for trade”, which is multilateral aid intended to
            assist countries to build institutions and infrastructure needed to take advantage of international
            trade opportunities.
