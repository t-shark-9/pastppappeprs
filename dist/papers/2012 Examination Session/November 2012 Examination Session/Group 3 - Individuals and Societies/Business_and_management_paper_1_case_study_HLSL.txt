                                  United World Peace Mission to Loyka

          The first years

          Loyka is a small country with an economy that is 45 % primary sector, 15 % secondary sector,
          and 40 % tertiary sector.  From 2006 to 2008, Loyka was torn by civil war.  When the fighting
          ceased, a new coalition government was established, but its hold on the situation was fragile.  
          In 2009, to prevent the eruption of further violence, the United World Peace (UWP) sent 4000
     5    peacekeepers to Loyka.   The UWP Mission to Loyka had ethical objectives: its troops
          (nicknamed “the Olive Hats” because of their olive coloured helmets) were expected to create
          stability, fulfilling the UWP Mission’s aim to maintain order, peace and security.

          The UWP Mission to Loyka was based in Beral, the capital of the country.   The autocratic
          General Ron Meiri was appointed by the UWP as Commander.  The organizational structure of
    10    the UWP Mission was tall and centralized, with several levels of hierarchy and a narrow span of
          control (Appendix 1).  This structure fitted well with the organizational culture of the military.  
          This organization was not flexible, but it ensured that orders were clearly understood and always
          followed.  As a consequence the security of the UWP troops was maintained.  

          In the first years, the UWP Mission to Loyka experienced some successes but also some failures.  
    15    The presence of “the Olive Hats” gave a sense of stability and international support.   It also
          benefited the local business community: the provisions for the troops were purchased locally, the
          soldiers spent a significant proportion of their pay in the local economy and also helped repair
          roads and bridges that had been damaged during the civil war.  As a result of these improvements
          in infrastructure, local businesses in Beral were able to resume their trade activities to the
    20    same levels as before the civil war.   However, the UWP presence also caused some problems.  
          There was some resentment at the presence of “the Olive Hats” – some Loykese just did not want
          these foreign soldiers in their country.   Local community leaders had also accused the troops
          of inappropriate behaviour and the local governor often had disagreements with General Meiri
          about the frequency of UWP patrols in the Beral area.  

    25    The reputation of the UWP troops gradually deteriorated and General Meiri did not seem able to
          control the situation.  Originally, when the troops first arrived, the local population was largely
          supportive.  However, opposition to the UWP presence grew as did violence against the troops.  
          Moreover, “the Olive Hats” in Loyka started to resent being there and motivation was beginning
          to deteriorate.  They felt unappreciated by the local population, whom they believed they were
    30    assisting by maintaining order, peace and security.   Due to these changes in the external and
          internal environment, the UWP headquarters in Geneva prepared a force field analysis to evaluate
          whether the UWP Mission to Loyka should change its strategy in 2011 (Appendix 2).

          General Diane Pierce

          In late 2011 the UWP replaced General Meiri with General Diane Pierce as Commander, in
          the hope that her situational leadership style and experience of social marketing in previous
    35    UWP missions would help reduce the problems.  She was given two specific objectives:
          • Firstly, she had the strategic objective to improve the image of “the Olive Hats” in Loyka in
             order to improve public relations.  This would reduce the number of conflicts with the Loykese,
             thereby improving the safety of the UWP troops.
          • Secondly, she had the operational objective to remotivate her troops.  As salaries were set by
    40       the UWP, she could not use financial rewards so she would have to use non-financial
             motivational methods.

          General Pierce decided to undertake a major improvement of social infrastructure in Loyka
          by using the resources of the UWP to build either a new hospital or a new university campus.  
          She received permission from the UWP headquarters, provided that the new hospital or university
    45    be operated as a non-profit organization.  The UWP believed that this would allow the Loykese
          to see an important benefit of the presence of “the Olive Hats”.   It would also reinforce the
          UWP Mission’s corporate social responsibility.  This humanitarian project would remotivate the
          troops by providing a change of routine, by giving them a sense of achievement, and by building
          positive relationships with the local population.  The construction of a new hospital or university
    50    would allow General Pierce to fulfill the two objectives given to her.

          General Pierce delegated the responsibility for investigating the feasibility of the two projects
          down the chain of command to Colonel Michael Donovan, Head of the Civil Engineering Group.  
          Colonel Donovan identified a suitable piece of land for the construction site: Beral’s only botanical
          gardens, ideally located and owned by the local government.   He calculated that both projects
    55    would cost the same (Appendix 3).  As a result, the decision about whether to build a university or
          a hospital would not be based upon cost, but upon other factors.


          A university or a hospital?

          To gain a general sense of which option would be better for the local population, Colonel Donovan
          decided to ask Kos Palouk, someone he had come to know quite well.  Kos worked as a part-time
          food server in the officers’ dining hall for the UWP Mission.  He also ran his own small produce
    60    distribution business that he had set up thanks to his contacts from his job in the dining hall.  
          Twice a week, operating as a sole trader, he drove his car to several local farms, where he bought
          vegetables and other produce such as eggs and poultry for resale to the officers’ dining hall.  
          Colonel Donovan asked Kos which option he thought would better meet the needs of the local
          Loykese.  According to Kos, both options had advantages and disadvantages.




2212-5001 ; 8812-5001                                                                              Turn over
                                                     –4–          M&N12/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

    65    A non-profit hospital would increase access to medical care, especially for poorer people.  
          When the civil war broke out, most of the Loykese doctors who could speak English left for
          countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, where foreign doctors
          could easily obtain work visas and employment opportunities.  As a result, there was a significant
          decrease in the number of doctors in Loyka.  Secondly, complications from the lack of prenatal
    70    care had increased significantly.  Many young children had a variety of health issues.  However,
          Kos was very concerned about who the staff at the hospital would be.   Given the shortage of
          doctors in the country, would doctors from abroad be employed?  Also would those providing
          obstetrics and gynecology be female doctors?  Conservatives in the country, Kos warned, would
          be strongly opposed to Loykese women receiving care from foreign male doctors.

    75    The construction of a university campus presented its own set of issues.   On the one hand,
          a new university campus would be welcomed, as the existing one was small, old and in need
          of extensive repair.   Moreover, because of the civil war, the country desperately needed
          engineers, school teachers, nurses and many other highly skilled professionals to help rebuild the
          social infrastructure.  However, although instruction would be in the local language, Kos feared
    80    that a university built by the UWP would become a symbol of foreign intervention in Loyka and
          would make it a target for critics of the government and of the UWP presence in the country.  
          Although a hospital might offend some conservatives, it is unlikely that it would be the target of
          physical attack.  A university, on the other hand, with more open access, would be less secure than
          a hospital.  In addition, as a place where free speech is exercised, a university could potentially
    85    cause unrest in a country recently torn by civil war.

          In further discussions with local officials, Colonel Donovan found that Kos’ concerns were
          shared by others.  After completing a critical path analysis, he reported to General Pierce that
          constructing either a university campus or a hospital was feasible within 25 to 30 weeks.  He added
          that the officers in the Civil Engineering Group were excited by the opportunity to lead the project.  
    90    The project also had the support of the troops, who would feel empowered and would welcome
          working in new flexible matrix structures.  It would, however, require careful workforce planning
          and training: some peacekeeping troops would need extra training in construction skills and safety
          procedures.  Colonel Donovan concluded that both types of facilities were greatly needed in Loyka
          and would offer important benefits.  The issue was which one to choose.

    95    Given her experience of previous UWP Missions, General Pierce ordered Colonel Donovan
          to conduct a formal social and environmental audit of the construction of both facilities and to
          carry out additional primary research.  She asked him to prepare and distribute a survey to 2000
          local residents for a more valid and reliable indication of the local community’s opinion of
          which was needed more, a university or a hospital.   She also wanted focus groups to discuss
  100     the two options.  Some of the focus groups were to consist of men only, some of women only,
          and some of both men and women.

          Unfortunately, the results of the survey did not give General Pierce the clear indication that she
          had hoped for (Appendix 4).  A slight majority preferred the hospital to the university, but it was
          by such a small margin that she could not be confident of which direction to take.  In addition, a
  105     far larger percentage of those surveyed were strongly opposed to the hospital than to the university.

          After spending weeks gathering data, Colonel Donovan had few doubts.   He recommended
          that the hospital should be built as soon as possible.  He still needed to decide what method of
          production to use.  He was considering cell production, where each cell would be responsible for
          the construction of a separate section of the hospital.  On completion, the hospital would provide
  110     immediate important benefits to the local population.  If the main objection of the local population
          was the concern that most of the doctors would be male, the UWP, he argued, should do everything
          it could to recruit female doctors, even if only for the short term.  However, the local governor
          who agreed to contribute the piece of land for the construction site preferred the new university
          campus rather than a hospital.   A new university would be prestigious and contribute to the
  115     long-term development of Loyka by training future professionals.   It could also attract private
          capital for future public-private partnerships in research and development (R&D).


          Kos Palouk’s own business

          It was clear that the construction of a new facility would create a number of opportunities for local
          entrepreneurs in a range of different markets.  Kos had already started to think about the future of
          his own small produce distribution business.  Should he expand it?

  120     He knew that he could increase the scale of his business operations with the UWP Mission without
          any additional marketing.   This would also allow for significant economies of scale, but the
          logistics would be more complex.  He would have to drive and collect produce using dangerous
          remote unpaved roads outside the protection of the UWP Mission.  These remote communities
          might perceive Kos as collaborating with the UWP troops.   He would also have to dedicate
  125     all his time to his business and would no longer be able to work in the officers’ dining hall.  
          Although that job did not pay particularly well, it was in a safe environment and provided a regular
          source of income.

          To collect larger quantities of produce in remote areas, Kos would need to purchase a large
          lorry (truck).   He discussed potential sources of finance with his bank.   The bank manager
  130     indicated as a condition for the granting of a loan that the bank would require the lorry as collateral.  
          Secondly, the poor quality of the roads meant that the lorry would lose value quickly.

          The bank manager warned Kos that many other local entrepreneurs were likely to take advantage
          of the business opportunities resulting from the construction and operation of the new hospital
          or university.   If Kos could utilize his contacts within the UWP Mission, he would have a
  135     “first-mover advantage”.

          Kos’ deliveries to the UWP Mission were just-in-time in order to ensure fresh produce.  
          However, increasing the scale of operation of his business would lead to some complications.  
          He would need to manage stock levels on a just-in-case basis.   One of Kos’ business contacts
          offered to rent him a large storage facility equipped with a refrigerated room for $200 per month
  140     to keep the produce fresh.   The use of just-in-case stock control would raise the possibility
          of waste, but Kos thought spoilage would be minimal.




2212-5001 ; 8812-5001                                                                                  Turn over
                                                     –6–          M&N12/3/BUSMT/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

          Kos prepared a business plan and compiled information comparing his current income to his
          forecast income if he increased his scale of operation (Appendix 5).   The income comparison
          showed that the expansion of his business would be very profitable – as long as the UWP Mission
  145     remained in Loyka.   However, even after a number of conversations with Colonel Donovan,
          Kos was still unsure how long the UWP Mission would remain in Loyka.

          Consequently Kos drew up three possible options for his produce distribution business:
          • Option 1: No change.   Keep the same scale of operation and stay working at the
            UWP Mission.
  150     • Option 2: Increase the scale of operation of his business.   Sell more produce to the
            UWP Mission and to the university or hospital.  Kos would need to leave his job at the officers’
            dining hall and lose his regular source of income.
          • Option 3: Maximize the scale of operation.   Supply produce not only to the UWP Mission
            and to the university or hospital, but also to retailers in Beral.  In Beral there is no city-wide
  155       wholesaler for the produce that Kos distributes.  Becoming a wholesaler would require setting
            up and managing supply chains, employing staff, increasing working capital and adopting a
            new business structure.

          At 54 years old, Kos was nervous about the risks of increasing the scale of operation of his
          business.   He enjoyed the job security at the officers’ dining hall.   His salary and the profits
  160     from selling produce to the UWP Mission were sufficient to provide for himself and his family.  
          However, Kos realized that he was entirely dependent on the UWP Mission for his income.  
          What would happen if the UWP Mission withdrew from Loyka when he was 60 or 62, when it
          would be more difficult for him to start over again?

          Kos hoped that the UWP Mission would stay for many years.   However, he knew that the
  165     aim of General Pierce was to stabilize the situation in Loyka as rapidly as possible so that the
          UWP Mission could withdraw their presence.

          Having been satisfied with Colonel Donovan’s research, General Pierce believed that the
          construction project would achieve the strategic and operational objectives she was given as
          commander.  However, she wished that the results from the primary research would give a clearer
  170     indication of the preferred option, the university or the hospital.  General Pierce was yet to decide.
