Answer one question from this section.

1.    Easy E Booking (EEB)

      Easy E Booking (EEB) is a small, well-known, reputable and financially stable online hotel
      reservation service. EEB employees are highly motivated and take great pride in their work.
      EEB has received recognition for their high quality customer service. Due to an increase in global
      demand, greater competition and changes in technology, the finance director, Maia, has decided to
      upgrade EEB’s computers and/or software.

      Maia has two options:
      Option A: purchase only a new software called “Book-Fast” from a local software designer.
      Option B: purchase new computers with installed software called “Global Reach” from a
      manufacturer abroad.

                                                     Option A                                     Option B
       Cost                                   $20 000                          $40 000
       Technical support                      24 hours onsite at EEB           24 hours online
       Further payments payable:
       Employees                 No change                                     At the end of their contract 15 % of

                                                                               cost: $15 000 in year 2
       Training cost                          On-the-job: free                 Intensive: $12 000 in year 1
       Maintenance cost                       Free                             $1000 per year
       Insurance cost                         $500 per year                    $1000 per year

      The estimated return/total revenue in $ per year is shown below:

                           Option A               Option B
       Year 1               10 000                 14 000
       Year 2               12 000                 16 800
       Year 3               17 000                 23 800
       Year 4               20 000                 28 000
      [© International Baccalaureate Organization, 2013]

      The average rate of return (ARR) of Option A is 46.25 %.

      Maia is considering using a straight line method of depreciation.

      EEB employees favour Option A, even though some of their competitors using “Book-Fast” have
      reported problems with the software, including security issues. However, Maia has chosen Option B,
      which will provide more up-to-date, sophisticated and secure reservation system software. It will also
      give EEB a competitive advantage and an ability to handle a large global volume of hotel reservations.

2.    BP and the Gulf of Mexico

      In May 2010, the oil company BP suffered a major disaster while drilling for oil off the coast of
      Louisiana, United States (US) in the Gulf of Mexico. The drilling platform exploded and was
      destroyed, killing 11 workers. Millions of tonnes of oil spilled out into the sea. This was the worst
      industrial accident BP had ever faced. Subsequently the price of BP shares fell by 30 %.

      It took BP three months to stop the leak in the oil well. The oil spill had a major negative impact on
      fish, birds and the whole ecosystem. Regional fishermen, seafood restaurants and the tourist industry
      were the first to suffer from the impact of the pollution and demanded compensation.

      This was a public relations (PR) crisis for BP. The US media attacked the company on a daily basis.
      Environmental pressure groups called for a ban on deep water oil drilling and even the US president
      got involved, announcing on television that BP would be “made to pay heavily”. The perception
      was that BP’s crisis management was slow, uncaring and inefficient. For example, Tony Hayward,
      the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of BP was reported to have said that the oil spill “was tiny”
      and on another occasion he complained of stress and said he “would like his life back”. However,
      to solve the problem in deep water was a very technical exercise, which had never been attempted
      before. As a result of this PR crisis, BP decided not to give dividends to its shareholders in 2010.

      BP has identified the following as causes of the decline in financial performance:
       the loss of the oil drilling platform
       the cost of stopping the leak 250 metres below the sea
       the cost of the clean-up operations
       the fall in share price
       the loss of brand image and goodwill
       compensation paid to regional businesses
       compensation paid to the families of the workers killed.

      Selected items from BP’s balance sheet as at 31 December 2009 (US$ millions) (before the disaster).

       Cash                        5000

                                                 SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    Toyota

      Toyota is one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world. For decades it was known for
      production efficiency and car quality. Its Kaizen approach to manufacturing transformed car-making
      worldwide resulting in years of growth in sales and profits. With rapid global growth, Toyota began
      outsourcing production activities of some car parts to overseas manufacturers, with whom it had
      not worked before, resulting in a loss of quality control. In addition to this, it ignored employees’
      concerns about car safety and quality and was also slow in responding to customers’ complaints.

      In 2009, Toyota recalled 11 million cars worldwide due to various defects in car parts. The financial
      loss to Toyota from the recall and lost sales was US$2 billion. The total market value of Toyota’s
      shares fell by US$20 billion.

      Following the recall, company President Akio Toyoda said that in expanding too rapidly Toyota:
       Lost sight of its long-established customer focus.
       No longer stopped to study every defect, or problem to determine the causes.
       Forgot its core values of safety first, quality second and volume third. Its main strategic objectives
        became “world biggest” and profit.

      He added that the situation is urgent and to recover its reputation and core values:
       New quality control standards will be put in place.
       New procedures will pay closer attention to customers’ feedback.
       A team will be set up to investigate every defect reported within 24 hours.
       Change will be implemented more rapidly than normal.

      Other famous car brands have also experienced product recalls. Regarding Toyota, analysts
      commented that Akio Toyoda understands the problems and has personal interest in Toyota, his name
      is on every car. Financially, Toyota created a US$1.4 billion provision for the recall and it has
      US$23 billion in reserve. In America, Toyota’s sales were up 6 % in 2010 over the previous year.

4.    “Think locally, grow globally”

      To avoid negatively affecting sales, McDonald’s® senior managers in the United States (US)
      headquarters realized that they should not apply identical American standards worldwide.
      McDonald’s® must now think locally to grow globally.

      British-born Steve Easterbrook, head of McDonald’s® in the United Kingdom (UK), understood the
      need for strategic change and prepared tactics with two objectives:
       to attract new and different customers
       to enhance the good value of products to appeal to customers during economic recession.

      One of the first tactics in the UK was the introduction of “Little Tasters®”, which offered new
      products, in small portions, at low prices. Steve understood that young mothers, when taking their
      children to McDonald’s®, would not buy meals for themselves because they felt the portions were
      too large. Other tactical changes, in response to customer demand, included the introduction of
      more chicken-based products for health-conscious customers. Moreover, an improved breakfast
      menu and better quality coffee attracted more price-conscious people on their way to work.

      These adaptations to local conditions proved successful in the UK and beyond. McDonald’s® UK
      had 13 million more customers in 2010 compared to 2009, resulting in an increase in market share
      (during the economic recession). In other host countries McDonald’s® also successfully implemented
      its “think locally, grow globally” strategy. For example, it successfully launched products made from
      local produce and suited to local tastes such as the “Maharaja MacTM” in India, the “McLobster®” in
      Canada and the “Ebi Filet-O” (a shrimp burger) in Japan.

      At the same time McDonald’s® launched a “global uniform initiative” to redecorate its restaurants
      with uniform appearance. McDonald’s® still tries to maintain the global recognition and the quality
      of its global brand. Local construction material and local labour are used, as well as different colours,
      comfortable armchairs and free Internet access. Other multinational food and drink companies, such
      as KFC® and Starbucks®, are also using a similar strategy to the “think locally, grow globally” strategy
      used by McDonald’s®.

5.    Rox and Inclusive Music (IM)

      Rox was a music band managed by Michel Mbappe. The band enjoyed considerable commercial
      success thanks to Michel’s autocratic leadership style. He personally made all decisions. Rox had
      given generously to local schools and other non-profit organizations. The band received many
      awards for their acts of corporate social responsibility. Their last CD “Action Not Words” had
      brought them considerable fame.

      In June 2010, Michel was asked to help finance the start-up of a new non-profit music school called
      “Inclusive Music” (IM). IM’s aim was to support young musicians from low income families. At
      first, Michel was very enthusiastic and prepared a business plan. Unfortunately, he realized that Rox
      could not afford to finance IM fully. External sources of finance other than contributions from Rox
      would be needed for IM to grow. Until then IM would only have a limited budget for marketing and
      market research.

      In June 2011, IM opened with the mission statement “Action not words”. To support its mission, it
      offered free lessons and allowed students to borrow musical instruments. Michel asked a popular
      former singer, Louis Marsaud, to be the school’s director. Louis adopted a laissez-faire leadership
      style, hoping it would allow creativity among students. Initial student attendance was lower than
      expected and quickly worsened. Within three months, many instruments had gone missing and many
      students were no longer attending music lessons.

      IM’s finances were deteriorating, and Louis could not attract external sources of finance.
      Michel took action and organized a concert by Rox to promote IM. He also examined IM’s accounts
      and discovered a significant liquidity problem. Without consulting anyone, he dismissed Louis.
      In the music media, Michel received much criticism for dismissing Louis. Journalists argued that
      the two main problems were, IM’s vague mission statement and poor marketing. However, Michel
      aimed to ensure that IM became sustainable in the long term.
