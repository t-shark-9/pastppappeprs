                                          Taxes on junk food and sugary drinks

           Some countries are considering indirect taxes on junk food or sugary drinks to reduce their
            consumption and increase government tax revenues. Over-consumption of goods with a high fat
            or sugar content has negative externalities, because it leads to obesity, serious health problems
            and additional health care costs. The principle behind such taxes is the same as taxes imposed
            on cigarettes and alcohol. These taxes are known as “fat taxes”.

           In the United Kingdom (UK), discussions focus on a tax on processed foods, snacks and
            sugary drinks. Another possibility would be to impose a tax on full-fat milk, butter and cheese,
            in order to induce consumers to switch to less fattening substitute products with a lower
            fat content. Foods with a high fat content are linked to heart disease and premature death.

           In the United States, some states are considering imposing a tax on sugary drinks to raise funds
            for health care. Denmark already has a tax on these drinks and is planning a new tax on some
            high-fat dairy products.

           However, research indicates that such taxes would have a disproportionately large effect on
            low income households. One reason is that low income individuals tend to consume a larger
            amount of foods with a high fat content because these are cheaper. This is an important reason
            why low income individuals tend to be less healthy than wealthier people. It has also been
            argued that low income individuals respond to higher food prices by eating smaller quantities
            of healthy food.

           Food manufacturers have been angered by the idea of a “fat tax”, arguing that the public would
            rebel against it.

           Studies have shown that the demand for most categories of foods and beverages is
            price inelastic. According to a representative of the Food and Drink Federation in the UK,
            “the fat tax may be a perfectly sensible issue to debate, but such a regressive taxation policy
            would reduce the purchasing power of consumers”. He argues that it would be better if food
            manufacturers voluntarily improved their products.

                                                  High milk prices in Cyprus

           Complaints that milk prices in Cyprus are too high have led the government’s Competition
            and Consumer Protection Service to investigate whether a cartel exists in the milk industry.
            There are indications that farmers are selling their milk at an identical high price to milk
            companies (processors) and distributors. Also, the milk companies and distributors
            themselves may be uniformly raising their prices, resulting in the most expensive milk in the
            European Union (EU).

           Cyprus has very limited grass pastures for cows to graze on, and fodder (food for cows)
            is imported and sold to farmers by a government monopoly. Farmers complain that if
            competition existed in the supply of fodder, fodder prices would come down, and this would
            allow milk prices to fall. They sell milk at identical prices because they all buy fodder at the
            same price from the government monopoly.

           Milk processing is dominated by two firms, which have also been accused of collusion as they
            sell milk at an identical price.  The firms claim that the reason for this is that they buy it at the
            same price from the milk farmers.

           The only real competition appears to be at the retail level, where prices range from about
            1.15 euros per litre (in supermarkets) to 1.30 euros per litre (in bakeries and kiosks).
            According to the Ministry of Commerce, 70 % of milk is bought from the higher-price
            bakeries and kiosks. A consumer association is urging consumers to buy milk from the lower
            price retailers.

           The Ministry is urging retailers to cut milk prices voluntarily. Many supermarkets have
            responded with price cuts, but bakeries and kiosks refuse to lower their prices, claiming
            that the high price they pay to buy milk would result in selling at a loss. The Ministry has
            received permission from the EU to impose a price ceiling on milk for approximately 40 days,
            until the situation is resolved. Critics of the government argue that its policies are ineffective
            because they do not attempt to solve the problem by increasing competition and creating free
            market conditions.

      (b)   Using a supply and demand diagram for the milk market, explain why the
            elimination of the government monopoly in fodder could result in a lower price

                                           Unemployment in the United States

           Though there are signs that the United States (US) economy is emerging from recession,
            unemployment remains high at close to 10 % (Figure 1). According to the chairman of the
            Federal Reserve (the US central bank), the US recovery will bring only a “slow reduction”
            in unemployment, and consumer confidence will improve only slowly.  In this environment,
            inflation is likely to remain low (Figure 2). These comments are taken to mean the central bank
            does not plan to tighten monetary policy soon.

           Interest rates remain at near-zero levels (Figure 3). Therefore, some economists argue that
            more fiscal stimulus is needed.  Others fear that large increases in the budget deficit, due to
            higher government spending and lower tax revenues, could create a new crisis leading to more
            job losses.

           Workers are fearful that long-term unemployment will result in a deterioration of their
            human capital, making it even more difficult to find jobs in the future.  Some types of jobs in
            sectors such as car manufacturing, hard-hit by the recession, might disappear.

           An economic stimulus package passed in 2008 did little to reduce unemployment.
            For example, the unemployment rate for young workers (aged 18–24) has increased to
            over 52 %.  Supporters of the fiscal stimulus argue that without it unemployment would have
            been even higher.   Opponents insist that the benefits of the fiscal stimulus are exaggerated.  
            At the heart of the disagreement lies an argument over the value of the multiplier. For the
            multiplier to translate into large increases in economic activity, consumers must spend rather
            than save, and budget deficits must not lead to crowding out.

           Some economists favour supply-side policies, such as tax benefits for firms that create new
            jobs.  Another policy is to provide tax benefits to all firms pursuing research and development,
            in order to stimulate technological innovation and rapid economic growth.

                                         Should Latvia’s currency be devalued?

           Badly hit by the financial crisis, Latvia is going through severe recession, losing 25 % – 30 %
            of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in two years.  It has very large budget and trade deficits,
            a large and growing public debt, and the deep recession has resulted in deflation.

           In view of these developments, the lat (Latvia’s currency) would face depreciation in a freely
            floating exchange rate system.  However, the lat has been pegged (fixed) to the euro since 2005
            (0.7 lat : 1 euro).  The Latvian government has shown its determination not to allow the lat to
            devalue. A stable currency relative to the euro is a condition for future adoption of the euro.

           Yet with very large trade and budget deficits, it has had to turn to the International Monetary
            Fund (IMF) and the European Union (EU) for loans. To qualify for the loans it has been forced
            to implement a highly restrictive fiscal policy, involving deep cuts in government spending on
            education and health care. Another government policy involves cutting wages in an effort to
            increase firms’ export competitiveness.

           To maintain the pegged value of the lat, the Latvian central bank must keep interest rates
            at a relatively high level, in order to attract financial capital and prevent currency outflows.  
            If the government devalued the lat, this could work to solve some of the problems. It would
            help correct the trade deficit and could also encourage economic growth.  Economic growth
            might help reduce the public debt. A devaluation of the lat would also allow the government to
            pursue expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to deal with its deep recession.

           However, devaluation comes with risks. The government argues that it may create
            inflationary pressures due to higher import prices and a loss of export competitiveness.  
            Widespread bankruptcies could arise because 85 % of consumer borrowing is in euros, meaning
            that the real value of consumer debt would increase.

           Estonia, Lithuania and Bulgaria (also with currencies pegged to the euro) may also devalue
            their currencies, reducing Latvia’s competitive advantage from a devaluation of the lat.

                                         Malawi-EU trade and development

           Malawi and the European Union (EU) have been negotiating an agreement involving trade
            and development. The objectives are to gradually liberalize trade between the two parties and
            provide support for economic development in Malawi.

           However, the talks have stopped as Malawi refuses to sign the agreement in spite of strong
            pressure by the EU to do so. Malawi’s trade minister wants to break the poverty cycle and
            has said that Malawi is at a disadvantage with trade liberalization because it is a country with
            poor infrastructure, low labour productivity, poor technological capacity and unreliable
            public utilities. The trade minister needs assurance that issues like rural roads, health and
            education facilities, and more investment in research and technology development will be
            addressed in the agreement.

           The director of a group of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), added that the agreement
            would lead to losses in tariff revenues. Tariffs are also needed to protect the growth of the
            manufacturing sector. Also, he fears that trade liberalization with the EU will encourage
            Malawi’s position as an exporter of low-value agricultural commodities, preventing
            diversification of production and exports.  It may also prevent regional trade from developing.

           Representatives of the EU argue that gradual trade liberalization will contribute to development,
            growth and job creation.   Malawi will benefit from the European Development Fund,
            which provides private sector grants, loans and technical assistance.  Also it will benefit from
            facilities to be developed as a result of “aid for trade”, which is multilateral aid intended
            to assist countries to build institutions and infrastructure needed to take advantage of
            international trade opportunities.
