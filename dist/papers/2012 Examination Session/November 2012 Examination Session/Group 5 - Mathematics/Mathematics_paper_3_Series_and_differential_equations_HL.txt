Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

                                            dy y
      A differential equation is given by     = , where x > 0 and y > 0 .
                                            dx x

      (a)   Solve this differential equation by separating the variables, giving your answer
            in the form y = f ( x) .                                                              [3 marks]

      (b)   Solve the same differential equation by using the standard homogeneous
            substitution y = vx .                                                                 [4 marks]

      (c)   Solve the same differential equation by the use of an integrating factor.             [5 marks]

      (d)   If y = 20 when x = 2 , find y when x = 5 .                                            [1 mark]

                                    dy
      Let the differential equation    = x + y , ( x + y ≥ 0) satisfying the initial conditions
                                    dx
       y = 1 when x = 1 . Also let y = c when x = 2 .


      (a)   Use Euler’s method to find an approximation for the value of c , using a step
            length of h = 0.1 . Give your answer to four decimal places.                          [6 marks]

      You are told that if Euler’s method is used with h = 0.05 then c  2.7921 , if it is used
      with h = 0.01 then c  2.8099 and if it is used with h = 0.005 then c  2.8121 .

      (b)   Plot on graph paper, with h on the horizontal axis and the approximation for c
            on the vertical axis, the four points (one of which you have calculated and three
            of which have been given). Use a scale of 1 cm = 0.01 on both axes. Take the
            horizontal axis from 0 to 0.12 and the vertical axis from 2.76 to 2.82.               [3 marks]

      (c)   Draw, by eye, the straight line that best fits these four points, using a ruler.      [1 mark]

      (d)   Use your graph to give the best possible estimate for c , giving your answer to
            three decimal places.                                                                 [2 marks]
