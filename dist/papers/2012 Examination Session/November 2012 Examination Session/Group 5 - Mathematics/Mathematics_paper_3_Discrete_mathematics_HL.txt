Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      In the graph given above, the numbers shown represent the distance along that edge.

      (a)   Using Dijkstra’s algorithm, find the length of the shortest path from vertex S
            to vertex T . Write down this shortest path.                                              [6 marks]

      (b)   (i)    Does this graph have an Eulerian circuit? Justify your answer.

		          (ii)   Does this graph have an Eulerian trail? Justify your answer.                       [4 marks]

      (c)   The graph above is now to be considered with the edges representing roads
            in a town and with the distances being the length of that road in kilometres.
            Huan is a postman and he has to travel along every road in the town to deliver
            letters to all the houses in that road. He has to start at the sorting office at S
            and also finish his route at S . Find the shortest total distance of such a route.
            Fully explain the reasoning behind your answer.                                           [4 marks]
