Answer all the questions.

1.    A geologist uses a computer program to keep track of the various rock samples that she
      has collected.  The program has a  Sample  class and creates a new  Sample  object for
      each rock sample.

      public class Sample
      {
        int sampleNumber;
        String rockType;
        String placeCollected;
        double sampleWeight;//Weight of sample in kilograms

            Sample nextSample;
            ...
      }

      To allow the geologist to rapidly identify a sample of a particular rock type,
      the program uses a simple hash table to store all the sample objects.  The hash function
      is a method named  rockHash() that produces a key value in the range 0 to 127 based
      on the sample’s  rockType.

      public int rockHash(String rockType)
      {
        ...
      }

      The key value can then be used as an index to retrieve a  Sample object from
      allSamples, an array of 128  Sample objects.

      (a)     Define the term collision.                                                          [1 mark]

      (b)     Explain why  sampleWeight has type  double.                                         [2 marks]

      To deal with collisions, objects in the  Sample class have been designed to allow them
      to be arranged into linked lists.

      (c)     Identify the element of the  Sample class that allows  Sample objects to be made
              into a linked list.                                                                 [1 mark]




                                                             (This question continues on the following page)

(Question 1 continued)

      Each element of the  allSamples array can be treated as the head of a linked list of
      Sample objects having the same key value.  The elements of the array are initialized
      to  null.

      (d)   Construct the method,  insertSample(Sample rockSample) that uses the
            rockHash() method and then adds the sample at the beginning of the appropriate
            linked list in  allSamples.                                                      [6 marks]

      (e)   Construct the method,  findBigSample(String rockType) that returns the
            sample number of the heaviest sample having the specified rock type.             [7 marks]

      (f)   Outline how all the samples collected from a particular place could be output.   [3 marks]

2.    Within a tree, a leaf node is one that has no child nodes.

      (a)   State the number of leaf nodes in the tree shown above.                                 [1 mark]

      (b)   State the word contained in the right child of the node containing the word
            “honourable”.                                                                           [1 mark]

      (c)   Identify the left subtree and the right subtree of the node “honourable”.               [3 marks]

      (d)   State the words in the order that they would be retrieved using pre-order traversal.    [1 mark]

      (e)   State the type of tree traversal that would retrieve the words in alphabetical order.   [1 mark]

(Question 2 continued)

      All of the words from a large dictionary are stored in a binary tree.   The tree is
      constructed from objects of the  WordNode class.

      public class WordNode
      {
        String word;
        WordNode leftChild;
        WordNode rightChild;

            WordNode(String theWord)
            {
              word = theWord;
              leftChild = null;
              rightChild = null;
            }

            int countLeaves()
            {
              // lines of code missing
            }
      }

      The method  countLeaves(WordNode w) returns the number of leaf nodes in
      the subtree, for example, in the diagram above, if node  w has no child nodes
      countLeaves(w) will return  1.

      (f)     State the condition to test if  WordNode w is a leaf node.                            [1 mark]

      (g)     Construct the method  countLeaves() using recursion.                                 [6 marks]

      (h)     Identify two disadvantages of using recursion to implement  countLeaves().           [2 marks]

      (i)     Outline two ways that the tree could be modified to allow access to the definition
              of the word.                                                                         [4 marks]

3.    The inventory of spare parts on a large ship is stored on the ship’s computer as a single
      sequential master file.  Each type of part has a unique ID number.

            Type of Part            Quantity          Re-order Level        Maximum Quantity
               322                    23                    10                    30

      (a)    Identify the key field in the record.                                                [1 mark]

      Each record contains the quantity of spares onboard the ship for that type of part.
      Inventory changes are recorded by different members of the ships personnel,
      each of whom has a small, handheld device.  Once a day the changes, which are stored
      in transaction files, are downloaded to the ship’s computer and used to update the
      master file.

      (b)    State the type of processing used to update the master file.                         [1 mark]

      (c)    State how the records in the master file should be ordered.                          [1 mark]

      (d)    Describe the process by which the master file can be updated when the changes
             recorded in the handheld devices are downloaded.                                     [4 marks]

      A wireless network is installed so that the handheld devices can communicate
      continuously with the ship’s computer.

      (e)    Explain how handshaking is involved in this process.                                 [3 marks]

      (f)    Identify two data items that need to be sent each time parts are taken from
             the inventory.                                                                       [2 marks]

      (g)    Explain how the introduction of the wireless network, together with a
             reorganization of the master file, can keep the inventory current rather than only
             being updated once per day.                                                          [4 marks]

      When the ship reaches port a list of all the parts that need restocking is generated.  
      Parts need to be restocked if the Quantity is less than the Re-order Level.  A sufficient
      number of parts should be purchased to bring the Quantity up to the Maximum Quantity.

      (h)    Outline the processing that would take place to produce the list of parts to
             be purchased, including the quantities to purchase.                                  [4 marks]

      (c)   Explain two reasons why a mobile phone designer might choose to provide a
            keyboard instead of a touch screen.                                           [4 marks]

      (d)   Explain two ways in which using a mobile phone to link an ambulance to a

      (e)   Outline two ways in which data interception can occur when using a
            mobile device.                                                                [4 marks]

      (f)   Outline two advantages of not restricting the development of apps to the
            manufacturers of mobile devices.                                              [3 marks]

      (g)   Describe how social engineering is used to persuade mobile device users to

      Many employers are providing their employees with mobile devices so that they can
      be connected to their work 24/7.

      (h)   Discuss the effects of this on the employee.                                  [6 marks]
