Answer all the questions.

1.    Consider the array  dArray and program fragment shown below.

                                       [0]   [1]     [2]      [3]    [4]     [5]
                         dArray         7        2    9       –3         4    1

      n = 6;
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i = i + 1)
      {
        if (dArray[i] < dArray[i – 1])
        {
          int t = dArray[i];
          dArray[i] = dArray[i – 1];
          dArray[i – 1] = t;
        }
      }

      (a)   Copy and complete the following table showing the contents of the array  dArray
            after each pass through the loop.                                                  [5 marks]

                   Original     7            2            9         –3        4      1

                   1st pass

                   2nd pass
                     …




      (b)   Describe the results of running the code fragment.                                 [2 marks]

      (c)   Construct a method  doIt(int[] dArray) that takes an array of any size as
            a formal parameter and which contains the code fragment, setting a reasonable
            value for the variable  n based on the size of the array.  The method should
            return the number of times the condition  dArray[i] < dArray[i – 1] is true.       [7 marks]

      (d)   Explain why the method call  doIt(dArray) is able to change the contents of
            the array  dArray.                                                                 [2 marks]

      (e)   Construct a method that will repeatedly call the method  doIt() until it
            returns zero.                                                                      [2 marks]

      (f)   State the number of times the method  doIt() will be called if the values in the
            array  dArray  are in:

            (i)     ascending order;                                                            [1 mark]

            (ii)    descending order.                                                           [1 mark]

2.    A taxi firm has twenty different locations (stands) in the town where its taxis can wait
      for passengers.

      Each taxi has an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) device which provides
      the present location of that taxi as two coordinates: latitude (lat) and longitude (long).
      With this information, it is possible to calculate the distance to a given destination.

                                    lat2                         destination

                                    lat1               taxi


                                               long1          long2

      (a)     State the location of the taxi as a pair of coordinates.                              [1 mark]

      An object of class type  Location defines the coordinates of a location.
      public class Location
      {
        double latitude;
        double longitude;
            // constructor
      }

      (b)     Construct a constructor method that takes two  double arguments to initialize
              the latitude and longitude coordinates of a new  Location object.                    [3 marks]

      The distance between location A and location B within the town is approximated by
                                   ( (lat − lat ) + (long − long ) ) .
                                           A   B
                                                   2
                                                                A       B
                                                                            2



      (c)     Construct the  distance(Location A, Location B) method, that returns the
              distance between two locations.  You can use the method  sqrt() to calculate
              the square root.                                                                     [3 marks]

      A computer onboard the taxi receives the taxi’s current position from the GPS.  
      It also has a file containing the locations of all the taxi stands.  The array  AllStands
      contains the locations of all twenty taxi stands.

      (d)     Construct the  closest(Location[] AllStands, Location B) method that
              searches through the array  AllStands and returns the index of the point closest
              to location B.  You should use the  distance() method from part (c).                 [6 marks]

      After taking a passenger to their destination, the taxi must return to a stand.

      (e)     Explain how the onboard computer could provide the driver with a list of the five
              closest taxi stands ordered by their distance from that taxi’s present location.     [5 marks]

      In some cases it might take longer to reach the closest taxi stand than to reach one of
      the other stands.

      (f)     Outline one reason why this may occur.                                               [2 marks]

3.    This question requires the use of the case study.

      (a)   State two differences between Wi-Fi and WiMAX.                                [2 marks]

      (b)   State two differences between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.                            [2 marks]

      (c)   Explain two reasons why a mobile phone designer might choose to provide a
            keyboard instead of a touch screen.                                           [4 marks]

      (d)   Explain two ways in which using a mobile phone to link an ambulance to a
            hospital could compromise the privacy of a patient.                           [4 marks]

      (e)   Outline two ways in which data interception can occur when using a
            mobile device.                                                                [4 marks]

      (f)   Outline two advantages of not restricting the development of apps to the
            manufacturers of mobile devices.                                              [3 marks]

      (g)   Describe how social engineering is used to persuade mobile device users to
            reveal personal information.                                                  [4 marks]

      (h)   Identify the type of memory in which the software for controlling a mobile
            device is most likely to be stored.                                           [1 mark]

      Many employers are providing their employees with mobile devices so that they can
      be connected to their work 24/7.

      (i)   Discuss the effects of this on the employee.                                  [6 marks]
