Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown
by written working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable
working, e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      A store recorded their sales of televisions during the 2010 football World Cup.
      They looked at the numbers of televisions bought by gender and the size of the
      television screens.
      This information is shown in the table below;  S represents the size of the television
      screen in inches.


                           S ≤ 22      22 < S ≤ 32    32 < S ≤ 46     S > 46          Total

      The store wants to use this information to predict the probability of selling these
      sizes of televisions for the 2014 football World Cup.

      (a)     Use the table to find the probability that

              (i)    a television will be bought by a female;

              (ii)   a television with a screen size of 32 < S ≤ 46 will be bought;

              (iii) a television with a screen size of 32 < S ≤ 46 will be bought by a female;

              (iv) a television with a screen size greater than 46 inches will be bought,
                   given that it is bought by a male.                                            [6 marks]

      The manager of the store wants to determine whether the screen size is independent
      of gender.  A Chi-squared test is performed at the 1 % significance level.

      (b)     Write down the null hypothesis.                                                    [1 mark]

      (c)     Show that the expected frequency for females who bought a screen size
              of 32 < S ≤ 46 , is 79, correct to the nearest integer.                            [2 marks]

              your answer.                                                                       [2 marks]
