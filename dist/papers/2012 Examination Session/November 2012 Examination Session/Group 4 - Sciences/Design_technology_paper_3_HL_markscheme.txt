Subject Details: Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried
      forward) on the script.

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

           the company could be sued if “cannot guarantee nut free” is not included;           [2 max]



A4. Award [1] for an example and [1] for each of two points of explanation of how chronic
    and acute food-related issues impact on a developed country’s health services [3 max]
    per issue, [6 max].
    Chronic food related issue:
    e.g. diabetes / obesity;
    long-term dependency on health services but not at acute level;

A5. (a)   Award [1] for outlining one way in which population growth poses challenges to
          the achievement of MDG1 and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
          more people to feed, more food required;
          more difficult to achieve MDG1;                                                          [2]

    (b)   Award [1] for outlining one way in which climate change contributes to food
          insecurity and the achievement of MDG1 and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
          climate change is leading to extreme weather conditions and drought and
          flooding;
          this can make crops fail and reduce food security;                                       [2]

    (c)   Award [1] for outlining one reason why the production of higher yielding
          cultivars of food crops is a more ethically-appropriate solution than
          genetic engineering for combating food insecurity and [1] for a brief explanation
          [2 max].
          public concerns over the safety of genetically-modified crops and therefore the
          ethical appropriateness of using them for combating food insecurity;
          higher yielding cultivars can produce more and better food without resorting to
          genetic engineering;                                                                     [2]

          and provides consumers with instructions/guidance;
          relating to storage/reheating/use by date;                                               [3]

    (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a suggestion of one reason
          why the increased consumption of ready meals in developed countries may be a
          factor in the rise of food poisoning incidents. [3max].
          inadequate heating;
          instructions not always followed;
          ignorance about the importance of re-heating the food correctly;

          inadequate storage;
          food not stored at the correct temperature;
          or stored beyond the use by date;

          must store in a refrigerator or cool cabinet above any raw foods, especially meat;
          this will ensure that the ready meal is not dripped on;
          this would contaminate the food with microorganisms and unless properly stored
          could grow in the ready meal and cause food poisoning;                               [3 max]

           seats are not enclosed so it is easy to see under them;                                 [2]



E6. (a)    Award [1] per distinct point in an explanation of the relationship between user
           trial and motion capture to the development of a digital human [3 max].
           a motion capture session records the movements of a person performing a user
           trial;
           e.g. using a kettle;
           the captured movements are mapped to a 3D model created by a computer expert
           so that the model moves digitally;                                                      [3]

     (b)   Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of how the use of digital
           humans can assist the designer of a car to deal with the problem of designing the
           car for a wide percentile range [3 max].
           ensures that people of different sizes will be able to use all the controls
           effectively/ see out of the windows;
           ensures that the users can climb in and out of the vehicle easily;
           ensures that the strength required to operate the controls is within the normal
           range;
           ensures that foot pedals can be reached by users in the normal percentile range;    [3 max]
                                                   – 26 –              N12/4/DESTE/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


E7. Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of why feedback, mapping and
    affordance are important in human factors design [3 max] for each aspect.
    feedback is the provision of information as a result of an action;
    e.g. an audible or visual response to pressing a control;
    so the user can decide how to respond;

     mapping relates to the correspondence between the layout of controls;
     and their required action;
     e.g. making important controls most visible;

     affordance is the characteristic of an object that indicates how it is to be used;
     e.g. turning a control knob in the right direction;
     to limit confusion and ensure safety/efficiency;                                           [9]
