This markscheme is confidential and for the exclusive use of
examiners in this examination session.

It is the property of the International Baccalaureate and must not
be reproduced or distributed to any other person without the
authorization of the IB Assessment Centre.

Subject Details: Physics HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  30 marks].
Maximum total = [60 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

          is now known) from L = 4πd 2b ;                                                             [2]

                this involves many uncertainties related to measurement of distances/volume;

G3. blue/short wavelength light is scattered most in the atmosphere;
    at sunset, sunlight passes through a greater thickness of atmosphere;
    so the Sun/sky/clouds appear redder due to removal of blue / OWTTE;                     [3]

H3. (a)   inertial and gravitational effects are indistinguishable / a freely falling frame in a
          gravitational field is equivalent to an inertial frame far from all masses /
          an accelerating frame is equivalent to a frame at rest in a gravitational field;             [1]

    (b)   (i)     The question does not specifically state the location of the tower so allow any
                  of the explanations below.
                  (the principle of equivalence predicts) photon energy decreases as it moves
                  against a g field;
                  this energy is given by E = hf ;
                  hence as E decreases, f must also decrease;                                          [3]
                  or
                  the tower is equivalent to a frame accelerating upwards;
                  the top of the tower is moving away from the light emitted from the base;
                  and so by the Doppler effect/red-shift the frequency at the top will be less;
                  or
                  in freely falling tower the frequency at the top and bottom would be the same;
                  an outside observer sees the top moving towards the light emitted from the
                  base and so (by the Doppler effect) expects a blue-shift;
                  for the frequency to be the same at the top the light moving upwards must
                  suffer an equal red-shift;

            (ii)   iodine-131 will be localized to the thyroid/will not be spread throughout the
                   body;
                   the effective half-life of nearly 6 days means that iodine remains in the body
                   for enough time to be effective/before losing too much of its activity;
                   an effective half life of 6 days means that activity will decrease to very
                   low/safe levels after a few weeks;
                   beta particles have a limited range in tissue so will interact with the cancer
                   cells rather than escape to the environment / OWTTE;
                   the gamma emissions mean that the activity of the isotope in the body can
                   be monitored externally;                                                           [3 max]
