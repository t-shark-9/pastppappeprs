40.   50 cm3 of copper(II) sulfate solution is measured into a plastic cup using a 100 cm3 measuring
      cylinder.   Excess zinc powder is added and the temperature rise that occurs is measured
      with a –10 °C to +110 °C thermometer.  The enthalpy change for the reaction is then calculated.  
      Which statement is correct?

      A.    Systematic error will be reduced by repeating the experiment several times and averaging
            the results.

      B.    Random error will be reduced by insulating the plastic cup.

      C.    Random error will be reduced by using a 50 cm3 graduated pipette instead of a measuring
            cylinder.

      D.    Systematic error will be increased by using a larger volume of copper(II) sulfate solution.
