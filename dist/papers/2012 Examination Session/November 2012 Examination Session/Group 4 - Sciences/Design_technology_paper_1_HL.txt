3.    Figure 1 shows an elevator (lift) shaft in a busy office building with a number of people waiting
      to board. The elevator receives instructions via display panels on the wall next to the elevator on
      each floor (floorcall) or from the panel within the elevator (panelcall). If the elevator is travelling
      up the elevator shaft it continues upwards until it has serviced all the calls or it reaches the top of the
      elevator shaft. It then changes direction and travels down servicing calls as it goes down until there
      are no more calls or it reaches the bottom of the elevator shaft when it again changes direction.

23.   The roof of Stadium Southland in New Zealand collapsed under an unusually heavy fall of very
      wet snow in September 2010 (see Figure 6). The stadium was built when the building regulations
      specified a snow load of 0.37 kiloPascals (kPa) and was designed to withstand 0.4 kPa. The snow that
      caused the collapse was in the range of 0.36 kPa and 0.45 kPa. The building code in New Zealand
      now stipulates a 0.63 kPa load.

Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the front and back of a traffic management sign undergoing evaluation in a
field trial. The sign integrates solar power and a wind turbine which charge a battery.

This type of sign has a number of advantages:

•   they are bright and easy to read
•   they are easy to install as they do not have to be connected to the national grid system
•   they are low maintenance
•   they are equipped with movement sensors so they light up if a vehicle approaches them too fast.

The signs are being constantly developed to produce a product family for a wide range of traffic management
applications.
