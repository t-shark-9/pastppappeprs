Subject Details:              Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 x 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

           awareness affects food choice in relation to fibre intake [3 max].

           raised cholesterol levels, haemorrhoids, colonic cancer);
           health awareness would make people eat higher fibre diet;
           selection of higher fibre foods, e.g. breads made from wholewheat not white flour;        [3]



A2. (a)    Award [1] for a definition of food spoilage to the effect of:

           nuts and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           nut allergies are increasingly common;
           potential consumers with nut allergies are looking for assurances about the
           likelihood of products containing nuts;
           the company could be sued if “cannot guarantee nut free” is not included;           [2 max]



A4. Award [1] for identifying one issue relating to the scaling up of recipes from bench
    scale and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].

    long-term dependency on health services but not at acute level;
    financial implications for public purse;
    some of these problems are avoidable with increased levels of health awareness by the
    general public;

     Acute food related issue:
     e.g. food-poisoning incident in a hotel, restaurant or institution;
     large numbers of people can be affected simultaneously;

E6. Award [1] for each distinct point in an explanation of why feedback, mapping and
    affordance are important in human factors design [3 max] for each aspect.
    feedback is the provision of information as a result of an action;

    so the user can decide how to respond;

     mapping relates to the correspondence between the layout of controls;
     and their required action;
     e.g. making important controls most visible;

     affordance is the characteristic of an object that indicates how it is to be used;
     e.g. turning a control knob in the right direction;
     to limit confusion and ensure safety/efficiency;                                           [9]
