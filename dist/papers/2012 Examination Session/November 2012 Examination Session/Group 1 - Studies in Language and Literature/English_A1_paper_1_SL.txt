Write a commentary on one of the following:

1.

                    Down the street there is a radio-repair shop run by an elderly Italian, Joe Vitale.
             Early in the summer there appeared across the front of his store a strange sign: The Black Wido1.
             And in smaller lettering: watch this window for news of the black wido. So our neighborhood
             wondered, waited. A few days later two yellowed photographs were added to the display; these,
       5     taken some twenty years before, showed Mr. Vitale as a husky man dressed in a black knee-length
             bathing suit, a black swimming cap and a mask. Typed captions below the pictures explained that
             Joe Vitale, whom we’d all known only as a stoop-shouldered, sad-eyed radio-repair man, had once
             been, in a more supreme incarnation, a champion swimmer and a lifeguard at Rockaway Beach.
                    We were warned to continue watching the windows; our reward came the following week:
     10      in a bold streamer, Mr. Vitale announced that The Black Wido was about to resume his career.
             There was a poem in the window, and the poem was called “The Dream of Joe Vitale”; it told of
             how he’d dreamed of again breasting the waves, conquering the sea.
                    On the next day appeared a final notice; it was an invitation, really, one which said we were
             all welcome to come to Rockaway on August 20, for this day he planned to swim from that beach
     15      to Jones Beach, a far piece. Through the intervening summer days, Mr. Vitale sat outside his store
             on a camp stool, observing the reactions of passers-by to his various declarations, sat there, dreamy
             and detached, nodding, smiling politely when neighbors stopped to wish him luck. A smart-aleck2
             kid asked him why he’d left out the last letter of Wido, and he answered very gently that widow
             with a w is for ladies.
     20             For a while nothing more happened. Then one morning the world woke up and laughed
             at the dream of Joe Vitale. His story was in every paper; the tabloids put his picture on the front
             pages. And sorry pictures they were, too, for here he was, in a moment not of triumph, but agony,
             here he was standing on the beach at Rockaway with policemen on either side. And in their
             accounts this is the attitude most of the papers took: once upon a time there was a mad silly old
     25      man who rubbed himself with grease and trotted down to the sea, but when the lifeguards saw him
             out swimming so far, they put to their boats and brought him to shore; such a shy one, this comical
             old man, for the instant their backs were turned, he was off again, and so out the lifeguards rowed
             once more, and The Black Wido, forced upon the beach like a half-dead shark, returned to hear not
             the mermaids singing, but curses, catcalls, police whistles.
     30             The proper thing to do would be to go and tell Joe Vitale how sorry you are, how brave you
             think him, and say, well, whatever you can; the death of a dream is no less sad than death, and,
             indeed, demands of those who have lost as deep a mourning. But his radio store is closed; it has
             been for a long time; there is no sign of him anywhere, and his poem has slipped from place, has
             fallen beyond view.

                                              The Cat’s Song

                        Mine, says the cat, putting out his paw of darkness.
                        My lover, my friend, my slave, my toy, says
                        the cat making on your chest his gesture of drawing
                        milk from his mother’s forgotten breasts.

                    5   Let us walk in the woods, says the cat.
                        I’ll teach you to read the tabloid of scents,
                        to fade into shadow, wait like a trap, to hunt.
                        Now I lay this plump warm mouse on your mat.

                        You feed me, I try to feed you, we are friends,
                  10    says the cat, although I am more equal than you.
                        Can you leap twenty times the height of your body?
                        Can you run up and down trees? Jump between roofs?

                        Let us rub our bodies together and talk of touch.
                        My emotions are pure as salt crystals and as hard.
                  15    My lusts glow like my eyes. I sing to you in the mornings
                        walking round and round your bed and into your face.

                        Come I will teach you to dance as naturally
                        as falling asleep and waking and stretching long, long.
                        I speak greed with my paws and fear with my whiskers.
                  20    Envy lashes my tail. Love speaks me entire, a word

                        of fur. I will teach you to be still as an egg
                        and to slip like the ghost of wind through the grass.
