Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you
have studied. You may include in your answer a discussion of a Part 2 work of the same genre if relevant.
Answers which are not based on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score high marks.

Drama

1.    Sometimes plays move beyond dialogue and conventional stage action into other techniques such
      as mime, plays within plays, dance or direct interaction with the audience. How have at least two
      playwrights you have studied used such techniques to enhance the effects of their plays?


2.    How far do playwrights include back stories or the life histories of characters prior to the plays and
      to what effect? Refer to at least two works you have studied by different playwrights.



Poetry

3.    The opening lines and the closing lines of poems are often very important. In the works of
      at least two poets you have studied, show the function of such lines in the larger meaning and effect
      of the poems.


4.    “A poem is many things moving together, and what holds them together is tone, the poet’s attitude
      toward the subject.” With reference to the works of at least two poets you have studied, show
      how materials that might be very familiar are shaped into something unique by the choice of
      particular tone(s).



Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.    “Characters in fiction come to life through their dialogue.”  In at least two works you have studied,
      explore important moments where dialogue develops character portrayal.


6.    The influence of belief in traditions such as religion, family bonds, or patriotism can be used to
      develop such narrative aspects as, for example, setting, motivation, or sources of conflict.  
      In at least two works you have studied, show how writers have incorporated such influences to
      good effect.

Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.    In the various forms of prose other than the novel and short story, the writer often presents
      himself/herself in a favourable light. However, added interest can arise when the writer reveals less
      flattering aspects of self.  By what means and to what extent is this the case in at least two works you
      have studied?


8.    Memory has a significant role to play in many works of prose other than the novel and short story.  
      In at least two works you have studied, discuss some of the ways in which remembering events,
      people or feelings have been incorporated with interesting effects for the works and the readers.



General Questions on Literature

9.    Works of literature often address continuity or change across generations. Referring to at least two
      works you have studied, in what ways and to what effect have such issues across generations been
      presented?


10.   Aspects of the physical body – potential, limitation, special attributes – are often used by writers in
      their presentation of humans or animals. Show how and to what effect at least two writers you have
      studied have used such material.


11.   Delaying revelation and withholding information are techniques sometimes used by writers to sustain
      the reader’s interest. In at least two works you have studied, show how writers have been able to
      employ such strategies in varying ways and with differing or similar effects.


12.   Playfulness in words, attitudes and behaviour is not just for children. With close reference to
      at least two works you have studied, examine how and to what effect authors have presented
      playfulness on the part of adults.
