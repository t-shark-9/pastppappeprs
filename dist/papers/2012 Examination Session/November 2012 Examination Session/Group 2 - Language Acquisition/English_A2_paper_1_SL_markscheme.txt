These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from a short story and a newspaper article.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

   call attention to the different genres: one a short story and the other a newspaper article
   discuss purpose (one to entertain, the other to instruct)
   mention one or two stylistic features of each text.

A better comparative commentary may:

   discuss point of view (text 1 being first person, text 2 being second person)
   consider the melancholy, reflective, slightly ironic (Surf King, applauding audience) tone of
    text 1 versus the upbeat, encouraging tone of text 2, despite the fact that these are instructions
   discuss tense – the simple present of text 2 versus the more complicated use of tense in text 1
    (past switches to present in paragraph 2, but it’s still a recollection. It’s a narrative trick to
    make the memory seem more present.)
   note that text 1 describes the experience of a novice adult swimmer, whereas text 2 is directed
    towards competent lap swimmers
   compare structure (text 1 is a narrative where the plot gradually builds, whereas text 2
    features headlines and sub-headings and is meant for easy reading and immediate
    comprehension)
   note that text 1 is from the perspective of a learner, whereas text 2 is from the perspective of a
    teacher
   look at diction in both texts (proper English in text 1 vs. the catchy/slangy use of English in
    text 2 – “hop in,” “up to snuff,” “swim yourself into shape” – which becomes more technical
    as it progresses).

The best comparative commentaries may:

   note that the speaker in text 1 is doing the opposite of what is being suggested in text 2
    (splashing, uneasy breathing, not being a “sleek vessel”)
   comment on the use and effect of proper nouns (Chaupatty Beach, Surf King, Ron in text 1;
    Michael Phelps in text 2)
   discuss the use of word play/double entendre in text 2 (“Don’t be a drag,” “Don’t make
    a splash,” “Breathe easy”)
   compare the informal register of text 2 with the more formal, but still intimate, confessional
    register of text 1
   note that water is anthropomorphized in each text (text 1: “when I was a child, carried about
    by the waves”; text 2: “the cool water of your local pool or lake is beckoning”)
   draw attention to the fact that while the water seems looming in text 1, it seems inviting in
    text 2
   compare the fact that while Ron the instructor seems cavalier in text 1 (encouraging a
    swimmer to jump into the deep end in the first lesson, “Perfectly safe”), the instructor/speaker
    of text 2 seems very careful and conscientious
   discuss the fact that text 1 begins and ends rather gloomily, while text 2 begins joyfully,
    almost fancifully and ends on a note of up-beat encouragement.

                                           SECTION B

This question invites the candidate to consider two texts about manners, the first an extract from a
memoir which recalls childhood lessons on manners and the other an extract from a guide which
instructs in the teaching of manners to children.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary will:

   comment on the importance placed on manners in both extracts
   observe that text 3 relates to personal experience and is written in first person whereas text 4
    is written in third person and is more general
   comment on the use of dialogue in text 3 and the use of subheadings and headings in text 4.

A better comparative commentary may also:

   observe that text 3 is an example of “the small house where perhaps the mother alone must be
    the teacher” referred to in text 4
   contrast the ways in which disobedience is presented in the two texts
   comment on the listing of imperatives in the first paragraph of text 3 and the use of adverbs
    and adjectives in the first two paragraphs of text 4
   contrast the purposes of the two texts, text 3’s being to entertain and text 4’s being to teach
    and instruct.

The best comparative commentary may also:

   comment on the tone created in the two texts, the sense of drama and humour conveyed in
    text 3 and the voice of authority (perhaps even extreme) conveyed in text 4, and the effect of
    the passive voice
   comment on why “Answering Back” in text 3 is written with capital letters in text 3 and
    “show off” is in inverted commas in text 4
   compare the attitude conveyed towards authority shown in text 3 with the attitude expressed
    towards children presented in text 4
   comment on the metaphor in text 3 that “manners are keys” and the simile “training a child is
    exactly like training a puppy” in text 4. They may also comment on the child as a “victim” in
    text 4
   assess Jenny’s efforts and the prospects of the child in text 3, in the light of the advice given
    in the guide.
