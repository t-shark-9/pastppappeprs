TEXT A


                         The Healing Effect of Music
       Words and music are such natural partners that it seems obvious they go together. Now science is
       conﬁrming that those abilities are linked in the brain, a ﬁnding that might lead to better treatment of
       various disorders.

              [–X–]            Her mother thought she was speech impaired. For years the child had
 5                             not spoken a word, and hearing her sing a rhyme was something everyone had
       long given up hope of. She was autistic, but Margaret Lobo, a music therapist in Mumbai, knew
       that she could be reached through music. Lobo sang nursery rhymes, encouraging the child to sing
       after her. After just three sessions her student sang, loud and clear. Lobo had unbolted her isolated
       world, if only for a brief moment.

10             [–1–]          Lobo is one of the unlikely people working in the ﬁeld of behavioural therapy.
                              After all, music and dance do not seem to belong in psychiatry books.
       Yet these creative forms may hold solutions for psychological problems. Doctors are increasingly
       prescribing these therapies for Attention Deﬁcit Disorder, dyslexia, autism and depression.

               [–2–]           Broadly, these therapies work on the premise that the basic brain structure is
15                             the same for everyone, and if someone cannot read, write or communicate, it
       isn’t because there is something wrong with their brain, but because we don’t have the right tools to
       communicate with them. These tools could well be found in various art forms.

                               Lobo uses music therapy to deal with autism and other disorders. “It works
             The variety
             of uses of        on anyone. You could be paralysed due to a stroke, but the ability to
20          music therapy      comprehend music never goes,” she says. She encourages a child to
                               experiment with many instruments, looking for cues about what might work in
       each case. The breakthrough may take weeks, sometimes even years, and the effect may be ﬂeeting.
       “There is a feeling of triumph each time a student manages to say a sentence coherently.”

               [–3–]         Dance therapy, meanwhile, uses body movements to increase emotional and
25                           physical coordination. Tripura Kashyap, an instructor in dance therapy, says,
       “Dance can improve imitation skills and memory, as kids are motivated to focus for a long time and
       learn the sequence of steps.”

               Stroke         New research suggests that intensive musical therapy may also help improve
                              speech in stroke patients. People who have suffered a severe stroke
              patients
30                            on the left side of the brain and cannot speak can sometimes learn to
       communicate through singing, said Gottfried Schlaug, of Harvard Medical School. “Music making
       activates links to several parts of the brain.” Schlaug mentioned one patient learning to say
       “I am thirsty,” by singing the words. He said that as long as a century ago there were reports of
       stroke victims who couldn’t talk but who could sing.

                                                                        From http://epaper.khaleejtimes.com

       A FRESH MAKEOVER FOR FAMILIAR FACES
       Color changes everything. It has, anyway, in
       the East Gallery of the Frick Collection, where
       walls covered with brown velvet for years are
       now a beautiful shade of coral.

 5     The paintings appear to be freshly restored.
       They’re not. They simply benefit from the
       soft velvet coral color, which sharpens details,
       clarifies compositions and deepens meanings.
       Suddenly this room shines as never before.

10     The East Gallery’s changes also include better lighting and the addition of a large, comfortable bench.
       This is a good thing, since art lovers may need a seat when they view the paintings by El Greco
       and Goya. These paintings have recently been moved here from the dark green walls of the West Gallery,
       and they’ve never looked better.

       The Frick, which turned 75 this year, has been fine-tuning its home in Henry Clay Frick’s mansion,
15     gallery by gallery, for more than a decade. Besides the East Gallery, the latest changes include the first
       cleaning in 60 years of the great Velázquez portrait of Philip IV of Spain, which went back on view in
       November in the Oval Room. With each change, the museum is becoming more user-friendly while also
       becoming one of the greatest museums in the world for close encounters with some of the high points of
       European painting.

20     Frick was an industrialist made rich by coal and coke. He started buying art while young and not rich, and
       always planned that his mansion would be dedicated to the public display of his beloved collection after
       his death.

       The coral emphasizes the red wherever it occurs – most expansively in the opulent dress worn by the
       wealthy Mary Edwards in William Hogarth’s 1742 portrait of her, and in Joshua Reynolds’s 1766 portrait
25     of a red-coated English officer, “General John Burgoyne”. But it works similar magic across the room in
       Jean-François Millet’s view of ordinary life, “Woman Sewing by Lamplight” from 1870–72.

       There are also changes in the Dining Room. Here new lighting illuminates a new arrangement of
       English paintings that goes back to the one that Frick originally had in mind. He took care that the
       room’s tall windows were far enough apart to accommodate his full-length portraits of English beauties
30     by Reynolds, Gainsborough and Romney. Perhaps Frick wanted to look at beautiful women while dining,
       regardless of who was actually at the table, but so what?

       The Oval Room is also different. Ruling over this room and dominating the four Whistler full-lengths
       in attendance, Velázquez’s “Philip IV” radiates royal privilege, but his face also indicates despair.
       Velázquez’s depiction of him is worthy of Shakespeare.

                The Motorway Service Station
               I arrived at the service station towards evening. The sky was turning red in the west
                and in a row of ornamental trees birds could be heard against the incessant bass note
                of the traffic. I had been on the road for two hours, alone with clouds forming on the
                horizon, with motorway bridges and the silhouettes of overtaking cars and coaches.
 5              I felt dizzy stepping out of my vehicle, which gave off a series of clicks as it cooled,
                as if paper clips were being dropped through the engine. My senses needed to readjust
                themselves to firm land, to the wind and to the discreet sounds of night drawing in.

               The restaurant was brightly illuminated and exaggeratedly warm. Large photographs
                of coffee cups, pastries and hamburgers hung on the walls. A waitress was refilling
10              a drinks dispenser. I slid a damp tray along a metal runway, bought a bar of chocolate
                and an orange juice and sat by a window that made up one wall of the building.
                Beyond the window, the grass sloped down to the motorway, where the traffic ran
                in silent, elegant symmetry along six lanes, the differences in makes and colours of cars
                disguised by the gathering darkness, leaving a uniform ribbon of red and white diamonds
15              disappearing into infinity in two directions.

               There were few other customers in the restaurant. A woman was idly rotating a teabag
                in a cup. A man and two girls were eating hamburgers. A bearded elderly man was
                doing a crossword. No one was talking. There was an air of reflection, of sadness
                too – only heightened by the faint sound of piped upbeat music and the enamel smile
20              of a woman about to bite into a bacon sandwich in a photograph above the counter.
                In the middle of the room, hanging from the ceiling and dancing nervously in the
                breeze of an air vent, was a cardboard box announcing an offer of free onion rings with
                every hot dog. Misshapen and upside down, the box seemed only a rough approximation
                of what head office must have stipulated, like those milestones in distant parts of the
25              Roman Empire whose forms strayed from the plans of the centre.

               The building was architecturally miserable, and yet something about the scene
                moved me. There was poetry in this forsaken service station, perched on the edge of
                the motorway far from all habitation. Its appeal made me think of certain other
                equally and unexpectedly poetic travelling places such as airport terminals, harbours,
30              train stations and motels.

      A Kayak on the Amazon
Helen Skelton, presenter of the children’s TV programme Blue Peter, is aiming to become
the ﬁrst woman to kayak 2010 miles down the Amazon river.

                                               “I am going to need seven bottles of shampoo,” Helen Skelton
                                               says worriedly. It is indeed scary news for the Blue Peter
                                               presenter, but not perhaps what would concern most people
                                               setting off on a world record-breaking ordeal.

                                               Her task over the next six weeks is to kayak solo for
                                               2010 miles down the Amazon. No woman has ever done
                                               that before, let alone one with no paddling experience.
                                               On route she can expect to encounter 20 ft anacondas
                                               and lots of piranhas; hideous blisters and sores are
guaranteed. As she steers her 15-kilo boat along the crocodile-infested river, there is also a likelihood that
she will contract a disease such as yellow fever or malaria. But, with the glorious optimism of youth, it is her
blonde hair that she is worried about.

However, last week everything went wrong. “The supplies didn’t arrive on time, so I only managed half a
day on Wednesday so already I’m behind,” she admitted. “Within two hours of paddling, my hands were
so badly blistered that they had to be taped up. I took a wrong direction and had to ﬁght the current;
it was exhausting. The heat here is so intense that it really drains you.”

It sounds like she might almost be ready to give up. “Oh no,” she screams, “I still believe that if I manage
60 miles a day – just a little more than the 58 I did on Thursday – I can make it.”

Helen will need luck over the next six weeks because a punishing schedule lies ahead. For six out of
seven days each week, she will paddle for at least ten hours, from 5.30 am until dark, with only a short break
for lunch when the heat and 100 per cent humidity become unbearable. On the seventh day, she will make
ﬁlms about her adventures for Blue Peter ’s 750 000 viewers.

This is a genuinely risky assignment. There are no roads, no towns, only rainforest and the river along which
she must navigate. If she falls ill, it will take around eleven hours to ﬂy her to safety.

On 1st November, when she was given the go-ahead for the Amazon trip, she had only ever been kayaking
once before. “I was in a New York hotel room, having run a marathon. Immediately I took hold of a
broom handle and started paddling on my bed.” If she does make it, it will be because children all over the
country are e-mailing her their encouragement. “Who am I to let them down?” says Helen. “It would be like
saying the tooth fairy doesn’t exist.”
