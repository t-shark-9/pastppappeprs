                                    Better Swimming Tips to Get in Top Shape
                             If you want success in the pool, try to avoid making waves

                   The sun is shining (finally) and the cool water of your local pool or lake is beckoning1.
             So why not hop in and go for a swim? If you’re worried that your front crawl isn’t up to snuff 2,
             then you’ll want to take advantage of this primer3 on how to improve your technique and make it
             easier to swim yourself into shape.

     5              And while there’s no guarantee that you’ll become the next Michael Phelps4, the following
             tips are designed to make you feel more comfortable in the water. They’re also designed to help
             you expend less energy, which translates into getting more laps done in less time.

                    You’ll have more success and less frustration if you attempt to master one tip at a time.
             Swimming is a technical sport and the body and brain need time not just to learn the individual
    10       skills but to sync them into your stroke.

                    If you’re worried that you’re going to look like a fool attempting these drills at the local pool,
             rest assured that every swimmer needs to work on their technique, even the great Phelps.

             Don’t be a drag
                   Swimmers reduce water’s natural resistance by pulling themselves into a long, tight,
             streamlined position. The idea is to turn the body into a sleek vessel that slips through the water,
    15       creating minimum disturbance in its wake5.

             Don’t make a splash
                   Good swimmers are quiet swimmers.             They create minimal splash by sliding,
             not plopping, their arms in the water and keeping their kick small, tight, and controlled. All of
             that makes fewer waves, creates less turbulence, and takes less energy. Your goal is to take the
             splash out of your stroke and replace it with an easy, relaxed style that won’t drown your fellow
    20       lap swimmers as you pass each other in the pool.

             Breathe easy
                    Relaxed, rhythmic breathing looks deceptively easy. In reality, however, it’s one of the
             hardest skills to master. The trick is to rotate your whole body, not just your head, to grab that bit
             of air. Keep practising your breathing drill until it feels as natural in the water as it does on land!

                              Adapted from a feature article in The Montréal Gazette newspaper, 23 June 2011,
                                                      ‘Better swimming tips to get in top shape’ by Jill Barker.

                                                 The Kindergarten of Etiquette1

                   In the houses of the well-to-do where the nursery is in the charge of a woman of refinement
            who is competent to teach little children proper behavior, they are never allowed to come to table
            until they have learned at least the elements of good manners. But whether in a big house of
            this description, or a small house where perhaps the mother alone must be the teacher, children can
      5     scarcely be too young to be taught the rudiments of etiquette, nor can the teaching be too patiently
            or too conscientiously carried out.
                   Training a child is exactly like training a puppy; a little heedless inattention and it is out of
            hand immediately; the great thing is not to let it acquire bad habits that must afterward be broken.
            Any child can be taught to be beautifully behaved with no greater effort than quiet patience
    10      and perseverance, whereas to break bad habits once they are acquired is a Herculean task.

            Chief Virtue: Obedience

                   No young human being, any more than a young dog, has the least claim to attractiveness
            unless it is trained to manners and obedience. The child that whines, interrupts, fusses, fidgets, and
            does nothing that it is told to do, has not the least power of attraction for any one.
                   When possible, a child should be taken away the instant it becomes disobedient. It soon
    15      learns that it cannot “stay with mother” unless it is well-behaved. Not only must children obey,
            but they must never be allowed to “show off” or become pert2, or to contradict or to answer back.
                   A child that loses its temper, that is petulant and disobedient, and a nuisance to everybody,
            is merely a victim, poor little thing, of parents who have been too incompetent or negligent to train
            it to obedience.

                     Adapted from Emily Post (1922) Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home
