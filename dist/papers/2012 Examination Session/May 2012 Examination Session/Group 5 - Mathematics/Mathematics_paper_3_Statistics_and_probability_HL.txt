Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working, e.g. if graphs are used to
find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks
may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore advised
to show all working.

      A baker produces loaves of bread that he claims weigh on average 800 g each.
      Many customers believe the average weight of his loaves is less than this. A food
      inspector visits the bakery and weighs a random sample of 10 loaves, with the following
      results, in grams:

                          783, 802, 804, 785, 810, 805, 789, 781, 800, 791.

      Assume that these results are taken from a normal distribution.

      (a)   Determine unbiased estimates for the mean and variance of the distribution.          [3 marks]

      In spite of these results the baker insists that his claim is correct.

      (b)   Stating appropriate hypotheses, test the baker’s claim at the 10 % level of
            significance.                                                                        [7 marks]

      The inspector informs the baker that he must improve his quality control and reject
      any loaf that weighs less than 790 g. The baker changes his production methods
      and asserts that he has reduced the number of low weight loaves. On a subsequent
      visit to the bakery the inspector tests a random sample of loaves for sale. Of the 40
      loaves tested, 5 should have been rejected.

      (c)   Calculate a 95 % confidence interval for the proportion of loaves for sale that
            should be rejected.                                                                  [4 marks]

      The random variable X has a geometric distribution with parameter p .

      (a)   Show that P ( X ≤ n) = 1 − (1 − p ) n , n ∈  + .                                    [3 marks]

      (b)   Deduce an expression for P (m < X ≤ n) , m , n ∈  + and m < n .                      [1 mark]

      (c)   Given that p = 0.2 , find the least value of n for which P (1 < X ≤ n) > 0.5 ,
            n ∈ + .                                                                             [2 marks]

      Each week the management of a football club recorded the number of injuries suffered
      by their playing staff in that week. The results for a 52-week period were as follows:

                   Number of injuries per week 0        1 2 3          4    5    6
                   Number of weeks             6        14 15 9        5    2    1

      (a)   Calculate the mean and variance of the number of injuries per week.                     [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain why these values provide supporting evidence for using a Poisson
            distribution model.                                                                     [1 mark]

      (c)   Stating your hypotheses, test whether a Poisson distribution is a suitable model for
            the number of injuries per week at the 5 % level of significance using a χ 2 test.     [10 marks]

      The continuous random variable X has probability density function f given by

                                              2x ,  0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 ,
