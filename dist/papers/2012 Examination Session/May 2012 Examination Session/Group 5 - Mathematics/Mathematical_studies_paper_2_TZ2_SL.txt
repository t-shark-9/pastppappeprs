Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for correct method, provided this is shown by written
working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      Leanne goes fishing at her favourite pond.   The pond contains four different
      types of fish: bream, flathead, whiting and salmon.   The fish are either undersized
      or normal.  This information is shown in the table below.

      Cedric wants to buy an  €8000  car.  The car salesman offers him a loan repayment
      option of a  25 %  deposit followed by 12 equal monthly payments of  €600 .

      (a)   Write down the amount of the deposit.                                                 [1 mark]

      Cedric’s mother decides to help him by giving him an interest free loan of  €8000  to
      buy the car.  She arranges for him to repay the loan by paying her  €x in the first month
      and  €y in every following month until the  €8000  is repaid.

      The total amount that Cedric’s mother receives after 12 months is  €3500 .
      This can be written using the equation x + 11 y = 3500 .
      The total amount that Cedric’s mother receives after 24 months is  €7100 .

      Cedric decides to buy a cheaper car for  €6000  and invests the remaining  €2000  at
      his bank.  The bank offers two investment options over three years.

      Option A: Compound interest at an annual rate of  8 %.

      Option B: Compound interest at a nominal annual rate of  7.5 % , compounded monthly.
