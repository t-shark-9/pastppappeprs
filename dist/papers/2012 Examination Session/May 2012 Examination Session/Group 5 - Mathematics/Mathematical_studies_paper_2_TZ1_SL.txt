Please start each question on a new page. You are advised to show all working, where possible.
Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be given for correct method, provided this is shown by written
working. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
e.g. if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

      Beartown has three local newspapers: The Art Journal, The Beartown News,
      and The Currier.

      A survey shows that

            32 % of the town’s population read The Art Journal,
            46 % read The Beartown News,
            54 % read The Currier,
            3 % read The Art Journal and The Beartown News only,
            8 % read The Art Journal and The Currier only,
            12 % read The Beartown News and The Currier only, and
            5 % of the population reads all three newspapers.

      (a)   Draw a Venn diagram to represent this information. Label A the set that
            represents The Art Journal readers, B the set that represents The Beartown News
            readers, and C the set that represents The Currier readers.                          [4 marks]

      (b)   Find the percentage of the population that does not read any of the
            three newspapers.                                                                    [2 marks]

      (c)   Find the percentage of the population that reads exactly one newspaper.              [2 marks]

      (d)   Find the percentage of the population that reads The Art Journal or
            The Beartown News but not The Currier.                                               [2 marks]

      A local radio station states that 83 % of the population reads either The Beartown News
      or The Currier.

      (e)   Use your Venn diagram to decide whether the statement is true. Justify your
            answer.                                                                              [2 marks]

      The population of Beartown is 120 000. The local radio station claimed that 34 000 of
      the town’s citizens read at least two of the local newspapers.

      (f)   Find the percentage error in this claim.                                             [4 marks]

      Part A

      The Green Park Amphitheatre was built in the form of a horseshoe and has 20 rows.
      The number of seats in each row increase by a fixed amount, d , compared to the
      number of seats in the previous row. The number of seats in the sixth row, u6 , is 100,
      and the number of seats in the tenth row, u10 , is 124. u1 represents the number of seats
      in the first row.

      (a)   (i)    Write an equation for u6 in terms of d and u1 .

            (ii)   Write an equation for u10 in terms of d and u1 .                               [2 marks]

      (c)   Find the total number of seats in the amphitheatre.                                   [3 marks]

      A few years later, a second level was added to increase the amphitheatre’s capacity by
      another 1600 seats. Each row has four more seats than the previous row. The first row
      on this level has 70 seats.

      (d)   Find the number of rows on the second level of the amphitheatre.                      [4 marks]

(Question 4 continued)

      Part B

      Frank is at the amphitheatre and receives a text message at 12:00. Five minutes later
      he forwards the text message to three people. Five minutes later, those three people
      forward the text message to three new people. Assume this pattern continues and
      each time the text message is sent to people who have not received it before.

      The number of new people who receive the text message forms a geometric sequence

                                                 1, 3, …

            12:30.                                                                              [2 marks]
