Answer all the questions.

14.   In a self-service fuel station, each pump has a touchscreen display equipped with a
      credit card reader and a printer for receipts.  All these peripherals are connected to
      a common computer that can communicate with the various credit card companies.  
      The pumps are set to deliver up to a maximum of 70 EUR of fuel.

      The customer inserts the payment card, enters the PIN and chooses the type of fuel.  
      The card is returned after validation and authorization from the credit card company,
      and only if these operations were successful can the fuel be dispensed.  Finally, the
      customer can choose to have a printed receipt with the actual expenditure.

      (a)   Describe the process that takes place at the station’s computer after the card’s
            PIN is entered through the touchscreen.                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify one piece of information that the computer at the fuel station needs to
            communicate to the credit card company if the authorization was successful.        [1 mark]

      (c)   Construct the system flowchart for the scenario described above.                   [4 marks]

      At night, the self-service fuel station may not be a particularly safe place.

      (d)   Explain why the owner of the fuel station has decided to set a limit of 70 EUR.    [3 marks]

15.   Consider the following recursive method.

      public int foo(int n)
      {
        if (n <= 0) return –1;
        else
        {
          if (n == 1) return 1;
          else
          {
             int y = n % 2;
             if (y == 0) return foo(n / 2);
             else return foo(3 * n + 1);
          }
        }
      }

      (a)   Identify the following in the code:

            (i)    a formal parameter;                                                        [1 mark]

      (b)   By copying and completing the following table, trace the algorithm for the
            call  foo(3).                                                                    [2 marks]

      (c)   Suggest a way to modify the method above in order to optimize the tests on  n.   [2 marks]

      (d)   Suggest how the method  bfoo, that returns Boolean values, can be obtained as

16.   A farm grows fruit in several greenhouses.   There is a network of sensors that
      contain microprocessors, which periodically measure the temperature and humidity
      in the greenhouses.  When a sensor detects a value outside of the acceptable range,
      it sends a message that causes an interrupt in the main server.  

      (a)   Explain why polling would not be appropriate in this situation.                      [2 marks]

      (b)   Outline how a CPU handles an interrupt.                                              [3 marks]

      (c)   Identify one process that takes place in the sensors’ microprocessors.               [1 mark]

      The server performs various tasks, including the regulation of temperature and
      humidity in each greenhouse.

      (d)   Suggest the steps the server would now take to restore conditions to within the
            acceptable range.                                                                    [4 marks]


17.   A social club stores on a disk file records containing some data of its members.  
      The records do not need to be frequently accessed.  The record structure is shown below.

                         Data type          Field name        Example data

                          String             address        Hollyoak Farm


      (a)   Define the term fixed-length record.                                                 [1 mark]

      (b)   Explain how the length of each record can be fixed considering the data types
            above.                                                                               [3 marks]

      (c)   Explain why direct access is an appropriate system for accessing data in
            this situation.                                                                      [3 marks]

      (d)   Describe how a record can be accessed quickly if the file does not consist of
            fixed-length records.                                                                [3 marks]

18.   The tree shown below is unbalanced, i.e. there are at least two leaves in the tree that
      are located at levels whose difference is more than one.   For example, the levels’
      difference for the leaves labelled Padma and Amina is three.

                   Level 0:                     David


                   Level 1:    Amina                             Marion


                   Level 2:                               Lou             Rachid

                   Level 4:                                             Padma

      (a)   State the mode of traversal on the tree above that would allow a list of names to
            be obtained in alphabetical order.                                                      [1 mark]

      Successive operations of insertion and deletion of nodes must preserve the possibility
      of producing a list of names in alphabetical order through the mode of traversal
      identified in part (a).

      (b)   The node Silvia is added to the tree.  Identify its position in the tree.               [1 mark]

      (c)   Discuss how the order in which the names are inserted in the tree can affect the
            BigO efficiency of searching.                                                           [4 marks]

      (d)   Describe the steps, without writing any code, necessary to delete the node Marion
            from the given tree.                                                                    [4 marks]


19.   A company has set up a nationwide telephone call centre for enquiries.  Depending on
      the phone number of the caller, a mainframe (central server) redirects incoming calls
      to one of the four servers, each of them located at a regional centre.  The calls will then
      be directed to the operators in the regional call centre, working with their computers.  
      The network developed is hybrid.

      (a)   Construct a labelled diagram showing a suitable hybrid network made up of two
            basic topologies.                                                                       [5 marks]

      (b)   Suggest a physical transmission medium for communication:

            (i)      between the mainframe and the four servers at regional centres;                [1 mark]

            (ii)     between the server and the operators’ computers.                               [1 mark]

      (c)   Explain why switches would be used, rather than hubs, in this hybrid network.           [3 marks]
