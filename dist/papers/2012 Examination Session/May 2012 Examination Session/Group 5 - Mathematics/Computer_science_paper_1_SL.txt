                                                SECTION B

Answer all the questions.

13.   A company has set up a nationwide telephone call centre for enquiries.  Depending on
      the phone number of the caller, a mainframe (central server) redirects incoming calls
      to one of the four servers, each of them located at a regional centre.  The calls will then
      be directed to the operators in the regional call centre, working with their computers.  
      The network developed is hybrid.

      (a)   Construct a labelled diagram showing a suitable hybrid network made up of two
            basic topologies.                                                                       [5 marks]

      (b)   Suggest a physical transmission medium for communication:

            (i)    between the mainframe and the four servers at regional centres;                  [1 mark]

            (ii)   between the server and the operators’ computers.                                 [1 mark]

      (c)   Explain why switches would be used, rather than hubs, in this hybrid network.           [3 marks]

14.   An array  files  stores the sizes of some files, which we assume to be whole numbers.  
      The order of the elements in  files   respects the chronological order of creation of
      the files.  An application that performs a backup on a USB memory stick uses  files  
      to preliminarily compare the current capacity of the stick with the sizes required for
      each file as they appear in the array, before actually starting copying.  The application
      uses the method below.  The method is incorrect and we study it for debugging and
      for improvements.

      public int[] checkcapacity(int[] files, int capacity)
      {
        int s = files.length;
        int[] b = new int[s];
        int i = 0;
        int sum = files[i];
        while (sum <= capacity)
        {
          b[i] = files[i];
          i = i + 1;
          sum = sum + files[i];
        }
        for (int j = i; j < s; j = j + 1)
        {
          b[j] = 0;
          return b;
        }
      }

      (a)   State the terminating condition for the  while  loop.                                  [1 mark]

      (b)   By copying and completing the table started below, trace the method
            when  files  is the array  {3, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8}  and  capacity  is 15.                  [3 marks]

                            b                      i             sum             j
                   {0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0}              0              3




      (c)   Suggest why the  for  loop is superfluous and hence can be safely removed.             [1 mark]

      (d)   Identify which values for the parameters will cause the  while   loop to never
            execute.                                                                               [1 mark]

      (e)   (i)    Suggest which values for the parameters would cause the program to
                   produce a run-time error.                                                      [2 marks]

            (ii)   Suggest how this situation could be avoided by modifying the program.          [2 marks]

15.   In a self-service fuel station, each pump has a touchscreen display equipped with a
      credit card reader and a printer for receipts.  All these peripherals are connected to
      a common computer that can communicate with the various credit card companies.  
      The pumps are set to deliver up to a maximum of 70 EUR of fuel.

      The customer inserts the payment card, enters the PIN and chooses the type of fuel.  
      The card is returned after validation and authorization from the credit card company,
      and only if these operations were successful can the fuel be dispensed.  Finally, the
      customer can choose to have a printed receipt with the actual expenditure.

      (a)   Describe the process that takes place at the station’s computer after the card’s
            PIN is entered through the touchscreen.                                            [2 marks]

      (b)   Identify one piece of information that the computer at the fuel station needs to
            communicate to the credit card company if the authorization was successful.        [1 mark]

      (c)   Construct the system flowchart for the scenario described above.                   [4 marks]

      At night, the self-service fuel station may not be a particularly safe place.

      (d)   Explain why the owner of the fuel station has decided to set a limit of 70 EUR.    [3 marks]

16.   A sequential file on a disk of a central computer stores records on some products,
      including the following information:
      •     a unique alphanumeric product code
      •     product name
      •     minimum price
      •     maximum price.

      The two price fields determine the price range in which the product can be sold.  
      They are updated once a week.

      The file is mostly used for reference.  The records are ordered on the alphanumeric
      product code.

      (a)     Outline why sequential access is suitable for the update.                            [2 marks]

      (b)     Suggest with reasons an efficient procedure for a retailer to store records of
              fixed-length on some products.                                                       [2 marks]

      An application needs to access the file for consultation, to verify that the price of a
      certain product currently on the shelf falls within the established boundaries.

      (c)     Outline the steps required in this process.                                          [2 marks]

      During the next file update, a record for a new product needs to be added.

      (d)     Evaluate the effects of this operation on the file, in the given scenario.           [2 marks]

      The retailer now wants to access the file remotely, to perform an interactive processing,
      and discovers that access times to the file are too slow.

      (e)     Explain why a direct access file would be an appropriate file organization in this
              novel scenario.                                                                      [2 marks]
