These generic markbands are specific to Paper 1 and should be used in conjunction with the
question-specific part of this markscheme. The range of possible answers and approaches listed in
this markscheme is not exhaustive. Although the questions test a common set of skills, the
application of these may demonstrate variation, and the range of appropriate specific knowledge
may not be exactly alike across candidates and schools.

Application of the markbands

Examiners judge the answers using a “best-fit” model, as described in the following paragraph.
When assessing a candidate’s work, the descriptors for each markband should be read until a
descriptor is reached that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the
one that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work chosen. Where there are several marks
available within a markband, the upper marks should be awarded if the candidate’s work
demonstrates most or all of the qualities described. The lower marks should be awarded if the
candidate’s work demonstrates few of the qualities described. A response that meets most of the
requirements of a particular markband, but not necessarily all, can still be awarded marks in that
markband.

In the assessment of extended responses in Paper 1, the following terms included in the Markband
descriptors should be considered, as appropriate to the focus of study for each topic (outlined in
focus of assessment above):

Specific features      refer to factual knowledge derived from the details of primary sources.

Features of genre      refer to genre or the conventions of genre. Candidates are expected to have
                       developed a basic critical vocabulary in these areas, though not all areas
                       may be relevant to the question.

Context                includes the historical, social, political, religious, or cultural knowledge to
                       the extent that each may be used meaningfully to relate specific features
                       (or features of genre) to the context of the society in which they were
                       produced.

Markbands for the extended responses for Paper 1.

0       If the answer does not achieve the standard described in markband 1–3, 0 should
        be recorded.

1–3     There is very little understanding of the question or relevant knowledge of the ancient
        Greek and Roman world. Appropriate skills and organizational structure are lacking. The
        answer is no more than a series of generalizations or a few facts that bear little relation to
        the question.

4–5     Little understanding is shown of the question, which is not addressed effectively.
        Although some factual details and comments are present, they are limited, often inaccurate
        and of marginal relevance. There is no clear and coherent argument and little evidence of
        specific features being analysed or related to their context. There is no reference to
        features of genre. Comparison and contrast are not used or not used effectively. There is
        also very little evidence of appropriate skills, such as selection and effective use of
        knowledge, and the structure is basic.

6–7     There is some indication that the question is understood. The question is partially
        addressed, and there is a limited degree of accurate and relevant knowledge of the ancient
        Greek and Roman world. Reference to features of genre is at best implicit. There is a
        limited demonstration of skills, focus (including relating specific features to their context)
        and structure. Skills of comparison and contrast are rudimentary.

8–10    The demands of the question are generally understood. The question may be answered
        with a relevant, coherent argument that is supported by limited material and/or contains
        limited reference to specific features and features of genre. Alternatively, the answer
        contains accurate knowledge of the ancient Greek and Roman world but is mainly
        descriptive or narrative in form, with implicit analysis or explanatory comments, or is
        made relevant by its conclusion. There has been some attempt to relate specific features to
        their context and to structure an answer. Comparison and contrast are used to some basic
        effect.

11–13   The demands of the question are effectively and relevantly understood and addressed, but
        not all the implications are considered. Specific features are related to their context with
        some explicit analysis and explanatory comments, which are supported by accurate,
        relevant and adequate knowledge based on evidence from the ancient Greek and Roman
        world.
        The approach is either thematic or analytical or a soundly focused combination of narrative
        and analysis. Use of comparison and contrast is generally effective. Where appropriate
        there is a grasp of features of genre, at least in general terms. Where appropriate there is
        evidence of evaluation and interpretation.
                                                –5–            M12/3/CLGRS/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


14–16   The demands of the question are effectively and relevantly addressed, usually in a
        structured framework. Arguments are generally well developed, and clear and coherent.
        The answer is clearly supported by the effective use of appropriate factual knowledge
        based on evidence from the ancient Greek and Roman world. It also demonstrates a
        consistent level of analytical ability and/or a critical approach to specific features under
        study. Where relevant, features of genre are explained and specific features are related to
        their context. It makes effective use of comparison and contrast. An awareness of issues
        of substantiating claims may be demonstrated where appropriate. Where appropriate there
        is evidence of informed evaluation and considered interpretation drawn from a personal
        engagement with the subject.

17–20   The question is addressed in a clearly structured and focused essay that indicates a high
        level of awareness of the demands of the question. Arguments are clear, coherent, relevant
        and well substantiated. The answer demonstrates an in-depth understanding of the ancient
        Greek and Roman world through the effective selection and use of evidence. It also
        demonstrates a high level of analytic ability and/or a sharply critical approach to specific
        features under study, or which are strongly related to their context with a good grasp of
        features of genre. It makes highly effective use of comparison and contrast. Where
        appropriate the answer may draw on or generate wider historical or cultural views from an
        international perspective.

        At the upper end of this markband the answer will further show an independent approach
        by displaying at least one of the following features: a highly developed awareness of
        contextual issues; the effective use of a wider historical or cultural perspective; a high level
        of conceptual ability; a successful challenge to the assumptions implied in the question.

                                           SECTION A

Greek and Roman Tragedy

1.   “Justice, even if slow, is certain to come.” (Solon.) Discuss the portrayal of
     justice in each of the three plays you have read in light of this statement.   [20 marks]

     Candidates should examine in all three plays the ways justice is portrayed. Candidates
     achieving the upper range of marks should discuss the portrayal of justice in all three plays in
     the light of the statement with sensitivity to similarities and differences between plays.
     The ideas which follow should be treated merely as guidance rather than as setting a limit on
     the scope or perspective of a candidate’s answer.

     Electra
     In a major way the necessity of retributive justice is integral to the plot and the play’s themes.
     The first part dramatizes the problem that long-awaited justice may be slow to arrive, putting
     added pressure on human agents of revenge. The chorus enhances the feeling of determinism
     through which Aegisthus and Clytemnestra are to meet their doom, significantly through its
     meditation on the curse of the house of Atreus. It is not clear how unequivocally just the
     retribution is (Electra’s near fanatical frame of mind, the portrayal of Aegisthus in the
     messenger speech, the broadening of the scope of argument in the agon scene) but the
     problem of how to deal with the siblings’ act of injustice in killing their mother, as well as the
     intervention of the gods, question the scope and efficacy of justice.

     Trojan Women
     Retributive justice in the form of Athena’s slight and her planned revenge on the Greeks
     establish clear cause and supernatural punishment. The punishment is certain and will be
     fairly quick to come (and understood to have come by the audience), though the Trojans’ and
     Greeks’ ignorance of it lends the play dramatic irony which complements the absence of
     Zeus’s intervention to save Troy. Injustices are claimed (the death of Astyanax, Talthybius’s
     involvement, Helen as cause of the war and Troy’s destruction) but perhaps only Cassandra’s
     prophecy concerning Agamemnon’s death (justice as slow burner) has the stronger claim in
     relation to the question.

     Phaedra
     Within the personal sphere of the psychological relation of the characters, there is no strong
     and impersonal definition of justice. There are strong reactions to perceptions of unjust
     actions with the gods being called upon to witness these. When retributive justice is invoked
     by Theseus it comes quickly and in a devastating form in what might be felt as arbitrary
     access to punitive power. There is a miscarriage of justice in the killing of Hippolytus.
     The chorus focuses on the blind, amoral force of nature and the fickleness of fortune.

     Award [0–7 marks] for unsubstantiated generalizations.

     Award [8–10 marks] for descriptions of the plot with little contextualization and analysis.

     Award [11–13 marks] for addressing the question effectively for the most part with some
     explicit analysis of the dramatised collapse of the family and explanatory comment.
                                              –7–             M12/3/CLGRS/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     Award [14–16 marks] for a balanced, well-substantiated answer with informed analysis
     drawn from a personal engagement with the plays.

     Award [17–20 marks] for sharply analytic or strongly reflective exploration, showing depth
     and/or breadth of understanding of tragedy, and well substantiated, engaged and individual
     treatment.


2.   Analyse one scene from each of the three plays you have read, showing how
     effectively the playwright has used the conventions of tragedy.           [20 marks]

     Candidates should choose three scenes – one scene from each play – and through their effect
     analyse the playwrights’ use of the conventions of tragedy. Look for a subjective response
     with relevant and accurate details of the chosen scenes described, discussed and analysed with
     a view to explaining how effectively conventions of the genre are used. Candidates may use a
     number of perspectives – e.g. plot conventions, performance, theatrical context, etc. – to
     enhance their analysis, though good knowledge of the text and of specific features is likely to
     offer the strongest evidence enabling candidates to achieve the upper range of marks.

     Award [0–7 marks] for unsubstantiated generalizations.

     Award [8–10 marks] for descriptions of scenes with little contextualization.

     Award [11–13 marks] for addressing the question effectively for the most part with some
     analysis of the scenes within the framework of tragedy.

     Award [14–16 marks] for a balanced, well-substantiated answer with informed analysis
     drawn from an effective understanding of tragedy and a personal engagement with the plays.

     Award [17–20 marks] for sharply analytic or reflective exploration, showing depth and/or
     breadth of understanding of tragedy, and well substantiated, engaged and individual treatment
     of the chosen scenes.

                                            SECTION B

War to peace in Augustan Rome and Empire

3.   Evaluate the actions of Octavian (later Augustus) between the time of the
     assassination of Julius Caesar and the battle of Actium.                  [20 marks]

     Candidates may evaluate Octavian’s actions from a strategic viewpoint in the power struggle
     following Caesar’s death in terms of challenges to overcome, though there is ample room for
     discussing effect beyond strategies for power, e.g. the moral aspects of certain decisions as
     well as repercussions on individuals and peoples of events in which Octavian was complicit.

     Some areas for discussion may include Octavian’s initial actions on deciding to take over
     Caesar’s name, his conflict with Antony, his relationship with the senate and with Cicero,
     his marching on Rome, the second triumvirate, the proscriptions and their purpose, the Battle
     of Philippi, the division of empire and Octavian’s unpopular settlement of veterans,
     the Perusine war with Antony, dealing with Sextus Pompeius, the deposing of Lepidus,
     keeping his troops limber on campaign in Illyricum, building aqueducts, etc. for Romans,
     the war of propaganda against Antony and Cleopatra, the preparation for and lead-up to war
     with Antony (e.g. spread of propaganda, building projects for Romans, organising an oath
     of loyalty).

     Award [0–7 marks] for general comments that are limited in focus or relevance.

     Award [8–10 marks] for limited evidence and evaluation of Octavian’s actions.

     Award [11–13 marks] for evidence of Octavian’s actions satisfactorily understood and their
     implications addressed with generally consistent analysis.

     Award [14–16 marks] for evidence of informed engagement with the question, with relevant
     examples, showing understanding of historical context and effective interpretation supported
     by clear argument.

     Award [17–20 marks] for an answer showing a range of cogent examples, an in-depth
     understanding of Octavian’s actions, and a strong grasp of historical context, supported by
     clear and developed argument.
                                                  –9–            M12/3/CLGRS/SP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



4.       Discuss the effectiveness of Augustus’s attempts at religious, political and
         social reform in Rome.                                                       [20 marks]

         A response of a high standard should take into account all three types of reform and evaluate
         to some extent their “effectiveness”.

         Religious
        the renovation and rebuilding of temples;
        the revival of priestly colleges;
        the building of new temples;
        the worship of Lares encouraged in new divisions of the city;
        the suppression of foreign cults, with the revival of ancient customs encouraged the idea of a
         golden age of religious piety after the neglect of religion and decline in morality which was
         seen to have led to civil wars.

         Evaluation may turn on the extent to which he co-opted religion to boost his and his family’s
         image by explicit and implicit connections. Augustus’s Forum, the temple of Apollo, the
         Secular Games and the Ara Pacis provide rich pickings for connecting religion to propaganda.

       Political
      an amnesty for those proscribed in 43;
      a revision of the senatorial role and functions/power of the senate and magistracies;
      consolidation of his own position of power through carefully controlled titular awards for
       himself (settlements, etc.);
      the reorganization of equestrian order;
      relations with plebs;
      the use of freedmen;
      administrative reform in Rome, perhaps for political ends;
      the downplaying of political power;
      the use of influence (auctoritas), etc.

         As to the effectiveness of these, central are the constitutional changes over time which
         allowed him supreme power in ostensibly republican guise, but which allowed for the
         progress of a more complex and thorough practice of government.

       Social – a broad category. Answers may include
      creating jobs for the unemployed;
      improving the quality of life (providing systems for supplying grain, water, proper sewage,
       policing, preventing fires, against flooding);
      fostering civic spirit in creating local “councils”.

         There is no evidence of any attempt at spreading the wealth downwards, but more on trying to
         stop any erosion of class distinctions. Attempts at social engineering, or at least nudging the
         elite classes to “responsible family outcomes” through moral reforms (against adultery or
         confirmed bachelorhood), were greeted with mixed success. If anything, they increased the
         elite’s vulnerability to public scandal and manipulation by the unscrupulous (Ovid’s fate?).
