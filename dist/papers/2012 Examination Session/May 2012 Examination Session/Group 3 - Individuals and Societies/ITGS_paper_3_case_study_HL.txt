Foreword

The ITGS case study, Theatre Booking System, is the stimulus material for the research investigation
required for May and November 2012 higher level paper 3.  All of the work related to the case study should
reflect the integrated approach explained on pages 15–17 of the ITGS guide.

Candidates should consider Theatre Booking System with respect to:
• relevant IT systems in a social context
• both local and global areas of impact
• social and ethical impacts on individuals and societies
• current challenges and solutions
• future developments.

Candidates are expected to use online booking systems to investigate the capabilities of various booking
(and other) systems that are available in more than one language, to research real-life situations similar
to Theatre Booking System and relate their findings to first-hand experiences wherever possible.  
Information may be collected through a range of activities: secondary and primary research, field trips,
guest speakers, personal interviews and e-mail correspondence.

Responses to examination questions must reflect the synthesis of knowledge and experiences that the
candidates have gained from their investigations.  In some instances, additional information may be provided
in examination questions to allow candidates to generate new ideas.


Introduction

The Piedmonte canton of Switzerland lies in an area where four official languages (French, German, Romansh
and Italian) are spoken.  Within the canton there is a capital city and a number of smaller towns.  There are also
a number of theatres which provide high quality performances, both professional and amateur.  Two theatres
have realized that there will be benefits of working together to provide an efficient ticket booking system and
have begun to investigate how this may be done, creating the Piedmonte Theatre Consortium (PTC).

Interviews were carried out with managers at the two theatres to elicit the problems with the current
IT systems.

                                 Cœur Théâtral – Small company

     Overview

     The Cœur Théâtral (CT) is a small theatre company situated on the outskirts of the capital city.
     It has a full time manager and an administrative assistant, but most of the work is carried out
     by a group of amateur theatre enthusiasts who act as producers, directors, actors, set designers,
     and administrators.  It is dedicated to quality productions and only presents five plays per year,
 5   from late February to early December.  Each play runs for twelve performances over three weeks.  
     When purchasing tickets for a performance, customers are encouraged to become a member of the
     “Friends of Cœur Théâtral”.


     Current IT system

     • The details of all members are kept on a flat file database.  Mail merge letters are sometimes
       sent from the database which contain special deals, details of special events and other such
10     information.  The same database is also used to print mailing labels for those members who
       have the “Retroscena” newsletter posted to them, and for the tickets and membership cards
       when they need to be posted.  Members receive preference over other customers and they can
       book early before booking is open to the public.
     • The details of all telephone bookings are recorded in a spreadsheet – there is one page for each
15     performance.  Each page of the spreadsheet contains a seating plan for a performance with the
       name of the person and telephone number recorded in each seating location.
     • Only payment by credit card is available for telephone bookings.  After processing, a receipt is
       produced and sent with the tickets when posted or collected from the box office.  All bookings
       are recorded for legal and financial purposes.
20   • Cash sales at the door do not get a receipt and are recorded in a special folder.  Facilities for
       credit and debit card sales are not available at the theatre.
     • Details of all ticket purchases are sent to the accountant in order to check that the amount
       deposited in the bank matches the tickets purchased.  Credit card purchases are automatically
       recorded in the bank account and cash sales are deposited separately.  At the end of the year
25     an analysis report for the ticket sales is produced – most of the analysis is done manually.  
       The report contains the number of seats sold for each performance divided into categories,
       e.g. member sales, door sales, concession sales, etc.  The report also contains an analysis based
       on the various days of the three weeks for each performance.  Various percentage occupancy
       rates are also calculated, however it is very time consuming.   Detailed financial analysis of
30     types of tickets, as well as member and cash sales are not available.

     The following problems were highlighted
     The problems with the current system are:
     • Most of the ticket and membership information is manually processed.
     • The lack of integration of the various ways of recording and processing the data which is
35     currently performed using a mixture of spreadsheet, database, desktop publishing and word
       processing software.
     • Double-booking issues.
     • Payment problems with the processing of credit cards and cash, providing receipts.
     • The lack of detailed analysis of the ticket sales and income.

                                                                                            Turn over

                            Mälzerei Theatergruppe – Large company
     Overview
40   The Mälzerei Theatergruppe (MTG) runs a multi-theatre venue in the centre of the capital city,
     with an all year programme.  There are three theatres within the complex, which are used for their
     own productions and by other professional theatre companies.  They have their own customized
     IT ticketing system accessible through their own web site.


     Current IT system
     The IT system they have at the moment is old and was developed in-house.   There are two
45   sub-systems; an office network connected to the Internet and a stand-alone local network box
     office system.  The office network has its own server and connection to the Internet, but is based
     on old technology and is starting to develop problems.  This system is used for customer relations,
     finance and analysis, production management, business communications and development of
     advertising and web site material.

50   The box office network has a separate server that is based on Microsoft Small Business Server 2003
     and a Microsoft SQL database.   The separate server is used to keep credit card information and
     customer details secure.   Both servers back-up to the same place but there is no transfer of data
     between the two systems.  Since there is no electronic connection to the office network, all sales and
     customer data is transferred to the office network using a USB memory stick.

55   The M-ticket web site which was developed for the MTG a few years ago is run on the web site of an
     Internet service provider (ISP); but the MTG is not happy with the user-interface and the features of
     the web site.  Customers are complaining, since they often go to the web site for information about
     productions, but find it easier to telephone the box office to make bookings as they can make special
     requests for seats, get more personal attention and discuss various options.  The reporting facility of
60   the web site is adequate but new needs for customer relations, requiring more complex data analysis,
     are arising.

     The following problems were highlighted
     The problems with the current system are:
     • The MTG does not have an in-house IT department and the two staff members who have been
65     responsible for most of the IT maintenance and development are planning to leave soon.
     • The office and box office hardware and software need upgrading and integrating where possible.
     • The web site has been in operation for many years but is basically still the same as when it was
       first developed, providing information but lacking interactivity and multimedia features, especially
       an interactive seat-selection interface.
70   • The quality of the reports produced needs improving.  They take a long time to produce, are poorly
       presented (often as numbers without any visual representation of the data through the use of
       graphs), and often do not contain detailed analysis that would be useful for making decisions and
       assessing past performances.  The accuracy of the analysis and financial reports has sometimes
       been challenged and requires a significant amount of time and effort to fix.
75   • Keeping in contact with customers via e-mail has been a major strength and has developed a strong
       community support for the MTG.  Now the management wants to make use of new technologies
       such as smartphones, Twitter, and social web sites to build even stronger relationships and have
       multiple means of contacting people and advertising.

      Solution Requirements

      Project management issues
 80   After a series of discussions, the PTC has accepted that they will need to purchase an IT system
      from a supplier to resolve many of the problems that currently exist.

      They have set the following objectives of the development strategy:
      • The web site ticketing system should be a single unified ticketing system for purchasing tickets
        and seat-selection for the PTC.
 85   • Tickets can be collected from the box office with suitable identification, or printed by the
        customer after they are sent as a PDF document in a confirmation e-mail.
      • Users must be able to easily input data, obtain information and carry out analyses as required.  
      • The web site must be intuitive and function in five languages (the four official languages plus
        English), and be able to include non-Latin alphabet languages later, such as Russian and Arabic.
 90   • The IT system must be handed over on 1 March 2014.

      As a result of the developments, the PTC hopes to encourage other theatre companies in the canton
      to join the scheme, creating a comprehensive theatre web site that would hopefully facilitate more
      ticket sales to tourists and the local population.

      However, the theatres have a limited budget and are aware that the solution may require compromises
 95   to be made.  They need to decide what will be the key features and also plan for future expansion.

      The solution will need to include as many of the following features as possible.

      Data management issues
      Data migration
      Data will need to be migrated from the existing systems and integrated into the new data structures
100   in the most time and cost effective manner.

      An efficient data management system – performances and customer relations
      Each theatre company needs to be able to manage its part of the consortium web site; specifically
      inputting details of performances and setting prices at least a year in advance for all performances
      through a content management system (CMS), possibly web-based.

105   Also, details of customers who purchase tickets need to be accessed and used to send them specific
      information on special deals and newsletters, using a customer relationship management (CRM)
      system.

      Analysis of sales and other data
      For the purpose of sales analysis, standard and customized reports need to be easily generated
110   and exported in a variety of formats, for example, sales figures for each play which can be
      analysed by day, ticket category or performance type.  A basic business intelligence package to
      analyse sales, and to mine the customer and member data, would be desirable.

      Web site development and management issues
      Ticketing
115   The web site needs to provide interactive seat-selection from a theatre plan so that it avoids
      double-bookings, and also needs to provide a secure online payment facility.   (The online
      payment system does not need to be researched in-depth.)  The payment recording system must
      be able to handle online bookings, telephone bookings and those made from the booking offices
      in each theatre.

120   Language provision
      In Switzerland there are four official languages.   It is important that, for any system that is
      developed, the user will be able to select their preferred language.  English will also be included.  
      Information provided by the Swiss government has indicated that there will be a significant
      increase in tourism from countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, so the web site may need to
125   be developed in Russian and Arabic in the future.

      Web site interface
      The interface must be user-friendly and intuitive.   It needs to be able to easily switch from
      one language to another, and also be compatible with all browsers, preferably without needing
      additional software such as plug-ins.  This might be problematic, especially for some smartphones
130   and tablet devices, as the inclusion of an interactive seat-selection feature may require the use of
      client-side software such as browser plug-ins, Java or Adobe Flash Player.

      The web site design also needs to give consideration to customers who may not be familiar with
      using online booking systems, who may not have a credit card, or may want to have the tickets
      physically sent to them rather than printing them themselves or picking them up at the venue.


      Challenges faced
135   The development of a new system must take into account the following issues which may make
      the proposed solution too expensive or impractical.

      Project management issues
      The PTC needs to create a development strategy in order to bring all of the PTC theatres into
      the new IT system.  The solution needs to be delivered on time, within budget and meeting the
140   requirement specification as far as possible.  Various methodologies will need to be considered in
      implementing the strategy, such as focusing on one theatre first and bringing the other online later;
      compared with bringing both theatres online together.  A decision about implementing the system
      has yet to be reached, and may depend on other considerations.

      Suppliers
145   The theatre companies will need to investigate various suppliers of ticketing systems which
      could provide an existing system that can be customized, as well as companies that will build a
      completely new system.

      Due to maintenance and training issues, it is necessary to take all reasonable steps to ensure that
      the system purchased meets the needs of all the theatres as closely as possible, and within the
150   agreed budget.  The PTC sees the correct choice of supplier as a key factor in the success of the
      development strategy.

                                                                                                Turn over
                                                 –8–           M&N12/3/ITGSX/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/CS

      Data management issues
      The new system could be based on one of the two options listed below:
      • a distributed database system
155   • a centralized database system, in association with a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

      Both choices need to meet the rigorous requirements of modern database systems, such as
      conforming to ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) rules, and they need to manage
      concurrency of access and processing through record locking, to prevent multiple bookings and
      other problems.

160   Data migration
      Both theatre companies have substantial amounts of data saved in various formats in their existing
      systems that should be copied across to the new system, such as customer and member details
      and records of previous performances for comparisons.  This is potentially a major challenge for
      the PTC.

165   Analysis of sales and other data
      The new database system needs to have the capability to produce detailed reports, in text and
      graphical format, with statistical analysis.  This may require the purchase of a business intelligence
      add-on package for the database system.

      Web site development and management issues
170   Language provision
      The PTC is concerned about the additional costs and expertise required to develop and maintain
      the web site in five languages.   They are aware that certain technical features, such as videos
      and animations, may be difficult to produce and maintain in multiple languages and that there
      could potentially be significant variations in quality between the different language versions.

175   Web site interface
      The new web site must function in a range of browsers without the need to install client-side
      software; it must also accept and transmit the data inputted by the users and function correctly,
      whatever security settings the user has selected.
