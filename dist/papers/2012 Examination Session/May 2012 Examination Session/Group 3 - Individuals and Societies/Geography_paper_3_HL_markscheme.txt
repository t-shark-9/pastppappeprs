1.   (a)   Explain the causes and effects of one major international labour flow.              [10 marks]

           The causes should encompass both push and pull factors and possibly also the
           enabling role of technology and transport networks (both providing means to
           move as well as spreading knowledge of opportunities) – without which the
           migratory impulse may not be acted upon. Popular examples could include
           Mexico-US or movements internal to the EU, South Asians working in the Middle
           East, Filipinos into Asia. Assess any example on its own merits but poorly chosen
           small-scale migration flows should be restricted to band C.

           The effects depend upon the case study chosen. These might include:
           economic/social impacts for host/source; the political reaction of natives/the
           media in the host country. More broadly, processes of cultural exchange and the
           growth of diaspora may be explored, possibly within the wider global context of
           migration contributing to growth of a “global village”/shrinking world. But do
           not expect all of these themes by any means to be necessary for full marks to be
           awarded: just two causes and two different types of effect could be sufficient to
           access the highest bands if the case study details are good.

           To access Band E, both causes and effects should be addressed in a reasonably
           balanced way.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   “The growth of globalization owes more to politics than it does to
      technology.” Discuss this statement.                               [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Politics:
      Important themes could include the influence of governments on capital transfers
      by financial institutions [Guide 3] and TNCs (liberal attitudes could be contrasted
      with countries where greater restrictions exist e.g. the controversial role of Chavez
      in Venezuela; or the isolationism of North Korea). Another theme could be IMF
      insistence on political reforms [Guide 3]. Weak environment and labour
      laws/enforcement of these laws may be attractive: this is likely to be a popular
      theme, possible examples being China (though now changing) or Malaysia.
      The movement towards nation-state integration in the EU – and to a lesser extent
      in other trading blocs [Guide 6] – allows rapid growth on a regionalized level due
      to suspension of tariffs and quotas on imports/exports between trading partners.
      Political reactions to globalization [Guide 7] vary enormously and cultural
      traditions of liberalism or socialism could become enshrined in immigration laws
      or other policies.

      Technology:
      The growth of transport and ICT networks have fuelled the growth of a range of
      flows – including FDI, migration [Guide 5], outsourcing by TNCs, call centres
      growth, social/cultural “shrinking world”; economic exchanges brought by the
      internet or BlackBerry, etc. [Guide 2]. Containerized shipping and no-frills air
      flights can be linked to exponential growth of various flows such as manufactured
      goods and international tourism [Guide 5]. The “Arab Spring” can be viewed as a
      youth-led phenomenon that was, in part, facilitated by technology and media.

      The very best answers may attempt to link the two factors and add complexity to
      their comparison. For instance, it could be possible to show how technology has
      actually been driven by politics (e.g. the Cold War roots of the internet); or to
      address how technology allows global political participation (e.g. use of Facebook
      to orchestrate protests at G20 summits etc.).

      To access band E, the response should be well balanced and a conclusion should
      be reached that is more complex than “they are both important” (perhaps through
      an evidenced account that supports one factor rather than the other; or perhaps by
      stressing that the two factors are actually interrelated).

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

2.   (a)   Analyse the relationship between globalization and the resurgence of
           nationalism in one country you have studied.                         [10 marks]

           The resurgence of nationalist tendencies within states can link with international
           migration (notably the EU, also southern states of USA), a politicized loss of jobs
           to outsourcing (e.g. USA to China) and broader concerns with cultural dilution
           (e.g. the Facebook ban in Pakistan; state internet censorship to some degree can be
           found in 40 countries).

           For bands D and E, the focus should clearly be on global rather than local
           interactions that do not reflect the dynamics of the world economy and/or its
           media (thus the labour migration of workers from Mexico to a global hub such as
           the USA is highly relevant; refugees seeking refuge from drought in a
           neighbouring country is not).

           Nationalism itself assumes many forms – from overt racism/xenophobia to less
           sensational controls e.g. migration caps. Alternative interpretations of nationalism
           could include state-sanctioned hostile reaction to TNCs (e.g. Chavez seizing
           assets of TNCs, or another “resource nationalism” case study) or clampdowns on
           media access sanctioned on national security grounds.

           An account that lacks details of the manifestation of the growth of nationalism can
           still access the higher bands if the multiple “threats” brought by global
           interactions are well-analysed.

           Discussion of only one country is required. In-depth analysis of a single reaction
           could reach full marks if the answer is developed, shows relevant understanding
           and uses terminology well.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                              –6–              M12/3/GEOGR/HP3/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   “Global interactions have made the world a richer place but not a fairer
      place.” Discuss this statement.                                          [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Richer:
      Global participation has increased over time and core areas [Guide 3] have clearly
      expanded since the days of the Brandt Report. Developing peripheries [Guide 3]
      are places where a large emerging middle class can be found apparent
      e.g. NICs/BRICs. This economic fact does not need to be contested/debated.
      However, it could be by suggesting the 2008 credit crunch caused the expansion
      of world wealth to temporarily halt/reverse. It is also possible to critique other
      notions of “wealth”, such as cultural [Guide 5] or ecological wealth [Guide 4],
      though, again, this is not a requirement.

      Fairer:
      This point does need to be debated, as it is controversial. Hundreds of millions
      have been lifted out of poverty in China although India is still a very divided
      society. It can be argued that global financial flows [Guide 3] have redistributed
      money on a regional level as world GDP has risen, with Asia, Brazil and some
      African (“African lion”) states clearly prospering at the aggregate level of GDP.
      But the benefits are still very uneven. Numbers in poverty in Saharan Africa have
      doubled over 30 years. Some financial flows (TNC profits, mining revenues etc.)
      are re-directed at core regions [Guide 3]. Good answers may debate the
      difficulties in finding a universally accessible definition of “fair” (or “wealth” for
      that matter).

      There are also “unfair” losses for the environment [Guide 4] in many places
      (an account of transboundary pollution could be employed here) and for local
      cultures as languages are lost, etc. [Guide 5]. There are many possible
      approaches and these should be assessed on their merits.

      To access band D, the answers should be well balanced. For band E, there should
      be an evidenced conclusion that has critically interrogated the idea of “fairness”
      with respect to the changing distribution of the growing total amount of
      global wealth.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

3.   (a)   Explain how        agro-industrialization     contributes    to    environmental
           degradation.                                                                          [10 marks]

           The term agro-industrialization describes commercial, large-scale agricultural
           operations (typically conducted by/on behalf of TNCs such as Cargill, Monsanto,
           Nestle, McDonald’s, etc.).

           Degradation may be mapped at local or global scales, and themes may include:
           carbon emissions/food miles, biodiversity losses, water extraction/water
           scarcity/water footprint issues, soil erosion/nutrient depletion, eutrophication,
           sedimentation, forest/mangrove losses, “virtual water” losses. There are many
           other possible themes.

           To access band C, a range of ideas should be explained (expect at least two in
           some depth, or the briefer outlining of a wider range). For band E, expect some
           named locations to be mentioned, or different types/sectors of
           agro-industry to be identified, or good links to be established with the actions of
           named agro-industrial TNCs.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

(b)   “Cultural diffusion is a process that takes place in many ways but can be
      halted by many barriers.” Discuss this statement.                         [15 marks]

      Credit all content in line with the markbands. Credit unexpected approaches
      wherever relevant.

      Pathways for cultural diffusion include the movements of workers and tourists
      who carry cultural traits with them [Guide 5]. A wide variety of traits could be
      explored, such as language, religion, arts and music, cuisine, fashion, etc.
      The movement of commodities and the diffusion of the internet and films,
      orchestrated by technology, TNCs and global media corporations respectively, are
      other key ways in which “messages” are transmitted [Guide 2]. Military and
      imperial ventures could also be discussed. A “Trojan horse” strategy of
      contemporary glocalization [Guide 7] could be explored – wherein western
      cultural icons (e.g. denim, burgers, etc.) gain access to foreign markets by donning
      “cultural camouflage”). MGO membership – notably the EU – also aids cultural
      transfers by easing restrictions on a variety of flows and pathways for cultural
      diffusion (such as greater freedom of movement for people or goods) [Guide 6].

      The barriers may be physical, political, economic or cultural and they can include
      nationalism and anti-globalization movements and sentiments [Guide 6 and 7].
      A range of local responses could be explored that challenge cultural imperialism
      [Guide 5] or at least negotiate glocalized outcomes in ways that restrict the pace
      of cultural change (censorship of Google in China is one example).

      To access bands D and E, the answer should be well balanced between coverage
      of the processes themselves and of possible barriers to their operation. The best
      answers may look beyond a “black and white” world (where processes of
      exchange either do or do not operate) and might critically explore ways in which
      global cultural exchanges are negotiated locally, resulting in partial or selective
      transfers of culture that bring into being new hybridized cultural forms (language,
      art, music or cuisine often show a “fusion” of different influences).
