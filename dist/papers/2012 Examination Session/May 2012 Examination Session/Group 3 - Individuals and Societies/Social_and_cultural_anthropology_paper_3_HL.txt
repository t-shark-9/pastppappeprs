Answer one question. The answer must refer to both theoretical perspectives and theory/schools of
thought in anthropology and their application to specific and clearly identified ethnographic illustrations.
Each question is worth [20 marks].

1.    Compare how two anthropologists approach structure in their ethnography.


2.    Examine how one of the following schools of thought has shaped ethnography:

      • functionalism
      • world systems
      • postmodernism.


3.    Discuss why one ethnographer adopts a conflict-centred perspective.


4.    Compare and contrast two anthropologists in terms of one of the following:

      • agency-centred perspective
      • diachronic perspective
      • materialist perspective.


5.    Evaluate how one theory and one theoretical perspective inform the work of one ethnographer.
