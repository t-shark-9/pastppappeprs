1.   (a)   What, according to Source C, were the problems affecting the
           League of Nations?                                                             [3 marks]

            The absence of the US deprived the League from moral and material influence;
            The failure to achieve universal membership as countries such as Germany and the
             Soviet Union were excluded;
            The failure to agree on political questions such as disarmament and security;
            The withdrawal of Germany, Japan and Italy and the expulsion of the Soviet Union.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [3 marks].

     (b)   What is the message conveyed by Source B?                                      [2 marks]

            The League of Nations as a project has flaws. This could be supported by making
             reference to President Wilson’s words about the donkey being “better than nothing”
             or to it looking weak;
            There seems to be limited enthusiasm for the League. President Wilson is trying to
             persuade an unenthusiastic US, represented by Uncle Sam, to support the idea;
            The US Senate is also mistrustful of the League of Nations. This is shown by the
             fact that the person representing it wants to give the animal a very detailed
             inspection.

     Award [1 mark] for each relevant point up to a maximum of [2 marks].
                                            –4–            M12/3/HISTX/BP1/ENG/TZ0/S1/M


2.   Compare and contrast the views expressed in Sources C and E about the
     effects of the absence of major powers in the League of Nations.                [6 marks]

     For “compare”
      Both sources recognize that the League of Nations failed because of the absence of major
       powers such as Germany;
      Both sources acknowledge that the absence of the US has been a widely used argument to
       explain the weaknesses of the League;
      Both sources recognize the importance of cooperation (allow reference to “collective
       security”) of League members.

     For “contrast”
      Source C stresses the importance of the absence of key powers. Source E plays down the
       absence of key powers such as the US;
      Source C gives a more detailed account of other contributing factors such as disarmament
       and security that led to the withdrawal of nations from the League. Source E offers more
       limited discussion of other factors;
      Source E mentions French anxieties at Versailles; Source C does not make explicit
       reference to French policies;
      Source C refers to the withdrawal of members such as Japan, Germany and Italy whereas
       Source E blames its failure on the lack of an extensive test period.

     End-on description of both sources would be worth up to [3 marks] if the comparative
     element is only implicit, and [4 marks] with excellent explicit linkage. If both sources
     are used with a good running linkage of both comparison and contrast award a maximum
     of [4–5 marks]. For the maximum of [6 marks] expect a detailed, comprehensive, running,
     comparison and contrast. If there is only either comparison or contrast award a maximum of
     [4 marks].

3.   With reference to their origin and purpose, assess the value and limitations
     of Source A and Source D for historians studying the problems of initial
     membership of the League of Nations.                                               [6 marks]

     Source A
     Origin:        A speech by US President Woodrow Wilson to a US audience in 1919.

     Purpose:       To persuade his audience of the significance of the League of Nations for the
                    world and of the importance that the US should become part of the
                    organization. To gain support for US membership. To justify the exclusion of
                    Germany.

     Value:         A speech by the US President made at the time the Treaty of Versailles and the
                    Covenant of the League of Nations were under consideration of the US Senate.
                    The speech represents the view of the author of the Fourteen Points which
                    proposed the creation of the League of Nations. It offers Wilson’s view of the
                    German situation after the First World War as well as insight into the
                    arguments he used to try to gain support for US membership.

     Limitations:   Wilson was trying to encourage support for his policies, which means he may
                    have been concealing some factors and exaggerating the benefits of the League.
                    The tone indicates partiality towards the issues.

     Source D
     Origin:        A speech given by a German journalist in London in 1931 at the Royal Institute
                    of International Affairs.

     Purpose:       To explain how Germany felt about the refusal to allow her membership of the
                    League of Nations in 1919 and the impact of such a decision on both Germany
                    and the League. To convince the audience that the exclusion of Germany was
                    a mistake.

     Value:         The source offers a German perspective on the issue of initial membership.
                    The speaker is a journalist who may have had access to a wide variety of
                    sources of information at the time.

     Limitations:   This is not a German government official speaking and therefore may not
                    represent the government’s position. The tone of the speech is emotional as
                    it is given to an audience in the UK, a country that had not openly supported
                    Germany’s inclusion in the League in 1919. His views may be reflecting those
                    in Germany at the time.

     Do not expect all of the above. Ideally there will be a balance between the two sources,
     and each one can be marked out of [3 marks], but allow a [4/2 marks] split. If only one
     source is assessed, mark out of [4 marks]. For a maximum of [6 marks] candidates must refer
     to both origin and purpose, and value and limitations.

4.   Using the sources and your own knowledge, analyse the impact of the
     absence of major powers on the League of Nations.                                   [8 marks]

     Source material:
     Source A:    The absence of the US would be a regrettable mistake. Wilson addresses the
                  importance of the League of Nations as a world organization to draw nations
                  together. He encourages US membership as founders and explains Germany
                  would be incorporated in the near future.

     Source B:     Wilson is trying to persuade Uncle Sam that the League of Nations is the best
                   alternative at the time. He seems worried that the US may not be a member
                   and considers it better to be a member of a weak organization than not to be
                   part of it at all.

     Source C:     This source acknowledges that the failure to achieve near universal
                   membership has been the main explanation for the failure of the League
                   of Nations. It explains that US absence deprived the organization of moral
                   and material influence. It also mentions how the absence of both Germany
                   and the Soviet Union undermined the operation of the League. It mentions
                   the withdrawal of Germany, Japan and Italy after acts of aggressions.

     Source D:     The author considers that the absence of Germany at the time of the
                   foundation of the League killed, affected and restricted her to the role of an
                   instrument to maintain the peace treaties and keep Germany down.

     Source E:     The author claims that even with the membership of major powers, the League
                   would have been too feeble to provide security or help consolidate Europe.
                   The gaining of legitimacy of the League needed to be achieved by showing that
                   the major powers were ready to enforce the Covenant.

     Own knowledge
     Own knowledge could include: The League being viewed as too European or as an
     organization of victorious nations; additional material on the effects of the absence
     of Germany, the US and the USSR at the time of the foundation of the League of Nations
     such as reference to the moral, economic and military limitations inflicted by the absence of
     the US; the impact of the absence of major powers on the effectiveness of collective security
     and the implementation of economic sanctions; The creation of mutual defense agreements
     such as the Little Entente between Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania to protect the
     territorial integrity and independence of its members; France started to look for potential
     allies; German and Soviet hostility towards the League and how their diplomatic isolation led
     to the signing of the Treaty of Rapallo which affected international efforts towards security
     and disarmament; the burden on France and Great Britain as members with limited capacity to
     enforce the Covenant; the effects of the eventual withdrawal of Germany, Italy and Japan on
     the legitimacy and credibility of the League.

     Do not expect all the above and accept other relevant material. If only source material or own
     knowledge is used the maximum mark that can be obtained is [5 marks]. For maximum
     [8 marks] expect argument, synthesis of source material and own knowledge, as well as
     references to the sources used.
