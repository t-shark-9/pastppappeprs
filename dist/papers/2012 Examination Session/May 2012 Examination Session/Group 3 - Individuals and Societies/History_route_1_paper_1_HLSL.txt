The sources and questions relate to the battle of Siffin and negotiations between Ali ibn Abi Talib and
Mu‘awiya ibn Abi Sufyan.

SOURCE A                 History of the Khalifas by al-Suyuti, London, 2006.

Mu‘awiya ibn Abi Sufyan and those with him in Syria came out against Ali, and met at Siffin in the year
37 AH [657 CE]. The fighting continued there for some days. People hated the war and they called each
other to negotiate and appoint two arbiters. They signed a decree between them and agreed to meet at
the beginning of the year to discuss seriously the command of the Umma. Then a group known as the
“Kharijites” [literally: “those who go out”] from among Ali’s companions and those who were with him
went out against him. They said, “There is no judgment but that of Allah!” and they set up a military camp
at Harura.


SOURCE B                 “The Siffin Arbitration Agreement” by Martin Hinds, Journal of Semitic Studies,
                         1972.

As the battle of Siffin progressed, the Syrians became fearful that they were losing, and it was at this
point that Mu‘awiya exploited the divisions which existed within the ranks of Ali’s coalition … Mu‘awiya
then caused a number of maṣāḥif [copies of the Qur’an] to be raised up on the points of lances …
They addressed the Iraqis who made up most, but not all, of Ali’s following, and in doing so, the Syrians
were clearly attempting to isolate Ali from his Iraqi supporters.


SOURCE C                 Extract from History of the Khalifas by al-Suyuti, Taha Publishers, London, 2006.

Ali said: “Mu‘awiya [and his supporters] are men without religion ... they have raised up the maṣāḥif
[copies of the Qur’an] only to deceive you!” They answered him, “If we are called to the Book of God,
we are bound to respond”. Ali said to them, “The only reason I have fought against them was so that they
should keep to the authority of the Book, for they have disobeyed God in what He has commanded and they
have forgotten His command and rejected His book”.

SOURCE D                  The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates: The Islamic Near East from the 6th to
                          the 11th Century by Hugh Kennedy, Longman, Harlow, UK, 1986.

The Syrian supporters of Mu‘awiya were simply fighting for the sort of political and financial autonomy
that the Iraqi allies of Ali had struggled for during the reign of Uthman, and they too might have wanted
a compromise which left the caliph with very restricted powers of interference. Thus, Ali was obliged
to agree to arbitration, not about who should be caliph, but rather over the issues which divided him
and Mu‘awiya.

Prescribed subject 2		         The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

These sources and questions relate to the events known as “The Sicilian Vespers” during the rule of
Charles I of Anjou, King of Sicily, in 1282.

SOURCE A                 Charles of Anjou by Jean Dunbabin, Longman, London, 1998.

For the Aragonese, Charles was a nuisance but not a danger. For Emperor Michael of Constantinople,
he was both. Legend has given John of Procida [a servant of Peter of Aragon] the role of plotter.
Famous though the conspiracy became, it played only a secondary role in the drama which began with
a spontaneous rebellion in Sicily in March 1282. It is true that Peter of Aragon’s arrival in the island
at the end of August transformed a local uprising into a war between kings which lasted until 1302.
Without the Aragonese, the Vespers would certainly have been much less significant, or might even have
been totally crushed. On the other hand, the Aragonese invasion might never have occurred without the
desperate pleas for help of the rebels. … The Sicilian Vespers has been called the first uprising against
modern state taxation. There can be little doubt that the demand in December 1281 of a general tax of
at least 150 per cent of the normal rate was the spark that ignited the conflagration. … Charles’ greatest
mistake had been to ignore Sicily. Before the Vespers he had visited it in 1270–1271, yet he never
came again.


SOURCE B                 The Sicilian Vespers by Steven Runciman, Cambridge University Press, UK, 1957

Soon after his accession [as King of Aragon] Peter nominated John of Procida as Chancellor of Aragon.
The post gave John full control of the king’s foreign policy; and he used it, with Peter’s full approval,
to plan the downfall of the Angevins. The plotters began work in 1279. According to the Sicilian legend
it was in that year that John of Procida went secretly to Constantinople. Emperor Michael received him
in private audience and was delighted with him. He remained for three months at the Imperial Court;
and when he left he was provided with letters from the Emperor to the King of Aragon and the people
of Sicily, and a generous sum of money … The main objective of [Peter of Aragon’s] conspiracy was to
stir up trouble within King Charles’ lands. Charles himself was an able and conscientious ruler. He spent
most of his time in or near Naples or in Apulia. There he could supervise the administration and see that
his officials were not oppressive. The island of Sicily was in a different position … he did practically
nothing to help the economy … he never visited the island [after] the Tunisian Crusade [of 1271].

                       France, 1835.

Peter, King of Aragon, equipped a fleet against Charles I of Anjou, and persuaded the Pope that it was
destined for Africa. After the massacre of the French in Sicily, and while Charles laid siege to Messina,
Peter invaded with an army, subordinated the kingdom, crowned himself king and forced Charles to retreat
into Calabria. Peter was anathemised [condemned] by the Pope, who released his subjects from their
oath of loyalty, and gave the kingdom of Aragon to Charles I of Anjou. A proposal was made by Charles
to resolve their quarrel through combat between one hundred on each side on the plains of Bordeaux,
but he did not turn up at this location. Charles severely punished the Neapolitans who revolted against
him after the defeat of his son by the Sicilians. Learning that Philip of France was attacking his kingdom,
Peter returned to defend it, bringing with him his prisoner, Charles of Salerno, who had become
King of Sicily by the death of Charles I of Anjou, his father.


SOURCE D               History of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, by Michele Amari, Italy, 1846

The Aragonese conspiracy with some Sicilian barons, which is not confirmed, I repeat, by any valid
historical source, appears to me to be probable but not certain. But to say that this succeeded in producing
the outbreak of the Vespers at the specified hour and day is false. The contemporary records state this:
that Peter aspired to the crown of Sicily, that he armed himself, that he arranged for money from the
Emperor of Constantinople, that he may have conspired with some Sicilian barons, but their preparations
were incomplete when the people of Sicily rose up. … In every Sicilian heart was engraved the image
of Charles, cruel and rapacious [greedy], and the deadly enemy of Sicily. The Sicilians endured the yoke
until 1282. … A young woman of singular beauty and modesty was approached by Drouet, a Frenchman,
to examine her for concealed weapons, and who seized her and searched her bosom. She fainted into her
husband’s arms. He, in a voice almost choked with rage, cried “Death to the French!” and the cry, say the
historians of the time, re-echoed like the voice of God throughout the whole country, and found an answer
in every heart.
