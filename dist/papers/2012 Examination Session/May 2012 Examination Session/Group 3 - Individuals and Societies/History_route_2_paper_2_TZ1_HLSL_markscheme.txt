 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of historical
        processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        An attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical
        processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been
        made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as evidence
        to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and contrast,
        placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately and
        effectively.

Topic 1   Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   With reference to two examples, each chosen from a different region, assess the factors which
     helped and hindered successful guerrilla warfare.

     Popular examples are likely to be guerrilla warfare in China (1927–1949 approximately), Vietnam
     (from the time of the First Indo-China War up till 1975), Cuba and the campaign in the Sierra
     Maestra (from approximately 1956/7–1959). Other appropriate examples could refer to the
     Malayan Emergency, the Hukbalahap movement in the Philippines, the Greek Civil War – all of
     which provide lessons on the barriers to success in achieving victory. Accept other examples as
     appropriate (Afghanistan, Partisan resistance during the Second World War etc.) but ensure that the
     regional requirement is observed for this question – and note that regions are defined in this case by
     the IB regional division of the world. Hence, candidates who choose say China and Vietnam are
     not fulfilling the demands of the regional requirement. Examiners need to scrutinise the map on the
     front of the Paper 2 exam to ensure consistency in terms of this regional requirement.

     Depending on the examples selected, factors which may be considered as helping could include: –
     the existence of an unpopular and/or repressive regime which produces grievances (social,
     economic, political) which provide the basis for discontent, existence of outside support in terms of
     moral and economic backing, the existence of suitable terrain or geographic conditions which
     allows the guerrilla force relative safety from successful attack by regular or conventional forces,
     popular support gained by fighting the guerrilla war not just as a military war but also a political
     war. The provision, by guerrillas, of a political platform allows support to be gained from the
     populace in terms of food, intelligence/information, recruits etc.

     Factors which may hinder successful warfare could include: failure of the guerrillas to win over
     popular support by resorting to intimidation of the local population (Greece for example),
     the attempts made by regimes to improve economic and political conditions – thus removing a main
     plank of guerrilla support, the provision of external aid (military and economic) to introduce
     schemes to physically combat the guerrillas or to improve conditions thus removing the base for
     grievances (Philippines for example), the introduction of schemes to physically separate the
     guerrilla from the population (Malaya, Vietnam) etc.

     If only one example is chosen, or only one region, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

2.   Analyse the economic and social effects of two wars in the second half of the twentieth
     century.

     Wars selected must be 1950 and onwards – no regional requirement.

     For economic effects candidates could address the ways in which the participant(s)
     organised/reorganised the economic system of the state to meet the demands of the war effort –
     this could include economic mobilisation of the nation/participants in terms of weapons production,
     food production, rationing of materials etc. “Effects” could also be dealt with in relation to the
     damage done to the infrastructure of the protagonists – human losses as well as physical damage.
     In some cases war may have contributed to a boom in economic development due to the demands of
     the war effort – in other cases the opposite may be true as pressures of war may lead to the
     destruction of the economy of the chosen example.

     Social effects could be dealt with in relation to the impact of war on the societies involved:
     the demographic changes occurring; displacement of population as witnessed in the growth of
     refugee populations; the curtailing of civil liberties (partly political, but also affecting society in the
     sense of depriving populations of accepted freedoms such as freedom of speech etc.); dehousing
     due to policies adopted by the antagonist(s); the effect on minorities (religious/ethnic) perceived to
     be “disloyal” and which may have suffered due to war.

     The Cold War cannot be used as an example – though proxy wars within the Cold War are
     legitimate choices.

     If only one war is chosen, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks]. The wars must be from the
     second half of the century. Credit for wars before this cannot be given.


3.   To what extent were religious issues responsible for the wars between either India and
     Pakistan (1947–1971) or Iran and Iraq (1980–1988)?

     “To what extent” questions invite candidates to consider not only the stated themes/areas of
     investigation and make critical commentary upon them, but also to acknowledge “other factors”
     which may be considered significant. The nature and extent of “religious issues” needs to be
     explained and its importance in terms of causation examined.

     Whether religious issues were a fundamental cause – or whether such issues masked larger issues at
     stake between the states needs to be addressed. Having commented upon the nature and extent of
     the religious issues in either case, candidates could examine whether such differences were of
     primary importance in leading to conflict and then consider “other factors”. These could include
     (depending on the war selected): economic ambitions/rivalry (the drive to secure natural resources
     or access to vital raw materials); national (or personal) prestige; the desire to establish regional
     hegemony; the need for a war of distraction to divert attention from pressing internal problems etc.
                                                  –6–                M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


4.   Analyse the reasons for, and importance of, foreign intervention in one of the following:
     the Chinese Civil War (1927–1949); the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939); the Gulf War (1991).

     Depending on the war selected, reasons (or motives) for foreign intervention could include:
     ideological – in the sense of a willingness to promote or support one particular side in the civil war;
     the desire to seek access to material gain (raw materials for example) in the event of victory by the
     side which is backed; strategical (territorial acquisition/geopolitical benefits) which would accrue to
     the foreign power(s) in the event of a victory by the side they are supporting; the desire to use
     intervention to show military power and/or use the war as a testing ground for new technology;
     the opportunistic moves of particular powers to take advantage of civil strife to attain their own
     goals (for example in this latter case, Japan’s intervention in China – not intended to back either of
     the warring parties, but to take advantage of China’s division during a period of economic and
     political crisis).

     The importance of foreign intervention (and an explanation of what form it took in terms of the
     nature and extent of intervention would be helpful here) could focus on areas such as whether
     intervention was responsible for extending or shortening the duration of the war, worsening the
     human and physical damages or ultimately deciding the outcome of the conflict. In some cases
     foreign intervention (militarily in particular) played a significant role in deciding the outcome,
     whereas it could be argued that in other cases, foreign intervention had little positive impact in
     advancing the interests of the foreign power or the side being supported.

     If only reasons or importance is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 –7–               M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


5.   In what ways did advances in technology affect the nature and outcome of warfare in the first
     half of the twentieth century?

     The nature of war refers to the ways in which the practice of war was affected – this could include
     reference to: the increasingly destructive nature of conflict in terms of casualties (civilian and
     military) and physical plant and infrastructure of the participants due to the ability to wreak more
     damage because of technological developments; the growing importance of new military fronts
     (especially aerial warfare), the involvement of whole populations – in the case of the world wars –
     as contributors to wars of attrition/total war; the changing nature of strategy – from the rapidly
     discredited “cult of the offensive” of 1914–1918 to the “cult of the defensive” which dominated
     military thinking in Western Europe post-1918 until that too was called into question by German
     “Blitzkrieg” tactics.

     The term “technology” will doubtless produce identification of weaponry (innovations and
     improvements) used in the world wars especially – and how it was used. This is not however a
     question about describing “Life in the trenches” on the Western Front 1914–1918.

     Candidates need to identify the relevant technological advances – whether in terms of weaponry –
     or for example in terms of advances such as radar, sonar, improved radio communication,
     cryptology (Enigma and its relevance?) and apply that knowledge to explaining how it affected the
     way in which the war was fought.

     In relation to “outcome” candidates could comment on the extent to which technological advances
     were major contributors – indeed decisive contributors – to deciding which side won/lost – and
     why. Though this is not a “to what extent” invitation, some candidates may attribute outcome to
     “other factors” – please accept this while bearing in mind that the issue of advances in technology
     should be dealt with and not ignored.

     If only nature or outcome is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

6.   Assess the importance of each of the following in causing the First or the Second World War:
     nationalism; alliances; economic factors.

     The basic structure for the essay is established by the task itself. Candidates are not required to deal
     with this as a “to what extent” question – there is no need to address other factors although some
     students with a pre-planned essay on the causes of the First World War will no doubt be determined
     to write all they have learned as a learned response.

     The task is to identify and assess the nature, and hence the importance of the stated factors in
     explaining the cause of either war. This could include dealing with origins and outbreak of the
     conflict.

     Candidates might do well to clarify/define the factors to aid in their “assessment” task – for
     example “nationalism” depending on the war chosen, could be interpreted and dealt with in a
     variety of ways: aggressive nationalism which sought to expand the nation’s political and territorial
     spheres of influence; revanchist–based based nationalism which sought to gain vengeance for past
     losses or defeats; thwarted nationalism (attempts to achieve self-determination); the attempt by
     empires to suppress nationalism to ensure self–preservation etc. Similarly, the “alliances” can be
     dealt with as both symptoms and also precipitants of war in either case. Whether alliances and
     alliance systems were responsible for exacerbating tensions or allowing for the extension of
     regional into continental or global conflicts could be addressed. “Economic factors” may be
     interpreted as the desire of particular states to achieve economic gains (raw materials, markets etc.)
     through a policy of war and aggrandisement – or possibly as solutions, in the case of some states, to
     existing socio – economic crises, which could be solved (war of distraction?) by resort to war.

     Most candidates who choose to deal with the Second World War will probably identify 1939 as the
     start of the conflict. However if candidates comment on, for example, Germany’s war against the
     USSR or Japan’s attack on the USA in 1941 in an attempt to deal with nationalism – or more likely
     – economic factors in determining the causes for conflict, accept. Between 1939 and up to June and
     December 1941, there is a case to be made that the conflict was not arguably a world war.

     If only one factor is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. If only two factors are
     addressed, mark out of a maximum of [14 marks].

Topic 2   Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   Analyse the challenges faced by one democratic state in the first half of the twentieth century
     and the extent to which they were successfully dealt with.

     Although the question says “in the first half of the twentieth century”, candidates do not need to
     deal with the entire period of 50 years! Coverage of a democratic state within this period is
     acceptable

     Depending on the selected state, candidates can deal with a variety of “challenges”, both internal
     and external, to the democratic state. Such “challenges” could include: political instability due
     to the growth of extremist parties or movements which threatened to destabilize the state;
     economic crises which undermined the state’s wellbeing and required action; labour unrest due
     to dissatisfaction with existing social economic conditions; threats to the state from external
     sources etc.

     No doubt the Great Depression and its impact upon the United States will be a popular choice –
     as could be Weimar Germany up to 1933. Accept any legitimate example – but answers which deal
     with examples such as Hitler’s Germany – or say Mussolini’s Italy or the USSR are invalid.
     The choice of such states reveals a lack of understanding of the question and cannot be credited.

     Candidates, having identified the nature of the challenges, are required to comment upon the extent
     to which such challenges were dealt with – this needs reference to the methods/policies adopted and
     the degree of success achieved – or not.

     No credit can be given for answers which deal with a democratic state which is chosen from the
     second half of the century. If only challenges or the extent to which they were dealt with is done,
     mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


8.   “Proportional representation hindered rather than helped the establishment of a stable
     democracy.” With reference to one twentieth century democratic state, explain to what extent
     you agree with this statement.

     Candidates could define/explain their understanding of the term “proportional representation” at the
     outset. The theory of proportional representation (in whatever form it existed) should be
     commented upon in relation to how the system functioned in practice. While such a system,
     according to its proponents, allows for a better representation of minority and or
     sectional/communal interests, it has sometimes been the case that the existence of a multiplicity of
     parties has proved detrimental to stable government. On the other hand, there have been states
     where coalitions, based upon the proportional representation system have functioned effectively and
     been able to pursue effective government through the necessary compromises being reached by
     coalition partners. The answer to the question obviously depends very much on the selected state
     and its experiences with the system.

9.   In what ways, and with what success, did Nehru deal with the economic and social problems
     facing India (1947–1964)?

     Candidates need to identify the specific economic and social problems facing India – and Nehru’s
     administration – upon India’s independence in 1947. While the bulk of such problems were
     internal, it is also the case that the dispute with neighbouring Pakistan certainly led to immediate
     economic and social problems in terms of the refugee problem accompanying Partition.

     Specific problems – social and economic – could refer to: the economic system which India
     inherited from its Imperial past, problems of economic inequality in the new state, arguments with
     Pakistan over water supply via the Indus; the expenditure upon the military due to poor relations
     with Pakistan; linguistic tensions threatening to undermine the stability of the state; the issue of
     caste; communal/religious tensions within the new India; inequitable distribution of land etc.

     Having identified the problems, candidates need to identify the methods/policies/legislation that the
     Indian state under Nehru’s leadership adopted to deal with these problems – and make a judgement
     as to how successful this was in the stated period.

     If only ways are addressed and no consideration of the degree of success is made, mark out of a
     maximum of [12 marks].
                                                  – 11 –             M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


10.   Compare and contrast the attempts of Eisenhower and Kennedy to deal with two of the
      following issues: civil rights; social welfare; education.

      The period 1953–1963 is the focus here and candidates are required to identify specifically the
      issues being dealt with as well as make reference to similarities/differences in the ways/methods
      both presidents (Eisenhower 1953–1961) and Kennedy (1961–1963) adopted to deal with the
      issues. Candidates may quite legitimately also compare and contrast the degree of success each
      leader had in tackling such issues, possibly noting the relatively brief period in office of Kennedy
      and the foreign policy “distractions” which he faced in these years.

      Civil rights can be dealt with in relation to the discrimination suffered by groups based upon race
      (or gender) – and linked to issues such as suffrage, lack of employment opportunities, segregated
      facilities based upon race/ethnic differences. Both presidents were linked, during their terms of
      office, to legislation which was intended to address these inequalities (1954 Brown vs. Topeka and
      the subsequent desegregation of schools which was enforced by Eisenhower in the case of Little
      Rock, Arkansas, 1957). Civil Rights Acts were passed (1957, 1960) which instituted government
      commissions and provided government support to examine irregularities in voting registration and
      the abuse of the suffrage. The appointment of Earl Warren as Chief Justice by Eisenhower could be
      seen as a step forward or, depending on interpretation of the candidate, a token gesture in advancing
      civil rights and racial equality.

      Under the short lived Kennedy administration, the pressure of events such as the Meredith Incident
      of 1962, the Birmingham demonstrations in Alabama and the mass mobilisation of protesters by
      Martin Luther King in 1963 (March on Washington) was instrumental in Kennedy’s proposal of a
      Civil Rights Act (passed posthumously, 1964). Kennedy in 1963 claimed “that race has no place in
      American life or law”.

      Candidates could comment upon the manner in which the issue of civil rights was addressed –
      the motives behind action, the inequalities that were addressed – and the extent to which legislative
      measures were successful in redressing the abuses.

      Similarly, in terms of social welfare candidates could identify issues relating to health care
      provision, health insurance, unemployment insurance, minimum wage, old age pensions, housing.
      The “New Frontier” ideals of Kennedy and the barriers he faced could be compared and contrasted
      to the earlier attempts of Eisenhower to identify and deal with social welfare issues. In terms of
      either social welfare or civil rights legislation, some candidates may point out the difficulties both
      leaders faced as a result of strong Congress backing at times.

      Education – as in the cases noted above, should identify the issues (no doubt there will be in some
      answers an overlap with civil rights and segregated schooling facilities and the way this impacted
      upon opportunities of the communities) – which relate to matters of primary/secondary/tertiary level
      education: – curriculum change of emphasis (for example following the 1957 launch of Sputnik),
      federal aid for education, the establishment of the Peace Corps under Kennedy etc.

      If candidates deal with only Kennedy or Eisenhower, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. If only
      one issue is compared and contrasted, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

11.   By what methods, and with what success, was democracy established in South Africa
      1991–2000?

      The period covered requires consideration of the transition of the Republic of South Africa from the
      apartheid regime to a multi-party state – and the degree of success achieved by the post-apartheid
      state in its move towards a democratic system.

      Candidates could examine the dismantling (by F W de Klerk, the last National Party president), of
      the apartheid state in the period after his election in 1989. Actions that indicated the retreat from
      racially based government and acknowledgement of the need for majority rule can be seen in moves
      such as: the legalisation of the ANC along with the release from prison of N Mandela; the continued
      repeal of apartheid legislation (already underway since the premiership of Botha a decade earlier);
      the holding of talks to discuss a new constitution for a post-apartheid system, talks which were
      often met with resistance by groups who would benefit from the continuation of the apartheid state.

      By 1993 the general election held returned an approximately two thirds majority for the ANC. The
      subsequent transitional, multiracial interim government formed was a coalition – ANC, NP and
      Inkatha. Mandela became president and de Klerk his vice president. Arrangements were made for
      the future elections of 1999.

      The extent to which democratic principles were established and honoured in the period up to 2000
      invites candidates to consider the way in which the multi-party system was able to offer the
      population (all of the population) the equality of opportunity (social, economic and political) which
      had been denied the majority since at least 1948. Arguments between Inkatha and the ANC and the
      flight of population and capital threatened the stability of the economy and led to the ANC adopting
      policies which differed from its original platform of socialism.

      This is not a question on the reasons for the fall of apartheid. Candidates need to focus on the
      period of transition and the consequent implementation of democratic/multi-party rule in South
      Africa.

      If only methods are dealt with and no reference is made to the degree of success, mark out of a
      maximum of [12 marks].

12.   To what extent have gender rights or religious rights been promoted and protected in one
      twentieth century democratic state?

      Gender rights
      Refers to the provision, by democratic states, to ensure equality between males and females. Such
      equality can be examined in relation to matters such as: suffrage on an equal basis; employment
      practices (hiring, promotion for example) and pay; equal opportunity in education; in terms of
      inheritance of property etc.

      Religious rights
      Refers to the right of religious groups to practise their faith free from state or public persecution or
      discrimination; religious education in schools and/or the provision of funding for religious schools /
      educational establishments catering for a specific faith; the right to proselytize without fear of
      government interference etc.

      The question requires candidates to consider how such rights have been promoted or supported (in
      some cases, initiated) by the state (by legislative means, by inclusion in constitutional guarantees,
      by court decisions that have been upheld in the interests of equality of treatment) and how the state
      has acted to protect those who have been deprived of such rights.

      N.B. The question requires candidates to do more than make generalizations – and to support their
      answers by reference to specific examples/historical knowledge from their chosen democratic state

Topic 3     Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   Assess the contribution of economic instability and lack of a united opposition to the rise to
      power of two leaders of single-party states, each chosen from a different region.

      Credit answers that use authoritarian leaders.

      “Economic instability” could refer to crises which weakened the existing state system and produced
      popular disillusionment or frustration with the governmental system. Often the corollary of
      economic unrest i.e. the result of economic crises as evidenced in: declining standards of living;
      shortages of essential goods; unemployment; inflation; anger over the maldistribution of resources
      (land for example), is the rise of political extremism – and/or the willingness of groups to support
      such extremes in the belief that they offer a solution to problems.

      Candidates have a wide choice of examples here and it is important that the nature and extent of the
      economic unrest (and its origin and how it contributed to the increasing support of the chosen
      leaders) is dealt with.

      The issue of the “lack of a united opposition” requires consideration of those individuals, parties,
      institutions which were unable, unwilling or simply incompetent in terms of organising themselves
      to offer effective resistance to the single-party leader. The reasons for lack of unity of opposition to
      the rise will differ according to the examples selected but candidates may identify themes such as
      underestimation, complacency, and collusion for example as playing important roles in aiding the
      ascension of the selected leaders. Subsequent illustration of exactly how such factors operated in
      favour of the aspiring leader are necessary for a convincing answer.

      This is not a “to what extent” question. The emphasis needs to be on assessment of the stated
      factors. While candidates may identify other factors, this should be only briefly. The bulk of the
      answer should focus on the key elements in the task.

      N.B. This is not an invitation to write a general overview of the rise to power of two single-party or
      authoritarian leaders.

      If only one single-party state leader or one region is chosen, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   To what extent were either Kenyatta or Nyerere successful in dealing with the social and
      economic challenges facing the state after independence?

      Identification of the social and economic challenges at the outset is necessary before a meaningful
      assessment of either leader’s addressing of such challenges can be undertaken. No period of years
      is given for “after independence”. Be willing to accept that candidates may treat such a question as
      covering the entire tenure of office of the leader selected.

      Nyerere
      As prime minister of independent Tanganyika (1961), president of the Republic of Tanganyika
      (1962–1964) and then Tanzania from 1964–1985 Nyerere inherited an economy which was
      previously tied to the imperial economy and reliant in large part on the production of crops for
      export (e.g. coffee, cotton, sugar, sisal). World commodity prices, which were variable, thus had a
      significant impact upon the economy of Tanganyika/Tanzania which had few other natural
      resources/raw materials. Nyerere initially expanded the production of export crops but by 1967 the
      conversion of Tanzania from a provider of cash crops/commodities to the world market to “African
      socialism” as outlined in Nyerere’s Arusha Declaration led to economic problems. Nationalization
      of foreign enterprises, an end to dependency on foreign loans, cooperative farming and the concept
      of ujamaa or familyhood, the stress on self-reliance and the elimination of economic inequality
      were government targets. The social challenges relating to the provision of universal primary
      education, the reduction of infant mortality and the drive to increase life expectancy were also goals
      that were set. Candidates could examine the ways in which these challenges were addressed and
      whether the leader was able to achieve success (and measured how?) and if not, what were the
      barriers to such success (internal? external? economic? etc.). If candidates deal with Nyerere’s full
      tenure they may consider the reversal of the nationalization programme by 1985.

      Kenyatta
      Became the prime minister of independent Kenya in 1963 and its president in 1964 (until 1978).
      Areas for examination in relation to the challenges could relate to the issue of land reform (since the
      pre-independence period had revealed the glaring inequality of land distribution on a racial basis in
      what had been to all intents and purposes a “settler colony” for whites – in contrast, for example, to
      Tanganyika), the question of rapid population increase and the growth of urbanisation and attendant
      problems in coping with the stresses of these (provision of housing, employment, equality of
      opportunity regardless of ethnic/tribal background). The nature of the economy – how it functioned
      (effectively or not) on both the level of domestic production and its links to the export economy and
      dependence on foreign custom could be examined and commented upon.

15.   Compare and contrast the treatment of religious groups and minorities in two authoritarian
      or single-party states each chosen from a different region.

      The most popular choices here are likely to be: the treatment of German and European Jewry and/or
      the Roma and Sinti communities by the National Socialist regime in Germany; dekulakisation
      undertaken by the Stalinist regime in the USSR; the elimination of landlordism in Mao’s China
      immediately after the establishment of the PRC; the repression of minority nationalities which were
      seen as inimical to national unity.

      Some candidates may deal with the treatment of religious groups by the authoritarian or single-party
      regime in terms of the persecution of specific denominations (Catholic Church, Orthodox Church
      etc.) or in terms of the attempt to discourage the practice of all religion in the selected state.

      The term “minority” may be interpreted in its widest form here: – class, tribal, ethnic etc. Make
      sure that the selected group is indeed a minority – and that candidates do not use this as an
      opportunity to write about general persecution of the population.

      If only one region is chosen mark out of a maximum of [7 marks]. If two regions are chosen but
      only religious groups or minorities are chosen, mark out of [12 marks].

      N.B. that women do not constitute a minority.

16.   Analyse the methods used by one single-party ruler to establish totalitarian control.

      “Totalitarian control” refers not merely to the existence of a one-party state but also to the attempt
      of that single-party ruler to implement policies and use methods to ensure control over all aspects of
      the lives of the population. Whether this could ever be completely realised was doubtful, but
      candidates could explore and comment critically upon the methods of their selected ruler to achieve
      this goal.

      N.B. This is a question on the ruler “in power” and not a “rise to power” question. Answers which
      focus only on “rise” cannot be credited.

      Methods used could include investigation of the use of force to ensure the leader and the party’s
      dominance – through the suppression of rival parties which could form a potential opposition base,
      purges of specific institutions (civil service, religious, the military – even the party itself – when
      leaders perceived an internal threat to their power base). Intimidation or the use of violence –
      through the establishment of a police state and the encouragement of a culture of
      denunciation/informing can also be investigated and commented upon critically.

      Other methods can be addressed such as: the use of propaganda; the establishment of a “cult of
      personality”; media censorship, the control of education and the establishment of youth movements
      to indoctrinate the population; the establishment of “scapegoats” to divert the population and
      provide a form of “negative cohesion”.

      Not all methods are necessarily linked to force or violence however. The implementation of
      schemes to address economic problems (reduce unemployment), to redistribute resources, to offer
      the population “rewards” in the form of access to organised leisure activities, to provide health care,
      gender equality etc. can also be seen as methods to win over the population and make it favourable
      to the totalitarian regime.

      Although foreign policy is not included as a focus point in this Topic area, some candidates may
      point out that the pursuit of a successful foreign policy which restores national pride or honour can
      also be a method whereby leaders sought to secure acceptance of, and obedience to, totalitarian
      rule. This should where relevant to the answer, be credited.

17.   Assess the extent to which ideological appeal aided the rise and rule of one of the following:
      Sukarno; Nasser; Perón.

       “Ideology” – the programme or beliefs of the above figures in relation to economic, social and
      political aims could be a starting point for discussion. The main elements or characteristics could
      be identified before an attempt is made to assess how appealing such ideas or beliefs were to the
      population (either generally or to specific sectors) of the chosen state. Without an explanation or
      definition of such beliefs, successful assessment is necessarily hindered.

      Depending upon the example chosen, beliefs (or ideology) may include the following:
      anti-colonialism; non-alignment; nationalism; regional unity (for example Nasser’s Pan-Arabism),
      land reform / redistribution of resources; nationalization; industrialization; etc.

      As this is a question which asks about “extent”, candidates need to consider not only how far the
      ideology was important in both rise and rule but also “other factors” which contributed towards the
      rise and maintenance of power. These, again depending upon the selected leader, could include: the
      use of military power to achieve control, external support pre- and post- rise to power; propaganda,
      education; successful social/economic policies; the use of repression to eliminate or diminish
      challenges to the leader etc.

      The question requires coverage of the period pre- and post- assumption of power. If only rise or
      rule is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


18.   “Successful economic and social policies were essential for the single-party leader’s
      maintenance of power.” With reference to either Mao or Castro, to what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      The longevity of the rule of either leader needs examination in regard to the extent to which they
      dealt with the social and economic ills of the state when they assumed power in 1949 and 1959
      respectively. A suitable starting point could be identification of the problems (social and economic)
      that either leader inherited from the previous regime. Depending upon the leader chosen, the areas
      to be addressed could relate to: the question of inequitable land distribution; industrialization; the
      existence of opposition by supporters of the previous regime; economic dependence on foreign
      powers; social inequality in terms of gender or racial/ethnic discrimination; low levels of literacy
      and health care which hampered individual and national development etc.

      In either case, candidates need to examine how either leader attempted to deal with such problems –
      and the extent to which their goals were achieved. Given that economic problems were not always
      successfully tackled in either case in terms of establishing a stable economy which was not reliant
      on outside powers (indeed the results of some economic plans were disastrous in human terms or in
      meeting the projected quotas) attention could be paid to other methods or policies implemented by
      the leader to ensure the maintenance of power. These methods/policies may be linked to the use of
      force/repression, purges, propaganda, censorship, education, the conjuring up (or utilization of) of
      an outside enemy – neo-colonialism / imperialism – to unite the population behind the leader and
      the regime.

      Social policies – in terms of gender equality, health provision, increased literacy and educational
      opportunities, advancement of previously disadvantaged classes or social groups can be examined.
      In many cases these policies were popular with sections of the population and could be said to have
      aided in strengthening the support base for the leader despite the lack of civil liberties available.

Topic 4    Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
           Eastern European states

19.   Assess the significance of the two world wars in hastening the independence of one African or
      one Asian colonial state.

      Consideration of the importance – or significance – of both world wars is necessary. The wars
      could be seen as catalysts for the decolonisation process, which resulted in the eventual
      independence of many African and Asian states. Only one state is required, but there is a need for
      responses to illustrate the general points raised about the wars by providing specific evidence
      relating to the African or Asian state chosen.

      The Great War, with the enormous economic demands placed upon imperial powers arguably began
      a process of imperial retreat as commitment to the retention of empire was reduced – or in some
      cases the financial and military capacity to deal with colonial nationalism was reduced. The Great
      War and Allied talk of self determination in the event of victory – coupled with the reality that
      self-determination post 1918/19 was never intended for the indigenous population of colonies –
      helped ignite a tide of nationalist and independence movements in Asia particularly. The rise to
      power of communism in Russia, partly a result of the strains of 1914–1917, also helped in the
      spread of anti-imperialist movements in colonial territories.

      The Second World War completed a process increasingly evident by the end of the First World
      War. The destruction caused by the war, the weakness of the European colonial powers militarily
      and financially, the unwillingness of some powers to spend effort on repressing colonial nationalism
      led, in some cases, to the decision to quit. While some imperial powers did make a desperate
      attempt to hold on to possessions – in Indo-China, in Southeast Asia, in North Africa – the war
      weariness of the population of metropolitan powers, the lack of financial resources and the fact that
      pressure for decolonisation could now be successfully applied by the two new superpowers via the
      newly established UNO led to the dwindling of empire.

      In the colonial possessions themselves, populations which had contributed to victory in both wars,
      and which had been under the impression that the victors of both wars had been fighting for
      freedom (as stated in Allied propaganda) organised, mobilized and pressured colonial authorities for
      freedom. These demonstrations could often take the form of violence – for example in the Gold
      Coast where nationalist aspirations combined with the frustrations of returned, but unemployed,
      indigenous troops.

      Sometimes independence occurred quickly (India 1947 for example) though on other occasions
      brutal wars of decolonisation/liberation were required (Indo-China, Dutch East Indies, Algeria etc.).

      If only one world war is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

20.   “The contribution of Gandhi to the gaining of Indian independence was much exaggerated.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Many students adopt an almost hagiographical approach to the role of Gandhi in relation to the
      gaining of independence in India in 1947. The question requires candidates to make a balanced
      judgement as to the factors responsible for the attainment of independence – as indicated by the
      “to what extent” invitation.

      Gandhi’s contribution could be examined in terms of his ability to unite much (but certainly not all)
      of the population behind the INC in a mass movement and in terms of his methods (which gained
      much publicity both in India and world wide). Passive resistance / civil disobedience and the
      abjuring of force were used as moral “weapons” in the freedom struggle and did allow for the
      mobilisation of large sections of the population. These did put pressure on Britain and world
      opinion and, as witnessed in the press, was arguably a contributing factor in undermining Britain’s
      claim to rule.

      “Other factors” could be dealt with in explaining Britain’s decision to “Divide and Quit” by 1947 in
      a hasty departure from its Indian empire. Such factors could be related to the impact of the two
      world wars which weakened Britain economically. By the time of the Labour government of 1945,
      the will as well as the desire to hold on to India was declining – along with financial weakness –
      instrumental in helping decolonisation in India. Communal tensions exhibited by growing
      antipathy between the Congress and Muslim League (from 1937 onwards especially) made
      continued possession of the sub-continent increasingly difficult. Britain’s post-war government was
      focused on internal reconstruction rather than the continuation of imperial control.

      The role of Gandhi could therefore be seen in a wider perspective – indeed some students may
      emphasise the role of Nehru (the younger), or Patel in accelerating India’s independence – or even
      the role of Jinnah, whose calls for an independent Pakistan hastened the desire of Britain to leave –
      and Congress to settle quickly on the details (timing for example) of independence.

21.   Analyse the reasons for the failure of movements to successfully challenge Soviet control in
      Central and Eastern European states between 1945 and 1968.

      The period offers a variety of examples which candidates could use to illustrate the response.
      Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968) will almost certainly prove the most well known
      examples, though candidates may refer to the events of 1953 in the GDR/DDR or 1956 in Poland.
      “Movements” which challenged “Soviet control” were not necessarily anti-communist or
      anti-socialist movements but could be seen as movements that challenged and/or rejected
      centralised control from Moscow. Tito’s Yugoslavia for example could be legitimately referred to
      as an example of a state where the centralising tendencies of Moscow control were resented and
      rejected with success. Candidates who use this to challenge the premise of the question that
      movements were failures should be credited. Similarly the purges of “Titoist” leaders in Bulgaria
      (Slansky), Hungary (Rajk), for example, illustrate the manner in which Moscow (in this case Stalin)
      was determined to eliminate “movements” or factions which were considered a threat to Moscow’s
      policy of control of satellite states.

      Depending on the examples selected –and the question does state “failure of movements” (plural)–
      so expect coverage of at least two examples, candidates could refer to the nature and strength of the
      movements themselves (numbers, leadership, popular support – or lack thereof, the adoption of
      policies, which antagonised or threatened Moscow’s security needs), the use of military strength by
      the USSR and, in Czechoslovakia 1968, Warsaw Pact forces to crush such challenges – real or
      perceived. The effectiveness of internal forces of surveillance and repression might also be referred
      to, partly as a catalyst for risings in some cases and as an explanation for the failure of risings or
      opposition in other cases.

      The role of outside intervention could also be commented upon. In most cases the West recognised
      the existence of the Soviet sphere of influence and made little attempt to defend movements
      challenging Soviet control. In at least one case (Yugoslavia and Marshall aid) the support provided
      helped amongst other factors to ensure freedom from Soviet control.

      If only one movement is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

22.   Analyse the extent to which the dissolution of Yugoslavia was the result of (a) internal factors
      and (b) external factors.

      While the break-up of Yugoslavia occurred in the 1990s, internal tensions in the state were present
      much earlier. Some candidates may trace these tensions back to the establishment of the state as a
      result of the Paris Peace Settlement. Yugoslavia – or Greater Serbia – was dominated by Serbs for
      much of its existence and resentment by Slovenes, Croats, Bosnians, Montenegrins etc. was present
      from the beginning. During the Second World War the bloody antagonism between Croats and
      Serbs revealed some of the division existing in the state. Under Tito’s regime, until his death in
      1980, the post-Second World War Yugoslav state evidenced few examples of internal dissension.
      In the decade or so following however, economic problems (unemployment – with wide regional
      disparity – and inflation) were aggravated by the emergence of political leaders who played upon
      nationalism to boost popularity and gain support. Tudjman in Croatia, Milosevic in Serbia pursued
      policies which threatened the fabric of the federal Yugoslav state. The tension which was present
      between different “nationalities” was exacerbated by the fact that in the six federal “republics”
      making up Yugoslavia (and the two provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo) there were ethnic
      minorities which permitted political leaders seeking power to exploit the situation by alleging the
      need to “rescue” compatriots from the unfair treatment it was claimed they suffered.

      Longer term problems together with shorter term problems after 1980 were compounded by the
      appeals to nationalism and inability or unwillingness of leaders to reach a compromise on matters
      relating to the distribution of power in Yugoslavia.

      In terms of external factors, the European Community moved rapidly in 1991 to avert what could
      have been an outbreak of civil war when Slovenia declared itself an independent state. When
      Croatian independence was declared at the same time, it was much more of a problem since the
      presence of a significant Serb minority in Croatia led to its invasion and the seizing of
      approximately 33 % of the self – proclaimed independent Croatia. While the UNO did become
      involved in the arranging of a ceasefire and dispatch of peacekeeping forces in early 1992 it did
      little to halt the slide to dissolution of the Yugoslav state. The war breaking out in the ethnically
      and religiously mixed area of Bosnia in March 1992 led to further bloodshed up into the late 90s.

      Arguably, foreign intervention (by the EC or UNO) – in terms of recognising the independence of
      states such as Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia encouraged the rate at which dissolution occurred and,
      because of the inability of the international community to effectively support these states (militarily,
      economically) or ensure protection of minorities it determined the bloody course which such
      declarations led to.

      If only internal or external factors are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

23.   Assess the social and economic challenges faced by either one post-colonial state or one new
      state in Central or Eastern Europe.

      The nature of the economy inherited from the previous regime and its suitability for the new state
      (i.e. the colonial or a former satellite state was invariably part of a large “plan” or scheme instituted
      by the metropolitan or dominant state and the economic clientship of Central or Eastern European
      states in the past) meant problems in readjusting trade patterns and accessing established markets
      and raw materials.

      Structural changes and the opening up to free markets often resulted in problems competing – with
      resultant failure and rising unemployment which led to social discontent. The need to adapt from
      centrally directed/command economies to a more free market system meant that management
      expertise, techniques and equipment were in short supply. The de-collectivisation of land and the
      privatisation process to replace state owned industry also caused short-term problems – as well as
      allegations of carpetbagging.

      Post-colonial states too found that the imperial economic legacy could lead to reliance on the
      vagaries of world commodity markets unless the economic relationship with the metropolitan state
      could be continued even after political independence (e.g. Francophone West Africa). The new
      post-colonial state required improved educational facilities to provide trained personnel for future
      economic development, the improvement of transportation infrastructure, attention to health and
      welfare provision – at a time when there was often a shortage of available funds. Stated aims to
      reduce infant mortality, to increase life expectancy, to provide universal primary and secondary
      education while laudable, were often unsuccessful due to lack of funding.

      Issues of corruption, inequalities in living standards, the emergence of new “elites” to replace the
      previous ones could be considered.

      Specific knowledge needs to be selected and applied to illustrate the challenges of the one selected
      state.

      If only social or economic challenges are dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

24.   Assess the importance of the leadership of one of the following in the attainment of
      independence from colonial or Soviet control: Jinnah; Nkrumah; Walesa.

      This is a question about the attainment of independence and not about how the leader maintained
      power. “Leadership” could be examined in terms of: how, why, and with what results the
      individual identified and articulated grievances about the existing regime; the methods used to
      promote and publicise the programme of the movement that each leader was associated with; the
      extent to which the leader and the movement were able to achieve mass mobilisation and support
      for the programme. Whether the leader was charismatic, ably assisted by other figures in the
      movement they were associated with – or the beneficiary of outside factors which they recognised
      as providing opportunities to achieve their goals – are also areas which could be explored.

      While not a “to what extent” question, candidates may identify a raft of “other factors” and attempt
      to evaluate the contribution of “leadership” in relation to these. This is acceptable.

      Jinnah
      Regarded as the founder of modern Pakistan, and “The Great Leader” was leader of the Muslim
      League which competed with the INC, from 1937 onwards especially, in the drive for
      decolonisation in the Indian subcontinent. Controversy exists regarding the extent to which his goal
      was really an independent “Pakistan” or whether his claims for such constituted a bargaining chip
      for Muslim guarantees in a future independent Indian state. Candidates could examine the manner
      in which the League under Jinnah transformed itself into a mass political movement which was able
      to negotiate, from a position of strength, with both the INC and the colonial government. His push
      for political power was aided not only by the establishment of a programme based on “religion
      under threat” but also by his ability to recognise the errors of others and take advantage of them (the
      policy of the INC during the Second World War for example with its Quit India programme – or the
      desperation of London by 1946/7 to “Divide and Quit” in the light of the physical, economic and
      military impact of the Second World War upon Britain).

      Nkrumah
      Served his apprenticeship in anti-imperialism during his student years in the USA and Britain.
      Involvement in Pan-Africanism and with the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) preceded his
      establishment of a much more popular and populist nationalist movement: the CPP (Convention
      People’s Party). Campaigns of “Positive Action” helped propagandise the demand for freedom and
      mobilise the population especially in the urban centres. Despite imprisonment for sedition his
      influence was great enough to have him released from jail in order to form an administration
      following elections in the Gold Coast in 1951. Independence was granted in 1957.

      Walesa
      Was involved as a worker in the Lenin Shipyard leading strikes as early as 1970–1971. He re-
      emerged, after a 4 year period of “enforced unemployment” when he became leader of a new strike
      movement in 1980. His main achievement has been seen as his organisation of the Interfactory
      Strike Committee which became the Solidarity trade union which managed to negotiate directly
      with the state on Solidarity’s right to exist and strike. In 1981 when martial law was proclaimed
      Solidarity was banned and Walesa like many of its leaders was detained. Walesa emerged one year
      later to lead anti-Jaruzelski opposition. It was not till 1988 following popular discontent over
      economic conditions – and political conditions – that Solidarity was once more made legal.
      Solidarity won elections in 1989 leading to the beginning of the end of non-Communist rule in East
      and Central Europe. Walesa has been blamed for causing a subsequent schism in Solidarity by
      establishing his own movement – the Centre Alliance. He was elected president 1990, losing the
      presidential election of 1995.

Topic 5     The Cold War

25.   Assess the role of Truman and Stalin in the origins and development of the Cold War.

      Truman’s presidential period extends from 1945 till 1952. Stalin died in 1953 but was ruler of the
      USSR from 1928/9 arguably. The period under discussion in the question is likely, for most
      candidates, to be interpreted as the years 1945–1953. There is much material available for
      consideration in this period, which should allow for answers to go beyond the “historiographical”
      responses which are still produced by too many candidates. *(See comment below in italics)

      Origins
      Could refer to the events of the year 1945: Yalta Conference (and Roosevelt), Germany’s surrender;
      Potsdam Conference (the differing stance of Truman – and why); the contrasting views as to what
      constituted “security” for the members of the Grand Alliance; issues relating to Germany, Poland
      etc. Some candidates will doubtless go back to 1917 and the Bolshevik revolution as their starting
      point, then work through the interwar years up to 1945. While this may be acceptable, the focus
      should be on Truman and Stalin and the period 1945 onwards should be the main focus.

      Development
      Could deal with the course of events from 1945/6 up till the Korean War as the conflict between
      East and West moved from Europe to East Asia. The flashpoints and issues in this period are
      numerous and provide sufficient detail for selection and deployment to support arguments:
      possession of atomic capability and arms race; the clash over the future of “liberated Europe”;
      confrontation over Iran; Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan and Soviet reactions; Germany and the
      Berlin crisis of 1948/9; Korea etc.

      The question asks about the role of two leaders so credit candidates who attempt to focus on the
      role of each. Stalin, given the continuity of his period of rule and his control of Soviet policy over a
      longer term was arguably at a greater advantage in being able to articulate Soviet foreign policy and
      goals. As a single-party ruler he faced few challenges to implementing domestic or foreign policy.
      Soviet policy was much more Stalin’s policy than US policy could be said to be Truman’s policy.
      Truman came into office with little experience after Roosevelt’s death: he was more reliant on
      foreign policy advisors – whether Kennan or those who advocated the “Riga Axioms” – upon
      whom Roosevelt had not been dependant.

      To what extent was the conflict– in terms of origins or development– linked to the decisions arrived
      at by each leader, or were there other factors or individuals guiding foreign policy and determining
      the path pursued by US and the USSR?

      *N.B. Questions on the origins and development of the Cold War sometimes reproduce “learned”
      or “prepared” responses based upon a standard “historiographical” treatment: the “orthodox”,
      “revisionist” and “post-revisionist” interpretations. While these can be made relevant, it is
      important that such answers make a genuine attempt to address the central theme/focus of the
      question and not simply regurgitate a generic answer on the origins and development of the
      conflict.

      If only Truman or Stalin is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

26.   “The sovietization of Eastern and Central Europe after the Second World War was
      undertaken as a defensive measure by the Soviet Union.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      The liberation of the states of Eastern and Central Europe from Nazi occupation by the Red Army
      was initially welcomed but the establishment of what became known as Moscow’s “satellite states”
      in the period 1945–1948 was regarded with trepidation by the Western allies of the former Grand
      Alliance. Washington perceived the “sovietization” of these states as not only contrary to the
      Declaration on Liberated Europe but as the beginnings of Soviet expansion in pursuit of ideological
      goals as well as immediate material resources.

      Candidates are required to examine whether the process of “sovietization” (a working definition of
      the term at the outset would be helpful) was undertaken by Moscow as part of a strategy of
      territorial aggrandisement based on the expansion of communist ideology in the pursuit of Marxist-
      Leninist goals, or whether such acquisition was the result of the desire to attain security.

      The state – and status – of the USSR in the period could be examined to determine the extent to
      which Moscow was capable of undertaking expansion in the aftermath of the Second World War.
      The impact of the war upon the USSR psychologically and physically could be investigated. The
      fears of Moscow for the future – in relation to developments in Europe (German Question, Polish
      issue, US economic and military aid) and the increasing strain between former allies in the period
      also could be identified. By February 1948, the last piece of what became a “curtain” fell into place
      with the coup in Czechoslovakia.

27.   Analyse the reasons for, and consequences of, the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations in the
      1950s and 1960s.

      Reasons
      Candidates could identify the factors which led to a breakdown after what appeared– at least on the
      surface– to be an amicable relationship as indicated by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Alliance of 1950.
      Some candidates may comment upon the relationship between Stalin and Mao even before this
      (Stalin’s view of Maoism as “the peasant heresy”) and the fact that the relationship was not as solid
      as outsiders (US) perceived given that Stalin arguably saw– and treated– Mao as a junior partner in
      the world communist movement.

      Candidates could then examine the post-Stalin years and the widening gap, in terms of ideology,
      personality clash of leaders and strategy for the expansion of communism which opened between
      Khrushchev and Mao. Issues such as destalinisation, the introduction of what were interpreted as
      “deviationist” or revisionist policies by Moscow (Peaceful Co-existence, Goulash Communism), the
      failure of Moscow to back China in the Taiwan crisis of 1958, the different perceptions of the Great
      Leap Forward (regarding its ideological purity), the Sino-Indian war of 1962 and the Cuban Missile
      Crisis of 1962 could be examined and commented upon.

      Consequences
      Candidates could focus on results for the worldwide communist movement, international relations
      and the changing balance of Cold War alignment, the economic development of China (withdrawal
      of Soviet aid for a programme– the GLF– considered by Moscow to be “faulty in design and
      erroneous in practice”), the physical clashes by the later 1960s on the border of the USSR and the
      PRC which were a symptom as well as a further reason for antagonism between Moscow and
      Beijing etc.

      If only reasons or consequences are dealt, with mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

28.   Assess the economic and social impact of superpower involvement in one of the following:
      Cuba (after 1959); Congo (after 1960); Afghanistan (after 1979).

      The treatment of the question needs focus on “economic and social impact”. Candidates who use
      this as an opportunity to narrate/describe the origins and course of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
      are unlikely to score well.

      Whichever of the three is selected, the effects economically – in areas such as dislocation of/or
      shifting trading patterns, structural reorganisation of the economy, the provision of foreign aid,
      destruction of physical plant or resources etc. could be examined. Social impact refers to how the
      involvement of superpowers may have contributed to a change in the lives of the populations of the
      respective states. This could lead (depending on the example chosen) to consideration of: religious
      issues; educational programmes – influenced by ideological beliefs associated with a particular
      superpower; social welfare programmes; changes in patterns of employment; the establishment of
      refugee/exile populations etc.

      No end date is provided and candidates may choose for themselves what they consider an
      appropriate end point. Dwelling mainly upon the last 10 years is not however appropriate.

      Better responses will identify the significance of the given starting dates.

      If only economic or social impact is addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


29.   In what ways, and with what significance, did either Kennedy or Reagan influence the
      development of the Cold War?

      Candidates need to consider “how” either leader impacted the development of the East–West
      conflict – and the importance of the decisions/policies undertaken by the chosen leader in terms of
      exacerbating and/or reducing Cold War tensions in the short or longer term.

      Kennedy (1961–1963)
      The main areas for investigation are likely to be Berlin (1961), Cuba – in terms of the Bay of Pigs
      and Missile Crisis and its immediate aftermath (1961–1963) and South East Asia – Laos and
      Vietnam (1961–1963). Some candidates may include reference to spending on the space race and
      the increased spending on arms programmes that could be used to illustrate the abandonment of
      Eisenhower’s arguably more cautious policy towards the perceived Communist threat. An
      assessment of the significance of Kennedy as a “Cold Warrior” and the extent to which he increased
      the tensions– or not– should be based on evidenced study of incidents noted above.

      Reagan (1981–1989)
      The main areas for investigation are likely to focus upon the increase in defence spending from the
      beginning of his presidency (SDI and Cruise missile deployment in Europe), rejection of détente,
      involvement in the civil war in Angola through sponsoring of UNITA, provision of aid to anti-
      Soviet forces in Afghanistan, support for anti-communist regimes in the Americas (El Salvador,
      Grenada), involvement in Nicaragua to undermine the Sandinista government.

      Candidates may make a case for Reagan’s pressure (economic and military) upon the USSR as
      being a major contributing factor to the decline of Soviet power and the demise of the USSR.

      If only ways or significance is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
                                                 – 29 –             M12/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


30.   For what reasons, and in what ways, did Cold War tensions hinder the work of the United
      Nations?

      The UN (1945–), successor of the League of Nations (1920–1946) was charged both with
      resurrecting the concept of “collective security” which had been abandoned by states in the inter-
      war period as well as in promoting “functionalism” – i.e. encouraging states to cooperate in
      attempts to solve social, economic, humanitarian problems.

      The desire to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war … and … reaffirm faith in
      fundamental human rights” was laudable – and understandable in the light of the devastation of the
      Second World War.

      The Cold War that developed more or less simultaneously with the establishment of the UN
      prevented the organisation from becoming actively involved in major issues or crises in succeeding
      years. The exercising of veto power (the non-concurring vote) in the Security Council by the
      permanent members (East and West) meant the UN was unable to pass resolutions and implement
      action. While the UN was able to play a role in Korea (1950) – because of the unusual and never to
      be repeated circumstances of Soviet absence from the Security Council over the issue of Taiwan’s
      (Republic of China’s) place in the Council – the UN found itself incapable of acting in subsequent
      crises: Hungary (1956), the Middle East (with the exception of Suez (1956) which allowed the UN
      to become a face – saving instrument for British and French withdrawal in many ways), Cuba and
      the Missile Crisis, Southeast Asia, Southern Africa (the Rhodesian and South African minority
      regimes). On those occasions when it did manage to involve itself (Congo, Angola, Mozambique)
      the results were often slow in being realised due to Cold War rivalries interfering with the mandate
      of the organisation to promote collective security.

      Mutual suspicion of the superpowers and the changing nature of UN membership as the century
      progressed (the growing number of ex-colonial states– some of which supported the US, some the
      USSR) also led to a fall in budgetary contributions from leading members which impacted upon
      expenditure on “functional” work of the UN.

      Candidates could use case studies to illustrate the reasons and ways in which the work of the
      UN has been hindered. It is unlikely that candidates will cover almost 45 years of UN/Cold War
      inter-relationship.

      Some candidates may go on to comment on and compare the progress made by the UN after the end
      of the Cold War.

      If only reasons or ways is dealt with, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].
