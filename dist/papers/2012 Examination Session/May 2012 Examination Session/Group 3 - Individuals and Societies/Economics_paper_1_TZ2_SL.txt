Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain how, in a market system, changes in demand and supply allocate scarce
            resources through the signalling and incentive functions of price.                       [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that government intervention in agricultural markets will
            create more problems than it solves.                                                     [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Using AD/AS diagrams, explain how inflation may be caused by demand pull
            and cost push factors.                                                                   [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the consequences of deflation are likely to be more harmful
            to an economy than the consequences of inflation.                                        [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the factors which might cause a country’s balance of payments on
            current account to deteriorate.                                                          [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that it is never desirable for countries to resort to protectionism.   [15 marks]


4.    (a)   “The banking system, the education system, health care and a country’s
            infrastructure are four sources of economic development.” Explain how three
            of these factors might contribute to economic development.                               [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the impact of globalization on the economic growth and
            development of developing countries has, on balance, been beneficial.                    [15 marks]
