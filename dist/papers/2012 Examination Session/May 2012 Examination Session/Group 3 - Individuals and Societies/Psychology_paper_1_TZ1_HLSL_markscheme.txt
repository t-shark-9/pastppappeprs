                                              SECTION A

Biological level of analysis

1.   Describe one principle that defines the biological level of analysis.                        [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one
     principle that defines the biological level of analysis.

     Possible principles include:
      patterns of behaviour can be inherited
      animal research is relevant to human behaviour
      behaviour is the product of our nervous and endocrine systems
      genes play a role in behaviour.

     Candidates may use a study, theory or general concepts derived from psychological
     research to describe the principle that defines the biological level of analysis.

     If a candidate describes more than one principle, credit should be given only to the first
     description.

                    addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering
                    the question.

     7 to 8         The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
                    the demands of the command term. The response is supported by
                    appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of research.

Cognitive level of analysis

2.   Describe one ethical consideration related to one research study at the cognitive
     level of analysis.                                                                [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “describe” requires candidates to give a detailed account of one
     ethical consideration in relation to one research study at the cognitive level of analysis.
     Ethical considerations can be positive (what guidelines could be followed) or negative
     (what guidelines were not followed).

     The focus of the response should be on the ethical consideration and not on the
     description of a study.

     Research studies could include traditional cognitive studies but could also include
     studies that investigate biological or sociocultural factors that affect cognitive processes.
     However, responses should clearly relate the study to the cognitive level of analysis.

     If a candidate describes more than one ethical consideration in relation to one or more
     research studies, credit should be given only to the first ethical consideration described
     in relation to the first research study used.

     If a candidate describes an ethical consideration but with no link made to a research
     study at cognitive level of analysis, a maximum of [3 marks] should be awarded.

     If a candidate describes a study but there is no link to an ethical consideration,
     [0 marks] should be awarded.

Sociocultural level of analysis

3.   Explain why one particular research method has been used at the sociocultural
     level of analysis.                                                            [8 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section A markbands below when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of the
     reasons for the selected research method used at the sociocultural level of analysis.
     Responses might refer to the appropriateness of the method for the aim, issues of
     validity and reliability, sample choice and size, ease and cost of the procedure, and the
     generalizability of findings. Candidates may address the strengths of the method as
     well as how it reflects the principles of the sociocultural level of analysis, i.e. candidates
     could make clear how the selected research methods underpin one or more principles of
     the level of analysis.
     A variety of research methods are used, such as experiments, observations, case studies,
     questionnaires, and interviews. Whichever method is chosen, the question asks
     candidates to address why that method was used at this particular level of analysis.
     Although Festinger’s theory is about cognitive dissonance, his study is one of group
     behaviour. It is a relevant study to be used as an example for this question.
     If a candidate explains why more than one research method has been used, credit should
     be given only to the first explanation.
     If a candidate describes why a research method is used but with no link made to the
     sociocultural level of analysis, a maximum of [3 marks] should be awarded.
     If a candidate describes a study with no link to a research method and its use at the
     sociocultural level of analysis, [0 marks] should be awarded.

Section B assessment criteria

A — Knowledge and comprehension

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding that is of
              marginal relevance to the question. Little or no psychological research is used
              in the response.

4 to 6        The answer demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding relevant to the
              question or uses relevant psychological research to limited effect in
              the response.

7 to 9        The answer demonstrates detailed, accurate knowledge and understanding
              relevant to the question, and uses relevant psychological research effectively in
              support of the response.


B — Evidence of critical thinking: application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation

Marks         Level descriptor

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3        The answer goes beyond description but evidence of critical thinking is not
              linked to the requirements of the question.

4 to 6        The answer offers appropriate but limited evidence of critical thinking or offers
              evidence of critical thinking that is only implicitly linked to the requirements of
              the question.

7 to 9        The answer integrates relevant and explicit evidence of critical thinking in
              response to the question.


C — Organization

0             The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 2        The answer is organized or focused on the question. However, this is not
              sustained throughout the response.

3 to 4        The answer is well organized, well developed and focused on the question.

                                             SECTION B

4.   Discuss one evolutionary explanation of one behaviour.                                     [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review,
     supported by appropriate evidence, of one evolutionary explanation of one behaviour.

     Candidates must choose one behaviour to examine, such as:
      human mating behaviours (Buss)
      emotions – such as disgust (Fessler)
      depression (Andrews and Thompson)
      graffiti (Keizer)
      machismo (Geary).

     Candidates may look at the underlying assumptions. They may also evaluate the
     evidence in support of the explanation as well as discuss its strengths and limitations.
     Comparison with another explanation of the behaviour is also a plausible approach to
     this question, but the primary focus needs to be on the evolutionary argument.

     If a candidate discusses more than one evolutionary explanation of one or more
     behaviours, credit should be given only to the first explanation of the first behaviour.
                                                 –8–               M12/3/PSYCH/BP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


5.   Evaluate two models or theories of one cognitive process.                                   [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal of how well the
     two models or theories explain one cognitive process, by discussing their strengths and
     limitations. Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does
     not have to be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Possible models or theories of one cognitive process could include, but are not limited
     to:
      cue-dependency
      Gibson’s “bottom-up” theory
      multi-channel model of attention
      multi-store model of memory.

     Cognitive processes that may be considered include, but are not limited to:
      decision making
      memory
      perception
      attention.

     The two models or theories do not have to be compared or contrasted (e.g. identifying
     similarities and differences), but this approach could be used in a legitimate way if it
     serves to highlight the strengths and limitations of the two models or theories being
     evaluated by the candidate.

     Evaluation might include supportive or contrary findings, involvement of other
     factors (e.g. social, biological factors), cultural or gender issues, or methodological
     considerations.

     If a candidate evaluates more than two models of one cognitive process, credit should
     be given only to the evaluation of the first two models. However, other models or
     theories may be used to evaluate the two models or theories selected by the candidate.

     If a candidate evaluates two models of more than one cognitive process, credit should
     be given only to the evaluation of the first cognitive process.

     If a candidate evaluates only one model or theory, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [11 marks].

     If a candidate addresses only strengths or only limitations, the response should be
     awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks] for criterion B, critical thinking, and up to a
     maximum of [2 marks] for criterion C, organization. Up to full marks may be awarded
     for criterion A, knowledge and comprehension.
                                                 –9–              M12/3/PSYCH/BP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


6.   Discuss the use of two compliance techniques.                                              [22 marks]

     Refer to the paper 1 section B assessment criteria when awarding marks.

     The command term “discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered review,
     supported by appropriate evidence, that includes a range of arguments or factors related
     to the compliance techniques.

     Two compliance techniques should be discussed, such as:
      reciprocity
      foot in the door
      low balling
      door in the face
      bait and switch.

     Discussion may include the following points:
      factors that influence compliance
      efficacy of the techniques
      conditions under which techniques may be employed
      cultural considerations
      empirical evidence
      ethical considerations.

     If a candidate discusses more than two compliance techniques, credit should be given
     only to the discussion of the first two compliance techniques.

     If a candidate discusses only one compliance technique, apply the markbands up to a
     maximum of [11 marks].
