Answer three questions, each chosen from a different Section. Each question is worth [16 marks].

Section A     Style and formal qualities

      Give reasons for your opinion, and refer in your answer to at least two works.


2.    Select for discussion two artists or architects who looked beyond their own cultures for inspiration.
      To what extent did they succeed in integrating the style of “the other” into their own work?



Section B     Iconography and meaning

3.    “The artist must leave the beholder something to guess” (Ernst Gombrich). Discuss with reference
      to at least two works of art.


4.    Consider in detail how two separate artists of your choice have depicted an identical subject.
      Which version of the subject do you prefer and why?



Section C     Historical context and function

5.    Select for comparison two works of art that are no longer displayed in their original locations.
      Discuss the historical context in which these works were created, and how the change in location
      affects the viewer’s response.


6.    “All art is quite useless” (Oscar Wilde). Do you agree? Justify your answer with reference to
      at least two works of art or architecture.

      at least two commissions in your answer.



Section E      Techniques and materials
