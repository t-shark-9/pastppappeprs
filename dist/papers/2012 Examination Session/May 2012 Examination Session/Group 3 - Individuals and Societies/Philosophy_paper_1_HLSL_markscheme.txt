Optional Theme 1: Grounds of epistemology

3.   Explain and discuss the view that the truth of a proposition can only come from the way it is verified.

     This question invites an explanation and discussion of the claim that arises from developments in the
     empirical tradition that the truth of a statement is discovered when the method of verifying the statement is
     known. Answers can be both broad in scope in dealing with the general problem of establishing knowledge,
     or more narrowly focused on the specific account of meaning and truth raised by proponents
     of verificationism.

     Key Points
      Propositions as statements of knowledge and their relationship to the pursuit of knowledge and truth
      Verification as an approach to establishing criteria for knowledge
      The relationship between meaning and the truth value of a proposition/declaration
      The empiricist claim that meaning and truth are established through checking the origins of knowledge;
       the tabula rasa view of knowledge acquisition
      The contribution of empirical observation to verifying propositions
      Logical issues arising from the inductive method of empirical observation in verifying propositions
      Verifying through analysis of language
      Other approaches to establishing truth, e.g. non-Western ideas, religious approaches, authority,
       narrative traditions
      Coherence theories of truth vs. correspondence theories of truth

     Discussion
      Popper’s criticism of verificationism and its replacement by falsificationism
      The criticism that verificationism fails its own ability to be verified
      Wittgenstein’s language games
      The issue of analytic statements in propositions – are they no more than tautologies?

4.   Evaluate the claim that knowledge can be innate.

     This question invites an evaluation of the view that some (or all) knowledge has its origin prior to experience
     and is in some way innate in human beings. Answers might concentrate on specific claims about knowledge
     being inborn (or prior to birth) or might pursue the more general claim that knowledge comes prior to
     experience or through structures of the mind.

     Key Points
      The claims of rationalism about the origin of knowledge
      The counter-position of empiricism and the tabula rasa
      The status of knowledge that is claimed to be innate – the certainty of a priori knowledge compared with
       the contingent claims from experience gained a posteriori
      The notion of innate knowledge in radical theories that all knowledge can be accounted for from before
       birth, e.g. Plato, or that some knowledge can be implanted before birth, e.g. Descartes
      A priori knowledge as separate from sense experience, as opposed to specifically prior to it
      Examples of innate knowledge: the ideas of identity, perfection, the idea of God, branches of mathematics
      Hume’s claim that some innate ideas may be explained by tracing them back to original sense experience,
       e.g. God, morality, the continuity of the self
      Intuition, e.g. Russell, Moore
      Kant’s claims about categories and their role in structuring knowledge

     Discussion
      Can innate knowledge say anything about the world?
      Descartes’s certainty; the cogito
      The idea that mathematics describes an ultimate reality with the use of innate, a priori understanding
      Is a priori knowledge really only tautological?
      Hume’s fork; matters of fact and relations of ideas
      Scepticism about the senses
      Reactions to rationalism, e.g. Berkeley’s idealism
      Non-Western approaches to innate knowledge, e.g. religious and folk traditions
      Kant’s response to empiricism and to Hume’s challenge

Optional Theme 2: Theories and problems of ethics

5.   Evaluate the claim that there are some ethical principles that are universal.

     This question invites an evaluation of the dichotomy between relative and universal ethical principles.
     Any number of these principles might be explored.

     Key Points
      Moral relativism claims that the truth of moral judgments is relative to the conventions of a social group
       or even to the individual taste of the person issuing the judgment, and that these conventions or tastes are
       not themselves subject to any further justification
      Descriptive relativism is the social and cultural version promoted by anthropologists, while normative and
       meta-ethical relativism are proposed by philosophers
      Apart from the evidence of social anthropology, another proposed justification for moral relativism is
       from an emotional basis, i.e. emotive moral theory
      By contrast, deontological views posit some principle or being that is the foundation or source of moral
       truths. The guiding principles are either based on reason, duty, or faith. Regardless of what the moral
       judgments are, they are erroneous if the judgments are not based on these principles
      Ethical monism claims that there is some single ultimate feature whose presence makes right actions right
       and whose absence makes wrong actions wrong
      Ethical pluralism claims that there is no such single ultimate feature, but rather a small set of irreducible
       features whose presence or absence tends to make actions either right or wrong
      With universalism, correct moral reasoning must be understood in terms of abstracting particular cases
       within general moral principles. There is an assumption of rationality as the determining factor in moral
       judgments and actions
      Universal ethical theories may be based on arguments that appeal to the dignity of the self, e.g. modern
       monotheistic ethical theories, Western views of the autonomous individual, the Universal Declaration of
       Human Rights
      Social taboos about violence, incest and other cultural/historical examples used as evidence in support of
       universal ethical principles

     Discussion
      The concepts of absolute good and evil are essentially meaningless within a framework of moral
        relativism, and this seems counter-intuitive to beliefs about human nature
      Using anthropological and cultural evidence for and against universal ethical principles can produce
        examples to support either position, so, as a part of a philosophical argument, it has no value
      The possibility of moral progress
      A radical relativism would argue that the universality of reason is challenged by moral particularism,
        i.e. a rejection of the universalist requirement for moral reasoning that requires an abstraction or
        reification of particular cases within general principles
      Do documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights have any meaning or value for a moral
        relativist? Are these rights merely a Western view of rights and so, as such, are culturally determined?
                                                     – 13 –               M12/3/PHILO/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


6.   With reference to one or more example(s) from applied ethics, evaluate the claim that human beings
     are the sole concern of ethical theory and ethical action.

     This question invites an evaluation of the issue of the limits of practical ethics. Issues from any area of
     applied ethics might be considered relevant.

     Key Points
      The appropriate objects for moral concern: arguments for and against the claim may be based on common
       characteristics or qualities. With animal–human distinctions and similarities it may be rationality,
       ability to suffer, goal orientation, cognitive reciprocity etc. Arguments based on religious principles often
       rely on the intrinsic value of “all of God’s creatures”
      In environmental ethics, arguments may appeal to self-interest as well as intrinsic value or stewardship.
       Some arguments in favour of environmental protection invoke a state of nature model as justification.
       This usually involves a dependency, often connected to human identity and “self-realization”. Nature has
       a beneficent quality. As such, it often forms part of a broader argument on living a good life
      Utilitarian theory can be used to support the ethical principle that all sentient life forms deserve equal
       consideration. It can also be used as a principle for ignoring or denying action on environmental and
       animal issues
      Arguments for punishment, specifically arguments for capital punishment, often use the principle of
       lex talionis to justify punishment and the removal of moral value from the convicted criminal
      Bioethics is often concerned with the connected questions of the moral position or status, justification of
       treatment, and losses of moral consideration in a being’s own right, e.g. anencephalic infants, and those in
       a permanently comatose or vegetative state

     Discussion
      Why should moral terms and considerations be applied to sentient and non-sentient beings that are
        (generally) incapable of moral self-awareness and reciprocity? Why should I care for a rock as much as I
        do for a child?
      Arguments that privilege human survival over others are labelled speciesist by opponents, and apart from
        biblical injunctions, supporters of speciesism need to provide justifications. Most use an evolutionary
        justification, that of survival and natural selection
      Speaking for those incapable of speaking for themselves often assumes duty based ethics, or an intrinsic
        value concept of moral agency. Are these principles based on reason or emotion?
      Is it possible to speak of the moral value of a sentient being as removable, or on a sliding scale? What of
        non-sentient objects?
      Are “free market” solutions morally valid answers to the question of environmental protection? Are we
        de-humanized if we treat the environment as another commodity?
      Is it impossible to frame an ethical position in anything other than a human-centred perspective?
        Does this necessarily limit our sphere of moral concern?
      If reason alone is inadequate as a criterion for moral consideration, then what other qualities are
        necessary? Is it necessary for these other qualities to be empirically verifiable?

Optional Theme 3: Philosophy of religion

7.   Evaluate the claim that any proof for the existence of God is based on the experience of the individual.

     This question asks for an evaluation of religious experience as a basis for proof of the existence of God.
     The broader question of the elements for proof of God’s existence might also be discussed.

     Key Points
      Types of religious experience: mysticism, prayer, and miracles. These are often introspective experiences
       or events experienced directly. The direct experience claims of individuals are often distinguished from
       the more general claims of common experience, and common interpretations of these experiences
      Faith can be initiated by specific experiences, but it may also gradually develop over time as a
       consequence of rational thought and life experience, often as a means of explanation or for consolation in
       the face of suffering and death
      Proofs based on common experiential and interpretative foundations appeal to general or specific features
       of the world, e.g. cosmological arguments and teleological arguments
      Knowledge of God through a set of shared experiences
      Establishing the veracity of such personal and common claims; not merely the means of establishing
       empirical/verifiable evidence, but whether the search for such verification is possible, and what might
       constitute verifiable evidence
      The nature of individual and common experiences is perhaps indescribable, or beyond sensory perception,
       so that religious experience is essentially private and correspondingly non-communicable
      The possibility that a religious experience is not separate from other parts of life and, therefore, is in the
       realm of being able to be described and understood by direct language
      Proofs of God’s existence not based on direct personal experience: the a priori or ontological proofs of
       God’s existence. The advantage of these proofs over experiential proofs is that these proofs purport to
       show the necessity of God

     Discussion
      In contemporary society might a person who had a genuine encounter with a divine entity be dismissed as
        suffering from delusions?
      Is religious experience in fact a natural feature of human life? Is it the one aspect that makes us human?
      Is it necessary that religious experiences be, in some sense, cross-cultural?
      Has science made the idea of miracles obsolete? Are religious experiences explainable by unusual brain
        states or some sort of delusion?
      A mystical experience may be adequately explained in purely scientific terms; does this show that
        whatever it is, it does not constitute an experience of a supernatural reality? It is a basic principle of
        perception that we cannot be genuinely perceiving an entity that does not make a significant causal
        contribution to our perception of it
      We may not be in possession of such naturalistic or empirically based explanations. There are theoretical
        frameworks and perspectives such as psychoanalysis, or social and clinical psychology, that may provide
        an explanation for religious experiences
      Non-Western traditions about experience of God/gods
                                                    – 15 –              M12/3/PHILO/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


8.   To what extent is it possible to speak about religious ideas and practices without speaking about a
     particular culture?

     This question invites an assessment of the extent to which religious ideas and practices are products of
     cultural/historical determinants. It allows for the possible selection of any religious ideas or practices in
     developing an answer.

     Key Points
      Some concepts that might be used: salvation, atonement, sacrifice, resurrection, expiatory and
       propitiatory worship, immortality, reincarnation, religious-based ethics etc.
      Cultural influences: in monotheism, festivals based on agrarian cycles were eventually supplanted and
       incorporated into the religious cycle of worship
      In many indigenous cultures, the natural cycle is a religious idea or living entity with many forms and
       manifestations, e.g. Australian and American indigenous peoples worship creator spirits that shaped, and
       continue to shape, the landscape
      The abstraction of religious ideas is often linked to the birth of a written tradition within a culture.
       Furthermore, any sacred text requires an active interpretation and re-interpretation of that text within a
       social context for its meaning
      Religious language has often been characterized as a cosmological narrative, or a historical narrative, or
       moral discourse, or myth, and uses many literary techniques to capture the inexpressible nature of its
       content. It may be argued that these are all culturally-based categories and characteristics

     Discussion
      A common feminist critique of religion as a cultural practice is that religious ideas, language, images,
        narratives, and practices are framed from a predominantly male perspective
      If culture and religion are inexorably linked, does this make the existence of God problematic or does
        culture provide more evidence for God’s existence?
      If religious concepts and culture are necessarily connected, does this mean that reading and understanding
        sacred texts demands a historical understanding as much as a religious and philosophical one?
      What constitutes religious practice? Is it defined only when practised communally?
      If religious ideas are culturally determined, then what does a concept such as salvation mean?

Optional Theme 4: Philosophy of art

9.   Evaluate the view that beauty is an objective property of works of art.

     This question invites an evaluation of the possibility of aesthetic judgments being made on an objective or
     cognitive basis.

     Key Points
      The possibility of making aesthetic judgments
      Subjectivity vs. objectivity
      Beauty as an external, objective, real quality in the world which can be intrinsic in objects of art
      Plato’s world of the Forms and the link to the Form of the Good
      “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder”
      The possible objective basis of aesthetic judgments: metaphysical accounts and scientific/evolutionary
       accounts
      Beauty as the expression of certain qualities, e.g. unity, simplicity, pattern, symmetry
      Kant’s universal scope of aesthetic judgments and the role of imagination in judgments of taste
      Challenges to the objective reality of beauty; art as merely a subjective experience and taste
      Art as a clarification of emotion, with a purpose which can be judged objectively

     Discussion
      The difficulty of particular things representing an ideal like beauty
      The relation of particular objects to universal concepts
      The notion of form in art
      The ability of art to arouse emotion in appreciators – a measure of beauty
      Biological and psychological approaches to beauty
      Other interpretations of the value of art, e.g. political, functional, expressive
                                                      – 17 –              M12/3/PHILO/BP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


10.   To what extent is authenticity important to the judgment of what constitutes good art?

      This question invites an assessment of the role that authenticity plays in our judgments about works of art.
      Answers might also challenge the assumption in the question that any quality could help a work of art to
      be good.

      Key Points
       Authenticity understood as a true expression of the artist’s outlook or feelings
       Authenticity understood as offering a true representation of the real world
       Representational vs. abstract art
       Technical skill required in making authentic art
       The value of art deriving from its being an informative insight into the way the world is
       Plato and imitation
       Intrinsic and extrinsic notions of artistic value
       The role of the artist as opposed to the observer in art and vice versa
       Interpretation vs. literal representation; formal qualities of art vs. content
       Consideration of authenticity vs. emotional effects of works of art
       Expressionist theories of art vs. representationalist theories of art

      Discussion
       Examples of valued art being representational of reality, e.g. paintings, theatre, music, installations
       Kant’s aesthetic argument that emphasizes the experience of contemplation by the observer over the need
         for accurate representation by the artist
       Can art stand for reality?
       Who can judge the authenticity of a work of art and/or the artist?
       How can authenticity be judged except in a literal means of representation?
       Authentic art and art forgeries
       Art as primarily informative
       The notion of high art vs. naive/pop/folk art
       The political/social function of art in relation to judgments about good art

Optional Theme 5: Political philosophy

11.   Evaluate the idea that for punishment to be just its severity must reflect the gravity of the offence.

      This question invites an evaluation of the notion of a just punishment. Answers might be further developed
      with regard to other central issues or concepts, e.g. justice more generally, society, power.

      Key Points
       Notions of justice, law and punishment
       Corrective justice refers to that which is concerned with punishment, whereas distributive justice refers to
        that which is concerned with benefits and burdens other than punishments
       Usually just punishment should meet the following criteria: it should be imposed only on a properly
        convicted wrongdoer, and the amount of suffering should be according to the principle of proportionality
        (Brian Barry “Justice”)
       There is no agreement over the justification for punishment; this makes it controversial how seriousness,
        severity and culpability are assessed, and how the scale of penalties should be fixed
       The idea of natural law as a basis for justice and punishment

      Discussion
       Is the idea of just punishment self-evident?
       To what extent does the idea that punishment must reflect the seriousness of the offence, reflect a cultural
         tradition such as the lex talionis? If so, is it legitimate to transfer the idea to other cultures?
       How essential to punishment is the possibility of its quantitative measurement?
       The extent to which the very notions of just punishment and amount of punishment might be based on
         different value systems; are these affected by gender, class or other social determinants?
       Justice and punishment in present societies with an international character
       Justice and punishment in multicultural societies
       Are conventional positions on punishment able to justify punishment solely by means of rational
         argumentation?
       Punishment as a deterrent, for rehabilitation etc.

12.   Evaluate the idea that democracy is the best form of government.

      This question invites an evaluation of the theory and the practice of democracy. It is open to different lines
      of discussion and argument. It might be approached as a form of government or as a way of constituting the
      state following a social contract approach.

      Key Points
       Democracy as rule by the people, as contrasted with rule by a special person or group. It is a system of
        decision-making in which everyone who belongs to the political organism making the decision is actually
        or potentially involved; in theory all have equal power
       Distinctions between state, nation, government and civil society which might affect the understanding and
        realization of democracy in practice
       The role of democratic legislation is not to register citizens’ unconstrained preferences and let majority
        preferences rule, but to advance the interests of all citizens, so that each has the status of equal
        citizenship, is suitably independent, and can freely pursue his or her conception of the good consistent
        with justice
       Historical examples and forms in which democracy has been developed
       Forms of government: one-party democracy, multi-party democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, authoritarian
        and totalitarian rule, tribalism, theocracy
       The relation between the executive and those who are governed
       Social contract theories and modern notions of participatory democracy
       Contested understandings of “democracy”

      Discussion
       Can it be assumed that democracy is the best form of government?
       Is democracy morally superior to others forms of government?
       In what ways can the will of the people be expressed? E.g. representative or direct democracy
       Proportional voting systems vs. “first past the post” systems
       The place of minorities in democratic societies
       Is present day democracy a form of international obligation?
       Might, or should, democracy as a form of government be applied in any cultural setting?
       Is democracy as a form of government unavoidably linked to capitalism?
       Ideologies of government: liberalism, conservatism, Marxism and socialism

Optional Theme 6: Non-Western traditions and perspectives

13.   Explain and discuss philosophical ideas concerning self-fulfilment in one or more of the non-Western
      traditions you have studied.

      This question gives an opportunity to explain and discuss ideas, issues or approaches that relate to the notion
      of self-fulfilment in non-Western traditions.

      Key Points
       The approaches to self-fulfilment adopted by various non-Western traditions
       Some main issues: self/non-self, subjectivity/objectivity, selflessness, identity, self-denial,
        self-expression vs. self-extinction, individuals, their relationship to other living and non-living things,
        evolution of identity, the journey of the self
       A fundamental premise of the great majority of India’s religious and philosophical traditions:
        the combined beliefs in karma and rebirth, that is, the retributive power of actions and decisions of the
        individual, and a beginningless – though not necessarily endless – succession of births and deaths for
        living beings
       Basic contributions of Buddhism: a) a stricter notion of causality which postulates a pervasive coherence
        of karmic events, but insists on the feasibility of choice and responsibility; b) a notion of agency which
        defines the act as rooted in volition and decision; c) a radical notion of final liberation (nirvana) by
        eliminating the roots of karmic existence, that is, selfish desire and the illusion of the self
       According to Hinduism, in general, the joys and suffering of a human individual are of his or her own
        making; the destiny of the soul is immortality through self-realization
       Within Chinese Buddhist traditions each individual is constituted by his or her own karmic stream
       The relation of the individual to ancestors and the landscape in some native American traditions
       With self-fulfilment comes the related issue of self-denial

      Discussion
       The responsibility of the individual and the motivation for accepting the doctrine of rebirth
       The individual as an intrinsic and inseparable part of the universe, as a general characteristic of Eastern
         philosophic traditions
       Implications of individual freedom and responsibility for Buddhism; the threefold action: in thought,
         in speech and in deed
       Is selflessness the same as non-self?
       Is self-fulfilment compatible with the emptying/denial of the self?
       Is it always necessary to conceive of the self as a thing? A substance?
       Has multiculturalism made traditional notions of self-fulfilment obsolete?
       Monotheistic traditions look at the individual as a whole. On the one hand, he/she is required to submit to
         God, but, on the other, they teach freedom and therefore personal responsibility. Concepts of sin and
         perfectibility

14.   Explain and discuss the most important philosophical contribution(s) to an understanding of society
      and culture in one or more of the non-Western traditions you have studied.

      This question gives an opportunity to explain and discuss ideas, issues or approaches in relation to society
      and culture in at least one non-Western tradition.

      Key Points
       The social and cultural life and the performance of ritual actions: ritual speech has causal power,
        e.g. according to the Navajo conception speech relates consciousness with causality; it has causal power.
        Ritual language does what it says, it does not describe but it determines how things are, e.g. dispersing
        evil or eliminating illness
       The meanings of life within social and cultural contexts
       Oral traditions as forms of thought; examples of African traditions
       A categorial approach seems to be a characteristic of Amerindian thought and cultures: things in the
        cosmos or society are always affected by an unstable dualism
       The Red–White social binaries of the Creek confederacy and the Winter–Summer Tewa moieties are
        examples of the common dual forms of social and conceptual organization
       Forms of society and culture: for the Hopi, eagles are persons and reincarnations of clan ancestors
       Culture, other beings and nature: histories of personal relationships with animals and elements are
        frequent among shamans

      Discussion
       What roles do ancestors, the family, the tribe, the village and folklore play in non-Western moral
         traditions or perspectives?
       Adaptation and coexistence with modern societies or cultures
       The Western/non-Western interaction; relevance in political, economic, social and cultural contexts:
         African political philosophy in the twentieth century has been carried out under the influence of
         philosophical traditions from the European countries that colonized Africa and created her modern system
         of education
       The role of culture in relation to knowledge, meaning and value
       Do non-Western approaches to the self diminish the need to become effectively involved in everyday

Optional Theme 7: Contemporary social issues

15.   Evaluate the claim that the information age is not an age of freedom but an age of oppression.

      This question asks for an evaluation of the claim that more information and knowledge might not create
      freedom but rather establish mechanisms to oppress people both in an individual and a social context.

      Key Points
       The difference between information and knowledge; facts vs. judgment about facts
       The issue of choice; more information might increase the ability to make informed choices
       The accessibility of information might be controlled by income, location, social status
       The use and abuse of accessibility to information; propaganda, the role of media and politicians
       The relationship of information and knowledge to what is true
       The role of the internet compared to attending libraries
       Oppression resulting from information overload or misrepresentations of information
       Cultural difference in terms of the status and accessibility of information and knowledge; news giver,
        the wise person, the literate person, the reader
       Authoritarian societies that manipulate real and imaginary information, e.g. fascism of present and past
        states, Nineteen Eighty-Four and other dystopian views of the future
       The role of the state in restricting information for safety and security
       With information might come responsibility; I know, I need to know, I do not want to know
       Literacy and freedom

      Discussion
       How far is the information age restricted to certain sections of the world?
       Does the lack of freedom come from an issue of the selection and use of information?
       Has greater access to information democratized knowledge?
       Is the information age like any other categorization of technology, and its impact merely a reflection of
         wealth and status? E.g. those who had the sharpest flint in the stone age were dominant just as those with
         access to more information now become dominant
       Do the problems of abuse of information exist irrespective of how much information is possessed?
       Should any one person or institution control access to information?
       Does knowing less produce a situation of bliss from ignorance or just frustration?
       Is the idea of a knowledge-based society new, or were all past societies knowledge-based?
       Is it immoral to deprive people of access to knowledge?
       Should information be restricted so as to prevent harm?
       Is the status of knowledge in a society dependent upon other cultural values, such as belief?
       The significance of concentrations of ownership of media
       The significance of access to information via the internet and of its being subject to government control in
         various states

16.   Evaluate the claim that the right to work should be protected.

      This question invites an evaluation of the importance and value of work as one aspect of human activity.

      Key Points
       The right to work; rights and responsibilities
       The notion of work; purposeful activity compared to labour or play
       The psychological and social benefits of work
       The relationship of work to status and meaning in life
       The problem of unemployment
       The role of the state in maintaining work and creating work
       The relationship of work to the achievement of wealth
       Issues of alienation and types of work
       Work’s relationship to freedom or oppression; dependence on work for survival or work creating a means
        to achieve other human goals
       Work as a fundamental aspect of the human condition
       Christian concepts of work; the worker who increases production is to be rewarded
       Non-Western views of work; some cultures consider leisure a prime purpose in human activity
       Social responses to indolence
       The interaction of technology and work; technology changes the nature of work

      Discussion
       Is work a defining feature of being human?
       If a state ignores the need to work is it failing in one of its prime responsibilities?
       Does the state view work only as a means of revenue?
       Could the application of technology eventually eliminate work?
       Is it possible to have a social model that prevents alienation and exploitation in the realm of work?
       Should the state interfere in market forces that drive the amount and nature of work?
       Is work optional? Can a person or institution require you to work?
       Does a society based on work become hierarchical? Do people have higher status because of the type of
         work they do? To what extent do people who do not work lose their status, identity or the respect
         of others?
       Can one person’s work be another’s play?
       Is there a universal idea of work or is it linked to a cultural perspective?

        society, existentialist views, historical-method approaches
       Phenomenological methods of understanding humans and society: understanding humans as they appear
        and act as opposed to them having a specific nature or essence, e.g. Ortega y Gasset
       Immigration in various forms: economic migration, skills shortages, political asylum
       The role of tradition: national identity due to recent historical immigration, e.g. Australia, Canada,
        the USA

      primarily materialistic in its purpose and origin.

      Key Points
       Cultural evolution; how culture emerges
       Materialistic theories of the nature and origin of culture, including the economic and labour dominated
        approach of Marx and Engels
       The rejection of spiritual accounts of culture as emerging separately from man’s basic position in life

      Discussion
       Is culture the creation of an artificial environment to serve human material needs?
       How can spiritual dimensions be housed in culture but discussed philosophically?
       Biological accounts and human sciences accounts of culture; what is the difference?
       How significant to culture is technology?
       Is there a justification for studying culture scientifically, subjecting it to an assumption that it yields to a
         reductionist and predictive empirical methodology?
