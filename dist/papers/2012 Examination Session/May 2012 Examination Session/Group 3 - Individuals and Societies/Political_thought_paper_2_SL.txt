Read the extracts and then answer the question that follows:

EXTRACT A

There is one conception of democratically elected representatives that understands them to be mandated
[instructed] to vote this way or that, another which sees them as left to decide for themselves which way
they ought to vote. Merely drawing the distinction itself does not show which conception is to be preferred,
but there is good reason to prefer the latter to the former. It is not good enough for the representative simply
to pursue what his or her constituents want. That way, debate becomes nothing better than barter. At the time
of choosing their representatives the electors cannot know, and hence cannot know about, all the issues that
might be up for decision. And there is this further point: representatives must represent those who did not
vote for them as well as those who did, even though, obviously, they have not been mandated or instructed
by them. The delegate conception pursued to its logical conclusion would effectively disenfranchise all
those who found themselves on the losing side.

EXTRACT B

The education and character development of the citizen is encouraged by participation in the political
system. It improves the whole of society. Such a citizen democracy assumes greater involvement than
merely voting, with citizens taking an active part in the political system. “Direct democracy” is the means by
which this can come about and the time for direct democracy may have come. People are better educated and
have greater access to information, and have more wealth and leisure time than ever before. Representative
systems of democracy belong to a less democratic, less educated and less affluent age. Their constitutional
systems are increasingly viewed as museum pieces by their electorates, who become frustrated by the lack
of accountability of the government to the people. Their elected representatives, to put it politely, do not
seem to demonstrate a greater level of political judgment than the people they represent.

1.    Using information in extracts A and B and your own knowledge, examine critically the
      view that “democratically elected representatives” should be “left to decide for
      themselves which way they ought to vote”.                                                                [20 marks]

                                              SECTION B

Answer one question, making reference to the ideas of political thinkers where appropriate.

2.    Assess the view that the freedom of individuals depends upon their ability to choose
      between different alternatives.                                                         [20 marks]


3.    To what extent do individuals have a right to protest against laws with which
      they disagree?                                                                          [20 marks]


4.    “The idea of a society in which everyone is equal is unnatural and would result in
      terrible uniformity.” How far would you agree, or disagree, with this view and why?     [20 marks]
