Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain the economic factors which may encourage the formation of a monopoly.   [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that natural monopoly is a more desirable market structure
            than perfect competition.                                                       [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain why governments may view deflation as a threat.                         [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that a low and stable rate of inflation is beneficial for
            an economy.                                                                     [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the differences in the operation of fixed and floating exchange
            rate systems.                                                                   [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that any imbalance in the current account will be corrected
            automatically under a freely floating exchange rate system.                     [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain how three of the following factors may act as barriers to development
            in a less developed country:

               capital flight
               income inequality
               ineffective taxation structure
               lack of infrastructure.                                                     [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that foreign direct investment (FDI) is the key factor in
            determining whether a developing country will be able to achieve economic
            growth and development.                                                         [15 marks]
