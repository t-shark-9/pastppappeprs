Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
e.g. “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

(b)   (i)    The database will allow teachers to export data to a spreadsheet.

             Explain one reason why teachers would export data from the database
             to a spreadsheet.                                                   [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
              Reason: exported data in spreadsheet format may be shared with
               other users
               Explanation: some users cannot work with a database but do work with a
               spreadsheet or do not have the database software
              Reason: exported data can be shared without having to share all data in
               the database i.e. data to be shared is selected
               Explanation: exported file size smaller / avoid sharing unnecessary data
              Reason: exported data may need calculations
               Explanation: these special functions and formulae are present in
               spreadsheet software and not in database software.

             Do not accept answers that refer to “user friendly” or “easier to use”.
             Award [1 mark] for one reason identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate
             explanation of that reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      (ii)   The new database will also require teachers to undertake training to be
             able to use it.

             A local company is offering to train users in the use of the new system.
             The two options proposed are:
              online training
              face-to-face training.

             Contrast the two options.                                                    [4 marks]

(c)   The following screen shows the options this database will have in its online
      version.

      When the system was purchased it was possible to include a Virtual Private
      Network (VPN), giving remote access to teachers to this database, which is
      stored on the school’s server.

      Discuss the impact for the school of the decision to allow teachers remote
      access to the school server.                                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Positive impacts for the school – “school includes teachers, administrators
      and students”
       school may bring deadlines forward because teachers will be able to work after
        school from home
       school will provide a better service for students if teachers can access students’
        records from home to do follow-ups, upload homework, update the
        calendar etc.

      Negative impacts for the school – “school includes teachers, administrators
      and students”
       some teachers may have difficulty meeting deadlines because their connection
        from home may not be as good as needed to work with the software
       teacher dissatisfaction – there may be more expectation on teachers to work in
        the evenings on school-related tasks
       teachers may request extra compensation because they are expected to work
        from home
       teachers may not feel comfortable with the use of IT and may need training
       school will now have the responsibility to have the system running after school
        hours and provide some support / provision for failure; IT support available
        after school, robust servers, hacker protection
       school will have to provide teachers with the hardware such as laptops and,
        additional software to use the VPN from outside of school
       some teachers may not log out of the network when away from school which
        may present security issues.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

2.   Home network

     (a)   (i)    Identify four advantages of using a home local area network (LAN)
                  rather than several stand alone computers.                        [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   hardware resources may be shared (e.g. printers, hard disks)
                   internet connection may be cheaper for a LAN than for a number of
                    standalone computers
                   computers can connect to the resources wirelessly and avoid having
                    cables around the house
                   software resources may be shared (e.g. antivirus)
                   files may be shared between computers without the need of external
                    memory devices to transfer them from one computer to the other
                   internet security is easier to take care of if only one internet connection is
                    available to be shared between home users
                   backups can be made using different computers as copying files between
                    them is simple.

                  Award [1 mark] for each advantage identified up to a maximum of
                  [4 marks].

           (ii)   James and James IT will only deal with the installation of equipment in
                  the house for the local area network (LAN). The family will have to
                  contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP) they wish to use.

                  Describe the role of the ISP.                                                      [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                   ISP provides internet access to the LAN
                   ISP has access to an internet backbone to provide its user with internet
                    access
                   ISP provides bandwidth to users for internet access.

                  Award [1 mark] for the role identified and award [1 mark] for the
                  description of the role. Award a maximum of [2 marks] for the answer.

(b)   James and James IT have given the family a choice of a wireless network,
      a wired network, or a mixture of both.

      The Perez family have chosen to have a combination of wireless and wired
      networks.
      See the diagram below.

      Explain the decision of the Perez family to install a mixed network.               [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Reasons to have a wired component
       family may already have a standalone computer with no possibility of
        wireless access
       family may want a computer with wired access to the LAN to guarantee faster
        connection to transfer large files
       some peripherals are more reliable when wired.

      Reasons to have a wireless component
       new computers can be added without the need to add cabling
       allows mobility around the house
       visitors may use their laptops/palm/ipods when visiting.

      Reasons to have a mixed network
       users may choose to use wired or wireless computers depending on the type of
        work they need to do (e.g. for extensive backups the use of a wired connection
        may allow faster transfer)
       they may have one central area for the wired computer and main peripherals
        (e.g. printers) and allow other users to choose where to work in the house.

      The response must explain the need for both wireless components/network and
      wired components/network. If only one type of component/wired have been
      addressed, the maximum that can be awarded is [3 marks].

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4 marks]
      A partial explanation that demonstrates some knowledge and understanding of
      the topic. Some relevant examples are used within the response. There is some
      use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the response.

      [5–6 marks]
      A detailed explanation of the issue which demonstrates thorough knowledge and
      understanding of the topic. Relevant examples and appropriate ITGS terminology
      are used throughout the response.

(c)   The Perez family were concerned about having a peer-to-peer (P2P) network
      at home and decided to ask James and James IT to convert their peer-to-peer
      network to a client-server network.

      Evaluate this decision.                                                                           [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Advantages of P2P at home
       no dedicated server – all computers are work stations
       less expensive as most operating systems have the software required by default
       easy to install and maintain
       good file, printer and CD-ROM sharing.

      Disadvantages of P2P at home
       slow – computer resources may be shared by the computer user and by other
        users requesting access to the workstation
       no good for database applications
       not as secure as client-server as security is handled by individual work stations
       less reliable (server is workstation)
       limited expandability
       software needs to be installed in each computer.

      Advantages of client-server network at home
       tends to have faster access speed
       expandable – new peripherals or more computers can be connected to the LAN
       will work with any application
       handles shared database applications
       more reliable (dedicated server)
       highest level of security as security is handled by the server
       upgrading software/files is easier as this only needs to be done on one
        computer and is shared by all.

      Disadvantages of client-server network at home
       needs dedicated server
       more expensive to buy
       more expensive to maintain
       needs someone to take care of the installation and maintenance and to assign
        levels of access (if this is a family member, there could be disagreements)
       might require a special area in the house with security to keep the file server
       if the server fails then data will not be available for users and may cause family
        problems with members not being able to do their work.

                  Answers may include:
                   communication in which information is received at (or nearly at) the time
                    it is sent
                   is synonymous with “live communication”
                   uses a direct path between the source and the destination
                   data goes from source to destination without being stored anywhere
                   often used for communication between people in different locations.

                  Award [1 mark] for any of the points stated above up to a maximum of
                  [2 marks].

           (ii)   After an accident an image of an x-ray of a badly broken leg was taken
                  in bitmap format. To ensure the resolution was clear/high enough for a
                  doctor to see the extent of the injuries, the image size was 12 MB
                  (Megabyte). The connection the doctor will be using has a speed of
                  240 kb/s (kilobit per second).

             Situation in telemedicine better suited to real-time data transfer:
              doctors guiding an operation in a remote location (robotic operation) –
                he will need to have the information such as blood pressure or oxygen
                levels in blood in real-time during the operation
              an ambulance at an accident – paramedics may need real-time data such
                as heart rate of the patient(s).

             Award [1 mark] for situations similar to those stated above. Award an
             additional [1 mark] for a reason why specific data needs to be transferred
             in real time.

             N.B. In this situation “store and forward” is used to refer to “delayed data
             transfer” where it is saved on a device or server until it can be sent.

             Situation in telemedicine better suited to store and forward data
             transfer:
              doctors in remote locations may not have a permanent internet
                connection – X-ray files, or similar, will be stored at the server and
                transferred when the internet connection is available
              situations that might not need immediate response or do not need to have
                all the participants available simultaneously – data can be digitized, sent
                and transferred only when recipient accepts it for clinical consultation
                rather than for a hospital visit.

             Award [1 mark] for situations similar to those stated above. Award an
             additional [1 mark] for a reason why the specific data needs store and
             forward data transfer.
             Award a maximum of [4 marks] for this question.

      (ii)   Many mobile devices use store and forward to manage data transfer.

             Explain one reason for using store and forward by such devices.                  [2 marks]

             Answers may include:

               and the message will be kept in the server until the mobile phone appears
               as available. Otherwise the message would be lost
              exchange server stores messages and prioritizes their delivery
              mobile devices use different networks so routing messages through an
               exchange server allows it to be sent to the destination.

       video conferences can be recorded for later review
       more patients may be treated by the same doctor as there is no need for the
        doctor to have to travel between patients.

      Disadvantages
       equipment for videoconferencing is needed
       time may be a problem if doctors are in a different time zone
       doctors do not get to “see” and touch the patient, must trust doctor in remote

(b)   The data collected can be used to develop models of traffic flow at various
      times of the day and in various situations such as during periods of
      heavy snow. Information from these models is used to manage traffic flows
      on major roads and will determine what decisions need to be made in
      controlling traffic on a day-to-day basis.

      Analyse the decision to use these models to manage traffic flow.                      [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
       information from sensors may be mapped and speed signs on the road may
        vary their speed allowance according to the traffic flow
       traffic lights may be programmed to receive this information and adjust the
        times between the change of lights
       information systems provide data that can be mapped to improve traffic
        management (e.g. graphs, maps, diagrams)
       information can be used to predict peak hour traffic or traffic on certain dates
        which allows planning ahead and road usage
       city growth (e.g. building of roads or implementation of transport systems) can
        be done using information provided by these models – provides information for
        the justification of potential future developments such as bypasses,
        roundabouts, traffic lights, pedestrian crossings
       model may be dynamic and allow for real-time adjustment to facilitate
        traffic flow
       may provide additional benefits such as law enforcement linked to registration
        plates of vehicles
       model may require a significant amount of data to be accurate
       the range of scenarios may be limited, or events that need traffic management
        occur so infrequently that the traffic management system may not provide any
        additional value
       traffic management system will still require human input in many cases to
        instigate changes
       the management of traffic may involve buying expensive equipment to install
        in many locations – cost and planning involved
       the installation of the system may involve training of specialists to program and
        maintain the system and equipment – cost and time involved
       a power failure/failure in the sending of information may cause a huge
        traffic problem
       large volume of cars on the roads can only be managed by an automated
        system and if it fails it may take hours to get the traffic back to normal
       accidents may be identified faster and help sent to the location immediately
       citizens may be more reluctant to break traffic laws as these actions may be
        easily detected and fines applied.

      Answers may include:
      Advantages
       motorists will have to follow traffic rules as breaking rules may result in an
        automatic fine – transgressions are easily spotted
       control by the police department will make traffic violations decrease and make
        driving safer
       accidents will be reported immediately and action can be taken to save lives
        and solve traffic jams.

      Disadvantages
       information may be used for other purposes e.g. tracking people
       police department database may not be secure and could be accessed
        by hackers
