Paper 3 assessment criteria

A    Expression

      Has the student formulated the response in an organized way?
      How clear and precise is the language used by the student?
      To what extent is the language appropriate to philosophy?

       Achievement     Descriptor
          Level
            0          The student has not reached level 1.
            1          The student expresses some basic ideas but it is not always clear what the response is
                       trying to convey. The use of language is not appropriate to philosophy.
             2         The student presents some ideas in an organized way. There is some clarity of
                       expression but the response cannot always be followed. The use of language is not
                       always appropriate to philosophy.
             3         The student presents ideas in an organized way and the response can be easily followed.
                       The use of language is appropriate to philosophy.
             4         The student presents ideas in an organized and coherent way and the response is clearly
                       articulated. The use of language is effective and appropriate to philosophy.
             5         The student presents ideas in an organized, coherent and incisive way, insights are
                       clearly articulated and the response is focused and sustained. The use of language is
                       precise and appropriate to philosophy.

             4          The student demonstrates good evidence of identifying pertinent issues raised in
                        the text. Appropriate examples or illustrations are used in support of exploring the
                        issues. The student draws on some experience of doing philosophy throughout the
                        course in exploring the issues raised in the text.
             5          The student demonstrates precise evidence of identifying pertinent issues raised in
                        the text. Examples or illustrations are well chosen and are compelling in support of
                        exploring the issues. The student draws insightfully on the experience of doing
                        philosophy throughout the whole course in exploring the issues raised in the text.

Unseen text – exploring philosophical activity

This paper consists of an unseen text to which candidates are required to write a response. The purpose of the
exercise is to allow candidates to reflect upon and explore the nature, function, methodology and meaning of
philosophical activity as presented in the text, relating this to the candidate’s experience of doing philosophy
throughout the whole course. Responses might reflect this in very different ways, giving examples which draw
from the candidate’s experience of exploring philosophical activity throughout the whole course. The following
points – referring to the text extract – might be included in a response, but they are neither exhaustive nor
prescriptive.

Key Points
 Many people think about philosophical problems without referring to the long tradition of their discussion
  by philosophers
 Examples of typical philosophical problems: what really exists? Does life have any meaning etc.?
 The philosophical raw material of these problems comes directly from the world and our relation to it
 Philosophy centrally lies in certain questions which the reflective human mind finds naturally puzzling
 The best way to begin the study of philosophy is to think about the questions directly without recourse to the
  answers provided by others; once you have done that, you are in a better position to appreciate the work of
  others who have tried to solve the same problems
 Philosophy is different from science; it does not rely on experiments or observation
 Philosophy is different from mathematics; it has no formal methods of proof
 Philosophy is done by asking questions, arguing, trying out ideas and thinking of possible arguments
  against them
 The main concern of philosophy is to question and understand very common ideas that all of us use every day
  without thinking about them
 The philosopher’s questioning is distinct from the historian’s, mathematician’s, physicist’s and psychologist’s
 Philosophical investigation aims to push our understanding of the world and ourselves a bit deeper
 The best way to learn about philosophy is to think about particular questions; the nine questions
 Philosophers disagree, and there are more than two sides to every philosophical question
 Nagel’s aim (in the book) is not to give answers, but to introduce the problems
 Before learning a lot of philosophical theories it is better to get puzzled about the philosophical questions which
  those theories try to answer

Discussion
 Is there a fixed order or “best way” to begin the study of philosophy e.g. first to think about the question directly
   and afterwards to appreciate the work of others? Is it not possible to carry out both simultaneously?
 Is this approach to philosophy as “natural” as it seems to be?
 Are there any kinds of assumptions in it?
 Does the passage encourage a kind of individualistic or even solipsistic approach to philosophy?
 Does Nagel consider infantile questioning to be philosophical?
 Does this approach to philosophy presuppose a certain kind of personality, or is it open to different classes,
   groups or types of person?
 Is philosophy as portrayed in the text an activity for anyone or only for some? If the latter, should it be so?
 Should philosophy only be concerned with mainly intellectual activities, e.g. questioning, arguing, constructing
   concepts? Or might it be open to, or related to, other human dimensions such as being open to different values,
   fostering emotions etc.? E.g. Greek classical philosophers emphasized the development of admiration towards
   reality or being
 Comparison with other views or possible approaches to philosophy, e.g. continental European, non-Western,
   feminist, other contemporary critical positions
 The more basic the question the fewer tools there are to help answer it
 Ways in which Nagel’s approach might be further developed or applied
 Issues raised in the text in the light of doing philosophy throughout the whole course, e.g. the study of the
   prescribed text and Nagel’s position regarding the history of thought, the starting point and range of questions
   deemed to be philosophical, the differences between philosophical questioning and that deployed in other areas,
   the personal experience of philosophical questioning during the course
