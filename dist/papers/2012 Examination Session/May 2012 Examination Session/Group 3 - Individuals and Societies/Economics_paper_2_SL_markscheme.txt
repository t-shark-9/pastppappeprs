                       (or price and/or output) is determined by one of the following:
                        demand and supply
                        price mechanism
                        producers and consumers.

(b)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain the possible effect on the market for
      cigarettes of the ban on tobacco advertising in Ireland.                    [4 marks]

       1   Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
           For drawing a demand/supply diagram of the cigarette market showing a
           decrease in demand and a resulting decrease in price and fall in the
           equilibrium quantity or for providing an explanation that a ban on
           advertising would lead to a decrease in demand, leading to a decrease in
           price and fall in the equilibrium quantity.

       2   Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
           For drawing a demand/supply diagram of the cigarette market showing a
           decrease in demand and a resulting decrease in price and fall in the
           equilibrium quantity and for providing an explanation that a ban on
           advertising would lead to a decrease in demand, leading to a decrease in
           price and fall in the equilibrium quantity.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      Candidates who interpret this as a market failure question may use MSB/MSC
      analysis. MPB shifts left towards MSB as a result of the ban on advertising.
      The effect on the market could be a reduction in the welfare loss. A candidate
      who selects this approach and does not refer to the change in price may
      nevertheless be fully rewarded.

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

      For a market failure diagram, the vertical axis may be price, but could be costs or
      benefits. The horizontal axis is quantity. A title is not necessary.

(c)   Using an appropriate diagram, explain why, if the demand for cigarettes is
      inelastic, raising the price may not be effective.                         [4 marks]

       1    Identification of appropriate theory                                             1–2
            For drawing a demand diagram of the cigarette market showing an inelastic
            demand curve so that an increase in price has a proportionately small effect
            on the quantity demanded or for an explanation that with inelastic demand
            an increase in price will cause a proportionately lower change in quantity
            demanded, thus not working to effectively discourage smoking.

       2    Correct application of appropriate theory                                        3–4
            For drawing a demand diagram of the cigarette market showing an inelastic
            demand curve so that an increase in price has a proportionately small effect
            on the quantity demanded and for an explanation that with inelastic demand
            an increase in price will cause a proportionately lower change in quantity
            demanded, thus not working to effectively discourage smoking.

      Candidates who incorrectly label diagrams can be rewarded with a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      The use of P and Q on the axes is sufficient for a demand and supply diagram.
      A title is not necessary.

      For full marks, candidates must make it clear that the change in quantity
      demanded is relatively (proportionately) smaller than the change in price. It is not
      enough to explain in terms of small changes in quantity demanded with no
      comparison to the change in price.

      A maximum of [2 marks] may be awarded for an answer which rests on the
      assumption that the demand for cigarettes is perfectly inelastic.

      If a candidate has incorrectly labelled the diagram in part (b) and been awarded a
      maximum of [3 marks], then they may achieve full marks in this part of the
      question, if the labelling mistake has been repeated.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate the economic effects of the imposition of a minimum price for
      cigarettes.                                                            [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
       an explanation and/or a diagram of minimum prices
       an observation that minimum prices are usually set to protect producers, but in
        this case it is being used to solve a market failure.

      Arguments for:
       cigarettes are a demerit good and so their consumption should be reduced
       a higher price could discourage people from smoking (paragraph )
       the imposition of a minimum price could save lives (paragraph )
       the costs of health care could be reduced
       negative externalities such as passive smoking will be reduced
       a higher price will particularly discourage young people (paragraph ), whose
        demand is likely to be more elastic because they earn lower incomes.

      Arguments against:
       informal (parallel/underground/black) markets may appear, reducing the
        effectiveness of the minimum price
       demand for cigarettes is inelastic, so relatively few consumers will be
        discouraged from smoking (paragraph )
       retailers may suffer through fewer sales
       a minimum price may be difficult to enforce
       the option of increasing indirect tax on tobacco may be more effective and adds
        to state resources for implementing alternative policies (paragraph )
       state financing of education campaigns, persuasion through further advertising,
        provision of medical advice and counselling support may be better than
        minimum price
       price controls reduce freedom of choice for consumers and producers
       the cost of living will increase for consumers who buy cigarettes
       distributional effects because lower income households’ real incomes will fall
        more.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,

      Responses may include:
       a definition of current account deficit
       a need to attract sufficient surplus in capital/financial account to balance the
        CAD
       the impact a surplus on the financial/capital account will have on the net
        foreign debt
       a need to pay interest on the net foreign debt
       the impact this interest payment will have on the incomes section of the current
        account
       the consequent impact of this for future current account balances
       a continued CAD is likely to deplete a country’s currency reserves
       negative net exports may reduce aggregate demand and therefore hinder
        growth and increase unemployment
       the CAD as a percentage of GDP is low and hence it may be argued that the
        continuing CAD is not a problem (Table 1 and 2)
       it may be argued that many imports are needed for later stages of production
        and not current consumption (Table 1)
       it may be argued that the CAD represents a failure to export enough to cover
        the cost of imports
       it may be argued that the continuing CAD may weaken the currency thus
        offsetting the effects of the appreciation of the peso (Para 5)
       it may be argued that the continuing CAD may require the government to
        impose a contractionary fiscal or monetary policy therefore lowering GDP
        further (fallen by 6.6 % in 2009 Table 1)

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences

      Responses may include:
       a definition of debt crisis
      Possible policies:
       tighter fiscal discipline which may include cuts to welfare spending
        (paragraph ):
        – will reduce the budget deficit
        – may reduce the need to borrow funds
        – may increase the incentive to work to maintain the same standard of living
        – will reduce aggregate demand and further increase unemployment
        – is likely to worsen the distribution of income and wealth
        – may bring debt level closer to EU limit of 60 % (paragraph)
       increased taxation (paragraph ):
        – will reduce the budget deficit
        – may reduce incentives to work
        – may reduce the need to borrow funds
        – may reduce disposable incomes of consumers
        – may reduce consumer spending, business investment and hence aggregate
            demand
        – may reduce economic growth
       raising the retirement age (paragraph ):
        – will reduce government spending on the old age pension
        – may reduce the budget deficit
        – may reduce the need for government to borrow
        – is likely to increase the number in the labour force
        – may impact on wage rates and the numbers unemployed
        – may increase government revenue from taxation as workers working longer
       financial assistance from other European countries or the EU or IMF
         (paragraph ):
        – may provide a short term solution to the debt crisis
        – may allow the countries in crisis some time in which to readjust their fiscal
            and monetary policies
        – may lead to higher taxation in the donor countries
        – may discourage fiscal discipline as other countries or the EU are taking
            responsibility for solving the crisis
        – may lead to strict conditions being imposed with regard to budget deficits
            and liberalization of markets etc. (similar to Structural Adjustment
            Programs)
       tighten monetary policies (paragraph ):
        – likely to involve higher interest rates
        – likely to discourage borrowing with consequent negative effects on
            consumption spending and investment spending
        – may reduce economic growth.

        Effective evaluation may be to:

         examine the impact on different stakeholders
         discuss advantages and disadvantages
         prioritize the arguments.

           For drawing a correctly labelled circular flow diagram showing that the
           investment due to the borrowed micro-credit funds is an injection into the
           circular flow of income or for explaining that micro-credit schemes will
           increase investment, which is an injection into the circular flow. This will
           increase AD and so there will be increased economic activity.

           For drawing a correctly labelled poverty cycle diagram including investment
           or for explaining that micro-credit loans fill the savings/investment gap and
           allow the poverty cycle to be broken, increasing incomes and therefore
           reducing the worst aspects of poverty.

(d)   Using information from the text/data and your knowledge of economics,
      evaluate micro-finance as a means of promoting economic development.  [8 marks]

      Responses may include:
      Possible advantages:
       allows even those in poverty to borrow funds (paragraph )
       has allowed many women to borrow funds (paragraph  and )
       allows individuals to establish businesses such as tailors and hairdressers
         (paragraph )
       allows more people to be employed
       allows higher incomes
       allows more savings to occur – fills the savings gap and breaks the cycle
       increased incomes allow the purchase of more goods and services and hence
         improved standards of living
       releases potential entrepreneurship.

      Possible disadvantages:
       some lenders are very focused on making profits for themselves
         (paragraph )
       some large firms have moved into the business of micro-finance
       small loans may not assist some to escape poverty as some do not have the
         necessary entrepreneurial skills (paragraph )
       in some cases high rates of interest of up to 125 % (paragraph ) are charged
       some loans involve exploitation of borrowers (paragraph )
       some of the loan costs are hidden from borrowers
       increasing micro-finance rates has pushed up interest rates across Mexico
         (paragraph )
       micro-finance banks are not putting their profits into development, which is
        restricting the process of economic development (paragraph )
       micro-finance on its own may not be sufficient as a means to promote
        economic development – other policies will also be needed.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach which if
      appropriate, should be rewarded.

      If there is no direct reference to the text/data, then candidates may not be
      rewarded beyond level 2.
