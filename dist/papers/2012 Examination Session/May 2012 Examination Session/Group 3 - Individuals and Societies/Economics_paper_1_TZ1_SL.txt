Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain the possible economic advantages to consumers that arise from living in
            a free market economy.                                                                   [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the economic implications of a government policy to provide merit
            goods free of charge.                                                                    [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain why countries measure national income.                                           [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that demand-side policies are the most effective method of
            increasing the level of national income.                                                 [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the difference between expenditure-switching and expenditure-reducing
            policies for a government facing a current account deficit.                              [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that it is never desirable for countries to resort to protectionism.   [15 marks]


4.    (a)   Explain how three of the following factors may act as barriers to development
            in a less developed country:

               capital flight
               income inequality
               ineffective taxation structure
               lack of infrastructure.                                                              [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that foreign direct investment (FDI) is the key factor in
            determining whether a developing country will be able to achieve economic
            growth and development.                                                                  [15 marks]
