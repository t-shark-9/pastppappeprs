       use of a tariff diagram to illustrate the costs of protectionism
       arguments against the view in terms of the drawbacks of free trade
        – the problem of free trade between unequal partners
        – impact on LDCs’ efforts to diversify
       arguments against the view in terms of specific justifications of
        protectionism
        – infant industry argument
        – employment arguments
        – protection of the balance of payments

        – anti-dumping
        – strategic arguments
       reference to short-term/long-term effects of protectionism
       evaluation of above arguments.

      Effective evaluation may be to:
       consider short-term versus long-term consequences
       examine the impact on different stakeholders
       discuss advantages and disadvantages
       prioritize the arguments.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which if appropriate, should be rewarded.
