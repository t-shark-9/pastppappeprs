Answer one question from this section.

1.    Safe Passage (SP)

      Trent Peters is one of seven partners at Safe Passage (SP). It provides bodyguard* services to
      film stars, politicians and other important people in Europe and the Americas. Trent would like to
      satisfy a growing demand from Asia but has to choose from two options for the recruitment and
      training of bodyguards. These are:
      • offshoring by setting up it’s own overseas branch in Asian country X or Y or Z
      • subcontracting by using an external agency in Asian country X or Y or Z.

      The forecast costs and revenues of offshoring are given below (all figures in US$ millions):

(Question 1 continued)

      The three suitable Asian countries are located in earthquake zones. An earthquake expert assured
      Trent that all three areas are safe. Trent is concerned and decides to prepare a contingency plan for
      each possible location in Asia.

      Control over recruitment and training of bodyguards is vital to SP. Customer service and trust are
      their unique selling propositions (USP). Clients will pay high fees to ensure their safe transport to
      concerts, meetings and important events. However, Trent is refusing valuable contracts in Asia due
      to a lack of suitably trained bodyguards. As a result SP is missing out on large profits.

      Trent has mentioned to a previous customer of his plans to subcontract the recruitment and training
      of bodyguards. She has threatened not to use SP again and would tell her friends if the plans
      went ahead. Trent is concerned as word-of-mouth promotion is crucial to SP.

      He calls a meeting of all the partners. Three partners prefer subcontracting the recruitment and
      training as it is cheaper, quicker and less risky. The three other partners prefer offshoring.
      They believe that subcontracting will damage SP’s USP. They argue that the higher costs of
      offshoring will be covered by the forecast high revenue.


      (a)   Describe two features of a partnership.                                               [4 marks]

      (b)   Explain two benefits and one cost to SP of preparing a contingency plan of the
            three possible locations in Asia.                                                     [6 marks]

      (c)   (i)    Construct a fully labelled decision tree and calculate the predicted outcome
                   of each offshoring option (show all your working).                             [6 marks]

		          (ii)   Comment on the value for SP of using a decision tree as a decision-making
                   tool.                                                                          [3 marks]

      (d)   Examine two disadvantages for SP of subcontracting its recruitment and training
            of bodyguards.                                                                        [6 marks]

2.    GF

      Barbara Johnson manages a small business (GF) that produces and sells gluten-free* bread.
      GF has been recognized for meeting national quality standards for gluten-free bread which has helped
      increase sales. Local supermarkets sell their own label brands of gluten-free bread which do not meet
      national quality standards at a price 20 % cheaper than GF. Barbara aims to make national quality
      standard gluten-free bread more affordable and in larger batches.

      GF has 21 employees. Four are gluten-sensitive (intolerant) testers who check the quality of the
      final bread. This traditional method of quality control is important, but takes significant time
      and resources.

      Several hospitals have asked if GF can provide them with an additional 1200 loaves of gluten-free
      bread every day for the next year. Barbara is keen, however in a small market like this, becoming
      larger does not automatically result in economies of scale. GF’s suppliers cannot provide larger
      quantities of gluten-free flour without increasing their prices and consequently GF’s costs.

      Barbara has two options:
      • Option 1: Increase GF’s production of gluten-free bread and maintain national quality
         standards by introducing total quality management (TQM) control at a one-off cost of $4000.
         This should also speed up the batch production process.
      • Option 2: Buy-in the additional 1200 loaves from the company that supplies the
         local supermarkets and then sell this bread to the hospitals. However this supplier uses flow
         production and does not meet national quality standards.

      The sales price per loaf of GF bread is $6.80 regardless of the option chosen.

      Barbara prepared the following figures for each option (in $):

      Option 1: Increase GF’s production to make the additional 1200 loaves.

       Fixed costs:
       one-off cost from introducing TQM                        4000
       Semi-variable costs:
       additional electricity costs                             2000 + an additional 0.20 per loaf baked
       Variable costs:
       additional gluten-free flour                             0.80 per loaf
       overtime pay for staff                                   0.40 per loaf

      Option 2: Buy-in the additional 1200 loaves.

       loaves from local supermarkets’ supplier

		          (ii)   Using relevant information given, calculate whether GF should either
                   buy-in the additional 1200 loaves from the local supermarkets’ supplier,
                   or make the loaves themselves (show all your working and state any
                   assumptions you make).                                                     [5 marks]

		          (iii) Comment on whether GF should make or buy-in the additional

      (e)   Analyse two reasons why GF should move from traditional quality control
            methods to a TQM approach.                                                        [6 marks]

                                              SECTION B

Answer two questions from this section.

3.    The $1.99 toy shop

      James Lai’s toy shop is popular with no toy priced above $1.99. The toy shop uses psychological
      pricing at a level much lower than its competitors. James imports 90 % of his stock from China.
      It is located in a poor part of the city centre. Its target market is low-income families. The shop
      is very busy at weekends with a long queue (line) at the one cash register. Most employees are
      teenagers, who are very low paid.

      Several stakeholder groups have complained:
      • parents are concerned about the quality and safety of the toys and have set up an online social
        networking web site urging people to stop purchasing from the shop
      • older customers have complained about the long queue at the one cash register
      • one employee representative (union official) contacted James about employing teenagers on very
        low wages
      • local toy manufacturers have questioned James’ use of Chinese suppliers.

      Competitors have argued that the $1.99 toy shop’s psychological pricing method is unethical.
      James replied to stakeholder concerns, in a letter to a local newspaper, by stating that his shop
      allows young children to purchase affordable toys and provides job opportunities for teenagers.
      James has decided to create a social networking web site to respond to critics and to manage
      customers’ perceptions.

      James admits that the rate of stock turnover could be improved. He admits that the long queue
      is causing many customers to leave without buying anything. James is considering opening a
      second, larger toy shop called $4.99. He announced the opening on his social networking web site,
      informing stakeholders that he would stock higher quality products and have more cash registers.
      However, he immediately received negative online feedback from customers who saw the
      $4.99 toy shop as just a $3 price increase for the same toys.


      (a)   Define the following terms:

		          (i)    target market                                                               [2 marks]

		          (ii)   stock turnover.                                                             [2 marks]

      (b)   Explain two disadvantages of James using psychological pricing.                    [6 marks]

      (c)   Analyse two possible conflicts between stakeholders of the $1.99 toy shop.         [6 marks]

      (d)   Discuss whether the introduction of the $4.99 toy shop as a new strategy will
            change customer perceptions of James’ two shops.                                   [9 marks]

4.    Motuoro High School (MHS)

      Motuoro High School (MHS) is a new residential (boarding) school for 16–18 year olds. It is a
      public-private partnership funded 60 % by the state and 40 % by the private sector.

      The school has two managers:
      • Charles Ledger, a government official, who is responsible for finance.
      • Julian Santiago, a successful businessman, who manages the daily operations.

      Julian was asked to help set up MHS as a new innovative and flexible school. He interviews all
      new students. They can choose to attend classes or telework from their rooms. MHS has an
      up-to-date Internet system to provide communication and educational resources. It has a flat
      organizational structure. Teachers and students are at the same level of hierarchy, but below
      Charles and Julian.

      The teachers were selected by Julian and did not sign contracts. Julian and the students meet to
      decide together on the appraisal process for teachers. The teachers themselves are not present at
      these meetings.

      MHS provides teachers with free accommodation, food and a generous salary. 12 months ago a
      television series about the opening of the school gave it enormous publicity. This lead to many
      applications from potential students and teachers.

      However, a number of problems have now emerged. New student applications are decreasing.
      Government funding has been reduced. A number of students are missing classes or not
      submitting work. Teachers are insisting that MHS provide contracts. They are also concerned that
      the informal organization within the school is having too much influence on Julian’s decision making.
      One frustrated teacher complained to Charles without Julian knowing. This caused an issue between
      Charles and Julian. Julian wanted to dismiss the teacher, but Charles was concerned that dismissing
      the teacher would have lead to strike action. This would have created unwelcome publicity at a time
      when student numbers were falling. Julian suggested that a no-strike agreement should be put in
      place and that teachers should consider working at MHS as a privilege. The meeting finished without
      a resolution.

5.    Columbo Coffee (CC)

      Columbo Coffee (CC) is a family business that produces four espresso coffee machines.
      CC’s objective is to provide the highest quality machines, but it is currently unprofitable.

       The Fortuna          2000            Low                High

      A marketing audit of the four espresso machines had the following results:
      • The Ventura was CC’s best selling espresso coffee machine. It has the strongest brand loyalty
        of all four machines, but has been suffering from overseas competition. Many customers of
        The Ventura want a new, improved version. However, because of its weak financial position,
        the company has not been able to develop it.
      • The Crema is CC’s exclusive luxury espresso coffee machine. Considerable publicity for CC was
        gained when it featured in a recent popular television series. Sales of The Crema are forecasted to
        grow further despite its high price.
      • The Rocket has been very successful. However, technical problems have resulted in many
        customers returning their machines. Reduced brand loyalty and quality control are significant
        concerns.
      • The Fortuna is the company’s newest model. It was developed to replace The Ventura
        but consumer resistance has forced CC to keep The Ventura in production.
        The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of CC sees The Fortuna as a potential market leader, but to
        achieve brand awareness this would require most of CC’s limited marketing budget.

      The CEO of CC is considering reorganizing the four espresso coffee machines into separate
      cost centres.

      However, before any decision is made the CEO receives an offer from its main competitor
      to work together. As part of a strategic alliance, the competitor will provide funds to allow CC
      to finance extension strategies or enter new international markets. The only condition is that
      The Ventura is discontinued. The family is divided. Some family members are worried about the
      impact of the business losing its most recognizable brand. Others think the competitor’s offer will
      allow CC’s other three machines to achieve their full market potential.
