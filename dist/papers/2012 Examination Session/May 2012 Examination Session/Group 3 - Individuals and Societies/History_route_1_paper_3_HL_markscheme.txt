Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 3 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

    0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
    1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
            appropriate structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
    3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the
            detail is insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there
            are little more than poorly substantiated assertions.
    5–6:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is
           limited in quality and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present
           but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    7–8:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant historical knowledge
           is present but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
           There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical
           commentary may be present. An attempt to place events in historical context and show
           an understanding of historical processes has been made. An attempt at a structured
           approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
    9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
           Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
           generally placed in context, and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
           are understood. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2
           and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the views of historians cannot reach the
           top of this markband.
    12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant, in-depth
           knowledge is applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used to
           indicate some in-depth understanding, but it is not consistent throughout. Events are
           placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical processes and
           comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
           substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present but not always consistently
           integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
    15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
           question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical
           knowledge is used convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes
           such as comparison and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different
           interpretations are used appropriately and effectively. Answers are well-structured and
           balanced and synthesis is well-developed and supported with knowledge and critical
           commentary.
    18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and
           may challenge it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there
           may be a high level of conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be
           present as may be understanding of historical processes as well as comparison and
           contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated into the answer. The answer is
           well-structured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

Christianity c500–1300

1.   For what reasons, and with what results, were monastic orders established in medieval
     Europe?

     The question requires that candidates address both reasons and results. There is a considerable
     amount of material from which to choose. Candidates must present a well-structured analysis of the
     reasons and the results, supported by specific examples.

     The reasons for the establishment of monastic orders which began with St. Benedict may include,
     but not be limited to: monastic orders were established to provide a framework for a life of worship
     and to follow an ascetic, simple lifestyle similar to that of the early Christians. Monastic orders
     became a refuge from a dangerous and chaotic world in the early medieval period, they were
     founded to be models of Christian life for the wider populace. They were created to provide
     locations for study, scholarship and the preservation of knowledge, as well as charity, medical care,
     and aid to pilgrims. The Templars and Hospitallers were founded as military orders to protect
     pilgrims and defend the Holy Land. Some orders were founded to struggle against the spread of
     heresy, preach the Gospel and to model the ideas of great Church leaders.

     The results of the establishment of monastic orders may include but not be limited to: they provided
     a refuge for those who wished to live and practise a religious life in order to attain salvation; they
     became important centres of scholarship and learning for both religious and secular material; they
     often became the basis of schools and academies. They became models of efficiency in agriculture,
     which benefited the society and developed a wide range of knowledge in that area which was
     passed on to the public; they founded the first hospitals, orphanages and charities. Their
     scholarship and piety produced many important Church leaders and served as a model for all
     Christians to emulate. Their wealth and influence became a source of criticism in later years as they
     were accused of lax morals and corruption by Church reformers and dissidents.

     If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

2.   How, and with what success, was Gregory VII (1073–1085) able to expand the spiritual and
     temporal influence of the Papacy?

     Candidates must comment on both the methods employed by Gregory VII and the degree to which
     they were successful. Responses must be supported by appropriate detail and be in a proper
     analytical format. A simple description or narrative of the events of his Papacy will not score well.

     Gregory VII was a key part of the Church reform movement in the eleventh century.

     His methods to increase the spiritual influence of the Papacy included, but were not limited to:
     he produced the Dictatus Papae – this said that the pope had supreme authority over all Christians
     and asserted his right to correct and judge them. He continued the movement of Church reform to
     eliminate simony, promote a celibate clergy and eliminate the practice of lay investiture.

     His methods to increase the temporal power of the Papacy included his assertion that the pope was
     superior to temporal rulers and could supervise their conduct or depose them. In addition, his
     prohibition would weaken their influence compared to his, as would the exclusion of clergy from
     the jurisdiction of the temporal courts.

     The best example of his attempts to expand his spiritual and temporal authority was the
     excommunication and deposition as Holy Roman Emperor of Henry IV. Henry’s subjects were not
     required to obey him and he was faced with a struggle to retain power after the pope’s ruling.

     The results of his efforts were not clear during his Papacy but his principles were continued and
     resulted in increased influence of the Papacy over the Church, shown in widespread reform, new
     levels of devotion and new monastic orders.

     The increased influence in temporal matters was shown by the fact that Henry IV, in order to save
     his throne, had to beg forgiveness from the pope. Gregory’s successors continued to exert influence
     in temporal affairs which was formalized in the Diet of Worms which limited lay investiture.

     If only methods or success are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

The Fatimids 909–1171

3.   Analyse the importance of religious doctrine as a cause of the rise of the Fatimid Empire.

     This will be a popular question. The Fatimid dynasty arose for a number of reasons including
     religious differences with the Abbasid Caliphate. Candidates must decide how important religious
     differences were, as compared to the other reasons for the Fatimid rise to power.

     Fatimid religious beliefs were based on the Isma’ili branch of Shi’ism. They arose as a secret
     movement to oppose the Sunni caliphate of the Abbasids. They believed that the son of Ismail,
     Muhammad, would return as the Mahdi.

     They developed an extensive missionary movement in Yemen and North Africa. The term Fatimid
     was applied to the dynasty in the tenth century when one of the leaders proclaimed himself caliph
     and claimed descent from Fatima and Ali, the fourth caliph.

     The reasons for the Fatimid rise may include, but not be limited to:
     The growing discontent in the Islamic Empire caused by social and economic changes: rise of cities,
     trade, industry and the growing diversity and complexity of the Empire. New sectarian movements
     were appearing as the result of a growing clash of cultures and ideas. Armed rebellions were
     breaking out in the ninth and tenth centuries. The divisions in Islam between Sunni and Shi’a, as
     well as the division in the Shi’a movement which produced the extreme Ismaili sect.

     The Ismaili revolt brought them a base in Yemen from which to challenge the Abbasids. The
     Ismailis had a well-organized missionary movement which spread the Ismaili message, particularly
     in North Africa. They focused on converting individuals and rulers in order to expand their
     political power. They converted the Berbers of North Africa who provided superb soldiers for their
     campaigns. Umayyad control was weaker in North Africa which allowed the Fatimid movement to
     grow more easily. The population had lost faith in the Umayyad caliphate and saw the Fatimid
     caliphate as providing a better social, intellectual and religious philosophy.


4.   How did the Fatimid Empire impact the Islamic world?

     The impact of the Fatimid Empire may be seen as being both short- and long-term.

     The short-term impact would include their expansion of naval power and trade throughout the
     Mediterranean, their new ideas on government based on merit not heredity and their tolerance for
     other faiths. They made Egypt the centre of the Islamic world as capital of a great empire and large
     economic centre. They surpassed the Abbasid Caliphate in power and influence for a brief period
     of time. They made Cairo the intellectual centre of the Islamic world. They spread Islam to India
     and beyond as a result of their commercial expansion to the East.

     Their long-term impact would include their cultural legacy in art, architecture and intellectual
     pursuits. They founded a university in Cairo which remains one of the intellectual centres of the
     Islamic world. They contributed to new styles in architecture, ceramics.

Monarchies in England and France 1066–1223

5.   How, and with what success, did royal government seek to become more powerful under
     either Henry I (1100–1135) or Louis VI (1108–1137)?

     Candidates must address both parts of the question and explain both the methods used and the
     success of these methods in increasing the royal power of their chosen monarch.

     Henry I
     Henry was fortunate in that he inherited a powerful royal government established by his father,
     William I, however he took a number of steps to improve and increase the power and authority of
     the royal government.

     The methods used by Henry I may include, but not be limited to:
      he issued a coronation charter promising the redress of grievances to encourage loyal support;
      he improved relations with the Church and reduced excessive taxes;
      he married an Anglo-Saxon princess to gain support for his rule;
      he crushed powerful barons who were a threat to his power and seized their lands, he evicted his
        brother as Duke of Normandy and became its ruler;
      he made a compromise with the Church over the investiture of bishops in which he retained
        considerable authority over them;
      he created an efficient royal government under the new office of the Justiciar, created the
        Exchequer to monitor and collect revenues through written records called the Pipe Roll;
      he created circuit judges to hear cases and enforce royal laws;
      he raised his revenue through taxes and sale of charters on boroughs, towns, guilds and
        merchants.

     The results of his methods may include, but not be limited to:
      increased power over the Church and influence in the appointment of bishops;
      the elimination of powerful rivals in his family and the nobility;
      greater revenues which allowed him to expand his power and retain strong military forces to
        suppress rebellion;
      a powerful bureaucracy made up of men loyal to the crown which expanded the king’s authority
        in all areas;
      the success of his methods is shown in the fact that despite a civil war after his death, English
        royal administration was quickly established by Henry II on the foundations established by
        Henry I.

     Louis VI
     The methods employed by Louis VI to increase royal authority may include, but not be limited to:
      he campaigned constantly to suppress disloyal and unruly barons and force them to
        acknowledge his authority;
      he destroyed the castles of disloyal lords and replaced them with royal ones to increase his
        authority;
      he replaced corrupt royal officials with men chosen for ability and loyalty, often from the
        bourgeoisie who were opponents of the nobles;
      he appointed Suger the Abbot of St. Denis as his chief adviser, an individual of outstanding
        ability and wisdom;
      he increased his authority over the powerful vassals in his kingdom;
      he gained a reputation as a champion of justice in feudal disputes and improved relations with
        the Church;
      he sought to portray himself as protecting the Church and the poor against wickedness and also
        as the apostle of St. Denis in an attempt to give himself greater ideological power;
      he expanded his territory by marrying his son to Eleanor, the heiress to the Duchy of Aquitaine;
      he attempted through warfare to control the Counts of Flanders and gain control of the Norman
        lands in Brittany.

         The results of Louis’ efforts may include, but not be limited to:
        a steady increase in the royal authority, which laid a solid foundation for his successors;
        firm control over the royal lands and greater authority over the barons;
        an efficient central government which continued to expand the king’s authority;
        he expanded the royal lands through marriage, treaty and purchase;
        he was not successful in controlling Flanders and the lands of the kings of England, although he
         was able to gain the support of some of their vassals;
        established the Capet dynasty firmly as the kings of France and as national symbols of France.
         This served to increase his authority and that of his successors.

     If only methods or success are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


6.   Account for the loss of Angevin power in France by 1214.

     This question requires an analysis of why much of the Angevin land in France was taken over by
     the French monarchy by 1214.

     The reasons for the loss of Angevin power may include but not be limited to: the increasing power
     and confidence of the French monarchy in the twelfth century put them in a better position to
     challenge the Angevins. The death of Richard I removed the most successful Angevin military
     leader. John was lethargic and unpopular, which produced internal dissension in the Angevin
     commonwealth. His murder of Arthur of Brittany caused many to desert him for Philip Augustus.
     The military and diplomatic skills of Philip Augustus allowed him to use a variety of methods to
     attack John, seize his lands and gain the support of his vassals. John’s quarrels with the pope
     undermined his authority and his military failures, culminating in the French victory at Bouvines,
     caused the loss of nearly all his lands in France.

The Crusades 1095–1291

7.   “The motives for the First Crusade by both the Papacy and the crusaders were largely
     non-religious.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     This will be a popular question. Many candidates may challenge the statement asserting that
     religion was the primary motive for the First Crusade.

     Candidates must present an analytical response supported by appropriate content. Even though they
     may choose to focus on religious motives, they must make reference to non-religious ones as part of
     their analysis.

     The non-religious motives for the Papacy may include, but not be limited to: desire to expand their
     authority over the Orthodox Church by taking control of the Middle East; reducing anarchy and
     violence in Europe by encouraging nobles to use their military skills elsewhere; the prestige and
     power over temporal rulers that a successful Crusade would give to the Papacy.

     The non-religious motives for the crusaders may include, but not be limited to: desire for land and
     wealth; opportunity for adventure, travel; to achieve a reputation which might lead to power in
     Europe and respect from peers; to escape from social and economic problems.

     Religious motives which may be considered would include, but not be limited to: desire for
     salvation and remission of sins; result of genuine religious devotion/fervour; desire to exterminate
     enemies of Christianity; desire to recover Holy Land for Christians.


8.   “Military weakness was the least important reason for the failure of the crusading
     movement.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

     Candidates are asked to analyse the reasons for the failure of the crusading movement in general
     and should not concentrate on one single Crusade or campaign. There is considerable material from
     which to draw. Responses must be well-structured and supported. Responses which focus only on
     military events or narrative accounts of the Crusading period will not score well.

     The causes of the failure of the crusading movement may include but not be limited to: weakness of
     the military and administration in the Crusader States due to a lack of European population; failure
     of the Crusader States to cooperate with each other; disputes over the leadership within the
     Christian kingdoms in the Middle East; general lack of support from Europe after the First Crusade.
     Resurgence of Islamic strength, e.g. Salah al-Din (Saladin), Mamluks. Islam was more unified
     under Salah al-Din (Saladin) and thus proved a stronger opponent. The failures of the Second and
     Third Crusades encouraged Islamic resistance; the Crusaders’ failure to cooperate with the
     Byzantine Empire was a weakness; the disputes between the military orders weakened Christian
     power; bad military tactics which led to the loss of Jerusalem and new and improved tactics by
     Islamic forces were a factor. The diversion of military strength to campaigns in Spain and against
     heretical movements in Europe reduced the support for the Crusader states.

The Mongols 1200–1405

9.    Explain why Genghis Khan was able to successfully invade the Muslim world.

      Candidates must focus on the reasons for the success of the Mongol invasions of the Muslim world.
      Responses should focus on the strengths and strategies of Genghis Khan as the Mongol leader but
      should not ignore problems in the Islamic world which helped make his efforts successful.

      The reasons for Genghis Khan’s success may include but not be limited to: his ability to unite all
      the Mongol tribes and end the internal disputes that had weakened them; the skill and dedication of
      his troops, their equipment and tactics. The morale of the troops was boosted by the manner in
      which they were treated – booty shared, etc. The leaders of the armies were loyal to Genghis, often
      relatives and friends. He gained support from many populations through his tolerance of other
      religions and his support for scholarship and learning. The numbers of his armies increased as a
      result. He practised psychological warfare – opponents knew that any resistance would result in
      their complete extermination. Many of the local Islamic rulers were unpopular with their subjects
      who deserted to the Mongols or failed to resist. The Caliphs were weak and could not mount an
      organized resistance.


10.   Assess the reasons for, and the results of, the Mamluk victory at the battle of „Ayn Jalut.

      The reasons for the Mamluk victory may include, but not be limited to: the strength and
      organization of the Mamluk army; the weakness of the Mongols as a result of a withdrawal of
      troops and leaders due to the succession crisis in the Mongol empire and uprisings against them by
      the population in Damascus. The tactics of the Mamluks were superior to the Mongols and their
      general, Baybars, was a more skillful leader.

      The results of the battle may include, but not be limited to: the Islamic world was preserved from
      the Mongol threat; Baybars overthrew the Mamluk sultan and became the leader of the Mamluk
      empire; Egypt and Syria became powerful economic and cultural centres once again.
      Baybars began to eliminate all Crusader settlements and strongholds in the Middle East;
      this process was completed by his successors in 1291.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

Muslim, Christian and Jewish interactions in Spain 711–1492

11.   Why did Islamic rule collapse in Spain?

      The reasons for the collapse of Islamic rule in Spain may include but not be limited to: the
      Umayyad caliphate collapsed in 1031. The individual Islamic states that replaced it were weaker
      and failed to cooperate against the Christian challenge. The leaders of these states – “the Party
      kings” – were mutually hostile and fought each other. There was a Christian resurgence in the
      eleventh century that made progress during this period of disunity. The capture of Toledo in 1085
      is an example of this. The Almohad and Almoravid invaders helped to improve Islamic strength
      but also alienated some of the Islamic and Jewish groups in the Islamic states. The Christian
      kingdoms were more unified and were receiving significant assistance from the Papacy and France.
      The Crusading spirit and the presence of the military orders of monks added military power as well
      as a new determination to the Christian Reconquista. This climaxed in the major defeat of Islamic
      forces at Las Navas de Tolosa. The reconquest of Portugal in 1147 strengthened the Christians who
      were growing stronger both militarily and economically. The Islamic states were never able to
      work together to maintain their territory.


12.   Assess the contributions of al-Andalus to either medieval Europe or the Islamic world.

      The contributions of al-Andalus to Europe are multi-faceted. They involve technology, scholarship,
      economy, literature. They also involve some negative aspects.

      The contributions may include, but are not limited to: advances in agriculture, architecture, and
      other technology brought from the East and salvaged from classical antiquity. European
      scholarship, including knowledge of Greek and Roman philosophers, as well as advances in
      mathematics, medicine, astronomy, cartography. The libraries of al-Andalus were a model for
      those of Europe and the scholars who studied there became part of the twelfth century renaissance.
      The military campaigns in Spain provided literature about the participants including Roland, El Cid.
      It provided a model of tolerance and a multi-faith society which Europe did not adopt.
      The Reconquista encouraged intolerance and the Inquisition which spread to other parts of Europe.

      The contributions of al-Andalus to the Islamic world may include but not be limited to: the
      establishment of a rival caliphate in al-Andalus in the eighth century divided the Islamic Empire
      and created a precedent for further divisions and factionalism that weakened the power of the
      Abbasid caliphs. Al-Andalus contributed to the Islamic world as an economic centre. Its trade,
      manufacturing, exporting and agricultural production made significant contributions to the
      commercial wealth of the Islamic world. The interaction between al-Andalus and the rest of the
      Islamic world in intellectual, scientific and cultural activities contributed enormously to the
      expansion of knowledge in all areas of science and technology as well as philosophy, poetry and
      geography. The city of Cordoba rivalled Baghdad as a centre of Islamic studies and scholarly
      endeavour. Scholars from both places met and discussed and furthered their knowledge in all
      fields. Al-Andalus was also a model for the Islamic world in multi-faith relations and showed how
      Muslims, Jews and Christians could work together successfully for mutual benefit. The successful
      interfaith relations added to the intellectual and scientific developments of al-Andalus, as well as its
      commercial success. The struggle with the Christian kingdoms in al-Andalus increased the friction
      between Europe and the Islamic world and inspired Christian crusades to remove Islamic influence.
      The loss of al-Andalus to the Christians marked a major event in the struggle and inspired the
      Christians to expand their attempts to weaken or destroy Islam.

Emperors and kings 1150–1300

13.   For what reasons, and with what results, was royal power challenged during the reign of
      Henry III (1216–1272)?

      The reasons for the challenge to royal power during the reign of Henry III may include, but not be
      limited to: Henry created considerable opposition through his policies as king. He ignored the
      administrative structure in place and ran the country through the members of his household; he was
      seen as too generous to his foreign supporters, the Lusignans; his foreign policy was poor, resulting
      in defeats in France; he raised taxes on the laity and the clergy. Local authorities had their power
      undermined by royal bureaucrats who were seen as increasingly oppressive. He was accused of
      extravagance and caused opposition by his support for a papal campaign in Sicily. There was a
      tradition amongst the nobility of restricting royal authority after the passage of Magna Carta which
      had placed the King under the law. The barons had powerful military forces with which they could
      resist royal power.

      The results of the challenge to royal power may include, but not be limited to: the baronial revolt
      which led to the Provisions of Oxford in 1258 which in turn limited the king’s power, banished
      foreign supporters and restored traditional administrative posts such as Chancellor and Justiciar.
      The king was placed under the control of the Council of 15. A civil war resulted, the king was
      captured and the leader of the revolt, Simon de Montfort, summoned a parliament. The war
      continued and the barons were defeated, but the Statute of Marlborough (1267) accepted elements
      of the Provisions of Oxford and created administrative reforms. As a result, the composition and
      nature of representation to parliament was established and the principle that laws could not be
      changed or taxes levied without parliamentary consent was established.

      If only reasons or results are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

14.   Assess the success of either Louis IX (1226–1270) or Philip IV (1285–1314) in expanding royal
      power and administration.

      The success of Louis IX in expanding royal power may include, but not be limited to: he was
      determined to unite the diverse regions of France. All lands recovered by the crown were
      administered by royal officials. These were members of the middle class loyal to the king and
      opposed to the nobility. His alliance with increasingly wealthy urban areas gave him additional
      power. Royal administrative models became the national standard and all local officials were
      brought into royal administration to be controlled and supervised. The French crown acquired more
      power through the support of the Church as Louis was given the title of “Most Christian”.
      Louis eliminated all diverse groups by expelling the Jews, launching campaigns against heretics in
      the south of France and mobilizing the Inquisition. His reputation was enhanced by his leadership
      in the crusading movement. He was a popular monarch who established commissions to hear
      complaints about government policies, reduce corruption and restore illegally seized property.
      His policies made him popular and therefore powerful. He took advantage of the declining power
      of the nobility to increase the royal power.

      The success of Philip IV may include, but not be limited to: Philip established a ruthless and
      efficient national monarchy. He chose ministers and advisers who were all staunch supporters of
      his policies. He identified, and set out to crush, all rivals to his power both inside and outside
      France. He defeated the Papacy over the issue of taxing the Church. The pope failed to exert his
      authority as Philip created a schism in the Church and held the pope captive in France.
      He destroyed the Templar order and seized their wealth in order to increase his power, he also
      expelled the Jews in order to seize their wealth. All internal rivals were crushed by his forces.
      The Estate-General was forced to carry out his policies. His Council controlled all administrative
      offices, the courts and taxation. He had little success in wars, which limited his power outside
      France and proved very expensive.

Late medieval political crises 1300–1485

15.   Analyse the causes and results of the removal of Richard II (1377–1399).

      The causes of the removal of Richard II were both long- and short-term. These would include, but
      not be limited to: Richard became king at age ten. The royal power was in the hands of a regency.
      A number of powerful interest groups were trying to increase their power at this time: nobles,
      commercial classes and the Church. This caused a struggle for power during his monarchy.
      Richard lacked the respect and admiration of the population, not a warrior like Edward III or his
      father. He was seen as moody and unbalanced emotionally. He tried to rule in an autocratic
      manner – he executed his enemies and confiscated the property of his rivals illegally. He ignored
      laws and customs and acted in a tyrannical fashion in the eyes of some. The Lancastrian family
      were powerful and ambitious opponents who had the power to remove the king.

      The results of his removal may include but not be limited to: it established a precedent for the
      removal of kings by powerful opponents; his murder encouraged disrespect for the monarchy and
      weakened the power of the crown, the throne would become open to anyone with power and an
      obscure claim, the possibility of civil war was created, in future monarchs could be challenged and
      replaced more easily. His removal led to dynastic struggles amongst the nobles with the crown as a
      prize. This ultimately laid the groundwork for the Wars of the Roses.

      If only causes or results are discussed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


16.   Compare and contrast the impact on France and England of their war between 1415 and
      1453.

      For “compare”
       Both suffered economically; France suffered physical devastation while the cost of the war
         bankrupted the English government and caused high taxes and financial distress;
       Both nations had great victories and produced national heroes which increased patriotic feeling.
         A stronger sense of nationalism, national monarchy and national identity was created in both
         countries.

      For “contrast”
       The war greatly strengthened the French monarchy and led to significant reforms in taxation,
         administration and the military. All of this made the French monarch very powerful;
       In England the war contributed to political instability, the decline of the Lancastrians and the
         Wars of the Roses. All of this weakened the power of the crown;
       France was physically devastated by the war, England suffered little damage;
       France increased its territory; England lost all its land in France except Calais.

      If only one country is discussed, mark out of a maximum of [7 marks].

Fourteenth century famine, pestilence and social change

17.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the famines of the early fourteenth century.

      The causes of the famines may include, but not be limited to: severe climate conditions which
      reduced yields by up to 50 %. Some candidates may refer to the coming of a mini ice-age at the
      beginning of the fourteenth century which saw a notable drop in average temperatures in northern
      Europe. There was also excessive rain from 1315–1322. Livestock declined by 50 %. Other
      causes were: the lack of a food surplus as a result of population growth and low yields; lack of grain
      reserves due to poor storage; losses and devastation due to widespread warfare, lack of
      transportation to bring food to affected areas and the absence of strong central governments to
      coordinate relief.

      The results of the famines include, but are not limited to: severe reduction in population of 15 % in
      some areas; migration to towns in a search for food; widespread abandonment of land and villages,
      surviving peasants had their rent and taxes increased as landlords sought to recover income;
      peasants were evicted as landlords abandoned farming for livestock. Widespread uprisings and
      violence by peasants took place in France, Flanders and Spain. Jews and lepers were targeted as
      scapegoats for peasant anger.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].

18.   Assess the significant changes to medieval society as a result of the Black Death (1348–1349).

      The Black Death contributed to and accelerated a number of changes in late fourteenth century
      medieval society. These may include, but not be limited to the points mentioned below.

      Demographic: populations declined sharply in many areas, there was a movement of population to
      cities looking for new opportunities, many villages were abandoned and large areas of land were not
      cultivated.

      Economic results: Landlords saw a sharp drop in rents as there were no tenants available. This led
      to a number of results: the enclosure movement expanded and replaced agriculture with livestock
      needing less labour; landlords tried to enforce feudal dues to compensate for lost rents. This caused
      peasants to desert for other lords or to towns. Wages for labour increased dramatically which
      reduced profits of landlords and business owners. This resulted in government legislation to reduce
      wage increases – resulted in uprisings and protests by workers and peasants. The Peasants’ Revolt
      in 1381 was in part caused by these attempts to reduce the earnings of workers. Economic hardship
      occurred as a result of severe price inflation caused by higher wages, shortage of goods and the
      debasing of coinage by governments making up for lower tax revenues.

      Social: The feudal system collapsed as peasants deserted, towns grew and lords had to offer
      inducements to peasants to stay on the land. There was a loss of respect for authority as
      governments had been unable to prevent or mitigate the Black Death. This helped to contribute to
      revolts and uprisings after 1350. Many forms of unrestrained and unconventional behaviour
      occurred as people reacted to the calamity. Massacres of lepers and Jews took place as people
      sought someone to blame for the disaster.

      Political: A number of uprisings and revolts took place as a result of economic hardship, anger and
      frustration at the calamity that had occurred, government failure to relieve suffering and their
      attempts to prevent economic gain by the survivors. The feudal system declined and towns became
      more powerful economically and politically. The influence of the feudal nobility sharply decreased
      as a result of their declining economic fortunes.

      Religion: The Church was criticized for its inability to explain or mitigate the plague. Critics of the
      Church, such as the Lollards, gained support from the decline of respect for the Church. Shortage
      of priests through death led to the recruitment of many under-qualified clergy who could not gain
      respect or were guilty of offences which reduced the status of the Church.

The Ottomans 1281–1566

19.   Analyse the reasons for, and the results of, the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople.

      The reasons for the Ottoman conquest may include, but not be limited to: the long-term decline of
      the Byzantine Empire especially since 1204, the growing strength of the Ottomans. Mehmet II had
      a large army, used modern technology (artillery) and was a creative and inspirational leader,
      Constantinople had a small garrison, inadequate for defence, the military and political leaders were
      not united. Little assistance arrived from Europe to help them.

      The results may include, but not be limited to: it was a major defeat for Christianity and opened
      many new areas to Islam. Ottomans conquered the Balkans which posed a threat to Western
      Europe, Ottomans controlled the economy of the Eastern Mediterranean – made western contact
      and trade with Asia more difficult. Some argument that this conquest encouraged the West to
      launch their voyages of exploration to outflank Islam and regain trade connections. Ottomans
      began to play a role in the European balance of power making treaties with a number of states. The
      Roman Church became the centre of Christianity after the fall of the Byzantines.

      If only reasons or results are addressed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


20.   Analyse the nature and significance for the Ottoman Empire of the contributions of either
      Mehmet II (1451–1481) or Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566).

      Candidates must identify and comment on the significance of the contributions of either ruler.
      Responses should be analytical in nature and well-supported by relevant detail. A list of events or a
      narrative of the ruler’s career will not score well.

      Mehmet II
      His contributions to the development of the Ottoman Empire may include, but not be limited to:
      he had a key role in establishing the Ottoman empire – its military power, legal system, and
      traditions of culture, scholarship and its cosmopolitan nature. His military role as conqueror of
      Constantinople – eliminated the Byzantine empire and conquered Anatolia, Greece and many parts
      of the Balkans. He even invaded Italy – a great threat to Western Europe. He emphasized culture
      and scholarship by importing Greek and Italian scholars and artists to Istanbul. He codified laws,
      encouraged a cosmopolitan outlook, protected Christians and Jews, maintained trade with the West
      and became the model of an effective autocratic sultan.

      Suleiman the Magnificent
      His contributions to the development of the Ottoman Empire may include, but not be limited to:
      administrative and legal reform, military conquests and expanded diplomatic influence, cultural and
      economic developments, religious toleration and humanity. His legal and administrative reforms
      include a reform and modernization of the legal system in criminal, tax and education matters. He
      was known as the Lawgiver. His military conquests extended across North Arica, the Middle East
      and the Balkans, including Hungary. The Ottoman Empire became the largest in the world and
      played an important role in European as well as Middle Eastern politics and diplomacy. His
      cultural achievements created the Golden Age of culture in the Ottoman Empire. He supported
      hundreds of artists, imported European artists, developed a distinct Ottoman style in many areas,
      wrote poetry and encouraged architecture and building. He reformed the government to eliminate
      corruption, and extended his protection to Christians and Jews. He became the model of an
      effective and humane ruler.

Renaissance government and society in Italy 1300–1500

21.   Assess the extent to which two of the following rulers may be considered successful:
      Ludovico Sforza (c1452–1508); Lorenzo de Medici (1449–1492); Cesare Borgia (c1475–1507).

      The degree to which the rulers may be considered successful will depend on their accomplishments
      in a number of fields. These may include, but not be limited to: foreign relations, maintaining the
      independence and strength of their state versus other states. Their economic policies and the degree
      of prosperity that they produced; their support for and encouragement of culture and the arts; their
      ability to maintain peace and order in their city; the ability to reduce or eliminate factionalism and
      strife; the respect that they were afforded by the citizens of the state; the ability to provide a viable
      successor to maintain their policies and the state.

      If only one ruler is assessed, mark out of a maximum of [12 marks].


22.   For what reasons, and with what results, did new forms of government emerge during the
      Renaissance?

      The new forms of government that were developed during the Renaissance had roots in an earlier
      period as well as during the period of the Renaissance. They took the form of the city states:
      independent, republican, having constitutions and some form of elections.

      The reasons for the emergence of these new forms of government may include, but not be limited
      to: The absence of a well-established feudal system in Italy, the lack of a powerful monarch able to
      control Italy and impose a system of government, the example of the Roman Empire and ancient
      Greece with their republican ideas was well known in Italy, the influence of merchant guilds which
      had established governments and constitutions for their members in the cities, the wealth of the
      cities allowed them to maintain their independence and govern themselves without external
      influence. The humanist, scholarly focus of the Renaissance had reacquainted urban citizens with
      classical ideas on government and law which they sought to employ as a sign of a more progressive
      era.

      The results may include, but not be limited to: the emergence of powerful states with republican
      governments which provided an example to others. The city state became a focus for ideas,
      discussion leading to the development of political writers such as Machiavelli and Castiglione. The
      struggle for power amongst the citizens led to violence in many cases and eventually weakened the
      states. The strong individual character of the city states and their rivalries produced conflict
      between them and led to their eventual demise as they were conquered by stronger national
      monarchs.

New horizons: exploration 1400–1550

23.   “The strength of the Islamic world was seriously undermined by European exploration and
      overseas expansion.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question will require students to analyse the impact of European exploration and expansion on
      the Islamic world. There is a considerable range of material from which to choose. Responses
      must be in a proper analytic format and be supported by specific evidence. Narratives describing
      voyages of exploration or careers of explorers will not score well.

      Aspects of European exploration that may have impacted the Islamic world include, but are not
      limited to: trade, especially in spices and other valuable Asian commodities, was diverted from the
      Muslim merchants in the Middle East by European vessels. Muslim vessels, merchants, and trading
      posts in the Indian Ocean and Asia were attacked and eliminated by Europeans. Christian
      missionaries began to convert native peoples in Asia, limiting the spread of Islam. European wealth
      increased and their improved naval technology was a serious challenge to Islam in the East.
      Europeans established permanent settlements which could continue the attack on Islam in the East.
      The wealth of the European kingdoms such as Spain and Portugal allowed them to launch
      offensives against the Muslim lands of North Africa and the Mediterranean.

      The question may be challenged by showing that at the time of European exploration, the Ottoman
      Empire was the most powerful in the world and was continuing to expand in Europe. The Ottomans
      had firm control of vast areas and Istanbul was still the most important commercial centre in the
      world.


24.   Assess the importance of scientific and technological developments as causes of the European
      exploration movement.

      Candidates must present a well-structured and supported analysis of the causes of the European
      exploration movement. While they may not see scientific and technological developments as
      important, they must address the role that they played relative to other causes.

      The scientific and technological developments may include, but not be limited to: improvements in
      ship design, navigation instruments and maps – much of this was obtained from Muslims and the
      work of Henry the Navigator, and the rediscovery of the work of classical geographers and
      scientists.

      Other causes for the exploration movement include: religious and missionary zeal to spread
      Christianity and attack Islam; search for gold and trade in spices and other precious goods;
      influence of ambitious individuals such as Columbus and Henry the Navigator. Individual
      monarchs who wished to expand their wealth and power, such as England and Portugal. Curiosity
      about foreign lands and peoples – Marco Polo.
