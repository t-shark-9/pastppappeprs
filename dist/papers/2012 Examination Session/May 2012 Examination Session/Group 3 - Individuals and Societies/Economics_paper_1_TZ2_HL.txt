Answer one question. Each question is worth [25 marks].

1.    (a)   Explain why, in markets dominated by a few firms, prices may remain
            relatively stable.                                                                [10 marks]

      (b)   “An industry with a larger number of firms will experience lower prices
            and greater efficiency than an industry with a smaller number of firms.”  
            Evaluate this view.                                                               [15 marks]


2.    (a)   Explain why governments may pursue the macroeconomic goals of low inflation
            and low unemployment.                                                             [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the extent to which the use of expansionary demand-side policies may
            lead to conflicts between the various goals of macroeconomic policy.              [15 marks]


3.    (a)   Explain the possible consequences for a country of a persistent deficit on the
            current account of its balance of payments.                                       [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that balance of payments deficits on current account are best
            resolved through the use of supply-side policies.                                 [15 marks]


4.    (a)   “The banking system, the education system, health care and a country’s
            infrastructure are four sources of economic development.”  Explain how three
            of these factors might contribute to economic development.                        [10 marks]

      (b)   Evaluate the view that the impact of globalization on the economic growth and
            development of developing countries has, on balance, been beneficial.             [15 marks]
