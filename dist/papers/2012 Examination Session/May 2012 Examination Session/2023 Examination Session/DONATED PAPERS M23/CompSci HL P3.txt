Answer all questions.

1.   (a)   Identify two reasons why NextStarwould use infrastructure as a service (laaS).             [2]

     (b)   Define the term stochastic gradient descent.                                               [2]


     (a)   Discuss whether the benefits of Next Star using implicit behavioural data outweigh
           the concerns.                                                                              [4]

     (b)   Describe how the K-nearest neighbour (k-NN) algorithm uses item-feature
           similarity to make recommendations.                                                        [4]


3.   Explain two limitations of collaborative filtering recommender systems.                          [6]


     Discuss whether the challenges associated with the development of an effective
     recommender system can be overcome through the choice of algorithm, training
     data and methods of evaluation.                                                                 (12]
