These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from an autobiographical essay and a
promotional website.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

 note that both texts are about dentistry
 call attention to the different genres: one an autobiographical essay and the other an excerpt from
  a website
 make some reference to differences in language in the two texts
 look at purpose: text 1 to entertain, text 2 to sell you something.


A better comparative commentary may:

 discuss the humorous, intimate tone of text 1 versus the earnest, more serious tone of text 2
 identify the different attitudes to dentistry
 consider the effect of the quote in text 1 and note that text 2 offers no quotes at all
 draw attention to the use of proper nouns in text 1 (Dr. Goldfarb, Vice-Grips) and their effect
 consider the subject of each text: Dr. Goldfarb in text 1, the “team” at Signature Dental (of which
  the patient is evidently a member) in text 2
 discuss diction: the everyday, colloquial language of text 1 (“mollycoddling,” “yanker”) versus
  the lofty, inspirational language of text 2 (“continually strive for the highest,” “best ways to
  achieve excellence” … )
 look at point of view: primarily 1st person (with some 3rd person) in text 1; 1st person in text 2
 comment on style: the fairly short sentences and paragraphs of text 1; text 2’s bolded title and
  sub-headings, as well as the long sentences punctuated with catch phrases.

The best comparative commentary may:

 consider the use of metaphor in both texts (text 1 compares Dr. Goldfarb to a “longshoreman”
  and a “Nazi,” while text 2 compares dentistry to an “art” and describes the staff members at
  Signature Dental as a “team”)
 explore the attitudes towards dentistry in each of these passages: text 1 describes dentistry as a
  sort of barbarism, while text 2 sees dentistry as a combination of an “art” and a science
  (“methodology”) which fulfils a variety of patient needs
 consider the socioeconomic implications of both texts, noting that text 1 is about a boy from a
  working class family with little money for expensive dental treatment, while the services offered
  in text 2 sound expensive (“exceptional,” “first class”), even though Signature Dental claims to
  help “manage” the “financial constraints” of patients
 note that both texts share a sense of exaggeration
 discuss the motivation of these dentists. Dr. Goldfarb in text 1 seems to want to see as many
  patients as possible (“Next”) and doesn’t call the speaker by name (“my lad”),
  while Signature Dental claims to know each patient by name and seems focused on creating
  “remarkable smiles” and “confidence” in patients, as well as tending to their “emotional
  constraints”.

                                            SECTION B

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from a promotional article and a
magazine article.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

 note that both texts are about matchmaking/finding a mate
 discuss genre (text 3 is a promotional article, while text 4 is a magazine article)
 call attention to one or two stylistic features of each text: for example, the use of rhetorical
  questions in both texts; the use of present tense in both texts; the shifting point of view in text 3
  (1st person plural, 1st person singular, 2nd person singular) versus the use of 1st person singular
  and plural in text 4.


A better comparative commentary may:

 compare the confident, bossy tone of text 3 with the bossy, humorous, intimate tone of text 4
 consider that text 3 is directed towards men, while text 4 is directed towards women
 note that the advice of text 3 is to be choosier, whereas the advice given in text 4 is to “settle”
 note that the ultimate purpose of text 3 is to sell a service, while the purpose of text 4 is to
  offer advice
 look at the use of metaphor and/or simile in both texts (e.g. text 3: “tied the knot,” “flying solo,”
  “cloud of self-deception,” “the drill;” text 4: “prize,” “like a partnership … nonprofit business”)
 discuss the effect of quotations in each text.


The best comparative commentary may:

 draw attention to the way that text 3 creates a flattering fantasy of the future, while text 4 tells
  the reader to get real, and deflates any illusions we may have about romantic marriage
 note that text 3 seems to be more about finding “the one,” whereas text 4 focuses exclusively
  on marriage
 note that text 3 consistently employs the language of the marketplace, whereas text 4 primarily
  adopts the familiar, colloquial language of a girlfriend (“nix,” “zing,” “passion-fest”)
 look at how text 3 frames courting as an unappealing “labor” which can be sub-contracted out to
  another professional
 explore the use of narrative in both texts, and its effects. Text 3 tells a story about the reader,
  as well as a story about the author’s own life. Text 4 ends with a story of the author’s date the
  night before.
