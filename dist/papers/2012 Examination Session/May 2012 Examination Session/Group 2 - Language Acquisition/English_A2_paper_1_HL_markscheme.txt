Higher Level, paper 1

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking. They are not offered as
an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere.
Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate.
Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here should not be so
heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

                                           SECTION A

This question invites candidates to compare extracts from a magazine article and a promotional
website.

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

 note that both passages describe social gatherings which centre around automotives
 call attention to the different genres
 discuss one or two stylistic devices in each text (e.g. diction – slang and technical language of
  text 1 versus the formal language of text 2; third person point of view in both texts; the use of
  lists in both texts)
 describe the structure of both passages, and its effects.


A better comparative commentary may:

 discuss purpose (text 1 entertains and analyzes, whereas text 2 is attempting to promote or
  sell something)
 look at tone (text 1 is down-to-earth and slightly ironic, although it takes a detour into the
  philosophical in paragraph two; text 2 is elevated, polite, exclusive)
 pay attention to setting (text 1 takes place in “Steeltown” in a public arena, whereas text 2 takes
  place on the “beautifully manicured” private grounds of a stately home with enough room for
  helicopters to land)
 consider the cost of each event per person and the implications of that (text 1: $18.50; text 2:
  £795)
 describe the attention to detail in both texts (e.g. the “Ford cap,” “gear-grinding” “big, loud,
  powerful” details of text 1 versus the “glittering,” “manicured,” “Pommery Champagne” of
  text 2)
 note that while text 1 offers a quote from a spectator, text 2 does not
 consider the effects of the smattering of French in text 2
 consider the sense of socio-economic status in each of these texts (text 1 seems to describe a
  pastime of the working class, whereas text 2 describes the rarefied leisure pursuits of the
  upper class).
                                                 –4–           M12/2/A2ENG/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


The best comparative commentaries may:

 note that both of these events could be considered a spectacle
 discuss the relationship of people to automotives in each of these passages (text 1 seems to
  describe a visceral, physical response, while text 2 suggests a more cerebral response with its
  “illustrious panel of industry experts”)
 look at register (text 1 is more intimate, whereas text 2 is more professional)
 note that each of these passages offers up a fantasy (text 1 lets you imagine being behind a giant
  truck and crushing things, while text 2 lets you imagine being behind the wheel of a “priceless,”
  “rarely seen” supercar)
 note that while there is a lot of direct description of trucks and cars in text 1, text 2 focuses more
  on the event itself and the cars are not described in any detail.

                                            SECTION B

A barely satisfactory comparative commentary may:

    note that both texts are about visiting Paris
    note the different genres
    comment on the point of view (text 3 being 1st person, text 4 being a combination of 3rd
     person, 2nd person, and 1st person)
    call attention to one or two stylistic features in each text.

A better comparative commentary may also:

    discuss the use of language (poetic, romantic, ornate in text 3, vs. text 4’s slang,
       colloquialisms, and language of the “everyday”)
      look at the use of description in both texts (of nature and “romantic” Paris in text 3, of the
       street life of Paris in text 4)
      note that both texts use place names and discuss the purpose and effect
      consider the use of French words and their effect
      consider the use of simile and metaphor in text 3
      compare the use of repetition in both texts
      discuss the use of imagery related to sight, smell, and sound for both texts (particularly the
       visual for text 3 and the auditory for text 4)
      call attention to the shared purpose of these texts, both introductions to Paris.

The best comparative commentaries may also:

    discuss tone in each text (fanciful, retrospective, earnest in text 3 vs. the frank, sometimes
       ironic, but affectionate tone of text 4)
      consider the extended personification of Paris (to the point that it is the city that the
       writer is finally having the affair with) in text 3 vs. text 4, where Paris is only briefly
       personified as “having its crankiness and its graces”
      compare the speakers of each text (confident and wistful in text 3 versus the “regular Joe” of
       text 4, who becomes philosophical only at the very end)
      note that while text 3 tells a story, text 4 is more of a direct address
      note that text 3 highlights the special, the exceptional, whereas text 4 celebrates the ordinary
      consider that both speakers feel connected to Paris (text 3: “turned me into a Parisian,”
       text 4: “the sense of having found a home – a spiritual home”)
      identify the use of ironic deflation at the start of text 4.
