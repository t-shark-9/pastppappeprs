                     Steps to a Happier Life

            In life, we have choices. We can choose to live fully or we can choose to watch our dreams pass
            us by. The choice is yours, experts say.

            Here are some areas where people are either proactive or may need a push to get going.

               Strengthen your mind.       Knowledge facilitates richer experiences and opportunities.
                Push your true limits.

               Fear less – dare more. Do at least one thing every day that scares you. New experiences,
                even ones we fear, make our lives richer.

 5             Live with love and passion. Love and express love as much as you can as often as you can.
                Be passionate about yourself, others and your goals.

               Serve others. Be a role model or a mentor and help others. We thrive when we feel valued
                and have left the world a better place through our volunteer efforts.

               Forgive. When someone harms you, try to understand why by putting yourself in
                his/her shoes. Accept that making mistakes is normal, let them go and move forward.
10              Forgiveness is for ourselves not for those who caused us pain.

               Live with integrity and acceptance. The former means that you must have no actions
                that you regret whereas the latter suggests that you are special, unique and precious.

               Set goals and commit to action. Decide right now that it is important to live a life of
                no regrets. Then set goals to support your purpose and dreams. Goals help us concentrate
15              our focus, motivate us to expand and grow and move us in a chosen direction. Write down
                this formula and keep it in a special place so you can refer to it when needed:
                      Success = Idea + Determination whereas Idea – Determination = Wishful Thinking

               Complete your past. Do not hold on to anything. This holds you back from being yourself.
20             Take responsibility. You may not be aware but it is true that you are responsible for
                whatever happens in your life. You are author of your book of life, creator of your reality.

                   Hidden Suffering
            Childhood obesity is a major health issue because of
            health risks that increase as children become older.
            These include heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.
            Even if weight loss is achieved by the time children reach
 5          adulthood, scientists have found that mortality rates are
            higher amongst adults who have been overweight as
            children. Whilst these physical health risks are of concern,
            what can be more serious and often overlooked are the
            psychological issues that can affect overweight children.

10          More research is needed into the psychological impact of childhood obesity, but from
            the studies that have been conducted, it is evident that overweight and obese children
            suffer from size discrimination. They are often bullied and teased and consequently can
            become socially isolated, depressed and suffer from low self-esteem. Sadly, this isolation
            increases the likelihood of further weight gain.

15          One reason why psychological factors related to obesity are overlooked stems from the
            long-held stereotypes that we, as adults and children, have of overweight and obese
            people. “Fat” kids are perceived as happy, even though they are made fun of. This is
            present in modern day media representations. Most recently, Po, the obese main character
            from the film Kung Fu Panda, was portrayed as greedy, lazy and obsessed with food.
20          Despite these negative characteristics, he was perceived as being cheerful and happy
            within himself.

            Experts have found that there are many reasons why young people are overweight.
            Findings indicate that the development of obesity is due to many factors and solutions
            to weight loss must reflect this. One view is that as children, feeding is an event where
25          parents select, prepare and give us food. Habits like parents telling us that vegetables are
            “tasty” to persuade us to eat them and using food as a reward for good behaviour or as
            punishment can shape how food is viewed by children and the role it plays in their lives.

                            The Prom: To Go or Not To Go?
What is prom night? For your parents, prom night usually included dinner followed by a dance.
What is prom night today? It’s still the most important high school dance. Having a date is important as
most teens would rather avoid the prom than go alone.


Prom is a special time in a teen’s life. Not everyone looks forward to it though. Does this mean that you are
weird or that you are going to regret not going? No! Unfortunately, this is a decision that many teens have
to make by themselves. No one can tell you what to do. You do not want to make a decision that you will
regret the rest of your life. Here is some important advice to help you make this decision.


The first thing for you to do is to think the prom through, thoroughly. What does prom mean to you?
For everyone, it means something different. For some, prom is a very special day, one that is to be
remembered forever. For others, it is just a day out dressed up, not unlike other dances. Before you
decide whether or not to go, really think about what it means to you. Most kids who don’t attend, never give
their decision a second thought.


Talk to people who may have not gone to get their perspective. For some, prom represents an evening
of enjoyment celebrating the end of senior year. On prom night, teens spend hours getting dressed.
Looking your best is of critical importance. For girls, choosing the right formal dress (and one that no one
else is wearing) is a major decision.


There is, however, a certain degree of pressure related to the prom both financial and social.
Guys are responsible for paying, often having to rent limousines, provide flowers and pay for meals in
five-star restaurants. Girls feel pressure to get a date often going with someone they don’t really like just so
they can go to prom.


Should you go to prom? If you feel that it could matter to you at all, even many years into your future – go!
By taking the time to make this decision carefully, you can protect the way you will feel later.
