Epic

1.     (a)   Any two of: Andromakhe [1 mark]; Hector’s wife [1 mark]; depicted here as a slave [1 mark].

       (b)   Any three of: Hector stretched out his arms for his son [1 mark]; the baby is frightened
             (          ) by his father’s helmet [1 mark]; his reactions are noted carefully:           ,
                     , [1 mark] each; his loving (      ) [1 mark]; father smiles (           ) [1 mark];
             father and mother together [1 mark]; Hector kissed (       ) [1 mark]; then hugged (       )
             [1 mark] his son.

       (c)   Any two of: Hector prays for the boy to become a warrior, like himself [1 mark];
             full of might (      ) and bravery (  ) [1 mark] each; and a ruler over Troy [1 mark];
             even better than his father [1 mark].

       (d)   Marks should be given if examples are accompanied by appropriate commentary, e.g. use of
             epic/Homeric formulae and stock epithets:
                                                 , [1 mark] each; epic words:                 ,          ,
                              ,            ,                 [1 mark] each; details pertaining to metrics,
             e.g. l.477 = spondaic end, bucolic diaeresis present in many lines, 461, 462, 463, 466, 469,
             471, 473, 478, 479 [1 mark] each. Ideally the candidate should give at least one example of
             each category.
                                                                                                [10 marks]


2.     (a)   Judge only for length of syllables. [1 mark] for each error-free line.

       (b)   Any two of: Hector is critic of his brother’s approach to the events [1 mark]; as he calls him
                       ; also see Paris, self-criticism in lines 518–519 [1 mark]; however, Hector also
             admits: “you are brave”:                  [1 mark].

       (c)   Paris is described in lines 503–522. The marking should take into account at least four main
             points supported by appropriate quotations, e.g. Homer insists on Paris’s beautiful armour,
             (                                     ) [2 marks]; and his swift feet (                       )
             [2 marks]. Then there is the Homeric simile comparing Paris to a horse happily running
             through the plain (                         ) [2 marks]; well-fed (               ) [1 marks];
             breaking his cord (                        ) [2 marks]; and also having relied on his beauty
             (                        ) [2 marks]. All these details suggest a somehow loose connection
             with the grim reality of the war raging around him, and selfishness, therefore lack of maturity
             [1 mark].
                                                                                                 [12 marks]
                                                  –4–             M12/2/GREEK/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M

                                                                      (tetracolon) [1 mark]; Thucydides
           introduces a rumour for a more vivid description of the Athenians’ feelings [1 mark]; the

           insistence on the most serious effect through use of superlative               plus partitive

           the opposite extremes of their respective lines [1 mark]; the importance of            , as a
           key word: you have been deluded … stressed by its position [1 mark]; the contrast between
           Oedipus suggesting that Teiresias rejoices at saying lies (            ) and Teiresias being
           persuaded that truth is strong in itself (                         ) [1 mark].

     (b)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense,

     (b)   Judge only for length of syllables. [1 mark] for each error-free line.

     (c)   Teiresias is a fearless and committed defender of the truth: starting the first line of this extract
           with an aorist participle,          = “after I said” [1 mark],
           [1 mark]; repetition of         [1 mark]; the opposition              ,                 [1 mark];
           the statement                             , which forms the first half of the line [1 mark];

                                        [1 mark]; vivid image in                                     [1 mark];
           then three (= tricolon [1 mark]) monstrous situations: brother and father [1 mark];
           son and husband [1 mark]; and                                                     [1 mark]. In the
           end of his argument,                                        Teiresias challenges boldly Oedipus
           to say that he has no gift of prophecy [1 mark].

Comedy

7.   (a)   Aeschylus’s tendency to tautology [1 mark]; synonyms in particular [1 mark].

     (b)   Whenever two synonyms are used next to each other, Aeschylus’s aim is to render his ideas

           Euripides [1 mark].

     (c)   The role of a referee in the competition between the two playwrights [1 mark]; with fairness
           and great humour [1 mark].

     (d)   Verbal humour: insults (                             ) [1 mark]; out of register comparison
           (tragic line versus everyday language) [1 mark]; the dumb character: Dionysus says “well
           done!” to Euripides, then immediately acknowledges he does not actually understand the
           point he just praised [1 mark].
                                                                                            [10 marks]

           on previous events [2 marks]; the tension between the two playwrights is effectively
           conveyed through Aristophanes’s use of broken lines (1130, 1134, 1136, 1137) [2 marks];
           exaggerated talk (                                                            ) [2 marks];
           Dionysus’s disciplinary tone (lines 1132–1133) [2 marks]; Aeschylus’s tone of irritation
           (line 1134 and 1136) [2 marks].
                                                                                            [12 marks]

Philosophy

9.    (a)   Award [3 marks] for a correct answer or with no more than one minor error (tense,
            number, etc.). Answers with two or three minor errors or one major error should be
            awarded [2 marks]. Answers with two major errors (or four minor errors) award [1 mark];
            otherwise, no mark.

      (b)   Award [2 marks] for answers which should look into taking advice from professional/
            experienced people before attempting something; or amount of freedom nowadays is such
            that one should not listen to any advice but use their own common sense.

      (c)   Any two of: series of three short, precise questions – tricolon [1 mark]; followed by similar
            manner of answer [1 mark]; both question and answer are partially elliptic of verb [1 mark].

            example [1 mark]; Socrates is summarizing an argument via tetracolon of verbal adjectives:

            use of opposite situations to create contrasting scenarios:
                                               [1 mark]; series (tricolon) of opposite pairs of concepts,
            to illustrate one’s point:
                                    [1 mark]; synonyms and repetitions of words to reinforce a concept:

                           [1 mark].
                                                                                              [10 marks]


10.   (a)   The prosopopoeia of the Athenian Laws [1 mark]; they deliver a speech to persuade Socrates
            to accept the sentence of the jury, even if a judicial error or similar [1 mark].

            particular law [1 mark].

      (c)   Up to [8 marks], when accompanied by appropriate quotation, of the following:
            the laws state first their plea, “you are wrong”:                                 [2 marks];
            fictitious character of the speech, expressed through              [2 marks]; tetracolon of
            benefits of citizenship:
            [2 marks]; insistence of using one’s discernment when coming to age and involved in public
            affairs:                                                            [2 marks]; insistence on
            someone’s freedom through repetition of              [2 marks]; anacolouthon as a mark of
            oral style:                                                      [2 marks]; other points on
            their merits.
                                                                                             [12 marks]
