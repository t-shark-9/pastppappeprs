These notes are not intended to replace the published criteria but to supplement them in some instances.

These notes are intended to define the top mark of the scale in this examination. The phrase,
“a good answer”, is intended to refer to scripts which are likely to be placed in the 9 to 10 band
of descriptors. Scripts should be marked proportionately lower to the degree to which they fail to
meet these requirements.

In each case, good answers will meet most, though not necessarily all, of the following requirements.


1.    A local youth magazine has just announced a short story competition for which entries must
      begin with the following words: “It happened just after I finished my IB exam …”. Write your
      short story.

      Imaginative narration – informal to semi-formal – short story

      A good answer
      • will adopt an informal to semi-formal register appropriate to the content
      • will have a title
      • should include the words “It happened just after I finished my IB exam …” at the
        beginning of the script. If these words do not appear, 1 mark should be deducted from
        Criterion C
      • will provide a clear structure (sequence of events) with appropriate narrative tenses, good
        use of vocabulary and connectors
      • will have a point, some sort of overall message about human behaviour
      • may include twists in the plot which engage the reader. This should be rewarded under
        Criterion C
      • may achieve emotional or humorous impact. This should usually be rewarded under
        Criterion B.


2.    Your principal is doing research on enjoyable events and activities for students and has asked
      you to write a report on an event or activity that you participated in and really enjoyed.
      Describe the event or activity and say why you liked it and how you benefited from it.

      Factual explanation – formal – report

      A good answer
      • will adopt a formal register
      • will clearly describe an event or activity the author participated in and enjoyed
      • will cover all parts of the task (description of the event or activity, reasons for liking it and
        benefits of participation). If only two parts of the task are covered, then no more than
        6 marks should be awarded in Criterion C; if only one part is covered, no more than
        4 marks
      • may personalize the topic to some extent in order to support the case; this should be
        rewarded under Criterion C
      • may be presented in the format of a formal letter, or of an e-mail, or of a report with
        headings and sections.
                                                 –4–            M12/2/ABENG/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


3.   Villains or the bad characters in a book often become more popular than the heroes.
     Identify a villain in a book you have read. Write a review of this character for your school’s
     literary magazine and state why he/she is popular. Remember to mention the name of the
     book and the author.

     Subjective analysis and critique – semi-formal to formal – review of a character

     A good answer
     • will mention the name of the book and the author
     • will clearly explain the popularity of the chosen character
     • will not just retell the story, but will illustrate the reasons for the popularity of the character
       through examples
     • will adopt a register and tone that is semi-formal to formal but may be lightened by
       some informality.


4.   One of your best friends has started to engage in behaviour that you find unacceptable.
     Write an e-mail to him/her, describing the behaviour and offering advice on what your friend
     should do.

     Written interaction – informal – informal e-mail

     A good answer
     • will base the e-mail on a personal, friendly style and approach
     • will cover both required elements of the task (i.e. include a description of the behaviour in
       question, and offer advice to convince the friend to no longer engage in that behaviour). If
       only one of these are addressed, then no more than 6 marks should be awarded in
       Criterion C
     • may explain the causes of the unacceptable behaviour and/or the reasons for the advice;
       such in-depth argument should be rewarded under Criterion C
     • may adopt a diplomatic and persuasive tone; this should be rewarded under Criterion B
     • may include aspects of informal address (greeting, closing salutation, etc.)

     NOTE: Examiners should be careful not to impose their personal views of what is or is not
           “unacceptable”. Accept what the candidate indicates as “unacceptable behaviour”
           so long as it is explained and justified.


5.   You are participating in a class debate on the motion: “Students should be expelled from school
     if they are caught cheating or plagiarizing”. Write the text of your speech, either agreeing
     or disagreeing with this motion.

     Controversial argument – semi-formal to formal – text of a speech

     A good answer
     • will make the writer’s viewpoint quite clear. Failure to take a clear position will result in
       no more than 6 marks in Criterion C
     • will focus mainly on either agreement or disagreement with the motion – but may devote
       some space to the opposing viewpoint for rebuttal purposes
     • will argue the case for agreement/disagreement
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register, perhaps with flashes of informality
     • will address the audience and keep contact with them throughout the speech.

6.   There have been numerous road accidents involving students on bicycles in your
     town recently. Write a pamphlet to be distributed at your school giving advice on how to
     cycle more safely in order to prevent these accidents.

     Factual description – semi-formal to formal – pamphlet

     A good answer
     • will adopt a semi-formal to formal register with possible informality at times
     • will convey the seriousness of the issue
     • will give clear, practical advice for safer riding, in a convincing and encouraging way
     • will use elements of pamphlet layout/format, such as headings, numbering, in-setting
     • may show concern at the number of past accidents.
