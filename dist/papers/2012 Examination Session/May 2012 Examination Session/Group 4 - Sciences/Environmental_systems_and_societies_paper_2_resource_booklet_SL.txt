   Figure 2                Factfile on Iraq and Iran marshes


                • The marshlands in Iraq and Iran once covered an area of approximately 15 000 km2.

                • The marshes get only 100 mm of rainfall annually.   More than 2500 mm of water evaporates,
                  leaving behind a salty body of water.

                • Snow in the high mountains of Iran and Turkey melts in spring and the resulting water formerly
                  flowed down to the marshes carrying sediment and washing away the salty water.

                • A unique wetland ecosystem developed with many endemic species (species found only in
                  this area).  The wetlands vegetation also filtered out pollutants in the water.

                • A human culture developed which was highly adapted to this environment.  Food systems were
                  based on fishing and the use of water buffalo.  Reeds from the marshes were used for construction.

Figure 7    Human impacts on the marshes


   • From the early 1950s, engineers in Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq built a series of huge dams across
     the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.  This reduced the flow of water to the marshes.

   • After the 1991 Gulf War the marshes were drained by diverting (changing) water flow away
     from the area.   This lead to desertification of the wetlands and displacement of indigenous
     (original) people.

   • By 2002, the marshlands had diminished to 760 km2.

   • In 2003, floodgates were opened and the embankments that had been built to drain the marshlands
     were broken down.  Partial re-flooding has since occurred in some areas but not to historic levels.

   • Despite re-flooding in some areas, high salt concentrations have prevented the restoration of
     the ecosystem.

Figure 12 (a) How to place a value on an ecosystem


   One method of valuing ecosystems is to place a monetary value on sources of natural income.   
   An alternative is to survey stakeholders (people affected) and ask them how much they would be
   willing to pay to preserve a species or habitat.  Villagers in South Eastern Iraq were asked how much
   they would be willing to pay to completely restore the marshes.  Figure 12 (b) is a map, based on a
   satellite image, showing the results of this survey.
