1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point
      where it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
      mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question
      part in the body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the Examiner column
                       on the cover sheet.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts
      are checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
      got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. A mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect in the left
      hand margin.

Subject Details:                           Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is signified by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/) – either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets (   ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      writing OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. Indicate this with ECF (error carried forward).

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in significant figures unless it is specifically referred to in
      the markscheme.

A6. Award [1] for each of three correct distinct points in an explanation of why it is
    important for governments to raise public awareness of food-related health issues with
    reference to moral, social and economic responsibilities [3 max] for each factor.

     Moral responsibilities:
     raising public awareness of the issues can encourage better eating habits;
     this will result in a better quality of life;
     and reduced incidence of disease;

     Better eating habits:
     lower incidence of food-related health issues;
     better quality of life;

     Economic responsibilities:
     educating consumers regarding food-related health issues allows them to take
     responsibility for themselves when choosing diet;
     reduces the pull on human resources/healthcare;
     allows these resources to be allocated elsewhere;

     Social responsibilities:
     provide networks of care/advice;
     food can cause chronic health problems in certain social groups;
     but also have a wider impact on society as a whole;

     School programme/health care visitors/health education:
     uses a variety of media to get the message across;
     targeting particular social groups e.g. young consumers;

     Food can cause acute health problems e.g. food poisoning:
     a large number of people can be involved at any point in time if a hotel, restaurant or
     public institution is involved;
     this can overwhelm health services;                                                       [9 max]

Option B — Electronic product design

B1. (a)    Award [1] for stating the name of Component A.
           transistor;                                                                                 [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying the purpose of component P1 in relation to the exterior
           solar lamp and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           variable resistor;
           it allows the user to determine the light level at which the lamp switches on;              [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three correct distinct points in an explanation of the
           operation of a comparator [3 max].
           saturation can be positive or negative;
           if the non inverting input is of a higher voltage, the output of the op-amp should
           saturate positive (+V);
           if the non inverting input is of a lower voltage, the output of the op-amp should
           saturate negative (–V);

           when the light level drops R (LDR) increases and voltage at input 2 of the
           comparator falls;
           when the voltage (at pin 3) drops below the pre-set voltage the inverting action of
           the amplifier causes the output voltage to rise;
           the very high gain ensures that it rises to saturate at the positive supply voltage;    [3 max]



B2. (a)    Award [1] for stating one advantage of converting a telephone system from
           analogue signal to digital signal.
           speed of signal;

     (b)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an outline of one reason why some
           telephone systems are still analogue [2 max].
           cost;
           installing a digital signal requires significant capital expenditure;

           availability of the technology;
           some countries/locations may not have access to the digital technology/equipment;

           user needs;
           may not be the demand for digital system;

           timescale;
           conversion from analogue to digital may be spread over many years;                      [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one limitation of the use of the underground electrical wire
           for other road users and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           bicycles would not affect the magnetic loop;
           the traffic light output would not change/they will be stuck for a while;                    [2]

 B5. Award [1] for each of two distinct issues and [2 max] for each point relating to each
     issue when considering implementing an information transfer system using copper
     wires [3 max] per issue.
     copper wires have limited bandwidth;
     can only support a limited number of users;
     are therefore not cost effective;

      copper is a limited resource;
      copper wire is relatively expensive;
      recycled copper is not appropriate for this application;

      electrical noise is electromagnetic;
      making copper wire vulnerable to interference;
      limiting its capability to transfer information;

      copper cables suffer significant Ohmic loss;
      signal amplifiers are required;
      so signals can be transmitted over long distances;

      copper is a soft metal;

C5. Award [1] for each correct distinct point in a suitable explanation of two differences
    between haptic technology and virtual reality [3 max] per difference.
    feedback;
    user has more control over the environment with haptic technology;
    the virtual reality environment is pre-determined;

     feedback;
     in haptic technology mechanical actuators apply force to the user so s/he can feel the action;
     in virtual reality the action is all visual;

     the environment can stimulate changes/decisions by the user;
     so with haptic technology response time is improved;
     a virtual reality environment requires the user to be more passive;

     haptic technology provides feedback on the users’ movements/physiology which is not
     possible with virtual reality;
     this provides the designer with detailed information about how the user physically
     interacts with the environment;
     which would be very difficult to replicate without the use of haptic technology;                 [6 max]



C6. Award [1] for each correct distinct point in a discussion of each of three issues in

     and not design parts larger than the capabilities of the machine;

     the designer must consider the range of fixings available;
     by using standard components;
     costs can be reduced;

     edges of material will require finishing after machining;
     to enhance the aesthetics of the product;
     and add protection against possible damage;

     the veneer will be very thin;
     the designer must ensure that the product can be manufactured with the CNC equipment
     without damaging the veneer;
     the designer must consider how to fix the material in place when using the
     CNC machine;                                                                                 [9 max]

           tagging systems are only suitable for soft goods [2 max].
           the pin makes a hole;
           which may cause damage to some fabrics;

           the weight of the tag;
           can distort fabrics with low dimensional stability;                               [2 max]

     (c)   Award [1] for each correct distinct point in an explanation of why the tagging
           systems are more popular with department stores than small shops [3 max].
           staffing levels;
           small shops tend to have a better ratio of staff to customers;
           so supervision of customers is easier and negates the need for the tags;

           layout;
           department stores tend to have a large amount of garments on display;
           customers can mingle freely between displays/racks;
           small shop layout is more compact and easier to oversee;

           customer service;
           small shops may provide a more personal service;
           they do not want to give the impression they expect customers to steal;

           cost;
           small shops may not be able to absorb the cost of the system;
           due to a small turnover of products/the price products are sold;                  [3 max]
