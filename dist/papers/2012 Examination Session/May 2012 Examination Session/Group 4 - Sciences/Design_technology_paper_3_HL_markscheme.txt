1.    Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.    Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
      becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
      mark awarded.

3.    Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
      cases write a brief annotation to explain your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
      where it helps clarity, especially for moderation and re-marking. It should be remembered that the
      script may be returned to the candidate.

4.    Unexplained symbols or personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

5.    Record marks in the right-hand margin against each mark allocation shown in square brackets e.g. [2].
      The total mark for a question must equal the number of ticks for the question.

6.    Do not circle sub-totals. Circle the total mark for the question in the right-hand margin at the end
      of the question.

7.    Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks, put a zero in the right-hand margin next to
      the square bracket.

8.    Where work is submitted on additional sheets the marks awarded should be shown as ticks and
      a note made on both the additional sheet and in the right-hand margin of the corresponding question
      part in the body of the script.

9.    For each Option: Add the totals for each question in the Option and write it in the Examiner column
                       on the cover sheet.
      Total:           Add the marks awarded and enter this in the box marked TOTAL in the
                       Examiner column on the cover sheet.

10.   After entering the marks on the cover sheet check your addition to ensure that you have not made
      an error. Check also that you have transferred the marks correctly to the cover sheet. All scripts
      are checked and a note of all clerical errors will be given in feedback to examiners.

11.   If an answer extends over more than one page and no marks have been awarded on a section draw a
      diagonal line through that section to indicate that it has been marked.

12.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
      of a paper, mark all the answers and use the marks of those answers that have the highest mark,
      even if the candidate has indicated the question(s) to be marked on the cover sheet.

13.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
      got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. A mark should not be
      awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect in the
      left-hand margin.

Subject Details:                           Design Technology HL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 40 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional. Do not
      award more than the maximum marks allowed for part of a question.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized.
      However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried
      forward) on the script.

10.   Only consider units at the end of a calculation. Unless directed otherwise in the markscheme,
      unit errors should only be penalized once in the paper. Indicate this by writing –1(U) at the first
      point it occurs and U on the cover page.

11.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

A7. Award [1] for each of three correct distinct points in an explanation of why it is
    important for governments to raise public awareness of food-related health issues with
    reference to moral, social and economic responsibilities [3 max] for each factor.

     Moral responsibilities:
     raising public awareness of the issues can encourage better eating habits;
     this will result in a better quality of life;
     and reduced incidence of disease;

     Better eating habits:
     lower incidence of food-related health issues;
     better quality of life;

     Economic responsibilities:
     educating consumers regarding food-related health issues allows them to take
     responsibility for themselves when choosing diet;
     reduces the pull on human resources/healthcare;
     allows these resources to be allocated elsewhere;

     Social responsibilities:
     provide networks of care/advice;
     food can cause chronic health problems in certain social groups;
     but also have a wider impact on society as a whole;

     School programme/health care visitors/health education:
     uses a variety of media to get the message across;
     targeting particular social groups e.g. young consumers;

     Food can cause acute health problems e.g. food poisoning:
     a large number of people can be involved at any point in time if a hotel, restaurant or
     public institution is involved;
     this can overwhelm health services;                                                          [9 max]

Option B — Electronic product design

B1. (a)    Award [1] for stating the name of Component A.
           transistor;                                                                                [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying the purpose of Component P1 in relation to the exterior
           solar lamp and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           variable resistor;
           it allows the user to determine the light level at which the lamp switches on;             [2]

     (c)   Award [1] for each of three correct distinct points in an explanation of how the
           operation of a comparator in the circuit in Figure B2 influences the type of output
           saturation [3 max].
           saturation can be positive or negative;
           if the non inverting input is of a higher voltage, the output of the op-amp should
           saturate positive (+V);
           if the non inverting input is of a lower voltage, the output of the op-amp should
           saturate negative (-V);

           when the light level drops R (LDR) increases and voltage at input 2 of the
           comparator falls;
           when the voltage (at pin 3) drops below the pre-set voltage the inverting action of
           the amplifier causes the output voltage to rise;
           the very high gain ensures that it rises to saturate at the positive supply voltage;   [3 max]


B2   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of product stewardship to the effect of:
           everyone involved in making, selling, buying or handling electronic equipment
           takes responsibility for minimizing environmental impact of the equipment at all
           stages in the life cycle;                                                                  [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of two ways in which manufacturers can meet the aims of
           product stewardship [2 max].
           products can be more easily disassembled;
           products can be more easily recycled;
           use less toxic and more recycled/recyclable materials;
           products can be made to last longer;
           develop collection and recycling infrastructure;
           integrate costs for collection and recycling into the product price;
           take back policy;                                                                      [2 max]

B3. (a)    Award [1] for each of two correct distinct points in a description of how the
           system shown in Figure B3 operates [2 max].
           when a car moves over the wire, it alters the magnetic field;
           the sensors in the system computer detect a change in the input current;

           the car alters the frequency of oscillation;
           the computer detects the change in frequency;                                            [2 max]

     (b)   Award [1] for identifying one limitation of the use of the underground electrical wire
           for other road users and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
           bicycles would not affect the magnetic loop;
           the traffic light output would not change/they will be stuck for a while;                    [2]


B4. Award [1] for each of two distinct issues and [1] for each point relating to each issue
    when considering implementing an information transfer system using copper wires
    [3 max] per issue.
    copper wires have limited bandwidth;
    can only support a limited number of users;
    are therefore not cost effective;

     copper is a limited resource;
     copper wire is relatively expensive;
     recycled copper is not appropriate for this application;

     electrical noise is electromagnetic;
     making copper wire vulnerable to interference;
     limiting its capability to transfer information;

     copper cables suffer significant Ohmic loss;
     signal amplifiers are required;
     so signals can be transmitted over long distances;

          the machine step variable controls the quality of the cut and the surface finish;
          if reduced the surface finish will be of higher quality;

          the machine tool step variable/stepover should be reduced;
          in order to reduce the ridge size/stepover distance to create an accurate
          profile/shape;                                                                      [2 max]

C4. Award [1] for each correct distinct point in a suitable explanation of two differences
    between haptic technology and virtual reality [3 max] per difference.
    feedback;
    user has more control over the environment with haptic technology;
    the virtual reality environment is pre-determined;

     feedback;
     in haptic technology mechanical actuators apply force to the user so s/he can feel
     the action;
     in virtual reality the action is all visual;

     the environment can stimulate changes/decisions by the user;
     so with haptic technology response time is improved;
     a virtual reality environment requires the user to be more passive;

     haptic technology provides feedback on the users’ movements/physiology which is not
     possible with virtual reality;
     this provides the designer with detailed information about how the user physically
     interacts with the environment;
     which would be very difficult to replicate without the use of haptic technology;        [6 max]

E7. Award [1] for each correct distinct point in a discussion of three issues relating to
    displacing population stereotypes in the design of controls for products. [3 max] per
    each issue.
    people become used to how controls work for a product:
    they often do not think about how to use the controls;
    but they use them intuitively;

     people come into contact with familiar products:
     but sometimes in unfamiliar contexts e.g. a telephone in a hotel room;
     if the controls work differently to the product they are most familiar with they may
     misuse the product/become frustrated with it;

     safety:
     if a user assumes a product works in a particular manner;
     they may misuse the controls which could cause a safety problem;
     e.g. leaving a gas tap on;
     (accept a suitable example)                                                            [9 max]
