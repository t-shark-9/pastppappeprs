15.   A simple calorimeter was set up to determine the enthalpy change occurring when one mole of
      ethanol is combusted.  The experimental value was found to be –867 kJ mol–1.  The Data Booklet
      value is –1367 kJ mol–1 (at 298 K and 1.01×105 Pa).
      During the experiment some black soot formed.

      Which statements are correct?

            I.      The percentage error for the experiment can be calculated as follows:
                                                   (1367 − 867) ×100 %

            II.     The difference between the two values may be due to heat loss to the surroundings.
            III.    The black soot suggests that incomplete combustion occurred.
