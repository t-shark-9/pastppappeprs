General Marking Instructions

   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
   or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
   the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
   they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
   through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
   For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the right-hand
     side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
     comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the part
     question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer to a
     part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question, enter an
     “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line with
     the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp ‘seen’ on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have got
     correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not be
     awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a text
     box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP1 Markscheme

Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions. Total = [45 marks].

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more
      important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

           obtaining representative numbers;
           the method could cause injury to the animal;
           migration/movement of tigers;

           Do not accept acid rain.

     (b)   open system;
           because it exchanges matter and energy with surroundings;                            [2]

                  sexual variation;
                  only already discovered species can be identified;
                  judgment may be difficult (subjective)/may require expertise;
                  differences might simply be variations within a species;                  [1 max]
                  Allow any other reasonable response.

                  Units (ha) not required. Accept 15 million (ha).

           (ii)   Ecological footprint is higher for France because:
                  higher production of waste;
                  greater energy consumption for industry/domestic activities;
                  (probably) differences in diet / more likely to have a diet based on animal
                  products which requires more land;
                  has more intensive (productive) farming;
                  uses more energy for transport and movement of goods/people;
                  greater wealth allows higher consumption of goods;
                  greater consumption of natural resources such as water;                       [3 max]
                  Allow any other reasonable suggestions.
                  Responses related to transportation and technology should be linked to

     (b)   (i)    the maximum number of a species/individuals/load that can be sustainably
                  supported by a given environment;                                                 [1]

                  resource requirements vary according to lifestyles;
                  technological developments lead to changes in resources demand/availablity
                  for consumption;
                  can be artificially altered by importing goods;
                  when discussing human populations global carrying capacity is more
                  significant;
                  amount of resources are often estimates / full stocks of resources are not
                  always known;
                  immigration/migration;                                                        [3 max]

           Award [1] for one transfer and one transformation process.

     (e)   energy efficiency will depend on the specific food being produced in the system;
           absorption of solar energy by producers in aquatic systems tends to be less
           efficient as some light is absorbed/reflected by water;
           food chains in aquatic systems are much longer so available energy is reduced
           from the original input energy;
           in crop systems, most food is harvested from relatively low trophic levels / in
           aquatic systems most food is harvested from higher trophic levels;
           energy conversions along the food chain are more efficient in aquatic systems as
           less biomass is locked up in bone and skeletal materials compared to flesh;
           aquatic producers achieve faster growth rates than terrestrial producers;             [3 max]

6.   (a)   ash would reflect sunlight back to space/prevent sunlight penetrating atmosphere /
           increases atmospheric albedo / global dimming;
           reduction in energy input leads to fall in global temperatures;
           greenhouse gases released could contribute to global warming;
