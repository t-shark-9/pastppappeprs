9.   Flybe is one of Europe's biggest regional airlines.  In June 2007 Flybe pioneered the development
     of an eco-labelling scheme for aircraft (Figure 7).  The label was modelled on those used for the
     sale of household appliances and shows a range of environmental indicators for particular aircraft.  
     Flybe has published its methodology so that it can be used by other airlines.

21.   Figure 11 and Figure 12 show a roadable aircraft called Transition®.  It is classified by aviation
      authorities as a light sport aircraft.   Its wings fold at the touch of a button to convert into a car.  
      Roadable aircraft have to meet motor vehicle regulations and aviation regulations.  This results in
      conflicts which the designer must resolve.

Questions 36–40 relate to the following case study. Please read the case study carefully and answer
the questions.

Figures 17 and Figure 18 shows a lift (elevator).   The lift car is raised and lowered by steel ropes.  
The ropes are attached to the lift car, looped around a pulley (3) and connected to a counterweight (4) on
the other side of the pulley.  Both the lift car and the counterweight ride on guide rails (5) along the sides of
the lift shaft.  The rails keep the car and counterweight from swaying back and forth.

The pulley has grooves around it and is connected to an electric motor (2).  The pulley grips the ropes,
so when it turns the ropes move too.  When the motor turns one way it raises the lift; when it turns the
other way it lowers the lift.  The sheave, the motor and the control system (1) are all housed in a machine
room above the lift shaft.  The counterweight weighs about the same as the car when it is about half full
(an average amount).  The lift has been designed for eight users or a maximum load of 630 kg.

      A.    It only takes a small force to operate the lift.

      B.    Electrical energy is converted to potential energy.

      C.    The lift car uses up potential energy as it descends.
