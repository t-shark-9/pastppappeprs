General Marking Instructions

   Assistant Examiners (AEs) will be contacted by their team leader (TL) through Scoris™, by e-mail
   or telephone – if through Scoris™ or by e-mail, please reply to confirm that you have downloaded
   the markscheme from IBIS. The purpose of this initial contact is to allow AEs to raise any queries
   they have regarding the markscheme and its interpretation. AEs should contact their team leader
   through Scoris™ or by e-mail at any time if they have any problems/queries regarding marking.
   For any queries regarding the use of Scoris™, please contact emarking@ibo.org.

1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where
     it becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each
     mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark.
     In these cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to
     write comments where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for
     these additional comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to
     the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a question or part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted
     the part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an
     answer to a question or part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted
     the part question, enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or
     section of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in
     line with the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that
     you stamp “seen” on any page, in the Options attempted by the candidate, that contains no
     other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should
     not be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect
     using a text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Physics SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from TWO of the Options [2  20 marks].
Maximum total = [40 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded when marking. Indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

Option B — Quantum physics and nuclear physics

B1. (a)    light consists of discrete packets/quanta/bundles of energy/particle;
           each photon has an energy of hf (where h is the Planck constant and f is the
           frequency of light);                                                                     [2]

     (b)   (i)    the energy of a (em) wave depends on amplitude (not frequency);
                  so increasing the intensity should have resulted in electrons being emitted
                  (at any frequency) / OWTTE;                                                       [2]

           (ii)   the work function is the minimum energy required to eject an electron from
                  a metal surface;
                  if the photon energy (hf ) is less than the work function then no emission
                  will take place;                                                                  [2]

B2. (a)    (i)    the α particles produced have discrete energies;
                  the gamma rays produced have discrete energies;
                  since the energies of the α particles and of the photons are determined by the
                  difference in nuclear energy levels this implies that nuclear energy levels are
                  also discrete;                                                                    [3]

           (ii)   the β+ spectrum is continuous;
                  the neutrino was postulated to account for those β+ with less energy than the
                  maximum;                                                                          [2]

Option C — Digital technology

C1. (a)    information stored digitally on the CD and in analogue form on the LP;
           CD: the sound is first encoded/converted to a series of binary numbers;
               the binary numbers are then converted to a series of pits and lands on the
               surface of the CD;
           LP: the shape of the groove corresponds to the musical sound;                           [3 max]
           To award [3] candidates must obtain the first marking point plus two others.

     (b)   for destructive interference the path difference between light reflected from a pit
                          
           and a land is    or 360 nm;
                          2
           the path difference is 2d;
           therefore 2d  360 nm such that d  180 nm;                                                 [3]
           Award [2 max] for a clearly labelled diagram and [1 max] for calculation.
