All adequate to good answers must include some pertinent detail (described, paraphrased or
directly quoted) to support assertions and reveal knowledge of the texts studied. Relevant
discussion of literary features must appear in every response. Answers should demonstrate
some discernible form of organization and demonstrate standard use of language.

 A good to excellent answer must be grounded in the features demanded for “adequate”
answers. In going beyond those features, it may be in the ways described below as well as
in other, somewhat unpredictable ways which show individual thinking and an engaged,
well-supported address of the texts.

1.   An adequate to good answer will identify some important similarities and contrasts in the
     presentation of female characters in the plays studied and discuss the ways in which these
     similarities and contrasts have been used to make an effect, offering some comparison of the
     works chosen.

     A good to excellent answer will present a more considered discussion of the kinds of
     similarities and contrasts used in the presentation of female characters in the plays studied,
     clearly comparing how these similarities and contrasts work to achieve a particular effect.


2.   An adequate to good answer will give examples of how the plays studied deal with the past.
     They will also try to compare and contrast the ways in which the plays treat things that have
     already happened.

     the past. They will also compare and contrast, with pertinent examples, how the authors treat
     things that have already happened.
