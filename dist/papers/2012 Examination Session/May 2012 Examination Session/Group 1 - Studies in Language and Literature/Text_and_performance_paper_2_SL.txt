      old age in their work.


2.    Consider the way memory has been used in the work of at least two poets you have studied.


3.    Evaluate how at least two poets you have studied have dealt with the challenge of expressing extremes
      of emotion through their use of language.


4.    Consider how at least two poets you have studied have used style to convey their sense of what is
      valuable in life.


5.    Poetry should communicate in a surprising and original way. Compare how at least two poets you
      have studied have used language in surprising and original ways to convey their meaning.


6.    Poets often focus on a particular preoccupation in their work. With close reference to the
      work of at least two poets you have studied, consider how they have used their poetry to examine
      this preoccupation.
