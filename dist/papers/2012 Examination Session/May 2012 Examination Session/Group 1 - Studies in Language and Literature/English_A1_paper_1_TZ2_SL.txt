                                            Non-Paying Passengers

                   Walk down any busy street. Sit in a crowded restaurant. Take a seat in a well-filled cinema.
            In particular, board a packed train. The chances are that somewhere in the immediate vicinity is
            a ghost. An actual, visible, audible, and – heaven help us – a solid ghost.
                   This is an unpalatable truth, that would be greeted with derision were it widely broadcast.
      5     Certainly, Percy Fortesque would have become gravely embarrassed if such a possibility had been
            presented to him as an undeniable fact, his assumption being he was either in the presence of a
            crank or a madman.
                   He was therefore totally unprepared when he saw the face of his dead wife staring at him
            from a window of the five-forty-five train which was standing at Platform 16 at Waterloo Station.
     10     She was sitting in the corner seat, wearing that blank, long-suffering look he remembered so well,
            and her steel-rimmed glasses reflected the light from an overhead platform lamp, so that they
            resembled miniature suns.
                   Percy’s heart gave one violent thump and the shock froze his reasoning powers into icy
            splinters of fear, so that he could only keep walking and finally seat himself in the compartment
     15     next to the driver’s cab. Then his brain gradually resumed its natural function and thoughts came
            tripping over one another in a vain effort to present a rational theory.
                   “That woman could not possibly have been Doris.” He repeated this comforting assertion
            over and over again, and was delighted to note a marked improvement in his morale. He then
            moved on to list a number of excellent reasons why a defunct wife could not possibly be travelling
     20     on the five-forty-five from Waterloo. “One, she’s dead. I was with her when she died. She said:
            ‘Oh, dear,’ and died. Two, she was cremated and her ashes sprinkled under a rosebush.”
            Percy was very pleased now that he had decided on cremation. The fire was so final. Old-fashioned
            burial meant the component parts were still around. The bones still in existence. The skull intact.
            And … goodness gracious … sealed up in a wooden box, she could still be in one piece. But the
     25     cremation oven disintegrated; it was as though she had never been. She did not exist.
                   Then his nasty, inquiring brain recalled the memory of that face framed in a train window
            and began to go over the salient points. She had been wearing that awful blue hat that Percy had
            so detested; and … oh, good Lord … there had been that little wen* on the left side of her chin.
            The comforting thought of a Doris double began to fade. Surely the arm of coincidence could not
     30     be that long? But what was the alternative? Percy shifted uneasily and a dour-faced woman to
            his left shot him a suspicious glance. A Doris-ghost on a rush-hour train? An apparition on the
            five-forty-five? Percy giggled and the dour-faced woman tried to edge away.
                   When he alighted at Richmond he had to have a second look. His heart once again began
            to beat unnaturally fast and anticipation made icy fingers to trail down his spine – but he had to
     35     seek reassurance. Surely a second look would prove beyond doubt that he had been mistaken.
            Been deceived by a trick of light. Deluded by a quirk of imagination.

                   He walked slowly along the platform, daring to look into each window, and disinterested
            faces stared back at him. Newspapers were rustled, one saucy-eyed girl winked at him, but so
            far there was no sign of the face. A whistle blew, a voice shouted: “Right, Charlie!” and the train
   40       began to draw away. Percy stopped and faced the train as the carriages flashed by. Then, just as
            hope was maturing into blessed relief, he had a glimpse of Doris’s face. Blue hat, steel-rimmed
            glasses, wen and all. He had the impression that just as the carriage tore out of his line of view,
            she turned her head so as to get a last look at him.
                   It really was too much. He fainted on the platform and a porter revived him with a cup of
   45       tea from the station buffet.

                                                        Dinner Party 1940

                                   “Do you mind the news while we eat?”
                                                    So guests assenting
                                   The well-bred voice from Daventry1
                                   Mingled with sounds from the pantry
                              5    And slowly through the ether spilled
                                   Its syllables … not silencing
                                                    augmenting
                                   The show of wit which never fails
                                   Thanks to 7.30 cock-tails … “and at Narvik2
                            10            Where for five days a storm has raged
                                          a few were killed … ”
                                   “More mutton, Alice?” “Yes, it’s delicious, dear,
                                   Yesterday at bridge I held three aces, three … ”
                                                    “in the Baltic
                            15            it is reported from Stockholm that the
                                                    soldiers fled
                                          leaving a number of dead” …
                                   “But don’t you like it cold with guava-jelly?”

                                   The well-bred voice from Daventry
                            20     Did not grow less well-bred
                                   And did not speak of more than three or four hundred dead,
                                   And did not really silence the sounds from the pantry
                                        Or the show of wit which never fails
                                        Thanks to 7.30 cock-tails.

                            25     Cold mutton is delicious with guava-jelly
                                   And does not seriously incommode
                                   Like cold lead in the belly.

                                               Philip Sherlock (1986) ‘Dinner Party 1940’, in: Paula Burnett (ed.)
