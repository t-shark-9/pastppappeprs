Provisional marking

During the early period of your marking your principal examiner will contact you to discuss
the standard of marking and the interpretation of the marking notes. Before this discussion,
it is necessary to have marked provisionally (in pencil) about ten scripts.

If your principal examiner has failed to make contact with you, please try to make contact
with him or her yourself, by phone or e-mail.


                                  ASSESSMENT CRITERIA

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustrations/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

The passages offer candidates a variety of possibilities for analysis and interpretation. The test of
any interpretation is that it has to be tied carefully to the words, images and relevant details of
the text. “Personal response”, in the same way, must be tied to the passage.

In the descriptor for level 2, there may be other conditions under which a “2” may be awarded,
such as a limited use of evidence or a generally weak response. Substantiation of points may be
made but be very weak/superficial.

What is sought by “personal response” is an individual voice and engagement with how the
text works. Engaged and individual commentaries will usually make themselves clear by the depth
of insight into the text and the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: The term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character, etc.,
attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                 –4–            M12/1/A1NOR/SP1/NOR/TZ0/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the commentary will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate.
Different conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches (including the line by line
analysis) are acceptable and will be judged on the basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should
remember that structure does not exist by itself, but any structure must be measured by appropriate
references to the passage or poem and by its capacity to integrate these towards the development of
an organized and coherent commentary.

Reminder: In this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a four, you should ensure that these are well-founded
before awarding a three. The breadth of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners
reluctant to award four.

Use judgment when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation; therefore do not
unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only a part of this criterion.         Ensure that all the other elements are
considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on the other criteria, and vice versa.

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good responses.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.
                                                –5–           M12/1/A1NOR/SP1/NOR/TZ0/XX/M


The following elements are particularly relevant to criteria A, B and C.

Question 1. Prose

A barely satisfactory answer will describe the incident in the text (the main character’s
recollection of memories from his childhood). Furthermore, the candidate will identify some
literary devices in the text (e.g. the snail) and describe the relationship between the main character
and his father, and to some extent interpret this relationship. The candidate will comment on the
sickness that the main character feels after eating the snail, but will not necessarily use correct
vocabulary for literary analysis.

A better answer will describe the plot in a more thorough and satisfactory manner. The candidate
will also interpret the snail and comment on the significance of this for the meaning of the text as a
whole. The candidate should also comment on the language used in the text. The candidate will
not necessarily use correct vocabulary for literary analysis, but will demonstrate adequate
understanding of the author’s use of literary devices.

The best answers will identify many of the literary devices in the text (e.g. what the snail and use
of memory imply) and use well-chosen examples. Furthermore, the candidate will reflect upon the
effect these have on the reader. The candidate should, more or less, use correct literary terms for
literary analysis in a way that shows their understanding of these devices. The best answers will
also provide precise observations on the main features of the passage based on a close reading of
the text.


Question 2. Poem

A barely satisfactory answer will identify the most important literary device in the poem (the
repetition) and will make some attempt to interpret beyond the basic meaning of the lines of the
poem. The candidate must comment on the questions raised at the end of the poem and reflect upon
who the second person pronoun may refer to. The candidate will not necessarily use the correct
vocabulary for literary analysis.

A better answer will include the features mentioned above and, in addition, will reflect more
independently on the different repetitions in the poem. The candidate will also comment on the
rhythm and reflect upon what this has to say for the meaning of the poem as a whole.
The candidate will also comment on the form and structure of the poem. The candidate will provide
an interpretation of who the second person pronoun may refer to. The candidate will demonstrate
an adequate understanding of the poet’s use of literary devices.

The best answers will include the features mentioned above. In addition, the candidate will
comment on how the form and repetitions/rhythm influence the content. The candidate will also
give a plausible interpretation of who the second person pronoun may refer to, and relate the
“conclusion” (“the winter had come over night”) to the rest of the poem. The best answers will also
provide precise observations on the main features of the poem based on a close reading of the text.
