Provisional marking

During the early period of your marking your team leader (or principal examiner in the case
of team leaders) will contact you to discuss the standard of marking and the interpretation of
the marking notes. Before this discussion, it is necessary to have provisionally marked
(in pencil) about ten scripts.

If your team leader has failed to make contact with you, please try to make contact with her
or him yourself, by phone or e-mail.

                                   ASSESSMENT CRITERIA

Criteria A and B

The danger of rewarding or penalizing the use of illustration/references/quotations twice in both
these categories should be avoided.

Criterion B

“Personal response” and “independence of thought” appear as the levels of the descriptors increase.
What is sought is an engaged and individual treatment of the chosen topic. Engaged and individual
essays will usually make themselves clear by showing insight into the implications of the question
and the quality and interest of the details cited in support.

The first person singular does not automatically constitute a personal response and conversely an
impersonal academic style does not necessarily indicate a lack of personal response.

Criterion C

It is expected that every question set will provide candidates with ample opportunities to
demonstrate their awareness of the demands of this criterion. However, where a question does not
explicitly offer such opportunities, examiners should interpret criterion C broadly in order to ensure
that candidates are not unfairly disadvantaged. In such cases it would be sufficient for candidates
to show, as appropriate to the question, an awareness of how elements such as plot, character,
setting, structure, voice, etc., are used by writers to meet their purposes. No matter how the
question is phrased, candidates must also address related matters of style and technique.

“Awareness” and “appreciation” of literary features are the key elements under this criterion.
The mere labelling, without appreciation, of literary features will not score the highest marks.
On the other hand, the candidate who is attentive to literary features and deals with them in a
meaningful way, but who does not consistently use the vocabulary of literary criticism, can still be
awarded the higher achievement levels.

Reminder: the term “literary features” is broad and includes elements as basic as plot, character,
etc., attention to which is valid and must be rewarded as appropriate.
                                                 –4–            M12/1/A1ENG/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Criterion D

Any form of structuring to the essay will be rewarded if it is effective and appropriate. Different
conventions are in operation and therefore all approaches are acceptable and will be judged on the
basis of their effectiveness. Examiners should remember that structure does not exist by itself,
but any structure must be measured by appropriate reference to the terms of the question and by its
capacity to integrate these towards the development of an organized and coherent essay.

Reminder: In this criterion, supporting examples must be evaluated in terms of how fluently they
are incorporated/integrated to shape/advance the argument, not in terms of their appropriateness
or accuracy.

Criterion E

If you have reservations about awarding a four, you should ensure that these are well-founded
before awarding a three. The broadness of achievement in level three sometimes makes examiners
reluctant to award four.

Judgment needs to be used when dealing with lapses in grammar, spelling and punctuation;
therefore do not unduly penalize.

Mechanical accuracy is only part of this criterion. Ensure that all the other elements are considered.

Examiners should be careful to avoid being prejudiced in their application of this criterion by
achievement levels in other criteria. It is possible to score highly on this criterion even if candidates
have scored in the lower levels on other criteria, and vice versa.

These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a
supplement to the published external assessment criteria for written paper 2. They are not
offered as an exhaustive and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must
rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded
as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested
here should not be so heavily penalized as to distort appreciation of individuality.

With reference to criterion C, the better answers will contain examples that show a
satisfactory sense of stylistic features with some awareness of their effects, using critical
analysis and pertinent detail.

The best answers will show a strong sense of the stylistic and comparable features of the
works, as well as the effects of these features.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

These apply to all answers below.
                                               –5–           M12/1/A1ENG/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M




All satisfactory to good answers must include some pertinent detail (described, paraphrased
or directly quoted) to support assertions and reveal knowledge of the texts studied. Relevant
discussion of literary features must appear in every response. Answers should evince some
discernible form of organization and demonstrate standard written English.

Very good to excellent answers must be grounded in the features demanded for “satisfactory”
answers and may go beyond that basis in the ways described below as well as in other,
perhaps somewhat unpredictable, directions which show individual thinking and an engaged,
well-supported address of the texts.

Drama

1.   A satisfactory to good answer will define and identify instances of change and/or
     transformation in the works studied and offer some comment on their effect, discussing
     relevant examples. Candidates may choose to focus on aspects of content (e.g. character,
     theme, setting), dramatic action, speech, motif, mood or any other reasonable interpretation of
     the term.

     A very good to excellent answer is likely to respond to the prompt offered by “idea” and
     explore both more closely and more broadly how transformation is portrayed, and consider its
     dramatic impact on the work as a whole. A clear line of argument may be supported with
     more apt examples insightfully discussed.


2.   A satisfactory to good answer will demonstrate an understanding of the difference between
     formal and informal speech and its application in the works chosen. Supporting examples
     will be relevant.

     A very good to excellent answer may look at examples of informal and formal speech and
     more closely explore the relationship between the two and the contribution this makes to the
     drama as a whole. A clearly structured answer may be well-supported with carefully chosen
     and analysed examples.
                                             –6–           M12/1/A1ENG/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Poetry

Poems should be taken from the works of at least two poets.

If a candidate fails to use at least two poets, mark down two levels in both criterion A,
Knowledge and Understanding of Works and criterion B, Response to the Question.

Contrary to previous instructions, answers must not be penalized for using two poems only,
providing each poem is by a different poet.

3.   A satisfactory to good answer will respond to the prompt, identifying and commenting on the
     way particular thoughts, feelings and sights are captured in the chosen works and commenting
     on the poets’ purpose for doing this (purpose will include discussion of effects).

     A very good to excellent answer may respond to the prompt in a more evaluative, purposeful
     and thorough way. There may be a more sophisticated consideration of why these things are
     felt worthy of being “preserved”.


4.   A satisfactory to good answer will clearly identify specific examples of harmony and discord
     and the tension between them in the poems studied. Examiners should be sensitive to a wide
     range of approaches to harmony and discord.

     A very good to excellent answer may engage critically with the topic; ideas may be developed
     in a clearly structured argument, with more probing analysis of aptly chosen examples
     including their effects on the work as a whole.
                                               –7–            M12/1/A1ENG/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


Prose: The Novel and Short Story

5.   A satisfactory to good answer will identify and offer a clear interpretation of “small
     moments” (examiners should be alert to a range of possibilities here) and their significance in
     the works as a whole.

     A very good to excellent answer may offer a more well-organised, sophisticated and
     analytical discussion of the “moments” chosen and a more perceptive analysis and
     understanding of their role in the greater work.


6.   A satisfactory to good answer will identify a particular antagonist or antagonists in the chosen
     works and show some awareness of their role and significance.

     A very good to excellent answer may provide a more sophisticated analysis (e.g. going
     beyond mere character study) and demonstrate greater sensitivity to the function and effect of
     the antagonist(s) within the works as a whole.



Prose: Other than the Novel and Short Story

7.   A satisfactory to good answer will provide a definition of “home” (this could include literal
     and figurative interpretations of the term), will identify appropriate examples and will pay
     some attention to its presentation and significance in the works.

     A very good to excellent answer may contain a more sophisticated exploration of the
     presentation of “home” and an evaluation of its literary significance in the works as a whole.


8.   A satisfactory to good answer will consider whether readers choose non-fiction because of
     curiosity or style, or both. With reference to the works chosen it will give examples which
     demonstrate the importance of style, curiosity or both.

     A very good to excellent answer may offer a more perceptive and compelling evaluation of
     the implications of the prompt. Examples will be more effectively chosen and used, and
     analysis more detailed.
                                               –8–           M12/1/A1ENG/SP2/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


General Questions on Literature

9.    A satisfactory to good answer will define and identify instances of innocence in the chosen
      works (a variety of interpretations of the term may be offered). It will provide some analysis
      of the impact of innocence in the works and its degree of importance.

      A very good to excellent answer may respond to the question in a more purposeful and
      evaluative way, with more awareness of the significance of innocence as a feature of
      the works.


10.   A satisfactory to good answer will identify examples of, and the means by which, irony and/or
      humour are created and to what end. Answers will be illustrated with relevant and
      useful examples.

      A very good to excellent answer may offer a more subtle understanding of the ways in which
      irony and/or humour are created and used in the works as a whole. Examples will be more
      precisely chosen and analysis more detailed.


11.   A satisfactory to good answer will need to define “commitment” and the ways in which it is
      depicted in the chosen works. Some assessment of its contribution to the works as a whole
      will be made.

      A very good to excellent answer may respond to the question in a more evaluative and
      purposeful way, exploring a variety of interpretations of the term “commitment” with
      judiciously chosen examples.


12.   A satisfactory to good answer will identify structure and theme in the chosen works. The
      answer may seek to challenge or support the prompt using well-chosen and
      relevant examples.

      A very good to excellent answer may engage with the prompt in a more sophisticated way,
      and offer grounds for both challenging and supporting the prompt. Examples will be selected
      and analysed with greater discernment.
