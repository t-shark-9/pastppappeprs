All adequate to good answers must include some pertinent detail (described, paraphrased or
directly quoted) to support assertions and reveal knowledge of the texts studied. Relevant
discussion of literary features must appear in every response. Answers should demonstrate
some discernible form of organization and demonstrate standard use of language.

A good to excellent answer must be grounded in the features demanded for “adequate”
answers. In going beyond those features, it may be in the ways described below as well as in
other, somewhat unpredictable ways which show individual thinking and an engaged,
well-supported address of the texts.

     female characters in the works studied. Furthermore, they will discuss the significance of the
     use of these female characters to their overall understanding of the plays.

     A good to excellent answer will analyse and compare in more detail how female characters have
     been presented in the works studied, and to what extent this has influenced their overall
     understanding of the plays.


2.   An adequate to good answer will give examples of how the plays studied deal with the past.
     They will also try to compare and contrast the ways in which the plays treat things that have
     already happened.

     A good to excellent answer will present a deeper understanding of how the plays deal with
     the past. They will also compare and contrast, with the use of pertinent examples, how the
     authors treat things that have already happened.
