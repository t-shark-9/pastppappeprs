                                    Birth of the Owl Butterflies

                              They hung in our kitchen for days:
                              a row of brown lanterns that threw no light,
                              merely darkened with their growing load.
                              Pinned to a shelf among the knick-knacks
                          5   and the cookery books;
                              ripening in the radiator’s heat:
                              six Central American Caligo chrysalids,
                              five thousand miles from their mountain home.

                              My father had brought them here,
                         10   carefully packed in cotton wool,
                              to hatch, set, identify, and display:
                              these unpromising dingy shells plumped up
                              like curled leaves, on each a silver spur,
                              a tiny gleam or drop of dew,
                         15   Nature had added as a finishing touch
                              to perfect mimicry.

                              For weeks the wizened fruit had been maturing.
                              Now, one by one, the pods exploded,
                              crackling in the quiet kitchen,
                         20   and a furry missile emerged – quickly,
                              as if desperate to break free –
                              unhinged its awkward legs,
                              hauling behind it, like a frilly party dress,
                              the rumpled mass of its soft wings.

                         25   It clung unsteadily to the cloven1 pod,
                              while slow wings billowed with the blood
                              that pumped them full.
                              The dark velvet began to glow
                              with a thousand tiny striations2,
                         30   and there, in each corner,
                              boldly ringed in black and gold,
                              two fierce owl-eyes widened.

                                               Uneasy minutes, these, before Caligo
                                               can flex its nine-inch wings and fly.
                                    35         They drooped still, gathering strength,
                                               limp flags loosely flowing.
                                               When two butterflies hatched too close,
                                               and clashed, each scrabbling for a footing,
                                               one fell and its wings flopped
                                    40         fatly on the kitchen floor.

                                               I pictured them shattering later
                                               on taps and cupboard corners;
                                               but my father gauged his moment well,
                                               allowed a first few timid forays,
                                    45         then swooped down gentle-fingered
                                               with his glass jar for the kill.
                                               The monstrous wings all but filled it,
                                               beat vigorously, fluttered, and were still.


                                                                                   ©Ruth Sharman. Used with permission.
