Extended response questions - quality of construction

        Extended response questions for SL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
         awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   10.0 − 8.0 = 2 mg CO2 dm–2 hr–1 (units needed)                                              [1]
           Accept answers in the range of (1.9–2.1)mg CO2 dm–2 hr–1 to 2.1 mg CO2 dm–2 hr–1.
           Do not accept negative values in the final answer.

     (b)   (i)    net photosynthesis of control is always greater than plants exposed to UV;
                  UV causes a sharp drop in net photosynthesis (after day 3) while control
                  rises slightly/remains the same;
                  UV does not affect the net photosynthesis (rises slightly) between day 1 and
                  day 3 while control drops slightly in same period;                               [2 max]

           (ii)   the rate of respiration of control is less than plants exposed to UV;
                  respiration rate increased in the UV exposed plants early/days 1 to 2 / little
                  change occured as the experiment progressed/days 4 and 7 while control
                  plants remain more stable/slightly decrease;
                  there are more fluctuations/variability/increases and decreases in the
                  respiration rate of the UV exposed plants than in control plants;                [2 max]

     (c)   production of O2;
           increase/change in biomass;                                                                 [2]
           Accept alternate valid techniques for measuring photosynthetic rate eg starch
           production.

     (d)   (greater) decrease in (net) photosynthesis / decrease in oxygen production / less
           CO2 uptake;
           slower growth / reduced (rate of) biomass production;
           (slightly) more respiration;                                                            [2 max]

     (e)   net photosynthesis for unshaded plants always greater than the shaded / unshaded
           was always more than 10 mg CO2 dm–2 while shaded was always less than 10 mg
           CO2 dm–2;
           (overall) both decreased with increasing UV doses/(overall) negative relationship;
           net photosynthesis reduced more for shaded than unshaded plants;
           as UV increases there was greater fluctuation in the response of unshaded plants
           than in shaded;                                                                         [2 max]

     (f)   increase the greenhouse effect (as UV decreases photosynthesis) so there is less
           uptake of CO2 / more accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere / OWTTE                          [1]

     (g)   plants affected most near the poles/have lowest photosynthesis;
           because more UV there (has greatest impact);
           because lowest light intensity (has greatest impact);                                   [2 max]

           by means of photosynthesis/converted to chemical energy/organic compounds;
           plants use part of energy for own energy requirements/lost through cell
           respiration;
           consumers use energy for own requirements from organisms in previous trophic
           level;
           energy travels between trophic levels/producer to 1st consumer/1st consumer to
           2nd consumer/2nd consumer to 3rd consumer;
           not all material is assimilated/consumed / not digested / lost in feces / OWTTE;
           only a small amount of energy/(approximately) 10–20% is passed between trophic
           levels / most/80–90%/a large amount of the energy of a trophic level is lost (and
           not transferred);
           loss of energy from organisms in form of heat;
           energy is not recycled in an ecosystem (but nutrients are);                           [6 max]

     (c)   pancreatic cells monitor the blood glucose concentrations;
           alpha and beta cells are in the islets of Langerhans;
           negative feedback mechanisms;
           send hormones (through bloodstream) to target organs;
           if too high, β cells (in pancreas) produce insulin;
           insulin stimulates liver/muscle cells to take up glucose;
           glucose is converted into glycogen (stimulated by insulin); (do not award this
           marking point where it is stated that insulin directly converts glucose)
           lowering blood glucose level;
           other cells are stimulated to absorb glucose and use it in cell respiration;
           if glucose levels too low, α cells (in pancreas) produce glucagon;
           glucagon stimulates liver/muscle cells to break down glycogen; (do not award
           this marking point where it is stated that glucagon directly breaks down glycogen)
           and release glucose into the blood;
           raising the blood glucose level;                                                      [8 max]
