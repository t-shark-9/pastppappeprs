1.      Each row in the ‘Question’ column relates to the smallest subpart of the question.

2.      The maximum mark for each question subpart is indicated in the ‘Total’ column.

3.      Each marking point in the ‘Answers’ column is shown by means of a tick () at the end of the marking point.

4.      A question subpart may have more marking points than the total allows. This will be indicated by ‘max’ written after the mark in the ‘Total’
        column. The related rubric, if necessary, will be outlined in the ‘Notes’ column.

5.      An alternative wording is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by a slash (/). Either wording can be accepted.

6.      An alternative answer is indicated in the ‘Answers’ column by ‘OR’ on the line between the alternatives. Either answer can be accepted.

                                                                                                                                       continued …

7.    Words in angled brackets ‹ › in the ‘Answers’ column are not necessary to gain the mark.

8.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

9.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the ‘Answers’ column, unless stated otherwise in the ‘Notes’ column.

10.   If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of equivalent significance, detail and validity
      as that in the ‘Answers’ column then award the mark. Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is
      emphasized by OWTTE (or words to that effect).

11.   Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is more important than grammatical accuracy.

12.   Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent marking points. If an error is made in the first
      marking point then it should be penalized. However, if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow
      through marks should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script. ‘ECF acceptable’ will
      be displayed in the ‘Notes’ column.

13.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred to in the ‘Notes’ column.

    incoming information is only retained and processed if it is attended to in
    the short-term memory ‹STM›
    most/90 % of all information entering the STM is lost within 10 seconds                                         4 max

    retention and passage to the long-term memory are dependent on rehearsal
    that is processed mentally/physically/both
    the STM has a small capacity/space limitation
    the long-term memory has large capacity/no space limitations
    the way we overcome the limited capacity of the short term memory is by
    the use of selective attention

d   selective attention:
    selective attention ‹SA› operates in the short term sensory store ‹STSS›
    only the relevant information is passed to the short-term memory ‹STM›
    where it is held for several seconds
    information selected to the STM can be determined through previous
    experience and information in the LTM
    SA ensures that information overload does not occur and prevents
    confusion as the brain would not be able to cope with streams of
    information
    a filtering mechanism operates, which separates the relevant information
    from the irrelevant ‹noise› information so that athletes concentrate on one
    cue/stimulus ‹for example the ball, position of player in a game of tennis›
    to the exclusion of others
    SA is very important when accuracy/fast responses are required
    SA      can     be     improved       by     learning      through     past
    experience/practice/coaching
    which improves a person’s anticipation/interaction with long-term
    memory/memory trace
