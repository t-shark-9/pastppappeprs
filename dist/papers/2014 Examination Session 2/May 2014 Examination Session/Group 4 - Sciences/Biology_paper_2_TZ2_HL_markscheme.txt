Extended response questions - quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg. within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

1.   (a)   42 (%) (units not required)                                                                 [1]

     (b)   (all) epipelagic species spend less time diving / benthic spend more time;
           (thus) foraging behavior/feeding location affects diving time more than species;            [2]

     (c)   46 (cm3 kg–1) (accept answers in the range of 45.5 (cm3 kg–1) to 47 (cm3 kg–1))             [1]

     (d)   benthic (species) dive for longer (than epipelagic species);
           the longer the dive, the greater the oxygen stores / overall relationship is positive
           between dive duration and oxygen stores;
           oxygen store is variable in dives of same duration (in benthic)/per minute of dive;     [2 max]
           Award any other sensible point.

     (e)   (i)    the depth of the dives decreases (slightly) over time;
                  the length/duration of the dive increases (slightly) over time;
                  the frequency of the dives increases over time / time spent on surface
                  decreases;                                                                       [2 max]

           (ii)   in each dive the temperature difference decreases as the seals dive down and
                  increases (slowly) after they rise;
                  temperature difference decreases over time;
                  but in a variable, regular fashion;                                              [2 max]

     (f)   vasoconstriction of skin arterioles so less blood flows to the surface to prevent
           heat loss from blood;
           hypothalamus control with thermoreceptors/hormones to increase/decrease
           metabolism;
           layers of fat under the skin/insulating fur to conserve body heat;
           shivering to generate heat;                                                             [2 max]
           Accept other verifiable mechanisms explained.

     (g)   difference decreases (in each dive) with depth as skin temperature falls/decreases;
           there is heat loss from skin to water;
           vasoconstriction may reduce blood flow to the skin and thus reduce skin
           temperature;
           difference increases after surfacing (in each dive) because skin temperature
           increases/rises;
           increased metabolic/respiration rate (with more oxygen) may increase skin
           temperature;                                                                            [3 max]

     (h)   oxygen reserves used up after 3.5 minutes;
           need to replenish oxygen reserves on surface;
           too cold after 3.5 minutes;
           need to remain on surface to raise body temperature;
           have caught prey by 3.5 minutes / return to surface to eat prey;                        [3 max]

           smaller cells are more efficient at exchanging materials / rate of exchange of

5.   (a)   primary structure is the (number and) sequence/order of amino acids in a
           polypeptide;
           secondary structures are regularly repeating structures/β-pleated sheets/α-helices
           (held together by H-bonds);

     (b)   enzymes are (globular) proteins that are catalysts/lower activation energy of
           chemical reactions;

           explains specificity of enzyme-substrate;
           the substrate (key) fits into/has complementary shape to the active site (lock) of
           the enzyme;
           the active site can be changed by different chemicals/temperatures/pH so substrate
           cannot bind;
           induced-fit model:
           changes in the active site/conformational changes to allow substrate to bind;
           the substrate induces the active site to change;
           bonds weakened in the substrate (so easier to break);

     (b)   water must be absorbed by the seed (to become metabolically active);
           gibberellin is produced (in the embryo);
           stimulates production of amylase;
           which catalyses digestion of starch to maltose;
           maltose diffuses to the growing embryo root and shoot/growth regions;
           maltose is converted to glucose for (aerobic) cell respiration (to release energy);
           or to synthesize materials/cellulose for plant growth;                                   [5 max]

(c)   Krebs cycle only occurs in aerobic conditions;
      the Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondria;
      acetyl CoA from the link reaction releases an acetyl group;
      NADH+H+ and CO2 are formed (with each decarboxylation);
      decarboxylation/removal of CO2 involves oxidation/oxidative decarboxylation;
      and the release of energy;
      acetyl group is joined to a 4-carbon molecule/C4/oxaloacetate to form a 6-carbon
      molecule/citrate;
      (decarboxylation changes citrate) to 5-carbon molecule/C5;
      (decarboxylation changes glutamate) to a 4-carbon molecule/C4;
      then converted into the original 4-carbon molecule/C4/oxaloacetate and the cycle
      repeats;
      one (molecule) of ATP is made during this step;
      reduced H-carriers/ NADH and FADH2 and carbon dioxide are end-products of
      Krebs cycle;                                                                        [8 max]
