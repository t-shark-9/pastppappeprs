Subject Details: Design Technology SL Paper 3 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer questions from ONE of the Options [1 × 30 marks].
Maximum total = [30 marks]

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

      introducing computer numerically controlled (CNC) machines on the fixed and variable
      costs of a multinational company [3 max] per impact, [6 max] total.
      Fixed costs:
      the company will have to make a capital investment in CNC machines;
      so fixed costs will rise;
      the company will have to consider its return on investment/breakeven;

      Variable costs:
      labour costs should reduce;
      following an initial period of redundancy and retraining;
      fewer but probably better paid/more technical jobs;

      material costs should reduce;
      increased accuracy;
      fewer errors;                                                                                 [6 max]

      Note to markers: candidates may offer training as either a fixed (as a part of the
      purchase of the CNC machines) or variable costs (where additional costs may be
      incurred after the CNC machines have been installed) depending on the context, in this
      case either approach is acceptable and responses may be derived from more than one
      cluster.

      brand recognition/awareness;
      branding a product makes it easier to promote with potential consumers;
      this makes it easier to launch new products;

      co-creations of brands;
      consumer websites/Facebook/Twitter allow consumers to have their say and to
      contribute to the development of a brand;
      global brands have to develop mechanisms to support consumer involvement;

      a brand may not fit the culture of a particular country context;
      a brand may need to be adapted to meet particular requirements – glocalized;
      this poses challenges for global brands since digital technologies are not limited by
      country borders;                                                                        [9 max]

            leaves the thumb/fingers of the other hand free to press the buttons;

            the narrowing in the centre of the handset;
            makes it suitable for most sizes/children and adults/balances the weight of the
            handset;                                                                              [2 max]

      (c)   Award [1] for each of three distinct points in an explanation of one reason for
            using a colour scheme for the buttons on the handset shown in Figure E1 [3 max].
            colour schemes are used to differentiate between different functions/groups of
            functions;
            to facilitate ease of use;
            the black buttons relate to common functions on the TV (eg channel selection) /
            the blue buttons relate to additional features / the red, green, blue and yellow
            buttons relate to special functions / easy to learn / low memory burden – colour
            code / no need for glasses to read small print /no need for labels;

            convention/stereotyping;
            coding system enables ease of recognition of control functions;
            global product/easy to use in different contexts;                                     [3 max]

      (b)   Award [1] for stating one reason why some manufacturers choose to produce
            shirts in sizes small, medium and large and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
            cost effectiveness;
            range of sizes is smaller so potentially less manufacturing costs/wastage;

            consumers may buy the shirt to wear informally/loosely/without a tie;
            so neck size no longer as important/as long as it is big enough;                      [2 max]

            Do not award marks for consumer related reasons.

      per reason, [6 max] total.
      sample size of users;
      may not be representative of all the user population/people of different ethnicity;
      so measurements taken may not be totally accurate;

      date when the measurements were taken;
      dimensions of the user population may have changed since that date;
      due to diet/nutrition;

      difficult to measure people/reliability of the measuring;
      a tolerance is included to allow for a small amount of error;
      measuring instruments may not have been very accurate;

      dimensions are stated in whole numbers;
      actual measurements taken may have included decimal figures;
      numbers are rounded up for ease of use;                                                      [6 max]

      considerations in the design of a car seat belt for a volume-produced car in relation to
      anthropometrics, psychological and physiological factors [3 max] per factor, [9 max]
      total.
      Anthropometrics:
      data required for relevant aspects of body size (eg. dimensions of the
      abdomen/chest/height;
      dimensions to relate to all the user population;
      range of adjustability within 5th–95th percentile;

      Psychological:
      users must feel safe/reassured by the “click” with the seatbelt on;
      the driver must also be satisfied about the safety of passengers;
      and complying with legislation;

      Physiological:
      comfort/feel of the material is important to users;
      the range of adjustability of the belt must provide comfort for all users;
      the tension of the belt must provide safety but also ease-of-use by a wide range of users;       [9]
