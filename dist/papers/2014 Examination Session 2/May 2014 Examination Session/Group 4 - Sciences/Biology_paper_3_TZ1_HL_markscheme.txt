           both have a peak at 12–14 hours;
           SFS flies have higher mean life span than NFS flies / vice versa;
           (some) SFS flies live longer than 16 hours, NFS flies do not;
           (some) NFS flies live less than 10 hours, SFS flies do not;                        [3 max]

     (b)   SFS has the drier climate as SFS flies live longer (when subjected to drought
           stress);
           both SFS and NFS have similar climates as both SFS and NFS flies have peak at
           12–14 hours;                                                                       [1 max]

     (c)   NFS and SFS flies have different gene pools;
           abiotic differences between the two slopes create different selection pressures;
           genes/alleles for advantageous characteristics passed on from one generation to
           the next/become genetically different over time;
           may not mate / reproductive barriers/isolation leads to speciation;
           abiotic/geographical differences may not be sufficient to cause reproductive
           barrier;
           the gene pools may not be separated if flies can fly between sides of canyon/mix
           at base of canyon;                                                                 [3 max]

6.   development of bird song has both innate and learned components;
     when birds hatch they may possess a basic song (crude template);
     species specific (so inherited/innate/genetic);
     after hatching young birds hear songs from adults of their species;
     (so learn as) mimic/memorise/modify the basic template;
     song does not develop properly if the young bird does not hear other members of its
     species singing;
     some birds have a sensitive period of development when they learn;
     later young birds practise what they have heard;
     song becomes modified/improved to form mature adult song/ song perfected when birds
     become sexually mature;                                                               [6 max]

           Both needed for [1].

     (b)   both graphs show fluctuating patterns;
           malaria rises/falls later than/after rainfall;
           malaria peaks in July, rainfall peaks in May/Apr–May;
           June to November – little variation in rainfall, decline in cases of malaria;
           both decline August to December / during Mar–Apr malaria declines while rain
           fall increases;
           both show lowest value in December;                                                  [2 max]

     (c)   hypothesis supported:
           increased rainfall is followed by increased malaria / strong positive correlation
           between rainfall and number of (future) cases of malaria;
           rainfall provides pools for mosquito larvae to survive (when adults emerge later
           they spread the disease);

           hypothesis not supported:
           very large values of standard deviation suggests data is unreliable / malaria data
           less reliable than rainfall;
           correlation between malaria cases and rainfall does not prove causation;             [2 max]

                  reptiles/poor kitchen hygiene/raw eggs/unpasteurised milk.
                  treatment: rehydration/lots of drinking/intravenous fluids/antibiotics.

           (ii)   acids:
                  low pH/pickling/preservation in vinegar restricts growth of
                  microbes/denatures enzymes;
                  sugar:
                  sugar (added to food) dehydrates microbes so it restricts growth / microbes
                  lose water by osmosis;                                                                  [2]

Option H — Further human physiology

13.   (a)   510 – 90 = 420 (beats min–1) (accept 420/–420/decrease of 420)                               [1]
            Accept answers in the range 400–440.

      (b)   during diving heart rate decreases while arterial blood pressure increases;
            swimming causes little/no change from control in both heart rate and arterial
            blood pressure;
            diving produces greater change than swimming in heart rate and arterial blood
            pressure;
            little/no differences between rats diving voluntarily or submerged
            involuntarily;                                                                           [2 max]
            Award [1] if candidate describes swimming and diving for heart rate and then
            swimming and diving for arterial bp correctly.

      (c)   diving rats hold their breath while swimming rats do not;
            so heart rate decreases/peripheral blood vessels constrict in diving/submerged rats;
            swimming rats have no need for the diving response so little/no change from
            control;
            constriction of blood vessels in diving rats raises arterial blood pressure;
            diving response conserves oxygen (for essential functions);                              [2 max]

      (d)   heat loss (from skin) is greater in cold water therefore vasoconstriction is greater /
            vice versa;
            diving response slows heart rate so less blood flows to skin so less heat lost in
            cold water;
            increased vasoconstriction increases arterial blood pressure;
            vasoconstriction/increased blood pressure helps to maintain core temperature in
            cold water;
            decrease in body temperature causes heart rate to slow;                                  [2 max]



14.   (a)   (i)    steroid hormone: oestrogen/progesterone/testosterone;
                   protein hormone: ADH (vasopressin)/insulin/TRH;
                   other valid examples;                                                             [2 max]

            (ii)   presence of food/stretching of stomach stimulates endocrine glands
                   (in stomach wall);
                   gastrin secreted;
                   gastrin/hormone stimulates increased secretion of HCl;                            [2 max]

      (b)   increased CO2 in blood / lower blood pH;
            detected by chemosensors/chemoreceptors/receptors in aortic/carotid arteries;
            nerve impulses/messages sent to breathing centre of medulla/brain;
            breathing centres/medulla also monitor blood pH/CO2;
            (more) nerve impulses/messages sent to diaphragm and intercostal muscles
            (causing increased muscle contraction);                                                  [3 max]

15.   erythrocytes have a lifespan of approximately 120 days;
      erythrocytes rupture releasing hemoglobin into bloodstream;
      phagocytosis removes hemoglobin/erythrocytes;
      by Kupffer cells/macrophages;
      hemoglobin split into heme and globin;
      globins hydrolysed into amino acids;
      iron removed from heme;
      (heme) converted into (biliverdin then) bilirubin (bile pigment);
      iron stored/released into blood;                                                     [6 max]
