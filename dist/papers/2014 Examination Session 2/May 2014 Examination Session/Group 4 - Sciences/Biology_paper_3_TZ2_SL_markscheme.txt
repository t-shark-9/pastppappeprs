                  sunlight contains some UV;
                  (moderate) daily exposure to sunlight stimulates skin to produce vitamin D;
                  vitamin D may help prevent osteoporosis/rickets/weak bones/low
                  immunity/some cancers/cardiovascular disease;

           work rate so corresponds to highest data point for ventilation rate / OWTTE;              [2]

     (d)   stroke volume increases cardiac output only up to (about) 40 Lmin–1 ventilation

           benefit inconclusive / stretching prior to exercise controversial;                 [2 max]

     (b)   exercise increases the need for oxygen (to muscular tissue);
           increase in volume allows more air / oxygen in lungs;

15.   (a)   (nerve fibres in) optic nerves cross at optic chiasma;
            neurons from right visual fields from both eyes go to left brain/vice versa;
            visual areas in the brain can therefore judge distance/produce 3D image/give
            sense of depth;                                                                        [2 max]
            Do not award marks for stating that all impulses from the left eye pass to the right
               side of the brain and vice versa.

      (b)   (many) excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic neurons may be connected to
            postsynaptic neuron;
            impulses from excitatory neurons increase release of excitatory neurotransmitter
            (in synaptic cleft);
            impulses from inhibitory neurons increase release of inhibitory neurotransmitter
            in (synaptic cleft);
            effects of neurotransmitters combine/cancel each other to alter (probability of)
            action potential/firing in postsynaptic neuron;

Option F — Microbes and biotechnology

16.   (a)   1.0 (%)                                                                                    [1]

            Award [0] for 1 or no correct answer.                                                  [2 max]

      (c)   both (generally) increase ethanol concentration as they increase;
            cellulase has much greater effect than incubation time;
            incubation time effect eventually decreases slightly;                                  [2 max]

      (d)   reduced incubation time would not change ethanol concentration much;
            more product in less time (improves profit) / little increase in yield for a greater
            expense due to a longer period of incubation is not worth while;
            changing cellulase concentration has greater effect on yield;                          [2 max]
            Do not accept “cellulose” instead of “cellulase”.

            virus may revert to original form causing (viral) disease;
            can induce tumor if gene inserted in incorrect position;
            may affect reproductive cells;
            gene therapy often fails and this leads to disappointment / decades of experimentation
