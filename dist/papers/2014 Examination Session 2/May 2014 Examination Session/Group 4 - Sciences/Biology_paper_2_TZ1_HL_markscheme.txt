Extended response questions - quality of construction

      Extended response questions for HL P2 carry a mark total of [20]. Of these marks, [18] are
       awarded for content and [2] for the quality of construction of the answer.

      Two aspects are considered:
        expression of relevant ideas with clarity
        structure of the answers.

      [1] quality mark is to be awarded when the candidate satisfies EACH of the following criteria.
       Thus [2] quality marks are awarded when a candidate satisfies BOTH criteria.

     Clarity of expression:
        The candidate has made a serious and full attempt to answer all parts of the question and the
        answers are expressed clearly enough to be understood with little or no re-reading.

     Structure of answer:
        The candidate has linked relevant ideas to form a logical sequence within at least two parts
        of the same question (eg within part a and within part b, or within part a and within part c
        etc. but not between part a and part b or between part a and part c etc.).

                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   53 (%) (allow a range from 52 to 54 %)                                                    [1]

     (b)   proteasome inhibitor decreases survival;
           small decrease/fluctuations/little difference initially and larger decrease above
           10/at 20;                                                                                 [2]
           Reject negative correlation.

     (c)   (i)    systolic: 34 (mm2) (allow a range of 33.5 to 34.5 mm2)
                  diastolic: 77.5 (mm2) (allow a range of 77–78mm2)                                  [1]
                  Both needed for [1].

           (ii)   10 (mm2) (allow a range of 9 to 11 mm2)                                            [1]
                  Do not penalise if no working.

     (d)   increases systolic area but decreases (mean) diastolic relative to control;
           systolic effects larger / significant differences with systolic but not diastolic;
           differences between control and treatment get less after treatment/from Day 14
           with systolic area but stay about the same with diastolic;                            [2 max]
           Reject answers stating that the diastolic area is increased.

     (e)   (hypothesis supported as) treated area decreases/differences decrease between
           treated and untreated area after end of treatment/after Day 21/after Day 14;
           (hypothesis not supported as) at the end of the experiment/21 days after the end of
           treatment/on day 42 there is still a significant difference;                              [2]
           N.B. the question refers only to the systolic area – do not award marks for
           answers relating to diastolic area.

     (f)   small reduction after one week and (much) larger reduction after three weeks;
           the longer the treatment the larger the reduction/reduces oxygen consumption over
           time;                                                                                 [1 max]

           ATP production requires oxygen;                                                       [2 max]

     (h)   One marking point corresponds to each of the three graphs in both pros and cons.
           might be safe because:
           does not affect heart cell survival (significantly) at concentrations below 20;
           effect on systolic area/on heart seems to be reversible;
           oxygen consumption does not drop much in the first week (of treatment);
           could be dangerous due to:
           reduced survival/death of non-tumor/cardiac muscle cells / non-specific;
           reduced volume/pressure of blood pumped by heart / more blood left in ventricles;
           reduced aerobic respiration/mitochondrial activity / damage to mitochondria;          [3 max]
           Do not award marks for answers that merely restate data from the graphs such as
           systolic area or oxygen consumption are reduced.
