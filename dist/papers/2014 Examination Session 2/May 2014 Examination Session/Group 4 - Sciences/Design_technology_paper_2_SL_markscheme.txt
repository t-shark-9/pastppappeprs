Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A (total 20 marks) ONE question in
Section B [20 marks]. Maximum total = 40 marks.

1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      OWTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However, if
      the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                                               SECTION A

1.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for stating one reason why the Cheetah blade has been designed
                  to absorb vertical shock.
                  if the Cheetah blade did not absorb the shock it would be transmitted to the
                  runners body/could cause injury/discomfort/reduced performance;                       [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for stating one benefit of using carbon fibre composite for the
                  Cheetah blade in relation to strength-to-weight ratio [1 max].
                  carbon fibre is extremely strong but very lightweight/high strength to weight ratio;
                  the Cheetah blade only weighs 512 g but can be used by someone weighing up
                   to 147 kg;
                  the Cheetah blade needs to be very lightweight in order for athletes to be
                   able to perform well and must also be very strong/withstand high loads;          [1 max]

           (iii) Award [1] for reason why materials development for the Cheetah blade took
                 so long even though carbon fibre is not a new material and [1] for a brief
                 explanation [2 max].
                 composite materials are designed for specific purposes;
                 obtaining the correct composition of the material for such a specific
                 application would be a complex/time-consuming process;

                  development of new materials is costly;
                  the company needs to ensure that the necessary funds are in place to support
                      on-going development;                                                             [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for a reason for designing the Cheetah blade so that the toe
                  shape can be customized and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  the toe shape will affect balance/grip;
                  different shapes are required due to the variation in sizes of athletes/the way
                  athletes run;                                                                         [2]

           (ii)   Award [1] for a reason for designing the Cheetah blade so the tread plate can
                  be customized and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  athletes run on different surfaces in competitions;
                  attaching the correct tread plate for the running surface will optimise
                  performance;                                                                          [2]
                                                  –5–                M14/4/DESTE/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


     (c)   (i)    Award [1] for stating the manufacturing technique for the Cheetah blade.
                  moulding;                                                                        [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why
                  the Cheetah blade is manufactured in different thicknesses [3 max].
                  the thickness of the blade affects its stiffness;
                  optimum stiffness is required so that the Cheetah blade flexes enough to
                  provide the energy;
                  different body weights of athletes will require different thicknesses of
                  Cheetah blade in order to achieve the optimum performance;                       [3]


2.   (a)   Award [1] for stating the percentile that would be used to decide the maximum
           height for a supermarket shelf.
           50th (adult);                                                                           [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of why
           percentile ranges for the stature (height) of adults are based on the 19–65 age
           range [3 max].
           by the age of 19 years most people have reached maturity in relation to height/will
           not grow taller;
           after the age of 65 years most people reduce in stature;
           due to shortening/curvature of the spine/stooping;                                      [3]


3.   (a)   Award [1] for a definition of planned obsolescence.
           a conscious act either to ensure a continuing market or to ensure that safety factors
           and new technologies can be incorporated into later versions of the product;            [1]

     (b)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in an explanation of how the
           work of a designer influences both the cost and the value of a product [3 max].
           decisions concerned with choice of materials/ease-of-production/surface finish/etc
           affect the cost/ WTTE;
           such decisions impact on a product’s characteristics/performance/aesthetics/retail
           cost;
           which determine the value to a consumer;                                                [3]

4.   (a)   (i)    Award [1] for stating a reason why analogy may have been the primary
                  generator of ideas for the chair.
                  the shape is like a nest, cocoon or shell / the idea has been taken from a
                  different context;                                                                  [1]

           (ii)   Award [1] for a possible reason for the name of the chair and [1] for a brief
                  explanation [2 max].
                  the name suggests a private (secret);
                  place for fun/entertainment/place for children to play (clubhouse);                 [2]

           (iii) Award [1] for stating the type of production system for the chair and [1] for
                 a brief explanation [2 max].
                 craft;
                 the nature of the woven structure would be difficult/not cost-effective for
                 mechanization/automation;                                                            [2]

     (b)   (i)    Award [1] for stating the percentile used to decide the height of the seat
                  from the floor.

             the wood may become mouldy/stained/textile seat become dirty;
             needs to be treated/cleaned regularly;

             the textile for the seat cover;
             needs to be easy to clean;

             the construction of the interwoven frame;
             makes it difficult to apply a protective surface finish to all edges;

             leaves blown by the wind;
             could become trapped inside the chair;

             birds/animals;
             might be attracted to use the chair for refuge/nesting;                          [2 max]

      (ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct points in a discussion of each of
             three possible reasons why the Secret Clubhouse chair is likely to have a
             relatively high price when marketed [3 max] per reason [9 max].
             the product will not be high volume and so economies of scale will not
             be achieved;
             it would not be cost-effective to create tooling to manufacture the chair
             by automation;
             so expensive craft skills will be used;

             design/manufacturing costs will be high;
             the costs will not be spread across a high volume of sales;
             the individuality/originality of the design requires much skill/time;

             perceived value;
             consumers expect high quality products to be relatively expensive;
             and would assume inferior materials and construction techniques had been
             used if the product was cheap;

             consumers with a high disposable income;
             look to purchase novel/original designs;
             and expect to/are willing to pay highly for them;                                [9 max]

                  so the seat has a long life cycle and little/no planned obsolescence built in;

                  the car seat is made from durable/long-lasting materials;
                  the cover is removable for cleaning;
                  or it can be replaced to ensure a long life cycle for the seat;

                  although the seat is made from a tough/durable plastic with a long life cycle;
                  the various straps/fastenings may become loose/broken as the child wriggles
                  around in the seat/causes damage to them;
                  and so reducing the product life cycle;

                  the seat is manufactured from a thermoset plastic/polyurethane;
                  which is not easy to recycle;
                  that poses disposal issues;                                                       [3 max]

     (c)   (i)    Award [1] for a reason why the fabric cover for the car seat is designed to
                  be breathable and [1] for a brief explanation [2 max].
                  so when the car seat is used for a long time/in hot conditions moisture from
                  perspiration does not accumulate between the surface of the seat and the
                  body causing discomfort;
                  the breathable fabric allows air to escape from the foam;
                  so the foam will mould better to the individual shape of the child;               [2 max]
                                        – 11 –                M14/4/DESTE/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M



(ii)   Award [1] for each of three distinct correct in a discussion of how the
       evaluation strategies of user trial, field trial and performance testing would
       have been used in the design development of the car seat [3 max] per
       strategy [9 max].
       user trial:
       the seat is intended to be used a wide age range/9 weeks–12 years;
       users representing different ages/sizes within this range would be observed
       using the chair;
       to test for adjustability of straps/cushions or comfort levels;

       adults would be observed securing children in the car seat;
       to test that a range of different adults can easily make adjustments to the fit
       of the chair;
       with one hand;

       field trial:
       children and adults would be asked to use the chair for different journey
       ranges/road surfaces in order to test for safety/comfort;
       over different periods of time;

       the car seat is designed for use in a wide range of different types of vehicles;
       which will have varied shapes/sizes of rear seats;
       the car seat will need to be tested by users with different types of cars to
       ensure that the car seat is suitable;

       performance test:
       the car seat is designed to protect children if the car brakes suddenly/is in
       a collision;
       dummies of different sizes/weights representing the intended child
       age range;
       will need to be used for crash testing;

       materials testing for car seat cover;
       testing for toughness/durability;
       ease of maintenance for cleaning/hygiene;

       materials testing for polyurethane foam;
       to test for suitable densities;
       in relation to comfort/safety/different user weight;

       stress tests for the straps;
       to ensure high enough factor of safety;
       so providing extra safety;

       tests for the locking mechanism;
       to ensure they are reliable;
       and the mechanism will not wear with continual use;                                [9 max]
