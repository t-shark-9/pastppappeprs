1.   Follow the markscheme provided, award only whole marks and mark only in RED.

2.   Make sure that the question you are about to mark is highlighted in the mark panel on the
     right-hand side of the screen.

3.   Where a mark is awarded, a tick/check () must be placed in the text at the precise point where it
     becomes clear that the candidate deserves the mark. One tick to be shown for each mark awarded.

4.   Sometimes, careful consideration is required to decide whether or not to award a mark. In these
     cases use Scoris™ annotations to support your decision. You are encouraged to write comments
     where it helps clarity, especially for re-marking purposes. Use a text box for these additional
     comments. It should be remembered that the script may be returned to the candidate.

5.   Personal codes/notations are unacceptable.

6.   Where an answer to a part question is worth no marks but the candidate has attempted the
     part question, enter a zero in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Where an answer
     to a part question is worth no marks because the candidate has not attempted the part question,
     enter an “NR” in the mark panel on the right-hand side of the screen.

7.   If a candidate has attempted more than the required number of questions within a paper or section
     of a paper, mark all the answers. Scoris™ will only award the highest mark or marks in line with
     the rubric.

8.   Ensure that you have viewed every page including any additional sheets. Please ensure that you
     stamp “seen” on any page that contains no other annotation.

9.   Mark positively. Give candidates credit for what they have achieved and for what they have
     got correct, rather than penalizing them for what they have got wrong. However, a mark should not
     be awarded where there is contradiction within an answer. Make a comment to this effect using a
     text box or the “CON” stamp.

Subject Details: Environmental Systems and Societies SLP2 Markscheme
Mark Allocation

Candidates are required to answer ALL questions in Section A [25 marks] and TWO questions in
Section B [40 marks]. Maximum total = [65 marks].


1.    A markscheme often has more marking points than the total allows. This is intentional.

2.    Each marking point has a separate line and the end is shown by means of a semicolon (;).

3.    An alternative answer or wording is indicated in the markscheme by a slash (/). Either wording can
      be accepted.

4.    Words in brackets ( ) in the markscheme are not necessary to gain the mark.

5.    Words that are underlined are essential for the mark.

6.    The order of marking points does not have to be as in the markscheme, unless stated otherwise.

7.    If the candidate’s answer has the same “meaning” or can be clearly interpreted as being of
      equivalent significance, detail and validity as that in the markscheme then award the mark.
      Where this point is considered to be particularly relevant in a question it is emphasized by
      WTTE (or words to that effect).

8.    Remember that many candidates are writing in a second language. Effective communication is
      more important than grammatical accuracy.

9.    Occasionally, a part of a question may require an answer that is required for subsequent
      marking points. If an error is made in the first marking point then it should be penalized. However,
      if the incorrect answer is used correctly in subsequent marking points then follow through marks
      should be awarded. When marking, indicate this by adding ECF (error carried forward) on the
      script.

10.   Do not penalize candidates for errors in units or significant figures, unless it is specifically referred
      to in the markscheme.

                  spillages damage/pollute ecosystems /
                  non-renewable;

                  N.B. Award [1 mark] for every TWO correct entries, (two advantages, two
                  disadvantages or one of each). One correct entry will score zero, and three
                  correct entries will score only 1 mark.
                                                                                                [2 max]

           (ii)           = 1.6 % (allow 1.0 − 2.0 % );
                  12200
                  Or, if hydroelectricity is included: 4200/12200 = 35% (allow 33-37%)

                  N.B. Working and % sign are not necessary for credit in this question.
                  So award 1 mark for any value between 1-2 or 33-37.                           [1 max]

           (iii) Any two of: Asia Pacific / North America / Europe & Eurasia;                   [1 max]

     /solar/tidal/nuclear;
     increase efficiency of energy usage through technological development;
     increase awareness of energy-saving practice through education/campaigns;
     address issues of energy distribution through import/export;
     promote exploitation of locally appropriate/available energy sources to
     reduce need for import/export;
     seek new reserves of non-renewable energy resources/fossil fuels;
     provide technical support/economic subsidy for renewable/clean/efficient
     energy supply;
     imposing legislated caps/taxes/limitations to energy consumption/C
     production;
     anti-natalist policies reduce population growth and energy consumption;
     reducing energy consumption through recycling/reusing resources
     (recycling uses energy but less);

     Accept reasonable alternative responses.                                     [3 max]
     Question addresses strategies of global application Credit should be given
     for broad approaches and not specific actions.

     Eg “use public transport” is not acceptable, but “promoting/raising
     awareness of/subsidising public transport” would be acceptable.

     Eg “switching off lights” is not acceptable, but                 “raising
     awareness/promoting energy conservation” would be acceptable.                      .
                                             –8–              M14/4/ENVSO/SP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   (i)    carry out a baseline study before mining starts;
             …recording abiotic conditions/biodiversity/key species/habitats/resources;
             survey opinion/value systems/perspectives/social & economic interests of

      (ii)   toxic waste from tailing ponds may leak/evaporate & precipitate into nearby
             rivers or marshes;
             leaks from Keystone pipeline may pollute freshwater systems (eg Ogallala
             aquifer);
             extraction of water from the rivers (to pump underground) may deplete
             freshwater resources/only 10 % of the extracted water is returned;
             extraction involves deforestation that may lead to increase run-off/input to
             freshwater bodies causing flooding / deplete input to underground aquifers;
             deforestation may increase soil erosion and input of sediment to freshwater
             resources;
             thermal pollution/pumping steam underground may melt permafrost raising
             water table;
             Do not credit impacts from the USE of fossil fuels, only those that relate
             directly to exploitation/extraction.                                           [3 max]

      (iii) Any two of:
            low temperature (will limit productivity/population sizes/regeneration);
            short growing season (will limit productivity/population sizes/regeneration);
            its short/simple food chains (will be more vulnerable if species are lost);
            habitat will contain highly specialised/less adaptable species (prone to
            extinction);
            permafrost inhibits drainage/provides unstable substrate on melting (so
            vegetation more vulnerable);
            located in mining locality (so prone to pollution/habitat destruction);
            water table close to surface (so easily polluted from leakage/spills);
            reduced water supply (due to extraction for mining);                            [2 max]

      (iv) raise public awareness of the impacts through campaigns/protests/direct
            action/social media;
           lobby governments to legislate/control/monitor/stop mining companies;
           research effects of the industry on local environment/communities;
           participate in EIA to ensure reliability;

(c)   (i)    Award 1 max for general principle of dynamic nature to resources:
             human abilities to exploit materials/processes change over time;
             so their identification/value as ‘resources’ is dynamic/changing;
             ability to exploit materials/processes as resources may be limited by
              technology/economics/value systems;

             tar sands may become identified/more valued as a resource through…
             ...technological developments making their extraction possible/easier;
             ...rising price/scarcity of alternatives/oil;
             ...societies prioritising development/energy security over environment;
             ...technological development to mitigate C emissions;

             tar sands may become less valued/lose status of resource through…
             ...rise in ecocentric values;
             ...advances in renewable technologies;
             ...changing economic advice to investors;
             ...more rigorous carbon targets;
                                                                                                [3 max]

      (ii)   Wealthier regions will consume more energy per capita to support their
             lifestyles/cultures/more cars/consumerism (eg USA/Canada/Europe);
             Industrialised regions of heavy transport and commercialised agriculture
             will tend to have high per capita consumption;
             Regions where there is ample local supply (eg Gulf States) may consume
             more energy because it is cheaper;
             Regions with low populations but high industrial needs (eg Russia) will tend
             to have higher per capita consumption;
             Developing regions may give energy conservation low priority in pursuit of
             economic development (eg China);
             very hot/cold climates may increase per capita energy consumption for
             cooling/heating (eg Saudi/Canada);

             Note to markers: Question asks about energy consumption, NOT
             specifically the use of oil, so do not credit answers that just give reasons for
             using oil (rather than other sources). It also asks for WHY consumption is
             high, so do not credit responses that just indicate where it is high. It also
             addresses per capita consumption so do not credit high or dense
             populations as a reason.                                                           [1 max]

(iii) Award [1 max] for identifying a value system for both writers:
      writer A could be ecocentric/soft ecologist/deep ecologist and writer B
      could be /technocentric/cornucopian;

     Award [2 max] for linking value system with aspects of the texts:
     writer A focuses on negative aspects of mining suggesting an ecocentric
     perspective;
     writer A seems opposed to large scale technology/corporate business
     suggesting an ecocentric/soft-ecologistapproach;
     cartoon in A implies a moral/evil component to mining suggesting a deep
     ecologist’s appeal to rights of the environment;
     writer B seems in favour of exploiting non-renewable resources suggesting
     a cornucopian/technocentric value system;
     writer B appears to dismiss a loss of some forest habitat suggesting an
     cornucopian/technocentric perspective;
     illustration in B implies a technical solution of underground carbon
     capture/storage suggesting a technocentric approach;

     Do not allow anthropocentric/eco-manager (no evidence in text)

     Award 1 max for response that justifies A as being against mining and B in
     favour of mining without correctly identifying any value systems.

     Allow credit for any points of similar validity, relevance and significance.   [3 max]

     General Essay Markscheme
     Each essay is marked out of [20] of which [2] are for clarity of expression, structure and development
     of ideas.
             [0] Quality of expression, structure and development is poor.
             [1] Quality of expression, structure and development is limited.
             [2] Quality of expression is clear, structure is good and ideas are well developed.

     Do not penalize candidates for writing in bullet pointed lists – if this technique is used appropriately
     ie to summarize or outline a list of points within an essay at an appropriate point. However,
     a candidate who has not shown any evidence of being able to write a paragraph with a developed,
     logical line of reasoning would not be able to achieve maximum marks.


                                                  SECTION B


2.     (a)     (i)    Definition:
                      NSP = the gain by consumers in energy/biomass after deducting/allowing for
                      respiratory losses;                                                              [1 max]

                      N.B. Do not credit the simple formula NSP = GSP - R, unless GSP is also
                      defined in words ie food/biomass/energy absorbed/assimilated by consumer.
                      Definition must include reference to “consumers” to gain credit.


               (ii)   Data required:
                      (rate of) food eaten - faecal loss;
                      (rate of) food absorbtion / gross secondary production;
                      (rate of) respiration;
                      per unit area, per time;
                      biomass/weight at time t+1 minus biomass/weight at time t;                       [3 max]

                      No mark to be given for named consumer, but award [2 max] if population
                      is unnamed or not an appropriate consumer.
                      Accept a generic name e.g. mouse, but not eg ‘mammal’ or ‘herbivore’.

(b)   first law is law of conservation of energy / in transformations energy is conserved
      / energy
      is not created or destroyed;
      … demonstrated in that all chemical energy comes from light energy / is
      converted by photosynthesis;
      but no new energy is “created”/chemical energy is converted to heat energy but
       not “destroyed”;
      energy entering producers is equal to energy stored + energy dissipated as heat;

      second law states that in an isolated system entropy tends to increase
      spontaneously / in any transformation there is a net increase in entropy/dissipation
      of energy;
      … demonstrated in that while some energy is stored as chemical energy in
      producer;
      … there is a net dissipation of energy / lost as heat through respiration/to
      environment;
      (as for all transformations) efficiency of photosynthesis/conversion of solar to
      chemical energy is less than 100 % / (often) only 10 % is passed on / 90 % is lost
      before next trophic level;
      producers maintain order/low entropy through this dissipation of high
      entropy/heat energy/the continuous input of solar energy;                              [6 max]

      Award [4 max] for responses that only address one law.

(c)   Arguments for terrestrial systems having greater potential:
      terrestrial systems tend to harvest food at lower trophic levels than aquatic
      systems;
      … so that there is less energy loss along food chain;
      … so larger areas/volumes are necessary to produce same total harvest;
      aquatic systems tend to be less efficient at trapping/fixing solar energy;
      … due to greater reflection/absorption of light by water;
      harvesting may be more efficient/easier in terrestrial systems than marine fisheries
      (e.g. distance travelled by fishing vehicles);
      (inland) populations may find efficiency of terrestrial food supply more efficient
      in terms of convenience/transportation involved;
      inland aquacultural systems may have even greater demand on water supply than
      equivalent irrigated farmland;
      there is a far greater variety of producers suitable for farming/harvesting in
      terrestrial systems;

      Arguments for aquatic systems having greater potential:
      aquatic systems tend to have more efficient energy conversions along food chains;
      ie lower respiratory losses than terrestrial systems;
      terrestrial systems require considerable inputs of water/irrigation;
      … which may deplete local resources/require energy subsidy;
      arable land is becoming limited due to increasing urbanisation/human settlement;
      global productivity of marine systems is greater than global productivity of
      arable land offering greater potential harvest overall;
      soils can become degraded through intensive terrestrial farming;

      Alternative points of equivalent validity, significance and relevance to those given,
      should be credited.

      Award [1 max] for an explicit and valid conclusion.
      Note to examiners: An isolated statement e.g. “terrestrial systems show the
      greatest potential for food production” or an unjustified opinion e.g. “I think
      aquatic systems are best for food production” should not be considered as a valid
      conclusion. The conclusion must be supported/justified by points raised that must
      have at least addressed both sides of argument. A valid conclusion may, however,
      be stated within the body of the response rather than at the end, and may involve
      some balanced decision:

      e.g. while terrestrial systems provide the greatest potential for food production in
      terms of quantity, aquatic systems will make a valuable contribution to providing
      full dietary/feeding needs/quality; [1 max]

      Award [5 max] for responses that only explore one side of argument.

           Award [2 max] for the following human activities appropriately linked to factors
           given above (eg deforestation may lead to fragmentation of larger forest
           populations):
           deforestation;
           harvesting/hunting;
           urbanisation/infrastructure;
           pollution;
           trade in rare species;
           introduction of non-native species;
           unfavourable climate change due to anthropogenic global warming;
           conservation/protection management;
           poor land management/fracking (leading to earthquakes/landslides);

           Do not credit human impacts that not linked to specific Red List factors.
           Same human activity can be used for two factors if appropriate                     [2 max]

(b)   The ecological footprint is essentially the area of land required to sustainably
      provide all the resources required and assimilate the wastes produced (by a
      population);

      Technological development may decrease the EF/area of land required through…
      …agricultural technologies for irrigation/fertilisers/pesticides increasing
      productivity (per unit area);
      …increased productivity of genetically engineered crops;
      …technology for hydroponic agriculture requiring less resources;
      …increased energy efficiency reducing CO2 waste;
      …alternative energy sources (eg wind/solar/ etc) reducing CO2 waste;
      ...hybrid/H-fuel vehicles reducing CO2 waste;
      …technology to harvest energy/recycle materials from waste;
      …technology to capture/store C waste;

      Technological development may increase the EF/area of land required through…
      …fossil fuel dependent technology increasing CO2 waste in use/production;
      …increasing demands for resources used in manufacture of technology;
      …pollution produced by use/manufacture of technology requiring more waste
      assimilation;
      ...reducing limits to population growth thereby increasing demand for
      resources/waste assimilation;
      …promoting rapid turnover of technologies/consumer market that increase rate of
      resource consumption/waste production;

      N.B. Award credit only for those factors for which it is explicitly indicated in the
      context of the response whether it will lead to either an increase or a decrease of
      EF.                                                                                    [6 max]


(c)   N.B. Question addresses effect of Global Warming on carrying capacity, so do
      not credit responses that focus on direct effects of CO2 (eg ocean acidification) or
      other causes of GW.

      Global Warming may increase carrying capacities due to:
      increasing crop yields through higher temps/increased precipitation;
      melting of permafrost releasing more arable land;
      increasing available freshwater supplies through increased precipitation/ice melts;
      creating more favourable/healthy climate for some human populations;
      technological developments that mitigate its negative impacts while exploiting its
      benefits;
      human ingenuity has reversed major threats in the past / turned them to human
      advantage;
      impacts of global warming may promote environmental concern/values that lead
      to more sustainable lifestyles;

      Global Warming may decrease carrying capacities due to:
      increasing spread of tropical diseases/pests to new regions;
      destroying coastal habitats/settlements/available land through sea rise;
      changing oceanic currents reducing productivity of fisheries;
      reducing crop yields through higher temps/reduced precipitation;

reducing available water supplies through increased evaporation/reduced
precipitation;
loss of habitats/biodiversity may deplete natural capital available to human
populations;
increasing natural hazards through extreme weather patterns/hurricanes/flooding;
speed at which change is happening will not allow time for human populations to
adapt;
phenomenon involves positive feedback mechanisms that will increase impacts
further;

Award [1 max] for an explicit and valid conclusion.
Note to examiners: An isolated statement e.g. “global warming will increase
carrying capacity” or an unjustified opinion e.g. “I think carrying capacity will
decrease” should not be considered as a valid conclusion. The conclusion must be
supported/justified by points raised that must have at least addressed both sides
of argument. A valid conclusion may, however, be stated within the body of the
response rather than at the end, and may be tenuous, involving a balance of
factors and provisos, or distinguish between local and global capacities:

eg Global warming may lead to increase in local carrying capacities in some parts
of the world, but is likely to lead to an overall decrease in global capacity;

4.   (a)   Distinction [2 max]:
           “Goods” are marketable commodities/storages/materials/energy exploited by
           humans;
           whereas “Services” are natural processes that provide a benefit to the human
           environment;

           Do not credit purely economic understanding of services (i.e. human
           labour/financial input)

           Examples – Award [2 max] for an example from each column:

                        Goods [1 max]:                            Services [1 max]:
           timber/wood;                             vegetation/trees prevent soil erosion;
           plants/animals for food;                 absorption of CO2/carbon sink;
           plant extracts/medicines;                aesthetic quality/value;                    [4 max]
           Alternative examples of equivalent validity, significance and relevance to those
           given, should be credited.

     (b)    natural capital is the sum of a natural resource in a given environment;
            natural income is the growth/increase/interest on that capital over time;
            for resource exploitation to be sustainable, it must not reduce the potential for
            future exploitation;
            … hence natural income is a measure of (maximum) sustainable yield;
            provided rate of harvest is below/equal to natural income/only natural income is
            harvested, the capital remains;
            … which will have potential to provide the same income in the future;
            if harvest is greater than natural income, natural capital is reduced;
           ...and reduction in capital will reduce potential for future harvesting/income;

           Credit may be awarded for each of these marking points if they are conveyed
           through use of an example eg. sustainable fishing.                                   [6 max]

(c)   Award [3 max] for general points of distinction between two value systems:

      Ecocentrism gives intrinsic value to natural resources/systems;
      it argues that any exploitation must be sustainable/respect the biorights of species
      and landscapes;
      centralised/state management/large scale technology should be avoided in the
      use/extraction of resources;

      Technocentrism claims all resources can be justifiably exploited/controlled for
      human benefit;
      it argues technology will provide solutions to all environmental problems / replace
      depleted resources;
      resource exploitation should be limited only by scientific/technological
      development/economic needs/benefits;

      Ecocentrism would appropriately argue to reduce or stop fossil fuel use because:
      fossil fuels are a non-renewable resource and so cannot be exploited sustainably;
      their exploitation often leads to significant habitat destruction eg oil spills/mining;
      …this environmental impact has aesthetic/moral/spiritual implications addressed
      by ecocentrism;
      their use contributes to global warming – so further disturbance to natural
      systems/species;
      their exploitation and use involves large scale technology;
      their use tends to be managed by central state authorities rather than local
      communities;
      investing in fossil fuels hinders development/use of renewable alternatives;
      dependence on fossil fuels can lead to international conflicts;

      Technocentrism would appropriately argue to maintain or increase fossil fuel use
      because:
      fossil fuels are still abundantly available;
      the technology is already well-developed (and developing) for their extraction;
      much of modern technology is geared toward/dependent on their use;
      they can provide significant economic benefits to countries owning the resources;
      technology is being developed for coping with environmental disturbances/oil
      spills etc;
      oil extraction is one of the largest capital projects providing mass employment
      globally;
      use of fossil fuels is essential in interim while renewable technology is being
      developed;
      fossil fuels have been very effective in promoting economic development;
      fossil fuels (esp natural gas) are very cost-effective sources of energy;

      Award [1 max] for an explicit and valid conclusion.
      Note to examiners: An isolated statement e.g. “the ecocentric approach is best”
      or an unjustified opinion e.g. “I’m an ecocentric, so I think this is best” should
      not be considered as a valid conclusion. The conclusion must be
      supported/justified by points raised that must have at least addressed both sides
      of argument. A valid conclusion may, however, be stated within the body of the
      response rather than at the end, and may suggest some combination/compromise
      of the two value systems:

    eg In the short term a technocentric value system has some merit, but in the longer
    term ecocentric values are most appropriate in managing the use of fossil fuels;

5.   (a)   Conditions for photochemical smog [2 max]:
           local topography/valleys/lack of wind reducing dispersal of pollutants;;
           temperature inversion;
           high population density/fossil fuel use/traffic density;
           high amounts/intensity of solar radiation / sunny;

           Processes forming photochemical smog [3 max]:
           largely photochemical reactions / reactions increased by sunlight;
           use of fossil fuels releases hydrocarbons through evaporation / nitrogen oxide/NO
           through combustion;
           emission of suspended particles catalyse photochemical reactions;
           NO reacts with oxygen to form NO2;
           Sunlight promotes the formation of O atoms from NO2;
           … that combine with O2 to form ozone (the main secondary pollutant in
           photochemical smog);
           hydrocarbons react with NO2, O2 and light to form aldehydes & PAN;
                                                                                                 [4 max]

     (b)   Award 1 max for distinguishing biotic indices and direct methods.
           biotic indices measure the quality of ecosystem rather than quantity of pollutant /
           biotic indices are dependent on the tolerance/diversity/abundance of organisms,
           not concentration/toxicity/identity of pollutant;


           They are advantageous in that:
           they measure the widespread effects/impacts of pollutants on the system;
           …which is more significant than the quantity/concentration/nature of the
           pollutant;
           they are specific to the characteristics of a given habitat;
           they will address the combined/integrated impact of many pollutants/human
           activities;
           Avoids use of expensive instrumentation;

           They are disadvantageous in that:
           they do not identify the specific pollutants;
           … leaving the possible source of pollution unclear;
           the quality of a given community may vary for reasons other than pollution /
           initial quality may not be known;
           may require counting/identification of organisms which are difficult to
           collect/identify (eg lichen, invertebrates) / prone to human error;                   [6 max]

           Award [4 max] for responses that give only advantages, or only disadvantages.

(c)   Level of “producing”. Award [1 max] for outlining such management: relevant
      to acid rain:
      Eg management can be applied at level of producing by reducing use of fossil
      fuels/ switching to alternative energy sources;

       political advantages/disadvantages:
      it may not be popular to impose limits on use of fossil fuels in certain societies;
      but it does address root cause of problem;
      and political factors have the advantage of generating laws/incentives;
      in democratic societies such management may have strong influence on
      voting/political support;
      may gain international support for an issue that often crosses national boundaries;

       economic advantages/disadvantages:
      it may be very costly to switch to alternative energy sources;
      could be long-term economic benefit in this for countries importing fuel;
      would be economically beneficial in context of international C-trading;
      may gain volunteer support from community/NGOs that make management more
      cost effective;

      Level of “impact”. Award [1 max] for outlining such management:
      Eg. management can be applied at level of impact by liming of water bodies/
      restoration of natural communities;

       political advantages/disadvantages:
      it may be popular because it allows use of fossil fuels to continue;
      and restores aesthetic qualities of environment;
      but may conflict with the increasing “green”/ecocentric sector of many societies;

       economic advantages/disadvantages:
      avoids cost of switching from fossil fuel technologies;
      liming and restoration may be very costly;
      could be mitigating benefits eg sustainable goods/services of restored systems;
      provides for environmental projects attractive to local community/NGO voluntary
      support;                                                                                [8 max]
