                                                The Imperial

          The Imperial is a seaside hotel in Mombasa, Kenya. It was founded in 1906 by Roger Williams,
          a citizen of the United Kingdom (UK) who had made a large fortune in the primary sector of
          British East Africa. Identifying a market opportunity and wanting to diversify his investments,
          Roger founded The Imperial. The Imperial initially had some financial problems, especially
     5    regarding cash flow and liquidity management. Roger operated the hotel as a sole trader. By 1920,
          The Imperial was the most famous seaside hotel in Mombasa: it had a very positive corporate
          image and a well-deserved reputation for its grandiose architecture, its high-quality service and its
          elegant décor. It held that reputation for several decades, until the 1950s.

          The 1950s were a turbulent time in Kenya. Following the Second World War, independence
    10    movements emerged throughout the British Empire. Fearing that the situation would turn violent,
          in 1959 Roger’s son and heir Jeff Williams, decided to sell all the family properties in Kenya,
          including The Imperial. In the decades that followed, The Imperial was bought and sold several
          times: between 1959 and 1989, The Imperial had five different owners. Investors were often
          interested in the hotel, as it was an attractive 200-room property with a private beach and easy
    15    access to Mombasa airport. However, because of recurring political unrest in neighbouring
          countries, the owners feared the situation in Kenya would deteriorate. They often panicked when
          the political situation seemed to worsen and sold the hotel.

          In 1989, Global Properties (GP), an international investment group, set up a subsidiary private
          limited company that purchased the hotel. GP was a good symbol of the new globalized world:
    20    GP’s shareholders were from the United States, Japan and South Korea. GP’s relationship to
          the hotel was “hands off”: GP did not want to be involved in the daily management of the hotel
          operations, preferring to have a manager on-site. The manager would have to generate profits,
          most of which would be paid in dividends to GP. Once a year, the manager and a representative
          from GP would meet to calculate the break-even quantity for the coming year, set target profits and
    25    determine the margin of safety.

          In 2009, Martin Kimathi was appointed manager of The Imperial. This appointment was a
          remarkable coincidence of personal history and the history of The Imperial. Martin’s father,
          Jomo Kimathi, had been a trusted groundskeeper at The Imperial when the Williams family still
          owned it. When Jeff Williams sold the hotel in 1959, he used his influence to help Jomo obtain
    30    a work permit in the UK. Jomo moved to London, where he worked the rest of his career in
          the hotel industry. Martin was born in London, where he grew up in a multicultural society and
          sometimes as a schoolboy he was a victim of racist bullying. He went to university and graduated
          with a degree in Hotel Management. When Jomo retired in 2000, he returned home to Kenya.
          Martin wanted to connect with his Kenyan heritage and went with his parents. At the time, The
    35    Imperial was recruiting receptionists. Martin applied and got one of the positions. Five years
          later, he was promoted to head of reception, and four years after that, though only 30 years old,
          he was appointed as manager of the entire hotel. GP particularly liked the fact that Martin was of
          African descent but that, at the same time, he was westernized. GP thought that this was a perfect
          combination.

    40    Martin’s situation was actually more complicated than GP realized. Though Martin spoke some
          Kikuyu, the language of his parents’ tribe, most Kenyan employees in the hotel thought of him
          as too westernized and not Kenyan enough. Apart from that, however, his life in Kenya and now
          his appointment as manager seemed to fulfill most of his needs. Though the country experienced
          some post-election violence in 2008, it was generally safe and stable. Martin had a well-paid
    45    professional position, with a salary based on performance-related pay. In Kenya, he met and
          married Anima, and they had two lovely daughters. He was proud that he was managing the hotel
          where his father had been a groundskeeper years earlier.

          When appointed manager, Martin had to address a long-term problem: the fact that over the
          years, the competitive position of The Imperial as Mombasa’s premier seaside hotel had slowly
    50    deteriorated. New luxurious hotels were opening in the vicinity; with their spas, themed restaurants
          and fast WiFi Internet access, they offered better facilities and better services than The Imperial.
          They had a modern, high-tech feel; in comparison, the colonial charm of The Imperial looked
          old-fashioned. Its market share was shrinking. Because GP’s interest in The Imperial was solely
          for profits, Martin was only given a limited budget each year for improvements and renovation. The
    55    long-term trend for The Imperial was worrying: there was a steady decline in room bookings, at a
          time when ironically tourism in Kenya was doing rather well. The number of tourists travelling to
          Kenya was increasing annually, and other hotels were experiencing a general trend of increasing,
          not decreasing, occupancy rates (Appendix 1). Martin read statistics from the Kenya National
          Bureau of Statistics and other sources of secondary market data. He conducted a marketing audit,
    60    constructed a position map and realized that The Imperial could attract new types of traveller
          interested in safaris or in cultural tourism.

          Besides his long-term marketing challenges, Martin had found that managing the working
          capital sometimes proved difficult in the short term, especially because of the seasonality
          of hotel operations. The Imperial occasionally had problems to follow its month-by-month
    65    budget. Now that he was manager, and not just Head of Reception, Martin had to design and
          implement strategies for dealing with those liquidity problems. His accountant recommended that
          The Imperial use separate profit centres for the hotel itself, for the restaurant and for the special
          events services. Non-revenue producing departments, such as housekeeping, would be established
          as separate cost centres. Martin also had to organize the preparation of final accounts for GP (profit
    70    and loss accounts, balance sheets) as he was accountable to GP for the financial performance of
          The Imperial. A particular challenge came from the Catering Department overseeing the restaurant.
          The Head of Catering struggled both to manage the actual stock and to make the appropriate
          calculations of closing stock values.

          Martin also had a problem of human resources: how to improve his working relationship with
    75    Susan Chapman, the Head of Housekeeping. Susan’s grandfather, Craig Chapman, had travelled
          to Kenya from Liverpool (UK) in the early 20th century to open and operate an orphanage near
          Nairobi. Unlike Roger Williams, who was already wealthy before he left England and went to
          Kenya to make even more money, Craig Chapman had a humanitarian motivation. When Kenya
          became independent, Craig stayed and continued to work for other non-profit organizations. His
    80    whole family lived in Kenya; his grand-daughter only left the country to study Hotel Management
          in the UK. In 2002, she came back and began working at The Imperial. The problem between
          Susan and Martin began when he was appointed as manager. Susan, too, had applied for the
          position. When she was not selected, Susan was very angry. Even three years later, she could not
          get over her feeling that she had been discriminated against.

    85    Martin and Susan had similarities: they were the same age, had similar university educations, and
          neither fitted perfectly well in Kenyan society. They had, however, an important difference: their
          leadership style. Susan, though efficient, hard-working and committed, was very task-oriented.
          She liked bureaucracy, formal accountability, and a clear chain of command. She had a scientific
          approach to decision-making. Her staff found her cold, official and impersonal. Martin, on the other
    90    hand, had a much more laissez-faire style. He believed in empowerment and delegation. Though
          he felt anxious when he saw there were minor problems that he knew he could fix quickly, he was
          always careful to let supervisors resolve problems. He was also warm, friendly and outgoing.

          Susan liked The Imperial very much; however, she still resented the fact that Martin had been
          appointed manager instead of her. As a result, she wanted others to think that GP had made a
    95    mistake in selecting Martin instead of her. She focused harder than ever on her job. She demanded
          more of the employees and was intolerant of even minor mistakes. The hotel, she was determined,
          should always be absolutely spotless and shining. However, as she became more demanding, the
          employees perceived her as too autocratic. They began to complain amongst themselves. The
          networks of informal communication amongst the employees enabled gossip and messages to
  100     move quickly through the hotel, such as stories and anecdotes of Susan acting overly autocratic.
          Fearing that the situation would soon become a major problem, Martin suggested that she should
          soften her leadership style. However, in every appraisal meeting, she resisted any discussion about
          how she managed staff. Martin did not want to dismiss her; he highly regarded her as a valuable
          member of staff, whose role in the Housekeeping Department was essential. A French travel
  105     journalist who had recently stayed at The Imperial had written an article praising the high quality
          of its housekeeping: “We reach here the top of the highest international standards”, he wrote, “in
          terms of benchmarking, The Imperial is très magnifique”. Martin fully appreciated the professional
          importance of Susan. However he believed that, professionally, she needed leadership training.

          In November 2013, a particular situation brought these tensions to the surface. One employee
  110     in the Housekeeping Department, Guthoni, was frequently calling in sick and did not come to
          work. Rather than enquiring about the reason, Susan dismissed Guthoni for repeated absenteeism.
          What Susan did not know is that Guthoni had been diagnosed with a terminal illness and required
          frequent medical treatment. Upon news of her dismissal, the other employees were outraged.
          They decided to go on strike in December, one of the busiest months of the year for The Imperial.
  115     When Martin heard of the planned strike, he was very worried. If it occurred in December,
          The Imperial would not be able to reach its annual target profits. He started negotiations with
          employee representatives. He realized that the collective action was giving the employees a sense
          of solidarity that they previously never displayed. He also noticed that many other frustrations
          were coming out into the open – and he ironically saw the threat of strike action as empowering
  120     for the employees. They seemed to be taking responsibility for the operations of the hotel to a far
          greater degree than before. Martin wanted to channel their frustrations toward constructive ends.
          He believed that The Imperial would emerge stronger from the conflict. He knew that he needed
          the full commitment and support of all the employees because big changes were on the horizon.

          Equally important, he had to address the long-term external issues facing The Imperial because
  125     of changes in the external environment. Strategic decisions were necessary. He considered three
          options for The Imperial.

          Option 1: Make the case to GP that The Imperial needs to close for a whole year to allow for mass
          renovations in order to upgrade the hotel and reposition it to its former place as the premier hotel
          in Mombasa. Martin had recently travelled to Dubai and Muscat to see the most luxurious hotels
  130     in these regions. He understood that The Imperial had reached the decline phase of its product
          life cycle and needed rejuvenation. He believed that it was possible, although this would require
          substantial investment:
          • in the physical condition of the hotel almost to rebuild it entirely
          • in its marketing in order to relaunch it, maybe even with a new brand name.
  135     The new hotel would attract the same customer types, but the product would be much improved.
          It would also need an improved workforce to match its new vision. Martin sketched out two
          possible approaches for a Human Resources Strategic Plan (Appendix 3).

          Option 2: Change the nature of the hotel by transforming all the rooms into self-contained
          apartments with small kitchens. The target market for these apartments would be business travellers
  140     staying at least one week. The marketing audit had revealed that:
          • there is an increasing demand for such apartments
          • very few hotels in Mombasa offer such apartments
          • the market is still small
          • the market has high growth potential.
  145     The revenue from these apartments would almost match the revenue from the current hotel
          operations; it would be more stable, with fewer seasonal fluctuations; both fixed costs and variable
          costs for cleaning and maintenance would be much lower. The apartments would be serviced once
          a week, rather than daily. According to Martin’s workforce planning, this option could reduce the
          housekeeping staff by 70 %.

  150     Option 3: Form a strategic alliance with the famous safari tour company KenSafar. Together they
          would offer a two-week package tour. Customers would arrive in Mombasa, spend three nights at
          The Imperial, go on a seven-day safari tour, and then return to The Imperial for four more nights.
          This would allow tourists to go on a safari, first getting adjusted to the time zone and climate and
          later rest for four days before returning home. The owner and manager of KenSafar was Kamau
  155     Onyango, a spontaneous, dynamic and charismatic Kenyan who had many networks and contacts,
          and intuitively knew market trends, even without market research. Kamau insisted that if the
          strategic alliance were to go ahead The Imperial would have to:
          • make some improvements to the appearance of the hotel
          • pay Kensafar a 20 % commission for all hotel guests staying at The Imperial and booking
  160        through KenSafar
          • undertake a marketing audit.

          Which option was best? Martin was unsure…

Appendix 3: Martin’s notes on a Human Resources Strategic Plan for Option 1

 Two possible approaches:

 Approach 1: “Upskilling” the existing workforce
 • emphasis on “internal’’ recruitment
 • strong emphasis on training and development
 • no concern about staff retention rate, as most employees would be Kenyan.

 Approach 2: Building a new global workforce
 • emphasis on “external” recruitment
 • little emphasis on training and development
 • major concerns about staff retention rate, as most employees would be international.

 Features common to both:
 • recruitment
 • training and development
 • retention.
