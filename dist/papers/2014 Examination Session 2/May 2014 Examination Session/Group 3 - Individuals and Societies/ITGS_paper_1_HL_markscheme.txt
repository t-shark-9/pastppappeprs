Examiners should be aware that in some cases, candidates may take a different approach, which if
appropriate should be rewarded. If in doubt, check with your Team Leader.

In the case of an “identify” question read all answers and mark positively up to the maximum marks.
Disregard incorrect answers. In all other cases where a question asks for a certain number of facts
eg “describe two kinds”, mark the first two correct answers. This could include two descriptions,
one description and one identification, or two identifications.

It should be recognized that, given time constraints, answers for part (c) questions are likely to include a
much narrower range of issues and concepts than identified in the markband. There is no “correct”
answer. Examiners must be prepared to award full marks to answers which synthesize and evaluate even
if they do not examine all the stimulus material.

                                               SECTION A

1.   Analysis of external examination grades by an international school

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of a CSV file.                                      [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • comma separated values
                  • a text file
                  • a file without formatting where data in a record is separated by commas
                  • a file that represents data in tabular form. Rows are represented by new
                    lines and cells are separated by commas.

                  Note: do not accept firewall or anti-virus software.
                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Identify two reasons why the Oneto7 examination board would provide
                  files in CSV format.                                                [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • a file format that is compatible with different spreadsheets and database
                    formats
                  • a CSV file carries no formatting, only text, therefore the file size depends
                    only on the quantity of data it contains, ie the CSV file will be smaller
                    than a formatted file from any application
                  • CSV files are text files and can be opened with many applications,
                    therefore can even transfer manually if needed.

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (iii) Identify two characteristics of a “secure site”.                                  [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • accessed using HTTPS – Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
                  • information sent to and from those sites cannot be accessed by anyone
                    else (ie user needs to enter authentication information such as username
                    and password in order to access the site)
                  • Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) provides encryption – preventing
                    information from being read in transit
                  • Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) provides authentication (verifying that the
                    site is who they claim to be).
                  • Secure sites display a padlock/lock symbol
                  • Secure sites use trusted certificates to check for authenticity

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Schools can use either spreadsheets or database software to analyse these
      exam results.

      Analyse the use of these two software types for this purpose.                          [6 marks]

(c)   Oneto7, an examination board that serves 5000 schools, has been
      contacted by a new company, schoolscompare.com.            This company,
      schoolscompare.com, wishes to buy the data about students’ results from the
      Oneto7 examination board.

      Schools, parents and others can pay schoolscompare.com for a more detailed
      analysis of the examination results. This analysis will be provided using data
      bought from Oneto7, as well as other data they have acquired.

      Discuss the implications of the Oneto7 examination board selling the data it
      holds about the schools to schoolscompare.com.                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • Oneto7 examination board would have to ask schools to authorize the sharing
        of their data
      • Oneto7 examination board would have to wait for parents in the schools to
        authorize the sharing of their son’s/daughter’s data
      • Oneto7 would have the possibility of comparing its results with those of other
        boards
      • other boards would have access to Oneto7’s results
      • a more in-depth analysis may be provided to the schools and parents
      • parents would be able to compare their children’s results with others from the
        same and other schools / boards
      • schools may be assessed by prospective parents from these results
      • universities and other institutions may use this information to evaluate their
        prospective candidates
      • policies of privacy and correct use of information would have to be put in place
      • security issues to guarantee the reliability and integrity of the data must be
        evaluated
      • Oneto7 must investigate that schoolscompare.com has adequate security
        measures
      • agreement needed that Oneto7will not use the data for any purposes other than
        analysis (eg distributing tutoring information to schools that did not perform
        well).

      Note: do not accept generic references to hacking or unauthorized access.
      References must be explicitly related to the scenario.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

      Please see generic markband information sheet on page 27.

2.   Online training

     (a)   (i)    Calculate the length of time it took to download the 720 MB video.                        [2 marks]

                  • using 1024 KB as 1MB:
                    - 720 MB is 720 x 1024 KB = 737 280 KB
                    - bandwidth of 800 kb/sec = 100 KB/sec (KB	  is	  kilobyte,	  kb	  is	  kilobit)
                    - 737 280 ÷ 100 = 7372.8 seconds = 123 minutes = 2 hours 3 minutes

                  • accept the approximate of 1000 KB as 1MB:
                    - 720 x 1000 = 720 000 KB (KB	  is	  kilobyte,	  kb	  is	  kilobit)
                    - bandwidth of 800 kb/sec = 100 KB/sec
                    - 720 000 ÷ 100 = 7200 seconds or 120 minutes or 2 hours.

                  Note: accept 123 minutes = 2.048 hours = 2 hours and 3 minutes or
                  approximately 2 hours.

                  Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation of file size into KB (720 MB is
                  720 x 1024 = 737 280 KB or 720 x 1000 = 720 000 KB. Accept if some
                  indication of units in the calculation. Award one mark for 737 280 or
                  720 000.)

                  Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation of file size into KB.
                  Award [1 mark] for the correct calculation into time.

           (ii)   Outline the difference between lossless and lossy compression.                            [2 marks]

                  Lossless data compression
                  Difference in the reconstruction of original data
                  • lossless data compression uses algorithms that allow the exact original
                     data to be reconstructed from the compressed data
                  • lossy data compression does not allow the exact original data to be
                     reconstructed from the compressed data as some data is removed during
                     the compression.

                  Difference in the loss of data
                  • in lossless data compression no information is lost, it is only changed so
                     that the file size is reduced.
                  • in lossy data compression some information is taken from the file that
                     will change the final image or sound and will make the file smaller.

                  Difference in loss in quality
                  • 	  in lossless data compression no information is lost and therefore no loss
                     in quality
                  • in lossy data compression some information is taken from the file that
                     will result in some loss in quality which normally goes unnoticed.

     Difference in the types of file that are compressed
     • in lossless data compression is used to compress text and data files
     • in lossy data compression is used to compress audio, video and image
        files.

Note: each bullet point refers to a difference between lossy compression and
lossless compression.

Award [1 mark] if there is a difference for either lossy or lossless compression
with an implied reference to the other.

Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] for an outline of a difference between lossy
and lossless compression that explicitly refers to both methods of compression.

(iii) Outline the difference between downloading and streaming videos.              [2 marks]

     Answers may include:
     • streaming is when video content is sent in compressed form over the
       internet and displayed on the receiving device in real time. A
       downloaded video is played from a local storage device
     • when streaming a video the user does not have to wait to download the
       video to play it / watch it. A downloaded video must be stored in order
       to view it
     • streaming a video involves playing the video on one device while the
       media is displayed on another. The video is not moved or copied to the
       device that is playing it. Downloaded video is played directly from local
       media or storage device where it is stored
     • a fast internet connection is needed to stream high definition videos from
       the internet without interruption (about.com). When downloading
       videos, a fast internet connection is not required
     • when streaming video the user needs a player, which is a special program
       that uncompresses and sends video data to the display and audio data to
       the speakers. Downloaded videos are played with a media player that is
       installed as a part of most operating systems
     • a streaming video is not saved on your device. Once you stop playing,
       the media is no longer available. A downloaded video is stored on local
       media or storage device (ie downloaded videos can be moved to different
       devices (by copying them, video is available whenever you want to play
       it, must wait until the download is complete before you can watch the
       media)

Note: each bullet point refers to a difference between streaming videos and
downloading videos.

Award [1 mark] if there is only reference to streaming video or downloading
video with an implied difference to the other.
Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] for an outline of the difference between
downloading and streaming videos.

(b)   Compare the use of online evaluation tasks versus face-to-face evaluation
      tasks to assess the skills the trainees may have learned with the training
      videos.                                                                    [6 marks]

      Fernando
      • will have to take a manual record of those who completed the training and of
        their performance
      • may lose credibility as he cannot guarantee that the training company will issue
        certificates for those who do the training
      • may make several copies of the videos and share them with many employees
        who might need to go over the training
      • needs to check if the training company allows the videos to be downloaded and
        used offline
      • if training videos were not available onsite, the employees would need to be
        sent to La Paz from the mining site to be trained

        from the local ISP when trying to access the videos from the mining site in the
        Andes
      • the downloaded videos offer the miners more training opportunities (ie view
        the videos as a group and group discussion of the various aspects of the video)

3.   Energy efficient data centres

     (a)   (i)   Define the term terabyte.                                                        [1 mark]

                 • 1012 bytes
                 • 1000 GB.
                 Note: units must be included in the response.
                 Award [1 mark] for any of the above.

           (ii) Identify three features/characteristics of data centres that make them
                consume large amounts of energy.                                       [3 marks]

                 Answers may include:
                 • large amount of hardware (computers/servers/routers/switches) need
                   energy to function
                 • processing requiring large amounts of energy (ie large volume of CPU
                   activity, inefficient processors)
                 • redundant or backup power supplies
                 • air conditioning is needed to cool equipment
                 • need for the data centre to work 24/7 (ie run all of the equipment)
                 • fire control systems
                 • cabling with high energy consumption (ie some types of cabling require
                   more energy than optic fibre cable, energy consumption can vary
                   between types of optic fibre cable).

                 Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [3 marks].

           (iii) Identify two ways that data redundancy may occur in data centres.                [2 marks]

                 Answers may include:
                 • local backups (kept for security in case of device failure)
                 • data centres are backed up in different locations (to allow a different data
                   centre to pick up in case the previous one fails)
                 • data centres (that store information from social networks) may have files
                   saved by several users repeatedly.

                 Award [1 mark] for each of the above up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   Some governments have decided that data centres will be charged for their
      environmental impact. This may be done by monitoring the volume of data
      stored and the energy consumed to maintain the data centre.

      Analyse this decision.                                                               [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • monitoring by government may be an invasion of privacy and may cause
        clients to find a data centre in a country where these regulations do not exist
      • some data centres will put more emphasis on the purchase of energy efficient
        equipment even if these are more expensive
      • some data centres will opt to downsize their facilities causing slower access or
        lack of backup services causing discontent among clients
      • data centres may investigate ways to reduce redundant data stored on their
        servers
      • data centres may increase the amount that they charge their clients for data
        storage
      • large data centres with high incomes may support economically projects for
        more efficient energy generators (eg Facebook funding the changes from coal
        to solar panels of the energy-producing companies)
      • in order to implement this decision the government will have to monitor the
        data centres. This has implications for cost, personnel and infrastructure.

      Note: accept responses that address the impacts of the decision as well as those
      that relate to the decision itself.

(c)   ORM, a large company, is expanding and the managers are concerned that
      their IT systems will need an expensive upgrade to be able to manage the
      increasing amount of data held by the company. The company is considering
      moving all of its data to an external data centre and relying on their services
      to store and provide access to this data.

      Discuss whether ORM should move all of its data to a data centre.                      [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • costs – they will have to compare the cost of upgrading their local servers and
        IT facilities with the cost of paying for the services of the external data centre
        provider
      • complexity of the change – they will have to take into account the complexity
        of the change from their local in-house providers of IT services to the move of
        data to the external data centre (time required, changeover period, reliability of
        the files when moved to a different location – may be too large and time to
        upload will make them unavailable)
      • personnel – many of the ORM IT personnel may not be needed and will be
        made redundant – social implications
      • policies – they will have to carefully review the policies at the external data
        centre to understand their responsibilities in the keeping of backups, privacy of
        the information and availability of the services
      • confidential information – ORM will need to determine whether data that
        involves confidential company information should be stored on data centre
        servers. Data can be accessed by personnel at the data centre.

      Note: the external data centre does not belong to ORM.
      Note: do not consider any references to hacking into the data centre servers.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between IT technical terminology and the terminology related to
      social and ethical impacts.

(b)   Explain three problems that may arise if a project does not make use of a
      properly designed project methodology such as PRINCE2.                    [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • scope creep – the project may drift into unplanned territory without a guiding
        plan
      • failure to deliver project results on time / on budget – items may get forgotten
        or not allocated sufficient resources
      • project team loses focus – individuals may go their own separate ways without
        a definitive plan
      • stakeholders lose ownership – the development team may lose sight of what the
        client really wants
      • critical path to complete project sub optimal – may lose sight of dependencies
        and waste time
      • failure to properly estimate project resources, time and costs – items may be
        neglected or added
      • project progress / risks / changes not communicated – this can lead to
        disillusionment on the part of the clients
      • project assumptions not explored properly – unexpected snags can turn up at a
        late stage.

(c)   Project managers need a range of skills, including technical IT skills, to
      ensure a project is completed on time and within budget.

      To what extent is a project manager’s technical knowledge critical to the
      success of the projects they manage?                                      [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • programming skills are needed in order to understand programmers’ issues
      • understanding of project management methodologies so that the work is kept
        on time, of a sufficient quality and to budget
      • needs to have knowledge of all areas of the project to ensure it goes as planned
      • technical knowledge allows the manager to evaluate the results
      • having a range of skills, such as the ones below, is more critical than having
        technical knowledge:
          - be highly organized and a good multi-tasker because the project manager
              has to manage multiple tasks simultaneously
          - be a good leader; build consensus, inspire the team, build relationships
              with key stakeholders
          - be an effective communicator; needs to be clearly understood by all
              stakeholders
          - problem solver; can address the problem with minimal disruption
          - able to delegate tasks
          - able to set up and manage budgets.

5.   Updating Top Dog’s information system

     (a)   (i)    Identify three reasons why the Top Dog owners have decided that it is
                  time to replace their old information system.                         [3 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • maintenance costs too high
                  • lack of maintenance provided
                  • more economical alternatives
                  • needs of the business have changed
                  • legislation has forced changes
                  • adopts a new hardware strategy / platform
                  • better performance / interface wanted
                  • old information system is not compatible with new developments in
                    technology
                  • old supplier ceases operating.

                  • train users
                  • install system on target computers
                  • transfer data from old system
                  • enter new data
                  • a changeover
                  • run in parallel to ensure working properly
                  • backing up data.

(b)   The project manager is considering either direct changeover or phased
      changeover for the implementation of the new information system for Top
      Dog Veterinary Practice. Analyse these options.                         [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Direct changeover
      • may take less time, new system is up and running immediately
      • may be less confusing for staff as they have only one system to understand
      • may lead to duplication of work if comparisons are made between the system
      • will remove the issues of compatibility between the two systems that may
        occur with a phased changeover
      • training is required before the implementation
      • high risk of data loss.

      Phased changeover
      • may provide time for staff to learn the new system (training) and may allow for
        original system to be used in parallel
      • may give time to appraise the new system as it is implemented – that is not
        possible with direct changeover as implementation is done in smaller “chunks”
      • may be possible to revert back to old system as changes may be less. May not
        be possible with direct changeover
      • allows closer monitoring of new system as each phase of the implementation
        can be thoroughly evaluated before the next stage. However, this may extend
        the time (and cost) required for the changeover
      • low risk of data loss.

(c)   Many companies now outsource their IT provision. This may involve
      handing over responsibility for the running and maintenance of the
      information system to a cloud computing provider.

      To what extent would it be advantageous for Top Dog Veterinary Practice to
      outsource its information system to a cloud computing provider?            [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      • definition of cloud computing
        - virtualization of resources
        - services offered remotely
        - transparent to user
        - cloud computing is sold on demand
        - the service is managed by the provider
        - user can determine the amount of service they take
        - users can log on to the network from any computer in the world
        - issues related to outsourcing.

      Pros
      • access to a huge range of applications without having to download or install
        anything
      • applications can be accessed from any computer, anywhere in the world
      • users can avoid expenditure on hardware and software; only using what they
        need
      • companies can share resources in one place
      • consumption is billed as a utility with minimal upfront costs
      • scalability via on-demand resources
      • reduced need for onsite resources
      • reduced need for skilled personnel
      • the cloud computing provider becomes responsible for backing up the
        company’s data.

      Cons
      • users do not physically possess storage of their own data, which leaves the
        responsibility and control of data storage with the provider
      • users could become dependent upon the cloud computing provider
      • with data held externally, business continuity and disaster recovery are in the
        hands of the provider

6.   Expert systems in health care

     (a)   (i)    Identify two characteristics of an expert system.                          [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • computer system that emulates a human expert
                  • used to solve complex problems
                  • uses reasoning
                  • has inference engine
                  • knowledge base
                  • interface.

                  Award [1 mark] for each point up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Identify two reasons why a doctor would use an expert system in order
                  to help diagnose a patient’s condition.                               [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • to have access to the latest information about the condition
                  • to have the benefit of the knowledge from top experts in the field
                  • to confirm their diagnosis with that of the expert system
                  • to make sure that interactions / complications are properly taken into
                    account
                  • avoid mistakes in diagnosis
                  • have greater time to spend on less common conditions as the expert
                    system diagnoses the common conditions more quickly.

                  Award [1 mark] for each reason up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (iii) Outline the relationship between the knowledge base and the knowledge
                 engineer.                                                             [2 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • the knowledge engineer translates knowledge into computer usable form
                    in the knowledge base
                  • knowledge engineer has the experience / background to determine what
                    should be included in the knowledge base
                  • knowledge engineer can test the knowledge base to see if it performs
                    adequately
                  • knowledge engineer does not need to maintain contact with the
                    knowledge base after it is implemented – otherwise no point in having
                    the autonomous system.

                  Award [1 mark] for each appropriate comment that outlines the
                  relationship between the knowledge base and the knowledge engineer
                  up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b)   (i)    Explain the purpose of an expert system shell.                              [2 marks]

             Answers may include:
             • a means for creating an expert system
             • has features for adding rules
             • allows if/then conditions to be created
             • provides interface between the expert system and its creator
             • provides algorithms for making inferences from the rules.

             Award [1 mark] for each appropriate comment that explains the purpose of
             the expert system shell up to a maximum of [2 marks].

      (ii)   Construct the inference rules that were put into the expert system by
             the knowledge engineer.                                               [4 marks]

             •   if age >=18 and age <=65 then check weight, (else no)
             •   if weight >=50 kg then check blood pressure, (else no)
             •   if blood pressure <180/100 then check hemoglobin, (else no)
             •   if male and hemoglobin >=135 g/l then yes
             •   else if female and hemoglobin >=125 g/l then yes, (else no).

             Award [1 mark] for each interface rule up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(c)   To what extent should Dr James trust the results produced by an expert
      system in making her final decision about a course of treatment for a
      patient?                                                               [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      A doctor should trust the findings
      • all known factors were taken into account when making decisions about the
        treatment because they are programmed into the expert system
      • they are making use of the knowledge of many experts in determining the
        treatment
      • a treatment may involve a complex situation that might be difficult for humans
        to comprehend unaided by an expert system.

      A doctor should not trust the findings
      • from past experience in using the system, the expert “knowledge” seems to be
        not reliable in providing an accurate diagnosis and treatment
      • the patient has multiple illnesses and the expert system cannot make sensible
        recommendations for treatment
      • risks of new treatments not known so they could not be added to knowledge
        base
      • may encounter unprecedented situations and there is no data to draw on.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between the IT technical terminology and the terminology related
      to social and ethical impacts.

                  • an agent having qualities that we associate with intelligence eg learning
                    ability / adaptability
                  • the ability of machines to have thoughts and make decisions like humans.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic comment about AI with [1 mark] for each
                  additional comment up to a maximum of [2 marks].

           (ii)   Identify the steps that could be taken by the drone to identify a target.     [4 marks]

                  Answers may include:
                  • relay image to human operator
                  • detect cell phone transmissions – if recognized as enemy then attack
                  • pattern recognition algorithms – match against known images / determine
                    if non-natural, ie man-made
                  • the drone uses sensors to scan and identify the scene
                  • the drone retrieves information from an expert system to identify which
                    target matches the established criteria
                  • heat detection – unexpected body heat could identify a human target
                  • detect man-made light source.

                  Any four steps, award [1 mark] each up to a maximum of [4 marks].

(b)   Analyse the decision to train soldiers using battlefield computer games.            [6 marks]

      Answers may include:
        • it is more cost-effective than training soldiers in a battlefield environment
        • it is safer than training soldiers in a battlefield environment
        • may give commanding officers an insight into how they may react in real life
        • good tool to examine the best strategy to use when approaching a situation
        • games should include normal and unusual situations
        • through the games soldiers should be able to visualize the worst-case scenarios
        • games should emphasize importance of reacting to warnings
        • because it is a game, soldiers may not take it as seriously, may not think it is important
        • soldiers might get fatigued by visual / aural signals
        • lack of danger may reduce realism.

      [1–2 marks]
      A limited response that demonstrates minimal knowledge and understanding of
      the topic and uses little or no appropriate ITGS terminology.

      [3–4 marks]
      A partial analysis, either lacking detail or balance, that demonstrates some
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Some relevant examples are used
      within the response. There is some use of appropriate ITGS terminology in the
      response.

      [5–6 marks]
      A balanced and detailed analysis of the issue which demonstrates thorough
      knowledge and understanding of the topic. Relevant examples are used
      throughout the response. There is appropriate ITGS terminology throughout the
      response.

(c)   To what extent is it acceptable in war that robots should be able to make
      their own decisions?                                                      [8 marks]

      Answers may include:
      Benefits
      • standard response to standard danger
      • prevents panic responses
      • prevents ill-judged responses
      • less chance of not noticing a danger
      • leaves operator free to make judgments.

      Drawbacks
      • response might be inappropriate / computer systems can make errors
      • might be a new situation never anticipated
      • might fail to take into account unexpected variables
      • makes the operator less alert as the system is trusted
      • unclear who is taking responsibility for lethal action.

      In part (c) of this question it is expected there will be a balance in the ITGS
      terminology between the IT technical terminology and the terminology related
      to social and ethical impacts.
