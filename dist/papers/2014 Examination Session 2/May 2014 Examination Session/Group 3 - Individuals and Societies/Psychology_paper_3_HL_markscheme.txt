Marks      Level descriptor

0          The answer does not reach a standard described by the descriptors below.

1 to 3     There is an attempt to answer the question, but knowledge and
           understanding is limited, often inaccurate, or of marginal relevance to the
           question. The response makes no direct reference to the stimulus
           material or relies too heavily on quotations from the text.

4 to 7     The question is partially answered. Knowledge and understanding is
           accurate but limited. Either the command term is not effectively
           addressed or the response is not sufficiently explicit in answering the
           question. The response makes limited use of the stimulus material.

8 to 10    The question is answered in a focused and effective manner and meets
           the demands of the command term. The answer is supported by
           appropriate and accurate knowledge and understanding of qualitative
           research methodology.       The response demonstrates a critical
           understanding of qualitative research methodology applied to the
           stimulus material.

1.   Evaluate the sampling technique used in this study.                                          [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
     the strengths and limitations of the sampling technique used in the study. Although a
     discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to be evenly
     balanced to gain high marks.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     The stimulus material explicitly states that the researcher used a purposive sampling
     technique so candidates should use this information and evaluate this particular
     sampling method.

     A purposive sample is often used in qualitative research when small samples are studied
     using in-depth interview techniques. The purposive sample is constructed to serve a
     specific need or purpose. In this study, the target population was heterosexual women
     who had experience of being in a romantic love relationship. The researcher chose the
     individuals in her sample because they met certain characteristics (selection criteria).
     The sample of eight women was selected through the researcher’s own social network
     so it was relatively easy and quick, but there is a risk of bias.

     Strengths of the purposive sampling method could include, but are not limited to:
     • the participants can accurately represent the topic under investigation because they
        are selected based on salient characteristics relevant to the research so they could
        provide rich data
     • it is relatively easy to select a sample and it can be supplemented with more
        participants during the research if necessary
     • it is useful when a researcher needs to select a sample quickly and if sampling for
        proportionality is not the main concern.

     Limitations of the purposive sampling method could include, but are not limited to:
     • sampling may be biased but if the sampling process is based on objective selection,
       documented and explained, bias can be reduced
     • the sample is not representative so it is difficult to generalize to a larger population
       (but this is not that important in a qualitative study such as this because the
       researcher is more interested in why these particular participants feel the way
       they do).

     Candidates may refer to other sampling methods but this should only be credited if it is
     done as part of their evaluation of purposive sampling.

     Responses that refer to only strengths or only limitations of the purposive sampling
     method used in this study should be awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks].

2.   Explain why reflexivity is relevant to this study.                                            [10 marks]

     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “explain” requires candidates to give a detailed account of why
     reflexivity is relevant in this study and give reasons or causes by referring to details of
     the study.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     There is reference to reflexivity in the stimulus material (lines 20–21) and candidates
     need to rely on their knowledge of reflexivity and provide reasons for why reflexivity
     could be relevant to this particular study.

     Reflexivity is a strategy used by qualitative researchers to reveal how a researcher’s
     subjectivity contributes to the findings. For example, a researcher may be biased
     towards the findings of a study because she perceives and interprets data through her
     own individual lens. Reflexivity is thus one way to establish credibility/trustworthiness
     in qualitative research.

     Candidates’ explanations as to why reflexivity is relevant to this study could be but are
     not limited to:
     • epistemological reflexivity: for example, the eight participants were all
         psychologists or psychology students from the researcher’s own social network, so
         candidates may refer to epistemological reflexivity such as considering if the
         purposive sampling method used in the study is appropriate
     • personal reflexivity: for example, the researcher herself states that “ever since she
         was a young woman she had tried to understand her own emotional responses when
         she was in love”. This statement indicates a subjective interest in the topic under
         investigation that could potentially bias the results and this alone could justify the
         application of personal reflexivity in order to avoid this bias.

     The terms personal or epistemological reflexivity are not required to access the higher
     markbands.

     Candidates could (but are not required to), as part of the explanation as to why
     reflexivity is relevant in this study, write how the researcher could apply personal
     reflexivity to avoid bias, for example, providing necessary information about her own
     experiences in love relationships and as a couples therapist, or including a critical self-
     reflection on her own interests in undertaking the study (for example, that the researcher
     had a desire to understand her own emotional responses). Bias could also be prevented
     by asking participants to verify the transcripts that are used as the basis for analysis as
     the researcher did in this study. Statements such as these could be part of an
     explanation of why reflexivity is relevant and this is perfectly acceptable.

3.   Evaluate the use of semi-structured interviews in this study.                              [10 marks]
     Refer to the paper 3 markbands when awarding marks.

     The command term “evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up
     the strengths and limitations of the use of semi-structured interviews in this study.
     Although a discussion of both strengths and limitations is required, it does not have to
     be evenly balanced to gain high marks.

     Responses that use the term “experiment” as a generic term for “study” should not be
     penalized.

     Candidates could argue that the researcher has probably chosen to use semi-structured
     interviews in the study because the rather sensitive topic under investigation (that is,
     participants’ perception of a meaningful relationship as more than just romantic
     fulfilment) could be more fully explored using this approach. For example, if the
     researcher had used a structured interview with closed questions she would perhaps not
     be able to get an in-depth insight into the participants’ various experiences with
     their partners.

     Relevant strengths of using semi-structured interviews in the study in the stimulus
     material could include, but are not limited to:
     • an interview guide with a combination of closed and open-ended questions allows
       the researcher to ask specific questions while giving participants the opportunity to
       talk more freely and in their own terms about their views on romantic love
       relationships
     • the flexibility of open-ended questions allows the researcher to obtain richer data
       because she can ask participants to elaborate on their answers. This could very well
       be the case in this study, as the researchers cannot know in advance what kind of
       experiences the participants have
     • the face-to-face situation and nature of semi-structured interviews could give rise to
       establishing a positive rapport between the interviewer and the interviewees, which
       could be useful in a sensitive issue such as romantic love relationships.

     Relevant limitations of using semi-structured interviews in the study in the stimulus
     material could include, but are not limited to:
     • there may be limited time and space to explore themes that have not been planned in
       advance
     • data analysis of the transcripts of semi-structured interviews is often very
       time-consuming compared to structured interviews
     • a lot of extra or irrelevant information may appear during the interview, which could
       make it difficult to analyse the data.

     Responses that briefly refer to other research methods as part of the evaluation of why
     semi-structured interviews were used in this study should be fully credited as long as
     the main focus is on evaluation of the use of semi-structured interviews.

     Responses that refer to only strengths or only limitations of the semi-structured
     interview should be awarded up to a maximum of [5 marks].
