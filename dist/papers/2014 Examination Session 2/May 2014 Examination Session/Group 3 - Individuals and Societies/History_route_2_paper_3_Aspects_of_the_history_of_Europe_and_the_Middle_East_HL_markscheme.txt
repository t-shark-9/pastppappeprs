Paper 3 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 3 published in the
History guide (2008) on pages 77–81. They are intended to assist marking, but must be used in conjunction
with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about
the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.
  0:      Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
  1–2:    Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of appropriate
          structure. There is little more than unsupported generalization.
  3–4:    There is little understanding of the question. Historical knowledge is present but the detail is
          insufficient. Historical context or processes are barely understood and there are little more than
          poorly substantiated assertions.
  5–6:    Answers indicate some understanding of the question, but historical knowledge is limited in quality
          and quantity. Understanding of historical processes may be present but underdeveloped. The
          question is only partially addressed.
  7–8:    The demands of the question are generally understood. Relevant, historical knowledge is present
          but is unevenly applied. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may be limited
          argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present. An attempt to
          place events in historical context and show an understanding of historical processes. An attempt at
          a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has been made.
  9–11: Answers indicate that the question is understood, but not all implications considered. Knowledge
          is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally placed in context,
          and historical processes, such as comparison and contrast, are understood. There is a clear attempt
          at a structured approach. Focus on AO1, AO2 and AO4. Responses that simply summarize the
          views of historians cannot reach the top of this markband.
  12–14: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Relevant in-depth knowledge is
          applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary is used to indicate some in-depth
          understanding, but is not consistent throughout. Events are placed in context and there is sound
          understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different
          approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented. Synthesis is present, but not always
          consistently integrated. Focus on AO3 and AO4.
  15–17: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the question,
          and if appropriate may challenge it. Accurate and detailed historical knowledge is used
          convincingly to support critical commentary. Historical processes such as comparison and
          contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used appropriately
          and effectively. Answers are well-structured and balanced and synthesis is well-developed and
          supported with knowledge and critical commentary.
  18–20: Answers are clearly focused with a high degree of the awareness of the question and may challenge
          it successfully. Knowledge is extensive, accurately applied and there may be a high level of
          conceptual ability. Evaluation of different approaches may be present as may be understanding of
          historical processes as well as comparison and contrast where relevant. Evaluation is integrated
          into the answer. The answer is wellstructured and well-focused. Synthesis is highly developed.

 Following a review of marking practices it has been agreed that in order to add further clarity to the
 markscheme for Paper 3, all caveats with regard to the awarding of marks for questions that include more
 than one component (eg, compare and contrast; reasons and significance; methods and success) will be
 removed.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best fit’ to
 the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications are
 considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners should
 not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that offer good
 coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

The French Revolution and Napoleon — mid 18th century to 1815

1.   Evaluate the causes of the Reign of Terror of 1793–1794.

     The Reign of Terror may be dated from either June 1793 (the overthrow of the Girondins by the
     Jacobins), or more commonly from September 1793 when Terror was made the “Order of the Day”.
     Its end date is July 1794 with the execution of Robespierre and his supporters. The Terror saw
     many thousands executed with total estimates varying widely. Candidates’ explanations of reasons
     for the Terror may include: internal opposition to the Revolution, such as armed rebellion (for
     example, in the Vendée, Lyon) and possible links between internal opposition and those foreign
     powers at war with the Republic (for example, at Toulon in 1793); the power-struggle between
     Jacobins and Girondins; the role of the sans culottes under Roux and Hébert in that power struggle;
     and economic causes (rising food prices) that contributed to the radicalization of the sans culottes.
     Some candidates may also argue for the importance of the lack of a parliamentary tradition in the
     period; with France moving so rapidly from an absolutist monarchy to a form of popular
     sovereignty, there was a lack of experience of how to manage political opposition. In the context of
     internal opposition and war with foreign powers implacably opposed to the Revolution, it was all
     too easy for political opposition to be seen as treasonous.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


2.   Analyse the reasons for the fall of the Directory in 1799.

     Many candidates who answer this question may focus on the events of the coup of 18 Brumaire, the
     role of Napoleon and the military force he could command. However, answers may also include
     consideration of other factors: military reverses (in Egypt and elsewhere); domestic economic crisis;
     the need for the Directory to avoid the extremes of resurgent Royalism and Jacobinism; electoral
     manipulation and personal corruption, for example the lifestyle of Barras (perhaps the most well
     known member of the Directory). Divisions within the Directory also played their part. The coup
     of 18 Fructidor entailed a purge of conservatives, including Carnot and Barthélemy from within the
     Directory. It also highlighted the dependence of the Directory on the army who had carried out the
     purge. In the context of the military defeats of 1799, Talleyrand and Sieyès decided that France
     needed a stronger government paving the way for Napoleon’s coup. Candidates may also argue that
     as a reaction to the overbearing dictatorship of the Committee of Public Safety, the Directory went
     to the opposite extreme and/or that there was a fatal lack of strong executive powers that
     undermined the Directory.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Unification and consolidation of Germany and Italy 1815–1890

3.   Analyse the reasons for Piedmont–Sardinia’s growth in power between 1815 and 1861.

     While some candidates may interpret this question as simply asking for an explanation of
     Piedmont–Sardinia’s leadership role in Italian unification, it is not asking for a narrative of that
     process. It is acceptable to analyse the relative success of Cavour’s diplomacy (role in the Crimean
     War, Pact of Plombières), as long as it is clearly linked to the terms of the question. However, this
     question also gives an opportunity for students to show what they know about domestic policy in
     Piedmont–Sardinia 1815–1861 (for example, Siccardi Laws, development of railways, industrial
     growth). Other responses may argue that the reason for the kingdom’s growth in power was largely
     fortuitous, and depended entirely on events beyond the control of the kingdom’s rulers.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


4.   Assess the extent of continuity and change in Bismarck’s domestic policy in the years
     1871–1890.

     Following the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871, Bismarck dominated domestic German
     politics until he was forced to resign by Wilhelm II in March 1890. This question asks candidates
     to focus on Bismarck’s domestic policy and assess the degree of continuity and change in that
     period. Candidates may divide the period chronologically into the Liberal period (1871–1878/9)
     and the Conservative period (1878/9–1890). Candidates may suggest that 1878/9 was the key
     turning point, with the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Laws in 1878 and tariff reform in 1879,
     and stress the extent of change after this point. Other factors which could point in this direction
     include the ending of the Kulturkampf and the introduction of social insurance legislation. For
     balance, candidates may argue for the degree of continuity throughout the period: the role of
     Bismarck and the Emperor, the relative lack of power of the Reichstag and the dominance of
     Prussia and its upper class.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Ottoman Empire from the early 19th to the early 20th century

5.   How strong was Ottoman control over Lebanon in the years 1861–1914?

     The focus of the question is neither the conflict of 1860 nor the resolution of communal tensions but
     on the level of Ottoman control over Lebanon in the period. Answers may give details of the
     Settlement (Montassarifiah/Mutasarrifiyya), but these should be linked to an analysis of the degree
     of Ottoman control. Although the Sultan chose the Mutasarrif (the Governor), he had to be a
     Christian and he had to be approved by the European powers. There were also two councils; an
     Administrative Council and a Judicial Council. In both cases, all communities were represented.
     The Administrative Council was to advise the Governor on assessing taxes and administering
     revenue and expenditure. The Judicial Council was to help the Governor with legal disputes. Other
     issues to consider in assessing the strength of Ottoman control include the role of European powers
     in Lebanese affairs in the period, especially French investment in the silk industry and the role of
     missionary activity.      More broadly Britain and France acted to guarantee the whole
     Montassarifiah/Mutasarrifiyya settlement. All of these points could be used to argue that Ottoman
     rule was relatively weak. On the other hand, continued Ottoman control of Lebanon could be
     demonstrated by a reliance on Ottoman troops to suppress disturbances, (for example the revolt of
     Youssef Bey Karam in 1866-7), the lack of a separate outlet to the sea and the fact the governor was
     chosen by the Sultan. Some candidates may also note the rapid abolition of Lebanon’s semi-
     autonomous status in 1914 with the outbreak of war.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

6.   Assess the importance of the Tanzimat reforms to the Ottoman Empire.

     Candidates should show an understanding of the major reforms and of their aims. Answers may
     consider the reforms in the context of the Ottoman Empire’s international position. The Gülhane
     Hatt-i Şerifi (Noble Edict of the Rose Garden) (1839) and the Hatt-i Hümâyûn (Noble Reform
     Edict) (1856) were both issued at critical periods when the Ottoman Empire was under severe
     external pressure. In the first case, this was after the Ottoman defeat by the Egyptians at Nizip. In
     the second case, this was to coincide with the Treaty of Paris at the end of the Crimean War.
     Candidates could discuss to what extent these reforms helped the Ottoman Empire in its relations
     with foreign powers.

     However, the main focus for most candidates is likely to be on the domestic impact. There were a
     range of reforms including, military, legal, bureaucratic and governmental reforms. Analysis could
     examine change and continuity when trying to assess the importance of the reforms, especially in
     how far there was real change at the local level. Areas which could be examined include how far
     the empire was “modernized” as well as how far disaffected Christian subjects of the empire were
     won over. Another possible line of argument could be that the importance of the reforms depended
     very significantly on individual provincial administrators, for example the success of Midhat Pasha
     in Rumelia, Nis and Baghdad. Some candidates may also discuss the extent to which the Tanzimat
     reforms provided an important legacy for later reformers in the Ottoman Empire.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

Western and Northern Europe 1848–1914

7.   Compare and contrast the reasons for the collapse of the Second French Republic in 1851 and
     the 1871 Paris Commune.

     For comparison: events in Paris did not reflect the political attitudes of provincial France, as
     indicated by the results of the December 1848 presidential elections and the February 1871
     Legislative Assembly elections, both of which showed support for conservative, moderate parties.
     In addition, both Louis Napoleon and Thiers gave clear leadership to moderate elements: while the
     former made reference to his uncle’s legacy (Bonapartism), Thiers relied on his political experience
     over many years to enhance his status as leader. This could also be used as a contrast.

     In both cases, violent events in Paris and fear of the Left opened the way for repression (June Days
     of 1848 and crushing of the Commune in May 1871). Repression was carried out by the military on
     both occasions.

     For contrast: Louis Napoleon won the presidential elections of December 1848 after the repression
     of the June Days by Cavaignac, while Thiers was directly associated with the suppression of the
     Commune. Furthermore, the 1848 Revolution in France saw the creation of the National
     Workshops scheme to alleviate poverty and unemployment, which caused concern among rural
     property owners and weakened support for the 1848 Revolution in France. By way of contrast, the
     Paris Commune was in part a response to the failure to pay the National Guard and the ending of a
     moratorium on rent payments, but the implementation of an active social project was arguably less
     important as a reason for the collapse of the Paris Commune.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


8.   How successful was Gladstone as prime minister?

     The focus should be on Gladstone as prime minister. Candidates may reflect that successful aspects
     of his leadership included leading governments on four separate occasions, in 1868, 1880, 1886 and
     1892. Other successful features to which candidates may refer include: the ability to unify
     (until 1886) a great variety of heterogeneous groups, including Whig aristocrats, dissenter middle
     classes as well as trades unionists; legislative achievements (for example, 1870 Education Act, 1884
     Third Reform Act).

     For balance, candidates may highlight his failures. These may include party disunity (culminating
     in the Liberal Unionists leaving the Party in 1886 and bringing down Gladstone’s third
     government), as well as the failure to implement Irish Home Rule in 1893.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

 Imperial Russia, revolutions, emergence of Soviet State 1853–1924

 9.   To what extent did the reforms of Alexander II achieve his aims?

      The details of the reforms should be well known: emancipation of the serfs (1861); local
      government (establishment of zemstva and the Duma); independent judiciary; trial by jury;
      education reforms (more schools and freedom for the universities); military reforms (reduction of
      the military service period and the introduction of universal conscription). There were attempts at
      economic reform, including developing infrastructure for both industrial and financial growth.
      Candidates may also consider the extent to which his reforms were diluted by his later reaction.
      However the key word in the question is “aims”, these should be clearly identified as modernising
      Russia whilst maintaining autocratic power. Discussion of the reforms should focus on
      consideration of how far each reform helped or hindered the achievement of these aims

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. However, it is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

10.   “The First World War was the main cause of the 1917 February/March Revolution in
      Russia.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The question invites candidates to examine a range of causes and then to make a judgment on which
      was the most significant. Many will no doubt accept that the war was the main cause of the
      February Revolution. Other causes could include: longer term discontent with limitations of
      political change after 1905 (Duma power was limited and by 1914 political parties were legal but
      political power still rested with the autocracy); the impact of industrialization and urbanization
      (leading to overcrowded conditions for workers in the cities) causing discontent, for example, the
      strikes of Lena goldfields and over 1.5 million industrial workers in the last few months of peace.
      Peasant revolts were also prevalent. Thus on the eve of war, Russia was unstable with much
      discontent. There was potential for revolution without the added stresses of war.

      On the role of the war itself, initial enthusiasm was rapidly destroyed by the failure of the Tsar’s
      regime to fight effectively. Evidence could include: defeats at Tannenburg and the Masurian Lakes;
      high casualties; the failure to logistically support the army; shortages of weapons at the front;
      failure to provide food and medical supplies to the troops. In the cities, high inflation and food
      shortages, coupled with the role of Rasputin and the Tsarina, led to increasing criticism of the
      Tsarist regime. Nicholas II’s assumption of military command and his refusal to share power with
      the Duma meant all discontent was focused on the monarchy.

      Candidates may well argue that the regime was inherently weak and that revolution would have
      happened because of this at some point, and that the stresses of war merely acted as a catalyst for
      revolution.

European diplomacy and the First World War 1870–1923

11.   Analyse the main objectives of German foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.

      This is not a question on the causes of the First World War, rather, it gives an opportunity for
      candidates to show their knowledge of German foreign policy between 1890 and 1914 and asks for
      an analysis of the main objectives. Some may focus on German naval and colonial policy (the
      claim for “A Place in the Sun” was stated by Bülow in 1897), while others may focus more on
      German support of Austria–Hungary in the Balkans and the desire for a Mitteleuropa. Others
      may highlight the unpredictability of German policy and comment on the character of Kaiser
      Wilhelm II (Daily Telegraph affair). Other approaches could emphasize how objectives shifted
      over time within this period, or how foreign policy was driven by domestic concerns – specifically
      by what was seen as the threat of the rise of the SPD. Fear of a two front war and the resultant
      military planning (Schlieffen Plan) could also be discussed as well as the view that Russia would
      only become industrially and militarily stronger over time (War Council meeting of December 1912
      and Moltke’s view that war was inevitable and “the sooner the better”).

12.   Compare and contrast the contribution of the British and German home fronts in
      determining the outcome of the First World War.

      The First World War was the first “total” war in history. For comparison between Britain and
      Germany, candidates could focus on conscription, propaganda and the degree of suspension of
      domestic political conflict, among others. Britain and Germany could both be examined for
      reorganization of the economy, rationing and the extent to which women were incorporated into the
      workforce.

      For contrasts: candidates might choose to focus on specific episodes during the war. For example,
      in Britain, the Shell crisis of 1915 and the emergence of the Ministry of Munitions, which supported
      the British military effort. For Germany, candidates could assess the Burgfrieden, conditions from
      1916 onwards, including the “Turnip Winter”, the growth of the black market and the way in which
      labour unrest (strikes and the Kiel Mutiny) contributed to political instability and an eventual
      willingness to seek an armistice, implicitly conceding defeat.

      Comments on comparisons and contrasts should be linked to the outcome of the war

War and change in the Middle East 1914–1949

13.   “The post-First World War settlement in the Middle East was based on the imperial
      ambitions of the victors.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers should focus on the details of Sèvres and Lausanne and decisions reached at San Remo
      with regard to the establishment of mandates in Palestine, Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon, as well
      as British control in Mesopotamia.

      Wartime diplomacy can be made relevant, showing how promises made were largely ignored if
      they went against the interests and ambitions of the victorious powers, especially with regard to
      Palestine. Interests and ambitions could include the protection of oil supplies (Iraq and Mosul
      oilfields) and Suez for Britain. The French desired to extend their influence beyond their colonies
      in North Africa. Analysis could also discuss the length of time that the mandatory powers took to
      relinquish their control: Iraq gained independence in 1932 and the other mandates were only
      surrendered in the post-Second World War period.

      This is not a question on the causes of the conflict in Palestine, but looks at the region as a whole.

14.   Examine the methods used by Ibn Saud to gain and consolidate power in Saudi Arabia.

      Methods used to gain power could be his gaining control of Riyadh in 1902 and becoming leader of
      the Wahabis. He founded the Ikwhan in 1912 and used them to gain support amongst the Bedouin,
      thus he had military power and religious influence.

      Conflict with Husayn in the years 1919–1925 led to Husayn’s exile and the proclamation of Ibn
      Saud as king of Hejaz in 1926.

      He reached an agreement with the British in 1927, gaining British recognition if he accepted the
      British-supported Hashemite Kingdoms in Jordan and Iraq. He was thus willing to compromise
      with major powers to establish and consolidate his rule.

      He also dealt with the Ikwhan when they caused conflict with Britain (Battle of Sabila, 1929).
      Ibn Saud retained support because of the religious basis of the state. He protected the Holy Places
      and the notables supported his strong rule. In 1932 he became king of Saudi Arabia with both
      internal and external support.

Interwar years: conflict and cooperation 1919–1939

15.   “Hitler’s rule in Germany gave most Germans what they wanted in the years 1933–1939.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Answers will have to identify the problems that faced Germany in the years before Hitler gained
      power and the extent to which Hitler resolved these problems (including: economic crisis; mass
      unemployment; weak governments; lack of law and order because of political violence; threat of
      revolution; national humiliation, ie Versailles).

      The main focus should be on how these problems were or were not dealt with: unemployment fell
      because of Schacht’s New Plan, which included public works schemes, conscription and
      rearmament; the one-party state and dictatorship (fully established by August 1934) ended political
      violence on the streets and gave the impression of strong, stable government. From the beginning,
      Hitler pursued a foreign policy designed to remove the Versailles settlement and restore national
      pride, including leaving the League of Nations, ignoring the military clauses of Versailles and
      remilitarizing the Rhineland, etc.

      All of these actions were popular. Plebiscites and levels of collusion with the regime also indicate
      that most Germans were willing to support the regime for the benefits it brought. Levels of
      opposition could also be considered: repression dealt with overt opposition, but there was little
      covert opposition within Germany until Hitler began to move towards war.

16.   Analyse the political impact of the Great Depression on any one country of the region.

      Case studies might include Germany, Spain, Britain or France, but accept any valid example.
      For Germany, candidates may focus on Nazi electoral gains and their links with the level of
      unemployment. The failure of the Müller, Brüning, Schleicher and Von Papen governments may
      also be outlined. In other cases, it could be argued that the impact was to strengthen the Left,
      for example in France, with the formation of the Popular Front government in 1936. In Spain,
      the Great Depression contributed to general political instability with both right-wing and left-wing
      governments in power during the Second Republic. Another point of view would be that,
      in general, all governing parties of whatever political persuasion were undermined as a result of the
      Great Depression.

The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe 1924–2000

17.   Analyse the effects of the Great Patriotic War on the Soviet Union in the years 1941–1945.

      There is much material here and answers could focus on three key areas.

      Military impact of the war. The initial success of Operation Barbarossa, which resulted in:
      millions of casualties; the retreat of Soviet forces; the siege of Leningrad; and the threat to Moscow.
      These all resulted in large-scale destruction of infrastructure. Key points of Soviet recovery
      (Stalingrad, Kursk etc) were only achieved through the massive mobilization of the civilian
      population.

      Economic and social effect of the war. Despite the retreat of production east of the Urals, by the
      end of the war the Soviet Union had suffered the destruction of much industrial capacity as a
      consequence of conflict (25 percent of pre-war industrial capacity lost). The civilian population
      suffered devastation because of harsh German rule in occupied areas and the “scorched earth”
      policy adopted by the Soviet Union. Civilian casualties in Leningrad were enormous, and deaths as
      a consequence of the war are estimated at 20 million or more.

      Politically, the Soviet Union was not altered by the war. Stalin, as generalissimo, remained the
      dominant leader, a position reinforced by propaganda. The party remained powerful, with party
      commissars attached to army units etc. The army, under leaders such as Zhukov, was important but
      did not threaten Stalin’s position.

18.   Evaluate the success of Khrushchev’s foreign policy.

      Khrushchev’s aims should be identified in order to assess success. Aims could be: maintaining
      Soviet dominance over the Eastern Bloc states and hence Soviet security; extending Soviet influence
      globally while avoiding nuclear conflict, ie peaceful coexistence.

      Foreign policy success: Allowing Gomulka to come to power in Poland to avoid further instability;
      crushing the Hungarian Uprising (1956); improving relations with Tito in Yugoslavia. Having
      failed to push Western powers out of Berlin in 1958, he allowed the construction of the Berlin Wall
      (1961) to close a gap in the Iron Curtain.

      After the Cuban Missile Crisis peaceful coexistence was once more pursued with the signing of the
      Test Ban Treaty (1964) and the establishment of the “hotline” between Washington and Moscow.

      Limits to success: Soviet influence in post-colonial countries such as India, Egypt and some
      African states was weak. In terms of global influence, Sino–Soviet relations became tense and
      distant. Mao Zedong accused Khrushchev of revisionism over his 1956 speech. He also criticized
      Khrushchev for his “weakness” over Cuba – Mao felt he had backed down to avoid nuclear war.

      The results of the Cuban Missile Crisis are a matter of debate. He failed to establish a Soviet base
      in the Western hemisphere; however, he did succeed in gaining the removal of NATO missiles from
      Turkey.

      Mention of both China and Cuba is legitimate, as they are mentioned in the guide.

The Second World War and post-war Western Europe 1939–2000

19.   What were the main factors in the consolidation and maintenance of Franco’s regime
      (1939–1975)?

      After victory in the Civil War, Franco ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. The question
      is focused on reasons both for the consolidation and the maintenance of his power. For
      consolidation, expect some discussion of repression. This included physical elimination (many
      thousands of republican supporters, or those associated with the Republic, were executed in the
      regime’s early years), forced labour, imprisonment and deprivation of livelihood. Another factor
      for consolidation could arguably be the decision to keep Spain out of the Second World War. For
      maintenance, aspects which could be discussed include Franco’s positioning of his regime as an
      anti-Communist bulwark in Cold War Europe (1953 Pact of Madrid between Spain and the US);
      economic growth (“Spanish Miracle” from 1959) or the role of the Catholic Church within Spanish
      society. Some candidates may also examine the centralization of power in Madrid and state control
      of all forms of media, or the relative weakness of the opposition to the regime after 1945. There is
      controversy over how important repression remained in preserving Franco’s power in later years.

20.   “The dominant motive for the formation of NATO in 1949 was to contain Soviet expansion.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates should show knowledge of what, as far as the West was concerned, constituted post-war
      Soviet expansion. Examples could include the overthrow of the Czechoslovak government
      (February 1948) and the Soviet Blockade of Berlin (June 1948), but allow other instances. For
      balanced answers, candidates could discuss other motives for the formation of NATO: the wish to
      prevent any possible future resurgence of European militarism through a strong US commitment to
      Europe and the desire in some quarters to encourage European political integration. Candidates
      may also present a revisionist point of view that Truman wished to assert US economic and political
      power in Europe (Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan) and that the formation of NATO was part of
      this strategy.

      Some candidates may also integrate knowledge of the Treaty of Brussels (March 1948), and its
      creation of the Western Union (later Western European Union) by Britain, France, the Netherlands,
      Belgium and Luxembourg. This was absorbed by NATO.

      The question is not asking for a summary of the causes of the Cold War.

Post-war developments in the Middle East 1945–2000

21.   Analyse the political and economic impact of Nasser’s domestic policies.

      Political issues include: the role of the army; control of potential opposition groups (such as the
      Muslim Brotherhood and movements on the left); control of the press and provincial and municipal
      councils; powers of the president, which were established by the 1956 constitution; the issuing of
      the National Charter (1962); levels of bureaucracy; expansion of the public sector.

      Economic issues to consider are: standards of living; the extent of land reform; nationalization of
      the Suez Canal, banks, insurance etc; state control of imports and exports.

      Analysis should focus fully on impact.

22.   Assess the reasons for the failure of the Arab–Israeli peace process in the years 1978–2000.

      The various agreements should be well known, from Camp David in 1978, to the various Oslo
      Accords, the Israel–Jordan Peace Treaty (1994), and Clinton’s final attempts to broker peace at
      Camp David in 2000. However the focus of the question is why all of these attempts have failed to
      resolve the conflict and candidates will need to identify the key obstacles to lasting peace. These
      could include: the issue of the Occupied Territories and Jewish settlements there; the issue of
      Jerusalem; the right of return etc.

      Other factors contributing to tensions could be: the growth of militias such as Hamas and their
      activities; Israeli rule in the Occupied Territories; the assassination of Rabin; the election of more
      hard-line Israeli governments. All of these made the peace process more difficult.

Social and economic developments in Europe and the Middle East in the 19th or 20th century

23.   Analyse developments in the arts in any one country of the region over a fifty year period.

      Either the 19th or the 20th century is legitimate as a focus. The arts can be considered to include
      visual arts, music, theatre, film and literature. Detailed material and analysis should be present, not
      unsubstantiated generalizations. Discussion of major trends may form the basis of the answer, with
      some reference to specific works. Any country within the region is valid.

24.   Analyse the reasons for industrialization in any one country of the region over a fifty

      Either the 19th or 20th century is legitimate here. The key word is “analyse” and therefore a
      number of reasons should be discussed in some detail. Well known cases are Britain, France,
      Germany and Russia. This question gives candidates the opportunity to use their knowledge of
      their own national history in analyzing their society’s industrialization (as long as it is within the
      region). Reasons for industrialization could vary widely between different countries.
