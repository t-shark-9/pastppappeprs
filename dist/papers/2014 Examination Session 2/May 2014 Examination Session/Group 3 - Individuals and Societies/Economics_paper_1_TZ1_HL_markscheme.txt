Microeconomics

1.   (a)     Using diagrams, explain how a change in one of the determinants of
             demand might increase the price of rice and how a change in one of the
             determinants of supply might decrease the price of rice.                       [10 marks]

             Answers may include:
             • definitions of demand and supply
             • diagrams to show the impact of changes in the determinants of demand and
               supply on the price of rice
             • an explanation of how a new price of rice would result from an increase in
               supply and increase in demand, with reference to the specific determinants
             • examples of situations where such changes have taken place.

(b)   Discuss the consequences of providing a subsidy on the production of rice
      for producers, consumers and the government.                                       [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definition of a subsidy
      • diagram of the application of a subsidy and its consequences for the various
        stakeholders

        (lower prices) and government (increased expenditure)
      • examples of situations where a subsidy has been introduced
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses.

      Discussion may include: a consideration of the effect of the subsidy on various
      stakeholders. The likely price inelasticity of demand for rice and proportionate
      benefits to consumers and producers may be considered.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.

(b)   Evaluate the view that the benefits of economic growth will always
      outweigh the costs.                                                                [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definition of economic growth
      • diagrams to illustrate the costs and benefits
      • an explanation of the potential benefits of growth eg higher living standards
        and on government finances; the potential costs, eg on sustainable
        development and in terms of the possible conflicts with the other goals of
        economic policy such as low inflation or equity in the distribution of income
      • examples of costs/benefits of growth which have occurred, or might occur
      • synthesis or evaluation (evaluate).

      Consider term
      “Evaluate” requires candidates to make an appraisal by weighing up the
      strengths and limitations.

      Evaluation may include: an evaluation of the positive and negative
      consequences of growth.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
