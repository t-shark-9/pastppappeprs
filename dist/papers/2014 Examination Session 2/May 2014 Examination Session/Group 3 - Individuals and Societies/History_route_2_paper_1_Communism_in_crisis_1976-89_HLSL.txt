These sources and questions relate to the domestic and foreign problems of the Brezhnev era: Afghanistan.

SOURCE A                Extract from an article written by Alexander Bovin, published in the Soviet
                        newspaper Izvestia, 1980. Alexander Bovin was a Russian journalist and diplomat.

We had either to bring in troops or let the Afghan revolution be defeated. We decided to bring in
the troops. We knew that the victory of counter-revolution would pave the way for massive American
military presence in a country which borders on the Soviet Union and that this was a challenge to our
country’s security. We knew that the decision to bring in troops would not be popular in the modern
world even if it was absolutely legal. But we also knew that we would have ceased to be a great
power if we refrained from taking unpopular but necessary decisions. There are situations when
non-intervention is a disgrace and a betrayal. Such a situation developed in Afghanistan.


SOURCE B                Extract from a speech by President Carter to the US Congress, 23 January 1980.

The implications of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan could pose the most serious threat to the peace
since the Second World War. The vast majority of nations on Earth have condemned this latest Soviet
attempt to extend its colonial domination of others and have demanded the immediate withdrawal of
Soviet troops … The Soviet Union must pay a price for their aggression … That’s why the United States
has imposed stiff economic penalties on the Soviet Union … I’ve asked our allies and friends to join with
us in restraining their own trade with the Soviets and not to replace our own embargoed items. And I have
notified the Olympic Committee that neither the American people nor I will support sending an Olympic
team to Moscow … The Soviet Union must realize that its decision to use military force in Afghanistan
will be costly to every political and economic relationship it values. The region which is now threatened
by Soviet troops in Afghanistan is of great strategic importance … An attempt by any outside force to gain
control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States
of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.

SOURCE C               Extract from Cold War by Jeremy Isaacs and Taylor Downing, 1998. This book was
                       the companion to a television series on US news channel CNN. Both authors have
                       had careers producing historical documentaries for television.

The Western belief that the Soviet invasion was part of a plan to dominate the region as far as the Persian
Gulf was mistaken. The decision to intervene was the act of a divided and leaderless Politburo that was
already beginning to lose its grip on power …

Carter denounced the invasion and called for trade sanctions against the Soviet Union … The administration
now dropped its support of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) II treaty and initiated a rapid
increase in arms spending …

Brezhnev denounced Carter’s “lies” about Afghanistan and insisted that Soviet troops had
entered Afghanistan at the request of the Afghan government, and that there was no intention of
withdrawing them …

America’s allies did not see the need to abandon détente because of events in Afghanistan. As US
trade with the Soviet Union dropped, other Western nations stepped in; huge trade deals cancelled
with American companies were picked up by European firms. That summer the Olympic Games were
due to be held in Moscow. The games went on despite the American-led boycott, and a majority of
nations competed.


SOURCE D               Extract from The Cold War by John Lewis Gaddis, 2005. John Lewis Gaddis is a
                       professor of History at Yale University, US.

Détente had failed … to prevent the Soviet Union from using military force again to save “socialism”.
That much was clear in January 1980, a month in which President Carter withdrew the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) II treaty from the Senate, imposed embargoes on grain and technology shipments
to the USSR, asked for a significant increase in defence spending, announced that the United States would
boycott the Moscow Olympics, and denounced the invasion of Afghanistan.

What was not so clear at the time though, was what all this meant for the global balance of power …
It should have been clearer at the time that the Soviet Union was on the path to decline, and that détente
was concealing their difficulties … The Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan looks less like a
coordinated strategy to shift the global balance of power and more like the absence of any strategy at all.
What kind of regime provokes those upon whom it has become economically dependent?
