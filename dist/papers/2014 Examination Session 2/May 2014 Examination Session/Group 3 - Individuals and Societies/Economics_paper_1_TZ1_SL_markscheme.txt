1.   (a)     Explain two reasons why governments impose indirect taxes.                    [10 marks]

             Answers may include:
             • definition of an indirect tax
             • diagram showing the effect of an indirect tax
             • an explanation that indirect taxes are a source of government revenue,
               a method to correct negative externalities of production and consumption,
               a way to redistribute income if levied on luxury goods, and a method of
               trade protection
             • examples of the imposition of indirect taxes.

             N.B. Award a maximum of level 2 if only one reason is explained.

(b)   Discuss the consequences for consumers, producers and the government of
      imposing a specific tax on cigarettes.                                             [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of demerit goods and specific tax
      • diagram to show the imposition of a specific tax on cigarettes
      • an explanation of how the indirect tax raises the price to consumers and
        reduces the quantity demanded of cigarettes; the indirect tax increases the
        cost of production, resulting in less supply of cigarettes; the low PED for
        cigarettes will affect the effectiveness of the policy and the revenue raised
        by government
      • examples of when a specific tax is used on cigarettes
      • synthesis or evaluation (discuss).

      Command term
      “Discuss” requires candidates to offer a considered and balanced review that
      includes a range of arguments, factors or hypotheses.

      Discussion may include: the advantages and disadvantages for the different
      stakeholders and the overall effectiveness of the policy.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.

      N.B. Award a maximum of level 2 if only one stakeholder is discussed.
           Award a maximum of level 3 if only two stakeholders are discussed.

(b)   “An increase in aggregate demand may not lead to an increase in real
      national income.” To what extent is this statement valid?                          [15 marks]

      N.B. It should be noted that definitions, theory, and examples that have already
      been given in part (a), and then referred to in part (b) should be rewarded.

      Answers may include:
      • definitions of aggregate demand and real national income
      • diagram to show an increase in AD when the economy is at and below full
        employment
      • an explanation that an increase in aggregate demand can lead to a rise in real
        national income if the economy is operating below full employment; an
        explanation that an increase in aggregate demand will not lead to a rise in
        real national income of the economy is operating at or approaching full
        employment
      • examples of when an increase in AD has/has not resulted in an increase in
        real GDP
      • synthesis or evaluation (to what extent).

      Command term
      “To what extent” requires candidates to consider the merits or otherwise of an
      argument or concept.

      Consideration of the merits of the statement may include: a review of
      Keynesian/neoclassical viewpoints and that the effect would depend on where
      the macroeconomic equilibrium lies. Also, candidates may mention that real
      national income cannot rise beyond full employment on the Keynesian AS
      curve, but that output can rise beyond full employment in the short run but not
      the long run on the monetarist long run AS curve.

      Examiners should be aware that candidates may take a different approach
      which, if appropriate, should be rewarded.

      Opinions or conclusions should be presented clearly and should be supported
      by appropriate examples.
