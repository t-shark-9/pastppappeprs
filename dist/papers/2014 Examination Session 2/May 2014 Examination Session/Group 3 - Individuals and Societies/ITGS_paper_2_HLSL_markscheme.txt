Using assessment criteria for external assessment

For external assessment, a number of assessment criteria have been identified. Each assessment criterion
has level descriptors describing specific levels of achievement, together with an appropriate range
of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive achievement, although for the lower levels failure
to achieve may be included in the description.

Examiners must judge the externally assessed work at SL and at HL against the four criteria (A–D) using
the level descriptors.

• The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.

• The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that conveys most accurately the level attained by
  the candidate, using the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation should be made
  when a piece of work matches different aspects of a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded
  should be one that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the criterion. It is not
  necessary for every single aspect of a level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded.

• When assessing a candidate’s work, examiners should read the level descriptors for each criterion until
  they reach a descriptor that most appropriately describes the level of the work being assessed. If a
  piece of work seems to fall between two descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
  that more appropriately describes the candidate’s work should be chosen.

• Where there are two or more marks available within a level, examiners should award the upper marks
  if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent. Examiners should award
  the lower marks if the candidate’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent.

• Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, that is fractions and decimals, are not
  acceptable.

• Examiners should not think in terms of a pass or fail boundary, but should concentrate on identifying
  the appropriate descriptor for each assessment criterion.

• The highest level descriptors do not imply faultless performance but should be achievable by
  a candidate. Examiners should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are appropriate descriptions of
  the work being assessed.

• A candidate who attains a high level of achievement in relation to one criterion will not necessarily
  attain high levels of achievement in relation to the other criteria. Similarly, a candidate who attains a
  low level of achievement for one criterion will not necessarily attain low achievement levels for the
  other criteria. Examiners should not assume that the overall assessment of the candidates will produce
  any particular distribution of marks.

• The assessment criteria must be made available to candidates prior to sitting the examination.

Criterion C — The impact of the social/ethical issue(s) on stakeholders                        [8 marks]

3.   Evaluate the impact of the social/ethical issues on the relevant stakeholders.

           Positive Impact to customers may include the following:
           • greater choice of products – online stores can have larger inventory because overhead
               costs are lower
           • access to information about products – including prices, reviews, comparison
               of products to make more informed purchase decisions
           • can take advantage of special offers, coupons etc – lower costs to customer.
           • global access rather than just local
           • convenience/efficiency / flexible – can shop anytime and anywhere –
               shopping in downtime/commute time
           • less time-consuming.

           Negative impacts to customer may include the following:
           • too many choices to make an intelligent decision
           • personal details (eg home address) could become accessible to unauthorized
             persons if data is not secured at the server/during transmission – this
             information could be misused/changed
           • customer’s whereabouts can be tracked – owners may feel that they are under
             surveillance
           • items can be hard to return – resulting in possible shipping costs, time wasted
             packing and sending the item
           • fraud – bogus online stores or shops, fake websites
           • unacceptable goods – goods do not match the online advertiser’s description
           • shipping problems – unexpected costs, goods take too long to arrive or never
             arrive
           • unwanted offers – customer might inadvertently accept an unwanted offer
             ie buying in a hurry
           • malware – unscrupulous sites adding malware to your smart phone.
           • reliability of device/network/app
           • equality of access – not everyone (customer) has a smart phone with internet
             connection
           • less social interaction – impact on culture as less approaching of staff.

           Negative impact on online store may include the following:
           • increase in sales – much wider customer base
           • collection of information about customers, such as browsing and buying
             histories – useful in marketing.

Question 3 continued

             Positive impact on online store may include the following:
             • need to provide a way to return items – might have to pay shipping costs
             • something must be done with the returned item – repackaged, reused,
               repurposed.
             • initial investment cost to set up IT infrastructure for the store
             • IT personal should be hired to maintain database/website
             • online store has to setup warehouse of goods at strategic locations to deliver
               the goods on time, cost involved in setting up warehouse
             • if the online server fails, customers will not be able to purchase.

             Positive impact on physical store may include the following:
             • some stores may also offer an online store (ie need to keep less inventory on
               hand, customers can order online and pick up in the store)
             • traditional stores can offer greater variety of products with a web presence.

             Negative impact on physical store disadvantages may include the following:
             • decrease in sales – customers buying elsewhere
             • decrease in profits – traditional stores need to maintain inventory, hire
               salespeople etc
             • closing of store – due to loss of business and high overheads
             • loss of jobs (ie fewer salespeople, fewer people in inventory of goods).

4.   Evaluate one possible solution that addresses at least one problem identified in
     Criterion C.

          Solutions to problems of security/privacy:
          • customer data is encrypted during transmission and on the central server of the
             online store
          • restricted access to information stored on central server of the online store ie
             employees can only view necessary information
          • authentication for employees of online store who have permission to access the
             database
          • customer can turn off GPS tracking at will
          • detailed privacy policy for the online store
          • details of how to secure the online store server eg firewall, anti-malware
             software.

          Solutions to problems related to returning items:
          • allowing customers to return (or pick up) items at a physical location instead of
             sending them back can benefit retailers (eg item purchased online can be
             picked up and returned at their local store)
          • online retailer can send shipping labels for returning the item with the
             purchase, retailer also assumes shipping costs
          • customers need to check shipping and return policies before buying.

          Solutions to problems of unacceptable goods, unwanted offers, fraud:
          • buy apps from a closed app store such as Apple’s app store or the retailer itself
          • make sure online site is secure, eg uses SSL on the login page
          • use strong passwords for accessing online stores and change them often
          • use of additional authentication eg biometrics, authentication dongle/app
             creating one off pass codes
          • research online store to determine that it is reputable, use comparison shopping
             sites or a site-rating browser add-on
          • document as many specifications for the item as possible and maintain a paper
             trail eg delivery charges, warranties etc.

Question 4 continued

             Solutions to problems of online purchases rather than purchases in traditional stores:
             • stores can enable customers to purchase in-store goods via an app that interacts
                with the store’s POS system
             • connect with in-store customers via a mobile device to create a personalized
                experience for the customer that influences behaviour and boosts spending, app
                connects customer to a salesperson
             • retailers can adjust prices to match those offered online
             • retailers can offer unique products that are not available online
             • retailers can create an online store to offer more products without having to
                keep them in inventory in the store
             • create an “experience” in the retail store that cannot be duplicated online, eg
                coffee shops in bookstores, events such as book signings or fashion shows
             • create a digital experience in the store, eg tablets that demonstrate make-up or
                provide information on products in the store. Allow customers to do their
                research while in the store
             • non technical solution of “Save the High St” campaign or equivalent.

        Solution to problem of lack of social interaction in stores:
           • retraining of staff and development of staff to use and interact with the
              shopping apps.
