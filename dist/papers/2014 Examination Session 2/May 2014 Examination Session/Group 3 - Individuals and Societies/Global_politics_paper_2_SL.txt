Answer two questions, each from a different unit of study.

Each question is worth [25 marks]. Marks are awarded for demonstrating understanding of relevant
political concepts, making reference to specific relevant examples, and for justifying your points and
exploring and evaluating counter-arguments.

Power, sovereignty and international relations

1.    Examine the claim that the significance of military power is diminishing in contemporary
      global politics.


2.    Discuss the impact of NGOs, MNCs, and international organizations on state sovereignty.



Human rights

3.    Compare and contrast an institutional approach to the ratification and enforcement of
      human rights (for example, through the Hague Courts) with non-institutional approaches
      (for example, through human rights NGOs, such as Amnesty International).


4.    To what extent do the complex realities and relationships of power in global politics make the
      concept of human rights an unachievable ideal?



Development

5.    Evaluate the claim that development through aid relies heavily on a stable government and a lack
      of corruption.


6.    The fundamental weakness of development goals (such as the Millennium Development Goals)
      is their lack of focus on how targets are actually to be achieved.  To what extent do you agree with
      this claim?

Peace and conflict

7.     “Transforming armed conflict towards peace relies on an interrelationship of peacemaking,
       peace keeping and peace building.”  Discuss.


8.     “If a person died from tuberculosis* in the eighteenth century it would be hard to conceive of this
       as violence since it might have been quite unavoidable, but if he dies from it today, despite all the
       medical resources in the world, then violence is present” (Galtung).  To what extent do you agree
       with the view that those in power have an obligation to identify and prevent structural violence?  



* tuberculosis: a common, and in many cases lethal, infectious disease which can now be prevented by vaccination
