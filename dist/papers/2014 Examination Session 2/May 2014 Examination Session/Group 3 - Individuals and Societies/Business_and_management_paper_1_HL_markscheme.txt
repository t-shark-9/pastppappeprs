                                              SECTION A


1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    primary sector (line 2)                                                      [2 marks]

                  The primary sector of an economy includes agriculture as well as fishing,
                  forestry and mining. It extracts natural resources / raw materials.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding, similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   dividends (line 23).                                                         [2 marks]

                  Dividends are the payments that a business pays to its shareholders on a
                  proportional basis (percentage) of the company’s profit (a fixed payment
                  amount for each share of the business).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge
                  and understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for Martin Kimathi of receiving
      “a salary based on performance-related pay” (line 45).                     [4 marks]

      Possible advantages include:
      • Martin will be financially motivated to ensure the success of The Imperial,
         because the higher the number of guests, the more Martin himself will earn,
         which is also good for GP as it ensures higher dividends.
      • In the longer term, Martin will pay attention to areas such as marketing and
         strategic development: if some of the options are very successful, that is, if
         Martin performs well as manager he could become very rich, which could be a
         major achievement for the son of a groundskeeper.

      Possible disadvantages include:
      • For some external reasons, for example political or economic, beyond
         Martin’s control, Mombasa could lose its popularity as a tourist destination;
         fewer tourists would stay at The Imperial and Martin’s salary would decrease,
         by no fault of his own, even if he does an excellent job as a manager.
      • The notion of “performance” could be very ambiguous for Martin if it is not
         well defined in his contract: it could be about the number of guests coming to
         the hotel, or the amount they spend (duration, extras…) or it could involve
         other aspects, such as their ratings or comments posted on a website
         (TripAdvisor for example) that Martin cannot control; he would earn less
         money to support his family just because someone gave unfair negative
         feedback about the hotel.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage in the context of The
      Imperial.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each valid advantage/disadvantage, and [1 mark] for each
      development of a valid point, showing why this is an advantage/disadvantage in
      the context of The Imperial.

      Award a maximum of [2 marks] if there is no application to the case study.

(c)   Analyse the advantages and disadvantages for The Imperial of the strategic
      alliance with KenSafar (Option 3).                                         [7 marks]

      The strategic alliance with KenSafar presents both advantages and disadvantages
      for The Imperial. On the one hand, this scheme would ensure a regular and
      predictable flow of guests at The Imperial; the hotel would know when to expect
      them and could make special arrangements, for example organizing transport to
      the hotel. Martin could also benefit from Kamau’s networks and contacts, and
      take advantage of the increasing number of tourists interested in safaris. On the
      other hand, the strategic alliance with KenSafar would be costly for The Imperial,
      in two ways: firstly, the cost of the initial improvements to the building; secondly,
      the 20 % commission, which could substantially make a dent into The Imperial’s
      cash-flow (Martin would need to take this into account when calculating his break-
      even; it could even affect his own performance-related pay).

      Accept any other relevant point, such as spreading risk, poor communication,
      brand image, reputation.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage in the context of The
      Imperial.


      Candidates are not expected to refer to all of the above points for top marks,
      but their analysis must be balanced in order to reach the highest level of
      the markband.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

2.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    appraisal (line 102)                                                            [2 marks]

                  Appraisal refers to a meeting between a worker and a manager (in the case
                  study: Susan and Martin) where they review key aspects of the worker’s
                  performance, including objectives and development.                  Different
                  organizations have different systems of appraisal, such as peer appraisal and
                  360 degrees appraisal.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge
                  and understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].


           (ii)   dismissal (line 113).                                                           [2 marks]

                  Dismissal occurs when an employer terminates the contract of an employee;
                  it is often just called “firing”. To be dismissed, the employee must have
                  been incompetent or must have breached the terms of his or her contract.

                  Accept the term lay-off.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

(b)   Martin Kimathi prepares two types of final accounts for Global Properties
      (GP): profit and loss accounts and balance sheets. Explain the importance of
      those two types of final accounts for GP (lines 69–70).                      [4 marks]

      The profit and loss account of a company shows the sales revenue for a given
      period of time (usually a year), as well as the costs – and also the levels of profit
      (gross profit, net profit). In the case of GP and The Imperial, it is important for
      GP to see how profitable the hotel is and what the dividends and retained profit
      are (the dividends that can be paid to GP shareholders, the retained profit that can
      be used by the hotel for maintenance and other types of investment).

      The balance sheet shows what an organization owns (fixed assets such as the
      building, current assets such as stock and cash) and what it owes others (liabilities
      such as money still to be paid to suppliers). In the case of GP and The Imperial, it
      is important for GP shareholders to see how safe the investment is and how well
      the manager (Martin) is performing, for example towards debtors and creditors.
      The balance sheet also indicates the business’s level of working capital and its
      liquidity, which provide insight into the business’s ability to survive in the short
      term.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct answer, and [1 mark] for each development
      about the importance for GP (ie to get the second mark, the candidate must refer
      to GP in the context of the case study: a purely theoretical answer is not sufficient
      for full marks).

(c)   Analyse the impact that one opportunity and one threat may have on
      The Imperial.                                                      [7 marks]

      This question implicitly refers to a SWOT analysis (opportunities and threats being
      external, as opposed to internal strengths and weaknesses). Candidates are not
      required to carry out a SWOT analysis, but they must identify a valid and relevant
      opportunity and a valid and relevant threat.

      The opportunity / threat must be external.

      Valid and relevant opportunities include:
      • Tourists to Kenya are increasingly interested in combining leisurely beach
         holidays with safaris or cultural tourism; lying by the Indian Ocean,
         The Imperial has traditionally targeted holidaymakers, but Martin has carried out
         market research and realised that market development (to use a term from the
         Ansoff matrix) is a possible opportunity for The Imperial; this corresponds to
         Martin’s Option 3 (strategic alliance with KenSafar).
      • Although The Imperial has always been a hotel for leisure tourists, paying per
         night, Martin has recently considered a different target market altogether (this is
         the opportunity): “business travellers staying at least one week” (see Option 2).
         Although the core product would stay the same (accommodation), several aspects
         would be different (the rooms would be turned into “self-contained apartments
         with small kitchens”). This may seem quite a radical change, but there may well
         be a business opportunity there. The marketing audit has revealed that there is
         increasing demand for this kind of accommodation and there are very few hotels
         in Mombasa offering such apartments.
      • The case study makes some brief and separate references to WiFi access, to
         business travellers and to special events services – although this is not explicitly
         suggested, The Imperial could also specialize in other areas, for example
         developing conference facilities to target high-level meetings with politicians and
         senior civil servants of organizations such as the AU (African Union); this again
         represents an external opportunity that The Imperial could seize.

      Valid and relevant threats:
      • Competition from the “new luxurious hotels” nearby: “with their spas, themed
        restaurants and fast WiFi internet access, they offered better facilities and better
        services than The Imperial”; Martin is very aware of the issue, he has also
        travelled to Dubai and Muscat to get ideas about how The Imperial could reinvent
        itself to try to compete.
      • Although Kenya is seen as a stable country, terrorist attacks are always possible
        (some candidates might have researched the fact that there was a terrorist attack in
        Mombasa in 2002, outside the Paradise Hotel, killing 13 people); this threat could
        deter some travellers from going to Kenya, which would affect The Imperial.
      • Global economic conditions. When major economies such as those of the United
        States, Europe, or the Pacific Rim are in economic recession or are merely in
        periods of slower economic growth, the tourism industry often suffers or
        experiences decreases in revenue.


         If only one threat or one opportunity is external award a maximum of [4 marks].

         Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

3.   (a)   Describe how a hotel such as The Imperial combines human resources,
           physical resources and financial resources for its business activity. [4 marks]

           The “human resources” correspond to the staff employed (not just the workers but
           the managers too, middle managers such as Susan and even Martin as manager of
           the entire hotel), the “physical resources” correspond to the hotel itself (the
           building with the rooms), the “financial resources” correspond to current assets,
           liabilities and even retained profit (simply put: the money in the bank that the
           manager can use). As in any business, the three types of resources are combined,
           ie not taken in isolation: they are interrelated, as for example the financial
           resources may make it possible to improve the human resources (by hiring more
           staff) and the physical resources (by renovating the rooms), which in turn may
           lead to more financial resources.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic answer showing some limited knowledge of what
           “human resources”, “physical resources” or “financial resources” are.

           Award [2 marks] for an adequate answer showing knowledge of “human
           resources”, “physical resources” and “financial resources” by applying them to a
           hotel (for example the fact that “physical resources” correspond to the premises
           and that “human resources” are the staff employed in the hotel).

           Award [3 marks] for a satisfactory answer which partially describes how the
           resources (human, physical and financial) are combined in a hotel (for example
           how the main revenue comes from the physical resources); such an answer shows
           the integration of any two types of resources.

           Award [4 marks] for a good answer which correctly describes how the resources
           (human, physical and financial) are combined in a hotel (for example how the
           financial resources may make it possible to improve the human resources, by
           hiring more staff); such an answer shows the integration of the three types of
           resources.

(b)   Explain two benefits for Martin Kimathi of conducting a marketing audit
      (line 59).                                                              [4 marks]

      A marketing audit evaluates the existing marketing activities in a business. It has
      the following benefits:
      • Based on his experience and intuition, Martin has some generic (preconceived)
         ideas about the types of tourists who come to Kenya; his marketing audit
         however will give him more reliable, factual information. (Note: candidates
         could refer to TOK concepts here).
      • As Martin knows The Imperial and its guests (customers) so well, he might
         miss/ignore some important marketing aspects, for example about some of
         their needs or some of the extra services they could benefit from; the marketing
         audit will enable The Imperial to find out the changes in customers’ needs that
         Martin has not perceived and to analyse data in a more systematic way, not
         based on anecdotes, but on representative samples.
      • The marketing audit could help Martin appreciate which aspects of the
         marketing mix he should change, or not, at The Imperial (for example about
         “physical evidence” the marketing audit could reveal the fact that many guests
         do seek and value the old-fashioned colonial charm of the hotel and stay there
         precisely for that reason).

      Candidates are not asked to define “marketing audit”; they may do so at the
      beginning of their answer. A candidate whose answer solely consists in a
      definition of “marketing audit” would still be awarded [1 mark] overall, in order
      to credit the fact that they have some knowledge of the concept being examined
      here (“marketing audit”).

      There are two references to marketing audit in the case study, one about tourism
      to Kenya in general (see lines 59–61) and one about strategic option 3 (see line
      161). Candidates may refer to one in particular or to both or just to Martin’s
      marketing audits in general.

      Accept market research as part of a marketing audit. However, if the answer only
      refers to market research, award a maximum of [2 marks].


      Mark as 2 + 2

      Award [1 mark] for each valid answer, and [1 mark] for each development,
      showing why this is beneficial for Martin.

(c)   Using examples of migrant workers (such as Jomo Kimathi, Martin Kimathi
      and Craig Chapman), analyse the significance of changes in domestic and
      international labour mobility.                                          [7 marks]

      The case study provides three examples of migrant workers: Jomo Kimathi (who
      first worked in Kenya, then in England, once The Imperial was sold in 1959),
      Martin Kimathi (who was born and educated in England, but went to Kenya in
      2000 to work as hotel receptionist there) and Craig Chapman (who went to Kenya
      in the early 20th century to open and operate an orphanage there). Those three
      examples of international labour mobility show that people migrate for a range of
      work motivation (to find a new job, to find a first job, for financial or
      humanitarian reasons). It is beneficial for the country of arrival (eg with Martin
      and Craig: qualified workforce in Kenya) and sometimes also for the country of
      departure too (eg in the short term, migrants often send money back home, as did
      Jomo, maybe; in the long term, many migrant workers decide to go back home, as
      Jomo returned to Kenya to retire). International labour mobility usually has an
      economic dimension (for example from less developed countries to more
      developed countries) though other factors are important too (for example, joining
      family or avoiding political situations, as with refugees).

      Accept any other relevant point.


      N.B. Change can refer to changes in individual circumstances as well as to labour
      markets.

      Candidates are not expected to cover all the above-mentioned points. However,
      for candidates’ responses in the 6–7 markband, they must include at least two of
      the examples above, in some fashion and consider both the impact on the
      destination country and the “departure country” and recognize that people migrate
      for both financial and non-financial reasons.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

                                              SECTION B

4.   (a)   Describe two features of benchmarking.                                                 [4 marks]

           Benchmarking is a form of external comparison with industry standards and
           competitors as a basis. In the case of The Imperial, a possible approach is to use
           the system of stars used by hotels worldwide – for example if The Imperial is
           locally classified as a 4 star hotel, Martin could compare his hotel to what the
           other 4 star hotels offer locally in Mombasa, and even in Kenya and
           internationally. Another feature of benchmarking is to establish standards:
           Martin's trip to Dubai and Muscat was done in that perspective. This is an
           objective approach, based on what the hotel can offer (eg about personalized
           services and additional extras). The French journalist who praised The Imperial in
           terms of housekeeping compared it to the higher international standards, using his
           own experience – so a more subjective form of benchmarking, based on his own
           experience of The Imperial and what he saw there.

           Features of benchmarking include:
           • established by a person or body outside the organization
           • have some claim to objectivity
           • are known (by customers, industry analysts, government regulators, etc)
           • reflect and help define industry “best practice”
           • typically quantifiable (stars, points, “classes” or grades)
           • can apply to a range of issues (cleanliness, quality of service, quality of food, and other
             areas in various industries) or can be summative (a “four star restaurant”, whereby the
             ranking synthesizes all features
           • typically are periodic used/measured against for identification of trends.

           Accept any other relevant point.

           N.B. No reference to the case study needed.


           Mark as 2 + 2.

           Award [1 mark] for each correct feature, and [1 mark] for each development
           about that feature of benchmarking.

(b)   Explain two advantages for The Imperial of having “separate profit centres
      for the hotel itself, for the restaurant and for the special events services”
      (lines 67–68).                                                                [4 marks]

      The advantages of The Imperial of having separate profit centres include
      the following:
      • The three business units (hotel, restaurant, special events) do not generate the
         same level of profit and do not contribute in the same way to the financial
         performance of The Imperial; it will be useful for Martin to see the differences
         between the three.
      • The three could then set different targets and different priorities, as a one-size-
         fits-all strategic objective might not work (for example aiming for an increase
         of 5 % might be too ambitious for the hotel itself, but not ambitious enough for
         the restaurant which could also target locals).
      • It will also make it easier to identify weaknesses or problem areas where action
         may be required (for example, Martin could realise that the “special events
         services” department costs more money than it generates, or the other way
         around).
      • It will also make it easier for the respective managers to understand their
         budgets and their place in the organization as a whole, also getting more
         responsibility and a sense of control, possibly with some sense of
         empowerment too.

      Accept any other relevant point.


      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for each correct point and [1 mark] for each explanation of why
      this is an advantage for The Imperial.

      Award a maximum of [2 marks] if there is no reference to the case study.

(c)   Explain how Porter’s generic strategies may provide Martin Kimathi with a
      framework for building competitive advantage.                             [4 marks]

      In Competitive Advantage, Free Press, New York (1985), Porter argued that as a
      strategic plan and for gaining competitive advantage, businesses must adopt one
      of three strategies (or, with some very large businesses, some combination
      according to products and markets):
      • cost leadership – basically, offering lower prices than competitors to gain
         market share
      • differentiation – offering products with some USP (other than price) that
         appeals to customers (and may allow for higher prices)
      • focus or segmentation – focusing on a narrow slice of the market that has
         special needs or requirements that other businesses have not anticipated.


      N.B. Award a maximum of [1 mark] if the answer refers to Porters five forces and
      gives some sense that difference from competitors is important.

      The [4 marks] available are allocated as follows:

      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows knowledge and understanding of what
      Porter’s generic strategies are (cost leadership, differentiation, and focus or
      segmentation); this could be in the form of a diagram.

      Award [1 mark] for an answer that shows knowledge and understanding of
      Porter’s generic strategies. In other words, the candidates do not merely list cost
      leadership, differentiation, and focus or segmentation, but provide a brief
      explanation of what those terms mean.

      Award [1 mark] for the application to The Imperial.

      Award [1 mark] for an explanation of how Porter’s generic strategies may provide
      Martin with a framework for building competitive advantage.

(d)   Evaluate two alternative approaches to resolve the conflict surrounding
      Guthoni’s dismissal.                                                    [8 marks]

      The conflict may be resolved in different ways, for example:
      • Through negotiations between Martin and employee representatives,
        agreements could be reached, such as reinstating Guthoni (which might not be
        suitable, as she has a terminal illness and needs to be off sick for treatment) or
        offering her financial compensation (possibly for unfair dismissal, without any
        further action taken by the hotel employees).
      • The hotel employees could adopt methods, such as go-slow and work-to-rule,
        yet short of strike action, in order to put pressure on Martin (without
        jeopardizing the business in its peak season).
      • Martin could put pressure on the employees (though this does not seem to
        correspond to his leadership style) through further threats of redundancy,
        changes of contract or even lock-out (though this seems unlikely, as Martin is
        keen to ensure The Imperial’s business is successful).
      • Worst case scenario (for all key stakeholders) the strike could go ahead, if the
        negotiations fail (this would be bad for Martin as December is one of the
        busiest months of the year for The Imperial, but it would also be bad for the
        employees, as strike action means that they would not be paid whilst they are
        on strike); this would also have long-term implications (as the image of
        The Imperial would suffer: future tourists would hesitate to book there).

      Accept any other valid answer.


      Award a maximum of [4 marks] if there is relevant understanding of conflict
      solving methods that are mainly theoretical (eg long-term solutions).

      Candidates are asked to evaluate two approaches; if they evaluate only one, award
      a maximum of [5 marks].

           Outsourcing is the method of transferring particular functions of a business or
           portions of stages of work to outside contractors/suppliers instead of doing those
           functions or that work internally. Companies usually outsource to lower costs or
           for the expertise provided by the outside supplier.

           Accept offshoring.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding.

           subsidiaries, award [1 mark].

     (b)   (i)   Using information from Item 1, calculate the target profit that would
                 result from an 80 % occupancy rate with housekeeping outsourced.      [3 marks]

                 150 × 0.80 (occupancy rate) × $157 (revenue per night) × 365 days = 6876 600
                 Less: 150 × 0.80 (occupancy rate) × $17 (variable cost per night) × 365 = 744 600
                 Less: Fixed costs                                                       = 4 450 000
                 Target profit                                                         = $ 1682 000

                 Alternatively, candidates might calculate the target profit (80 % occupancy
                 rate, etc) as follows:

                 150 × 0.80 × $140 [$157 − $17 = 140] × 365 days                       = 6132 000
                 Less: Fixed costs                                                     = 4 450 000
                 Target profit                                                         = $ 1682 000

                 Allow $4608.22 which is the target profit per day.

                 N.B. Do not penalize if the candidate uses 200 rooms (instead of 150) in
                 their calculation as line 14 of the case study says 200 rooms, which gives a
                 target profit of $3 726 000.


                 Award [1 mark] if the candidate conveys some sense of how the target
                 profit should be calculated (revenue minus expenses) but does not set up the
                 calculation correctly. Award [2 marks] if the candidate correctly shows a
                 method for determining the target profit but has one error in their working.
                 Award [3 marks] for a correct response and demonstration of working.

(c)   With reference to Martin Kimathi and The Imperial, compare and contrast
      scientific and intuitive decision-making processes.                     [9 marks]

      Scientific decision-making refers to various approaches to decision-making
      undertaken systematically often quantitative. Many of the “decision-making
      tools” that are in the IB Business and Management Guide are types of so-called
      scientific processes: decision trees, ratio analysis, force field analysis, etc.

      Intuitive decision-making processes are often described as a “feeling” about the
      best possible course of action, but actually intuitive decision-making is often more
      rational than typically given credit. Intuitive decision-making often involves prior
      experience usually made consciously, but sometime subconsciously. Often some
      of these data do not fit the narrow structures necessary for scientific decision-
      making models. Intuitive decision makers often described intuitive decisions in
      affective terms: as “a hunch”, a “feel”, or intuition.

      As a good manager, Martin is well trained in scientific decision-making models:
      decision trees, break-even analysis, ratio analysis, etc. He uses these types of
      methods to help him to evaluate options. Even when not formulaic, he uses solid
      logic and reasoning. For example, in addition to the cost savings from
      outsourcing the housekeeping staff, Martin is aware that this would provide him
      with an opportunity to terminate Susan’s employment and, at the same time, take
      away most of her basis for a discrimination law suit.

      Martin is also being influenced by intuitive decision-making processes.
      He senses the importance of Option 3, which would connect with the history of
      the hotel. He also has some sense of the growing importance to people from
      developed countries of eco-tourism and he can imagine The Imperial connecting
      to this global trend. Martin has a certain reluctance to lay-off the housekeeping
      staff (the employees would probably struggle to find new jobs), despite the cost
      savings involved. These intuitive processes make him question the value of the
      scientifically arrived at “best solution”.

      One point of comparison in the case is between Martin and Susan. Susan relied
      exclusively on scientific decision-making (and bureaucratic approaches, which
      often overlaps with scientific decision-making, though they do not necessarily
      have to). Because of this approach, she was perceived as cold, official and
      impersonal. She consciously would not let what she considered “non-relevant”
      information to influence her decisions. Martin, on the other hand, relied on both
      approaches, which made him more appealing at a human level though, from a
      certain perspective, left him open to criticism, eg his “laissez-faire” style.

      Accept any other relevant comparison or contrast.

(d)   Using information contained in the case study and Items 1 to 4, evaluate the
      need for The Imperial to change objectives in response to changes in the
      internal and external environment.                                           [12 marks]

      The Imperial has strong reasons to change objectives in response to changes in
      both the internal and external environment.

      The internal environment has changed in two significant ways:
      1. Tensions between the staff and Susan have become significant and, though
         some opportunities might come out of it (employees coming together), these
         tensions also pose some risks. This changed internal environment has
         propelled Susan to consider a legal claim against The Imperial. The Kenyan
         constitution, Appendix 2, clearly stands against discrimination.
      2. The other significant change in the internal environment is the higher
         expectations for profits by the owners of The Imperial. The Imperial will have
         to make some changes. These pressures are causing Martin to look for ways to
         cut costs (Item 1), though this might lead to laying off some of the staff, which
         he is reluctant to do.

      Major external factors include:
      1. global economic conditions (Items 4 and 5)
      2. increased competition of new hotels
      3. changes in consumer tastes (more luxurious hotels, eco-tourism, etc).

      These and other relevant internal and external factors, in the context of the options
      Martin is considering, should be examined as candidates evaluate the need for
      The Imperial to change objectives. Candidates should recognize that The Imperial
      needs to change its objectives; they have latitude in the direction The Imperial
      should go provided that they can support their answer.

      Award a maximum of [7–9 marks] where either the case study and Items 1–4 have
      been used, ie only one set of data.

      If candidates discuss strategies and tactics with some sense of changing objectives
      without explicitly mentioning them award a maximum of [8 marks].
