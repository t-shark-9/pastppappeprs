Paper 2 markbands: The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for paper 2 published in
the History guide (2008) on pages 71–74. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in
conjunction with the full markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are
uncertain about the content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

 0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.
 1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
        appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
 4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
        inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely understood
        and there is minimal focus on the task.
 6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited in
        quality and quantity. Historical context may be present, as will understanding of historical
        processes, but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
 8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present but is
        not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature. There may
        be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary may be present.
        There has been an attempt to place events in historical context and show an understanding of
        historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either chronological or thematic has
        been made.
 10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications considered.
        Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are generally
        placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison and contrast,
        are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and interpretations but they are
        not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear attempt at a structured approach.
 13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is applied as
        evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to produce a specific
        argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound understanding of historical
        processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of different approaches may be used to
        substantiate arguments presented.
 16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
        question, and, if appropriate, may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
        evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison and
        contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
        appropriately and effectively.

 Following a review of marking practices it has been agreed that in order to add further clarity to the
 markschemes for Paper 2, all caveats with regard to the awarding of marks for questions that include
 more than one component (eg, compare and contrast; reasons and significance; methods and success)
 will be removed.

 Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the ‘best fit’
 to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
 indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications
 are considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then examiners
 should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme: ie, responses that
 offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Topic 1   Causes, practices and effects of wars

1.   With reference to either the Central Powers in the First World War (1914–1918) or the Axis
     Powers in the Second World War (1939–1945), to what extent was their defeat the result of
     poor tactics and strategies?

     Candidates are required to address the statement in their response even if they take another view
     than the one proposed in the question. This question deals with the defeat of the Central Powers or
     the Axis Powers in either the First World War or the Second World War. “Strategies” may be
     defined as long-term planning for military success in a campaign or a war. “Tactics” would be
     more precise use of technology/troops to address the challenges posed in specific battles or to
     achieve certain military targets. Do, however, accept any interpretations that would be reasonable.

     With reference to the First World War, material in support of the statement may include: the
     inflexibility of the Schlieffen Plan, which forced Germany into a two-front war yet failed to produce
     a success; the decision to use unrestricted submarine warfare, which brought the United States into
     the war; failure of the German Navy to beak the British blockade on Germany; Germany entering
     the war with a very weak ally in the form of Austria and an unreliable one in Italy.

     Material that would challenge the statement would include: the effects of the British control of the
     seas which hampered the German economy; reduced access to food and raw materials; the failure of
     the submarines to impose a counter-blockade on Britain and weaken its economy; the superior
     manpower of the Allies especially after the entry of the United States; the economic power of the
     Allies which surpassed that of Germany; the ability of the Allies to bring men and resources from
     their colonies added to their strength; declining morale in Germany brought on by economic
     problems and revolutionary ideology undermined their war effort. The weakness of Austria and the
     defection of Italy also weakened the German effort.

     With reference to the Second World War, material in support of the statement may include but
     not be limited to: Hitler’s decision to undertake a two-front-war in 1941; failure to defeat Britain
     before attacking Russia; failure to secure oil supplies in the Middle East; declaring war on the
     United States thus creating another powerful opponent, German mistreatment of conquered nations
     which led to resistance and support for the Allies; German failure to develop a strategic bombing
     force to attack enemy industry; the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor created a more powerful
     reaction in the United States than they expected, engaging the US in war when they were still
     involved in China; failure to protect their merchant shipping from attack, which led to economic
     collapse; entering a war against a more powerful and advanced industrial and economic power.

     Material to challenge the statement may include: the superior economic and industrial power of the
     Allies especially after the entry of the United States made Axis victory unlikely; the superior man-
     power of the Allies; Allied control of the seas in the Atlantic and ultimately the Pacific was crucial
     to their strength and Axis weakness; the distance between Germany and Japan made their ability to
     support each other very limited in comparison to the Allies; the close co-operation and mutual
     support of the allies for each other was an advantage; Allied air superiority in strategic bombing as
     well as in tactical airpower was a major asset,

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

2.   Assess the importance of economic causes in the origins of either the Spanish Civil War
     (1936–1939) or the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988).

     For the Spanish Civil War economic causes could deal with the question of the inequitable
     distribution of land and the economic imbalance witnessed in Spain pre-1936, for example in the
     system of latifundism which existed in the south (especially Andalucía) and minifundism in the
     north (Galicia in particular). There could be a discussion of the plight of the braceros, or landless
     labourers, in the south and the radicalization of such communities due to poverty and the lack of
     social, economic and political equality. Specific details are required to illustrate the divisions, and
     the animosity fostered by those divisions and reflected in the programmes of different political
     parties or movements. Linked inextricably to the question of economic inequality was the issue of
     the Church, which played not only an important spiritual role in the state, but also a temporal role in
     terms of being a major land holder – and was identified by many as an upholder of an unjust status
     quo.

     Candidates could also identify “other factors” that were important in fuelling the tensions leading to
     civil war, such as the issue of regional separatism; the anticlericalism of particular political parties,
     which provoked reaction from those who feared the move towards a “Godless Spain”; the fear of
     the growth of Communism/anarchism/socialism etc. But the focus should be on economic factors
     and an assessment of their importance. They should not simply be marginalized in a general
     “origins of the Spanish Civil War” learned/pre-prepared response.

     For the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) candidates could examine causes related to economic factors,
     such as the long-standing dispute over mutual borders and control of waterways (Khuzestan and
     Shatt-el-Arab) which had been vexed issues even before the fall of Muhammad Reza Shah in 1979.
     The Shatt-el-Arab waterway acted as a vital outlet for both Baghdad and Tehran with regard
     to oil exports. Khuzestan was one of Iran’s most valuable oil-rich provinces and desired by Iraq,
     which also believed that the Arab majority population in that area would allow Saddam Hussein a
     relatively easy victory in the event of an invasion. The oil boom of 1979–1980 helped Iraq to fund
     military developments in preparation for a possible conflict, at a time when changing circumstances
     in Iran made success in war likely in Saddam Hussein’s opinion.

     A major cause of war was Iraq’s desire to take advantage of Iran’s military weakness after the fall
     of the Shah.

     Calls by Tehran for Iraq’s Shiite majority to rise against the Saddam Hussein’s secular regime also
     added to Saddam’s desire to teach Iran a lesson and establish regional hegemony, as well as gain
     oil resources.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

3.   “Victory was the result of superior technological development.” With reference to either the
     Falklands/Malvinas War (1982) or the Gulf War (1991), to what extent do you agree with this
     statement?
     The outcome (victory) of either conflict should be examined in relation to a variety of factors
     (hence the “to what extent?” command), though it is necessary to focus on the role played by
     technological development in either war and not merely dismiss it or accept it uncritically as a
     reason for the triumph of one particular side.

     For the Falklands/Malvinas War (1982), candidates could consider the relative strengths of both
     protagonists in terms of military technology used in the conflict: the task force consisting of
     Royal Navy warships and aircraft carriers with Harrier jets as well as requisitioned merchant and
     passenger vessels dispatched by Britain to re-conquer the islands which were taken by Argentinian
     forces in early April 1982; the supply by the US of Sidewinder missiles to Britain, which proved
     crucial in aerial combat with the Argentinian air force; satellite intelligence provided by
     Washington to London, which aided in the identification of Argentinian troop and naval
     dispositions; the use of British submarines to sink enemy vessels and prevent the resupply of
     Argentinian troops on the islands; the provision of intelligence by Chile concerning Argentinian air
     force movements etc. Argentina’s Exocet missiles and French-built Mirage III fighter planes were
     unable to compete successfully with British air and naval power.

     Other factors which could be considered in explaining victory are: the underestimation by the
     Galtieri regime of the likely British response, which may have encouraged the occupation of the
     islands in the first place; foreign aid and support provided to Britain by the US in particular; the
     effect of Argentinian morale after the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano by the Royal Navy;
     the discrediting of the military junta in Argentina as a result of lack of military success, leading to
     calls for its ending etc.

     For the Gulf War (1991) candidates could consider the military strengths of the multinational force
     (most of whose equipment, financing and troops were provided by the US), which went to war to
     restore Kuwait’s independence after the Iraqi invasion and annexation in August 1990 and
     Saddam Hussein’s refusal to accept UN resolutions to withdraw. Airpower and strategic targeting
     of Iraqi military positions and economic infrastructure allowed the forces of the coalition to launch
     land attacks without serious resistance. The effectiveness of such airpower led to large casualty
     rates amongst Iraqi ground forces as well as retreats and mass surrender as morale collapsed.
     Civilian and military losses suffered by Iraq led to Baghdad’s acceptance of the aforementioned
     resolutions, as well as an agreement to pay compensation for damage inflicted by Iraq on Kuwait’s
     infrastructure. The Iraqi Scud missiles that were used against Israel and Saudi Arabia had little
     military impact on the outcome of the conflict.

     Other factors which could be considered in explaining victory are: the unity of the UN in imposing
     collective security in the changed geopolitical circumstances of 1990–1991; Moscow did not veto
     UN action; the imposition of a UN-sponsored trade embargo on Iraq from 1990 onwards that
     prevented Baghdad from selling its oil, and the willingness of oil-consuming nations to cooperate in
     their own interests to prevent Saddam Hussein taking control of Kuwait’s oil supply. Lack of unity
     in the Arab world also prevented support for Iraq as states such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria
     supported the aims of the coalition, less out of sympathy for Kuwait than in their own future
     interests and security if Saddam Hussein’s ambitions were not curbed.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

4.   Examine the factors that hindered the successful establishment of collective security in either
     the period 1920–1930 or the period 1945–1955.

     Note that answers should not focus on events/issues outside the stated period. Responses dealing
     with events after 1930 or 1955 cannot be credited.

     The League of Nations and the United Nations Organization (UNO) were set up after the world
     wars to prevent the outbreak of future conflict. Revulsion against the human and material cost of
     the world wars led to the desire to establish a mechanism that would provide a platform for dealing
     with potential conflict – and a vehicle for promoting functionalism through the provision of
     agencies or organizations to encourage international cooperation. Despite such sentiment in the
     immediate post-war period, however, collective security encountered significant obstacles to its
     success.

     With reference to the period of 1920–1930, for factors which hindered the successful
     establishment of collective security, candidates could consider: the provisions of the League’s
     Covenant; the non-universality of membership (for example, the failure of the US to join);
     revisionism and revanchism associated with the post-war peace settlement; the reluctance of Great
     Powers to sacrifice the pursuit of national self-interest etc. Such factors should be linked to specific
     cases to substantiate claims made – Åland Islands, Vilna and Corfu, for example.

     Similarly, candidates could consider the other agreements or pacts intended to promote collective
     security in the period and explain to what extent collective security was hindered – and how
     and why. In the period 1920–1930, candidates could also consider the Washington (1921–1922)
     and London (1930) Conferences, the Locarno Pacts (1925), and the Kellogg–Briand Pact (1928),
     for example.

     With reference to the period of (1945–1955), in the case of collective security arrangements, the
     likely focus of answers will be the work of the United Nations Organization.

     For factors hindering the successful establishment of collective security in the period 1945–1955,
     candidates could include the emergence of Cold War tensions which prevented the UN in particular
     from acting in cases of aggression (with the notable exception of Korea, 1950–1953).
     The existence of the veto power in the Security Council led to paralysis of the organization for most
     of the period.

     Some candidates could also deal with regional security pacts or agreements such as North Atlantic
     Treaty Organization (NATO, 1949), the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty
     (ANZUS treaty, 1951), South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO, 1954) and the Baghdad and
     Warsaw Pacts, which were established at the end of the period (1955). The willingness of states to
     resort to such regional collective security agreements illustrates the level to which the UN was
     relegated in status and power. The existence of atomic weapons added to already existing fears, and
     reinforced the desire to establish spheres of influence which prevented cooperation between major
     powers in the pursuit of genuine global collective security.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

5.   Evaluate the contribution of external involvement to the outcome of two civil wars, each
     chosen from a different region.

     The focus should be on identifying the nature and extent of external involvement, whether
     economic, military, diplomatic etc. Few, if any, 20th century civil wars have remained free from
     outside involvement, and the impact of such intervention needs to be evaluated – an approach could
     be an assessment of the extent to which such involvement aided one side to victory, or in fact
     proved counter-productive (for example in Russia’s civil war). Extensive coverage of the motives
     for foreign intervention is not required.

     Popular examples are likely to be: the Russian Civil War (1918–1921/22), the Chinese Civil War
     (1927–1949 or 1945/6–1949), the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), the Korean War (1950–1953),
     or the Vietnam War (approximately 1961–1975). Candidates could investigate the types of aid
     provided in terms of war material and/or military personnel, and how and why (or not, depending
     on the war selected) such aid could be considered decisive in determining the outcome. In some
     cases the military equipment, advisors and troops which were sent by outside powers could be seen
     as giving an advantage to one particular side – especially when the opposing side struggled to match
     such aid (for example, Spain) due to lack of domestic military capacity or equivalent outside
     support. In other cases, outside intervention, even though significant in terms of material or troops,
     did not produce victory for the recipient (for example, Vietnam or – to a lesser extent – Russia).
     Other factors may be considered alongside the issue of external involvement (economic factors
     favouring one side, political divisions hampering unity of a particular side etc) but candidates are
     required to consider the issue of external involvement and not gloss over the issue by producing a
     narrative overview of the causes and practice of civil wars.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

6.   “The poor military strategy of governments is the principal reason for the success of guerrilla
     movements.” With reference to two guerrilla wars of the 20th century, how valid is
     this statement?

     The focus of the response should be a discussion of the importance of government military strategy
     in determining the success of guerrilla movements. Failure to do so would indicate a failure to
     answer the question. Candidates may state that government military strategies were of little
     importance but they must address their role in some form in their response.

     The ways in which government military strategies may have played a role in their failure in
     guerrilla warfare may include: governments’ focus on military control of cities and failure to control
     the countryside; governments’ reliance on advanced technology to defeat the guerrillas instead of
     using weapons more suited to the environment and type of combat; governments’ failure to train
     troops in the nature of guerrilla warfare and how to succeed in it; large-scale government attacks
     such as aerial bombing may have caused extensive damage to civilian lives and property thus
     alienating the population. The use of foreign troops or agents by governments may alienate the
     population and further reduce support.

     Factors which may challenge the statement may include: weaknesses or failures in government
     political and economic policies may have been more important in creating support for the guerrilla
     movements; governments may not have possessed a charismatic or popular leader who could attract
     support; governments’ failure to see guerrilla warfare as having a large political component and an
     attempt to win the war by military means alone. In addition candidates may suggest that the
     strength, popularity and strategy of the guerrilla movement were such that no government initiative
     would be successful.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the

Topic 2    Democratic states – challenges and responses

7.   Examine the obstacles to the success of democracy in Weimar Germany (1919–1933).

     The question invites candidates to explore democracy rather than the rise of Hitler.

     The focus of the task should be the identification of obstacles throughout the period. While the rise
     of extremist political movements occurred during Weimar’s existence – and especially after
     1929/30 – there were indeed threats to democracy from the outset from extremists: Spartacus
     League; Kapp Putsch; November Putsch. Areas for consideration could include: the circumstances
     in which democracy was introduced (was it welcomed by the population, or foisted upon them in an
     attempt to mitigate punishment in the post-war settlement?); the constitutional structure and
     provisions; the association with defeat and the influence of the Versailles “diktat”; the economic
     crises of 1923 and 1929–1930 onwards; the willingness of political leaders to abandon democratic
     government by March 1930 (Hindenburg’s invocation of Article 48); the failure of institutions
     (judicial, military, civil service) to commit to the new system; the actions of particular parties which
     were willing to abandon democracy in favour of their own interests (for example, the Centre Party
     (Zentrum) or the Nationalists (DNVP) by 1933).

     The story of Weimar was not only a tale of constant failure or disaster – there was a Golden
     (arguably a “gilded”) Era under Stresemann from 1924–1929, which did seem to indicate that
     democracy was taking root as the economic and political situation stabilized. The fragility of the
     system in this period, however, does provide an opportunity for candidates to comment upon the
     underlying problems which the Republic faced and had insufficient time to deal with.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

8.   For what reasons, and by what methods, did political and economic change occur in Japan
     between 1945 and 1952?

     The occupation period offered the opportunity for the victorious Allies to demilitarize, organize war
     crimes trials and dismantle the zaibatsu (industrial combines). It also resulted in a significant
     reorganization of Japan’s political and economic structure: SCAP (Supreme Commander for the
     Allied Powers), under Generals Macarthur and Ridgeway, sought to establish democratic rights
     and institutions to prevent a revival of militarism.

     Reasons for the original implementation of political programmes by SCAP and the subsequent
     changes, especially in the economic development of Japan by 1947–1948, could be explained and
     linked to the growing international tensions that generated anxiety in Washington and encouraged a
     reassessment of Japan’s economic, political (and even military) future in a Cold War world
     (Maritime Safety Force established 1948; Self Defence Force, 1952). The outbreak of the Korean
     War – a proxy war amongst other things – and its significance for Japan could be considered.

     Candidates, in relation to political changes (developments), could refer to the post-war Japanese
     constitution (1947), in which the role of the emperor as symbol of the state (deriving his position
     from the will of the people) was clearly stated, along with the establishment of a bicameral diet
     elected by universal suffrage. Some candidates may explain the respective importance of the
     House of Representatives and House of Councillors. A supreme court was to decide on whether
     laws infringed constitutional provisions/rights, and courts were independent of control by the
     Ministry of Justice. Reference could be made to the guarantees of human rights, freedom of speech,
     religion, association and the improvement in the position of women in terms of suffrage and rights
     within marriage.

     Economic changes (developments) could include consideration of: legislation to improve the
     rights of workers (Trade Union Law, 1945; Labour Standards Law, 1947); land reform (which by
     1950 was responsible for redistribution of the holdings of absentee landlords to tenants); and
     developments after 1947–1948, as earlier changes were altered and emphasis was placed on
     encouraging an industrial revival of Japan. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
     (MITI) was established under US guidance to deal with economic recovery, and a series of policies
     introduced to stimulate economic growth: an end to previous policies to abolish
     the zaibatsu; fixing of the dollar/yen exchange rate to promote currency stability.

9.   With reference to one democratic state in the first half of the 20th century, examine how it
     coped with threats from either internal or external sources.

     Candidates are required to select one democratic state from the first half of the 20th century.
     References to threats to democratic states after 1950 are not acceptable and will be considered as
     not having answered the question.

     Candidates are required to identify either internal or external threats to a democratic state and then
     determine how effectively these threats were dealt with.

     Internal threats may include: economic collapse; political division and extremism; new ideologies,
     racial and ethnic tensions; religious divisions; constitutional disputes; armed insurrection and/or
     civil war.

     Popular choices of countries subject to internal threat may include: Weimar Germany; Spain;
     France; United States; Argentina.

     External threats may include: invasions; trade or economic sanctions/boycotts; involvement in wars.

     Popular choices may include: France; Britain; Czechoslovakia.

     Candidates must not simply describe the course of a crisis but explain clearly the nature and
     severity of the threat and what specific steps were taken to deal with it and how successful or
     unsuccessful they were in dealing with the crisis.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
     However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

10.   Examine the methods used, and level of success achieved, in the struggle to gain gender
      equality in one 20th century democratic state.

      Candidates should identify the extent of the gender imbalance in the selected state, for example in
      relation to issues such as: suffrage; legal rights, such as property/inheritance; opportunities
      in education and employment; marriage/divorce etc. The focus should be on identifying the
      policies adopted by democratic governments to address such inequality, and an assessment made of
      their effectiveness or success achieved. Candidates are required to create an effective argument
      supported by reference to specific historical knowledge of the methods used.

11.   To what extent was Canada successful in dealing with the political and economic challenges it
      faced in the period 1968–1984?

      Candidates must identify a number of challenges that existed at this time and then determine how
      successfully they were addressed.

      Political challenges: These may include: growing nationalist movement in Quebec which
      threatened to divide the country; increasing alienation of the Western provinces which led to new
      political initiatives to increase their power; demands for the patriation of the Canadian constitution
      including an enshrined Charter of Rights and a formula for constitutional amendments.

      Candidates may argue that the government had limited success in dealing with these issues.
      The Quebec nationalist movement was defeated in the referendum of 1980 but it did not disappear
      and continued to expand its popularity; the alienation of the western provinces increased, leading to
      the formation of a Western political party and even discussion of separation; the patriation of the
      constitution was achieved along with the Charter of Rights but Quebec refused to sign the accord
      and no amending formula was agreed upon. This led to further challenges in later years.

      Economic challenges may include: stagflation of the 1970s; rising government deficit and debt;
      recession.

      Economic challenges: The government intervened in the economy in order to address problems
      with a variety of measures such as wage and price controls that attempted to address inflation
      (some success was achieved but broader issues of stagflation were not easily resolved);
      governments attempted to address recession issues with increased spending which provided some
      temporary relief but which increased debt and deficit leading to problems in the later years. It could
      be argued that governments had limited ability to address economic issues as they were worldwide
      and because of the influence of the US economy

      These are only examples of problems and all reasonable responses should be credited.

      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

12.   “Coalition government proved unworkable and unable to promote stability.” With reference
      to two 20th century democratic states, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      A working definition or understanding of what is meant by coalition government would be an
      appropriate starting point for candidates. The question invites candidates to examine the
      functioning of coalition governments in the selected states in relation to a variety of areas
      (economic, political, and social) and comment on whether the coalitions were able to address the
      issues facing the democratic state effectively. In some cases it could be argued that coalition
      governments, because of the fragile nature of their composition, were unequal to the task of acting
      quickly to deal with pressing problems. On the other hand, it could be argued that coalition
      governments allowed for different political groups to work together in the national interest to
      promote a stable administration, with effective policies acceptable to the majority of the population.

      Whichever states are chosen (likely examples could be Weimar Germany, Switzerland,
      the Netherlands, Italy etc) the candidate is required to comment on the extent to which such a
      system of government was unable to function due to divisions amongst its members, and whether
      the attempt to promote stability (economic or political, for example) was impossible due to other
      factors or circumstances outside the control of any democratic form of government.

      Specific knowledge is necessary to substantiate the argument presented.

      There is no regional requirement.

Topic 3    Origins and development of authoritarian and single-party states

13.   “Widespread support for the ideology of authoritarian or single-party leaders was the most
      important factor in their rise to power.” With reference to two leaders, each chosen from a
      different region, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates could, at the outset, provide a working definition of the term “ideology”; for example in
      order to identify the main beliefs (social, economic, political) of the chosen leaders. The task is to
      comment on the extent to which such ideology was welcomed by the population on a large scale
      (ie “widespread support”) and why – or whether – other factors were as important, or more
      important, in explaining the rise to power. Answers that focus on the leaders in power are
      not relevant.

      Some candidates – if Stalin is chosen as an example – may comment on the fact that support for
      Stalin was “widespread” in the Party rather than the population (though the reason for the
      popularity may have had as much to do with patronage than ideology per se). This is a legitimate
      approach, since at the time of the succession dispute the USSR was a single-party state and the rise
      of a leader was dependent on support within the party, rather than popularity within the populace.

      Having commented upon the significance/importance of ideology, candidates could consider a
      variety of other factors which explain the accession to power of the chosen leaders. These could
      include: lack of faith in discredited existing regimes that proved unable to deal with economic and
      political crises; the failure of opponents to organize resistance to the rise of the leader and his
      movement; collaboration and/or cooperation of individuals or vested interests who underestimated
      the aspiring leader and believed he could be controlled; fear of alternative radical movements and
      leaders; the use of force and propaganda etc.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

14.   Assess the importance of the use of force and economic policies in the maintenance of power
      of one authoritarian or single-party ruler.

      Note the focus of the question is rule, not rise, and answers which dwell on the period of rise do not
      meet the requirements of the task.

      For force, candidates could consider: the use of physical intimidation by means of internal security
      forces and/or paramilitary groups used to suppress opposition and enforce the party/leader’s will;
      the establishment of camps to punish and/or “re-educate” dissidents; the use of the purge against
      sectors of the population and, in some cases, the party or movement itself; the application of
      arbitrary arrest and terror to atomize society and prevent the organization of opposition movements;
      show trials manufactured to scapegoat perceived opponents and intimidate the population etc.

      For economic policies, examination could be made of specific policies implemented by the
      single-party leader to address economic issues and provide solutions to problems such as
      unemployment, inflation, maldistribution of economic resources within the state etc. In some cases
      economic policies could be seen to be successful in addressing economic distress, though in other
      cases the adoption of economic programmes in the areas of industrialization and agrarian reform,
      for example, did little to tackle general distress – and indeed contributed to new and higher levels of
      distress for many.

      The emphasis is on force and economic policies, though the term “assess” does allow candidates to
      comment on “other factors” which could be considered significant in the maintenance of power.
      These “other factors”, however, should not be a replacement for the main focus of the task, and
      responses that show little evidence of knowledge of the stated factors of force and economic
      policies cannot access the higher markbands.

15.   “The domestic policies of Stalin were beneficial to the Soviet Union up to 1939.” How valid is
      this statement?

      The domestic policies of Stalin may include: economic development both industrial and
      agricultural; a move from an agricultural to an urban society; the elimination of opposition to
      himself and the Party and complete political control.

      Stalin’s domestic policies for economic development involved a series of 5 year plans. These plans
      may be seen as successful in developing certain aspects of the Soviet economy such as iron and
      steel, and large engineering machinery as well as infrastructure such as canals and hydroelectric
      projects. They were much less successful in providing consumer goods and improving the standard
      of living. Basic necessities such as food and housing were often in short supply. The emphasis on
      heavy industry meant that Soviet citizens saw little improvement in their lives and faced increased
      hardships as few goods were made available.

      Agricultural policy which involved forced collectivization of land proved less successful and led to
      widespread famine in which millions died as well as a permanent weakness in the Soviet economy
      as food production never reached the necessary levels. It did achieve political goals of eliminating
      potential opponents of the regime but was not a sound economic policy.

      The transformation from an agricultural society to a more urban one was achieved through policies
      of forced collectivization of land and the transfer of millions of people to new industrial cities.
      These new industrial cities were centres for increased industrial production which allowed Russia to
      develop armament and other industries necessary for defence against invasion. This was a key goal
      of Stalin. This industrial policy was successful in achieving the goals of the government but
      involved considerable cost in human lives, family dislocations and other hardships.

      The elimination of opposition and political control were achieved through purges, mass arrests,
      labour camps and deportations as well as extensive propaganda. These were successful in removing
      all internal dissent and challenges to the authority of the government. They could be seen as less
      successful in terms of the numbers of casualties, the loss of talented individuals and the enormous
      resources devoted to internal security. In addition an atmosphere of terror and fear was created.
      The need to diminish the influence of various ethnic groups as part of national unity and elimination
      of rival groups led to the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s in which millions died as well as the
      relocation and internal deportation of many ethnic groups – all of which led to considerable
      hardship.

      Candidates may argue that Stalin was successful in transforming the Soviet Union to satisfy
      his priorities.

      This transformation, it might be argued, came at a great cost both in terms of human suffering and
      an enormous waste of resources as a result of trying to achieve political goals rather than
      economic efficiency.

16.   With reference to one of the following leaders: Castro; Perón; Nyerere, assess the extent to
      which his economic policies were successful.

      Candidates must produce a critical analysis of the success of the economic policies of the chosen
      leader. Narrative accounts will not score well. In each case the leader’s key economic policies
      should be identified and their success assessed. All, of these leaders experienced varying degrees of
      difficulty in implementing their economic plans. Candidates should be able to explain the causes of
      these difficulties as well as noting any success that they may have had.

      Castro’s economic policies were designed to diversify the Cuban economy from its dependence on
      sugar as an export and to increase food production and industry. This would make Cuba better able
      to export and improve standards of living. He also wished to free Cuba from dependence on the
      US. This led him to open close relations with the USSR and other communist bloc countries in
      search of export markets and capital.

      His internal economic policies were based on a Soviet model of state control and ownership of all
      the means of production. These policies were generally a failure as production declined, rationing
      was introduced and Cuba still relied on sugar as its main export. The same problems that caused
      poor economic performance in other communist states such as the USSR or the Soviet bloc in
      Eastern Europe occurred in Cuba. In addition, the emigration of many skilled workers and
      managers who were unhappy with the socialist model hampered development. The Cuban economy
      became dependent on Soviet subsidies to survive, and thus Cuba went from being a US satellite to a
      Soviet satellite.

      The Cuban economy was directed and controlled by the USSR from 1970 onwards and made some
      progress in expansion of industry but sugar remained the key export and the vast majority of trade
      was with the Soviet Union which meant that the Cuban economy had not achieved the ability to
      compete in world markets. The Cuban economy was entirely dependent on a large Soviet subsidy
      to survive. This was made clear when the withdrawal of Soviet support after 1991 caused the
      collapse of the Cuban economy. This resulted in unemployment, food shortages and a much lower
      standard of living.

      After 1994, the recovery of Cuba was made possible by the abandonment of previous economic
      policies in order to attract foreign investment, allow foreign ownership of industry and encourage
      tourism. This was a complete reversal of the earlier policies of Castro and marked a return to
      reliance on market forces to improve the Cuban economy.

      Perón’s economic policies were designed to eliminate foreign influence in the Argentinian
      economy, expand and diversify the Argentinian industrial sector and to increase incomes and living
      standards. These policies were initially successful as the result of the use of profits from exports
      during the Second World War were used by the government to purchase a number of foreign owned
      companies and reduce Argentina’s dependence on foreign loans. In addition foreign enterprises in
      Argentina were not allowed to export their profits and were required to invest them in Argentina.
      This led to a significant expansion of Argentinian industry and the creation of new industrial sectors
      such as aviation, and shipbuilding as well as expansion in other sectors such as iron and steel.

      The government also imposed high tariffs on imports to protect new Argentinian industry and
      encourage investment in new industrial ventures. Government resources were also shifted away
      from the traditional agricultural focus to support these new industries. These policies resulted not
      only in increased industrial investment and production but a significant expansion of real wages and
      employment opportunities for many Argentinians. This improvement in living standards was also
                                            – 21 –             M14/3/HISTX/BP2/ENG/TZ2/XX/M


aided by heavy government investment in the social infrastructure such as education and
health care.

The success of these policies could not be sustained as Argentina still required foreign loans and
investment to realize the new policies. Perón’s nationalization of foreign industry and his hostility
to foreign investment caused significant decline in the availability of foreign capital which began to
put limits on his expansion plans. In particular American investment and willingness to trade with
Argentina were greatly reduced as there were fears that Perón was setting up a type of socialist or
anti-capitalist state. Perón’s decision not to join General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
was short-sighted as it limited Argentina’s opportunities to export. This weakness in exports caused
by the GATT decision and American attitudes was further compounded by the fact that by 1950,
European industries had recovered from the ravages of the Second World War and were recovering
their export markets at the expense of the Argentinians. The new Argentinian industries were not
able to compete against the Europeans and others who were returning to world markets which led to
a sharp decline in export income. This decline in income limited Perón’s ability to continue his 5-
year plans and expand government revenues and economic opportunities.

Despite this decline in income, Perón continued to spend large amounts on infrastructure and other
social projects. This high level of spending caused increased government debts, severe inflation,
stagnation and limited growth. Inflation rates of 20 per cent and higher were quite common and did
much to undermine economic development, discouraged investment and lowered the standard of
living. A new 5 year plan in 1953 attempted to shift the focus to agriculture but this was not
successful and the pattern of high inflation, large government deficits, low exports and large
amounts of government regulation continued to put severe limits on growth and prosperity.

Nyerere’s economic policies were expressed in the Arusha Declaration of 1967. This was the
document that proposed that the economy be based on a socialist model similar in a number of ways
to those practised in Maoist China. The basics were compulsory collectivization of agricultural
land and the elimination of virtually all forms of private enterprise. The state was, as a result, the
largest employer.

These policies were essentially a failure as the production of goods especially food collapsed.
The problems of collectivized agriculture had been seen previously in the USSR and the People’s
Republic of China and the Tanzanian experience was very similar. The collective farms which
represented the vast majority of the arable land produced only a tiny fraction of the food required
and much less than before collectivization.

The result of this failure was widespread starvation which was only alleviated by foreign aid. It was
argued that production of certain goods such as tobacco and tea did increase but this was of limited
importance to the populace as the proceeds went to the state to finance its programs. The supply of
basic essentials continued to decline as resources were devoted to state priorities.

The economy was essentially in a state of collapse with declining living standards which were made
worse by high levels of government corruption which diverted the resources available to the benefit
of a few.

In addition to these problems, the government was not able to attract foreign investment or industry
as means to increase development. The anti-capitalist political ideology and hostility to private
enterprise discouraged interest from foreign businesses. This meant that Tanzania’s significant
natural resources were not developed.

The situation became so severe that Tanzania came to rely extensively on foreign aid simply
to survive.

17.   Analyse the successes and failures of either Mao or Nasser as leader of a single-party state.

      Whichever leader is chosen, candidates could identify, at the outset, the range of issues/policies
      which are to be examined – for example the aims and efforts of the leader in relation to: economic
      policies relating to: employment, currency stabilization, agrarian reform, the nationalization of
      foreign and/or privately owned and controlled businesses, programmes to promote industrialization,
      attempts to achieve a more equitable distribution of wealth amongst the population etc); political
      measures relating to: methods adopted to consolidate the leader’s authority (use of force, purges/re-
      education programmes, propaganda, the cult of personality, censorship etc); social policies
      designed to: improve the status of previously disadvantaged classes/groups through universal
      education and programmes to increase literacy, the provision of employment opportunities, health
      care, gender equality, the treatment of religious groups etc.

      Candidates could examine the nature and extent of opposition to specific policies and how
      effectively the regime was able to deal with such resistance – or not.

      While foreign policy is not included as an area of study for explicit examination in the guide
      for topic 3, some candidates may legitimately point out that the various economic reforms
      undertaken by a leader were designed to eliminate external control over the economy and such
      reforms did have repercussions for the leader (for example, the financing of the Aswan Dam
      in Egypt) in the longer term. Similarly, involvement in conflicts (Arab–Israeli dispute,
      Korean War) did prevent valuable resources being used to promote development.

      Successes, it should be noted, can be taken to mean successes not only for the state and its people,
      but for the leader himself. The Cultural Revolution, for example, could be interpreted by candidates
      as a failure in terms of promoting social and economic stability, yet it did re-establish Mao as leader
      after the failure of the Second Five Year Plan (Great Leap Forward).

      Critical comment should be made as to why – and how – such policies could be considered
      successful (or not).

18.   Examine the status of women or the role of education in two single-party or authoritarian
      states, each chosen from a different region.

      Candidates should consider the policies implemented that affected the roles and status of women in
      the society chosen.

      Areas for examination of the “status of women” could include: suffrage rights; the provision of, or
      restrictions placed upon educational and employment opportunities; attitudes to traditional roles of
      the woman within the family structure; policies to promote or restrict births; legal rights such as
      marriage/divorce, property and inheritance, the presence of women in leading political or economic
      roles; the portrayal of women in media and propaganda.

      For the “role of education” candidates could consider the ways in which the chosen regimes
      sought to control the system of education in schools (and state-sponsored youth movements) and, in
      a wider sense, amongst the general population through opportunities for adult literacy, for example.
      Political indoctrination and the need to ensure the continuation of the regime for the future (ie after
      the generation of the leader and his supporters) by fostering acceptance and support for the ideals of
      the leader were crucial for single-party or authoritarian leaders. Education was also used to instil
      the social norms supported by the regime, emphasize specific values important to the regime and
      assist in the development of a disciplined and compliant society.

      Education was not only a vehicle for the promotion of ideology, however, and in some cases, the
      desire of the leader to build a modern industrial state required the provision of educational
      opportunities for a developing work force – in some cases leading to the inclusion of sections of
      society which had been previously ignored.

      In both cases – women or education – specific knowledge is necessary to support the claims made.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 4    Nationalist and independence movements in Africa and Asia and post-1945 Central and
           Eastern European states

19.   With reference to one African or Asian nationalist movement, assess the reasons for its
      success in achieving independence from colonial rule.

      Depending on the selected state, areas for consideration could include: the impact of the world wars
      in weakening the capacity (economic, military) and/or the willpower of the metropolitan power to
      wage a campaign to retain control of the colonial territory; the growth of mass movements led by a
      charismatic leader, able to mobilize the people behind an appealing programme of reforms designed
      to deal with popular grievances (economic, religious, racial etc); the use of force or non-violent
      methods to put pressure on the metropolitan power; the involvement of outside powers
      or organizations (for example the superpowers and/or the UN) which advocated and provided
      support (political, military) for the process of decolonization etc.

      Please note that China is not a valid example for this question, since it was not formally under
      colonial rule.

20.   “Challenges to Soviet control of Central and Eastern European and Balkan states
      (1945–1968) were both rare and unsuccessful.” To what extent do you agree with
      this statement?

      After the Second World War many of the states of Central and Eastern Europe that had been
      occupied by the Nazis and liberated by the Soviet Union (or, in the case of Yugoslavia, by an
      indigenous Communist movement led by Tito) found themselves the victims of sovietization.
      Moscow, for ideological and/or security reasons, established regimes in these nations that were
      intended to remain subservient to the interests of the Soviet Union and to aid in its reconstruction
      after the war.

      The presence of Red Army troops in such states acted as a deterrent to those who sought to
      challenge their incorporation into a Soviet sphere of influence. Despite pro-Moscow regimes, an
      army of occupation, and internal security forces established to eliminate anti-Communist resistance,
      in the period 1945–1968 there were attempts to escape Soviet control.

      The schism between Tito and Stalin, beginning in 1948, provided an example where a Communist
      government in the Balkans was able to defy Moscow over matters of economic and foreign policy
      and follow the “Yugoslav road to socialism”. Expulsion of Tito from the Cominform did not bring
      Belgrade to heel, and indeed Tito became the recipient of US aid of $2.7 billion from
      1951–1960: a case of a successful challenge.

      Other relevant examples where Soviet control was challenged in the period could include: in
      1949–1592, Hungary, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, where Moscow (or, more specifically, Stalin)
      perceived “Titoist” resistance in the administration of these states, leading to purges and executions
      in the attempt to restore Moscow’s control; the East German rising of 1953; Poland in 1956;
      Hungary in 1956; and Czechoslovakia in 1968.

      In most cases the successful re-imposition of Moscow’s power over the satellite state was achieved;
      through the use of force in the majority of cases, as well as a mixture of force and concessions, for
      example, in the case of Poland (and Gomulka) in 1956. The lack of success and the forceful nature
      of the Soviet response to challenges varied according to the geopolitical status
      of the state where challenges occurred. “Front line” states such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
      and the German Democratic Republic were treated especially harshly for any sign of deviation from
      the Moscow line.

      Whether the challenges were indeed rare depends very much on how the candidate interprets the
      term and how much awareness there is of the events in this period.

      Since the question states “challenges”, candidates need to refer to more than one example to
      support their answer. Answers which deal with only one example cannot score well.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

21.   Compare and contrast the methods used in the struggle for independence and the reasons why
      independence was finally granted to Algeria and the Belgian Congo.

      Methods used in the struggle for independence

      The most obvious contrast was the fact that Algeria’s struggle for independence was accompanied
      by a bitter war of liberation (1954–1962) waged by the FLN (National Liberation Front) against the
      colon (European settler) population and the French army. A (conservative) estimate puts the death
      toll of this conflict at 300,000, with more victims in the post-war period as those Muslims who had
      stayed loyal to France were attacked. Guerrilla warfare tactics were used by the FLN in urban and
      rural areas, and the frequent use of terror/torture (by both sides) was common. In the Congo, the
      methods involved a decision by the colonial government to grant independence. This decision was
      not influenced by war or rebellion and there was little violence prior to the grant of independence.

      For comparison, one might suggest that while there was violence in the Algerian situation, there
      might have been a fear of violence in the Congo which influenced the independence decision.

      Reasons why independence was granted

      For contrasts, with regard to Algeria, candidates could examine, the impact militarily,
      economically and politically on France eg the open revolt of colons and General Salan against the
      government of the Fourth Republic, which was believed to be insufficiently committed to holding
      on to Algeria, led to a crisis on the mainland. De Gaulle was the main beneficiary of this lack of
      confidence in the Fourth Republic. By 1960 a referendum on independence for Algeria returned an
      affirmative vote in France and Algeria. By 1962 and the Evian Agreement, the war was over.
      With regard to reasons for Belgium granting independence to the Belgian Congo, candidates may
      mention that neither military conflict nor occupation costs were involved. In addition, unlike
      France, there was no political unrest or instability in Belgium. Mindful of the decolonization
      movement in Africa (Ghana 1957, the bloody war in Algeria, the moves towards independence for
      Nigeria) Brussels very quickly – without any preparation of the indigenous population for the task
      of government – granted freedom. It has been claimed the rapidity of decolonization was quite
      deliberate: the ensuing chaos would lead to appeals by the ill-prepared leaders of the new states for
      help from Brussels. A new form of neo-colonial control would thus replace the formal one.
      This proved illusory.

      For comparison, candidates might mention that in both cases, the colonial power sought to rid
      themselves of territories which they no longer could or desired to possess. In both cases changing
      world attitudes to imperialism and rising support for national independence movements and racial
      equality were undermining their ability to maintain an empire.

      However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

22.   In what ways, and with what success, did Mugabe deal with the challenges faced by the newly
      independent state of Zimbabwe?

      Robert Mugabe became prime minister of Zimbabwe in 1980 after a long, brutal war of liberation
      against the Rhodesian Front government of Ian Smith.           He later became president
      (1987–present).

      Candidates could consider the challenges faced by the new leader in terms of the need to: achieve
      reconciliation with the White settlers who had fought against Black majority rule in the conflict;
      allay the fears of many that Mugabe, as an avowed Marxist, would seize private property and
      embark upon a programme of nationalization; reach a rapprochement with his rival Joshua Nkomo
      and his political movement, the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU); redress the racially
      discriminatory policies that had obtained in Rhodesia with regard to employment, education, land
      ownership, health provision etc, as well as ensure (for economic reasons) that relations with the
      Apartheid regime in South Africa were non-confrontational.

      Candidates need to explain what specific measures were adopted by Mugabe to tackle these
      challenges and how effectively he achieved his aims. This could include: consideration of his
      treatment of Nkomo, who survived only two years in the first coalition government; the ending of
      safeguards for Whites (as previously agreed upon) in terms of reserved seats in parliament; the
      compulsory purchase of land by 1992; the problem of inflation/hyperinflation; foreign debt
      accumulation; the fall in living and educational standards of much of the population along with
      unemployment etc.

      Note that “success” could also be taken to mean success for Mugabe personally in maintaining his
      rule, as well as for the state and its people.

23.   How successful were the methods used to deal with the political challenges faced by one
      Central and Eastern European or Balkan state after it achieved independence?

      The achievement of independence by these states marked not only a period of political freedom
      from domination but the need for each new nation to deal with a variety of political problems in
      order to ensure the stability of the nation.

      The political challenges that new nations faced may include: the existence of disaffected religious
      or ethnic minorities in the state; difficulties of establishing new political structures and systems
      acceptable to the population; the influence of members of the previous regime; difficult or hostile
      relations with neighbouring states; lack of experience by the leaders and the populace in
      administering an independent state; developing a sense of nationalism and loyalty to the new state
      amongst the populace.

      Candidates must assess how well the new state was able to deal with the problems that
      it experienced.

      Some of the ways that their success may be measured may include: their ability (or otherwise) to
      maintain internal unity, establish an effective government, develop a national consciousness and
      defend themselves against external pressures. In addition the success of their methods in
      suppressing the influence of the previous regime or groups associated with it should be assessed.
      The methods used may involve: propaganda and education to explain and promote the working of
      the new state and its government; armed force; the return of previously ousted leaders to provide
      experience, inspiration and knowledge; establishment of laws to prohibit the activities of the
      previous regime or other disruptive groups; seeking assistance of other friendly states to provide
      assistance in transforming the state.

24.   Assess the importance of the leadership of either Ho Chi Minh in the organization of
      resistance to colonial control or Havel in the organization of resistance to Soviet control.

      Whichever leader is selected, the invitation to “assess” requires candidates to identify the
      nature and extent of the contribution of the leader in the struggle against colonial/Soviet control
      and comment upon its significance (importance) in relation to other factors.

      A founding member of the French Communist Party (PCF) Ho Chi Minh, as a member of the
      Comintern, was also founder of the Indo–Chinese Communist party. Ho’s involvement in
      anti-imperialist activities thus pre-dated the First and Second Indo–Chinese wars (1945/46–1975).
      His organization of the Vietminh in 1941 was originally intended to combat the Japanese
      occupation, and by the end of the war the Vietminh were in control of much of northern Vietnam.
      The Viet Minh unified the Vietnamese in their anti-colonial struggles before and after the Second
      World War. Ho created a rainbow party which incorporated all political views during the struggle
      against France. He has a key role therefore in the anti-colonial struggle in Vietnam and was clearly
      the inspirational figure for the movement.

      His declaration of independence of Vietnam after the Japanese surrender was unacceptable to the
      French, and the result was a war of liberation against the French that ended in 1954 with victory at
      Dien Bien Phu. He was a popular hero for Vietnamese nationalists of all political views and created
      the environment which led to the defeat of the French.

      Vaclav Havel, by profession a playwright, produced work highly critical of the Communist regime
      in Czechoslovakia. After the crushing of the Prague Spring of 1968 Havel’s plays were banned in
      Czechoslovakia, though he was able to have work published abroad. His most notable contribution
      to the organization of resistance to Soviet control was to the drawing up of Charter 77, which
      earned him periods of imprisonment, house arrest and hard labour over the next six years for his
      “anti-state activity”. Charter 77 was a condemnation of the Czech regime’s failure to honour its
      commitments to the Helsinki Final Act (1975), by which the signatories had agreed to respect
      “civil, economic, social, cultural and other rights and freedoms”. Charter 77 dissidents were
      relatively few in number, but their influence was felt in other Eastern Bloc states as well.
      Released from imprisonment in 1983, Havel continued to organize opposition groups in Civic
      Forum, resulting in a further period of imprisonment in 1989.

      The unfolding of events in other Eastern European states – for example, the fall of the Berlin Wall –
      helped catalyse events in Czechoslovakia, and a relatively peaceful transition occurred as the Czech
      Communist government disintegrated.

      Popular admiration for Havel meant that the Velvet Revolution of 1989, which marked the fall of
      Communism in Czechoslovakia, also resulted in his election as president of the nation.
      Havel, as an intellectual, was much respected at home and abroad before and after the fall of
      Communism, but whether his work and that of other Chartists who were jailed was of major
      significance – or whether Czechoslovakia was caught up in a “domino effect” of regime changes as
      a result of a loosening of Moscow’s control under Gorbachev (1985 onwards) – is a point
      candidates could consider.

Topic 5    The Cold War

25.   Evaluate the reasons for the change in East–West relations from the Yalta conference to the
      end of the Potsdam conference.

      Candidates have an opportunity here to demonstrate detailed knowledge of the issues discussed at
      both conferences. They should not simply provide a general “origins of the Cold War” or a
      “description of Cold War historiography” response.

      At Yalta (February 1945), with the defeat of Germany imminent, Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill
      reached agreement on: the establishment of the United Nations Organization; the temporary
      division of a defeated Germany (and Austria) into zones of occupation, with similar arrangements
      for sectors in Berlin and Vienna, the intention being to demilitarize, denazify, disarm and
      democratize defeated Germany; reparation arrangements that would entitle the Soviet Union to half
      of a sum set at $20 billion dollars; the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which was intended to
      provide for free elections in the states of Central and Eastern Europe that had been freed from Nazi
      occupation; the formation of a Polish government, which would consist of “London” and “Lublin”
      Poles; and the entry of the USSR into the war against Japan after Germany’s surrender, in exchange
      for the South Sakhalin and Kurile Islands.

      At Potsdam (July–August, 1945) circumstances had changed. The death of Roosevelt (April) and
      his replacement by Truman, Germany’s defeat (May), the defeat of Churchill in a general election
      in Britain and his replacement by Attlee, and the news of a successful atomic bomb test formed the
      background for a less harmonious meeting.

      Issues arising (and producing grounds for potential conflict) at Potsdam included further discussion
      and disagreement over details concerning reparations to be extracted from Germany (including the
      agreement that the USSR would receive 25 per cent of the reparations from the western zones in
      exchange for providing food supplies to these zones), Western reluctance to permanently
      impoverish and weaken Germany was a source of disagreement with the Soviets, Western disquiet
      over Soviet policies in Poland (border changes and the failure to carry out democratic elections), the
      increasing sovietization of Central and Eastern European states, which was felt by Truman to be a
      breach of the Declaration on Liberated Europe agreement made at Yalta, the revelation that atomic
      tests had been successful and the dropping of two bombs on Japan in August increased Soviet
      suspicions of Western intentions. Truman’s decision to take a harder line with the Soviets than
      Roosevelt had, changed the atmosphere at the Potsdam Conference.

26.   To what extent did the US policy of containment prove effective in limiting Soviet expansion
      between 1947 and 1962?

      Candidates could begin by defining containment and explaining the circumstances in which it was
      adopted by the Truman administration in 1947. The “two halves of the walnut” (the Truman
      Doctrine and the Marshall Plan) formed the basis for the containment of perceived Soviet expansion
      in Europe. Examination of events in Greece and Turkey, the Czechoslovakian coup of February
      1948 which acted as an additional stimulus to the expansion of the policy, the Berlin Crisis of
      1948–1949 and the formation of NATO (1949) could be considered in the European sphere, before
      moving on to consider the application of the policy outside Europe with the establishment of the
      People’s Republic of China in 1949 and the outbreak of the war in Korea (1950). Attempts to
      bolster anti-Communist regimes in East and Southeast Asia, militarily and economically, as well as
      the establishment of regional pacts in the Middle East and Australasia, could also be noted. The
      end date of 1962 provides the opportunity for candidates to deal with events in Cuba, culminating in
      the missile crisis of that year following tense relations with Cuba since Castro’s accession to power
      in 1959.

      More developed responses may also identify the instruments of containment and make an
      assessment of whether the original intentions of containment – essentially, to hold in place what
      was considered a spreading tide of Communism – were realized, or not, and why and how.

27.   Examine the social and cultural impact of the Cold War on two states (excluding the US and
      the USSR), each chosen from a different region.

      Reponses will vary in detail depending on the countries chosen, but note that candidates are
      required to focus specifically on two countries.

      For social impact candidates could consider areas such as: increased tensions or divisions in society
      based on ideology, ethnic origin or political views which may be seen as hostile by the populace or
      government; education curricula may be changed to support a particular view of world events,
      history or ideology; various aspects of lifestyle may be forbidden or discouraged as showing
      support for unacceptable ideas.

      For cultural impact candidates could examine: effects on the media; censorship; influences on art
      and/or films produced in the country. In addition the impact on written materials produced by
      governments or individuals may be considered. Music may also be limited or directed in support of
      a political or ideological position. Religion and education are further areas which may demonstrate
      some impact. Restrictions on free expression may be increased to limit the circulation of images or
      ideas deemed inappropriate by government or other groups in society.

28.   Assess the significance of events in either Germany (1945–1961) or the Congo (1960–1964)
      to the development of the Cold War.

      Between 1945 and 1961 Germany played a key role in East–West relations. Agreements reached
      at Yalta and Potsdam on the future of the state illustrated the differing views and geopolitical
      priorities of both sides in the Cold War. The “temporary” division of Germany (and Berlin) into
      Allied zones and sectors respectively assumed a more permanent basis as mutual suspicion and the
      fears of both superpowers became more evident in this period. Western anxiety about Soviet
      expansionism in Eastern Europe generally, and Soviet policies relating to reparations and the
      establishment of a sovietised eastern German zone in particular, led to Washington’s attempt to
      rebuild the western zones as an economic unit and ultimately, by 1949, a political unit – the Federal
      Republic. Similarly, Soviet perceptions of a resurrected anti-Communist and capitalist western
      Germany produced the basis for clashes, such as the crisis over Berlin (1948/49) following the
      currency reform in the zones of the US, Britain and France. Containment of the USSR (enunciated
      in 1947) led to massive American commitment to preventing the loss of West Berlin. US
      perceptions of Soviet aggression led to the establishment of NATO and the Federal Republic in
      1949 and the eventual incorporation of West Germany into the NATO alliance. Soviet belief that
      the rebuilding of western Germany and its inclusion in NATO was a threat to Moscow’s security
      led to the formation of the German Democratic Republic (1949) and the Warsaw Pact (1955). For
      Moscow, Berlin was “the fishbone that stuck in the throat of Communism”, and even after the
      “rescue” of West Berlin by airlift in 1948/49 the Soviets resented the existence of this Western
      outpost – in 1961, the Berlin Wall was erected to isolate this “capitalist island”.

      Events in Germany reflected both the mutual hostility and suspicions of the superpowers and
      exacerbated the development of tensions and the adoption of policies which were eventually
      expanded to other parts of the globe (containment, confrontation, regional defence pacts etc).

      The Belgian Congo achieved independence in 1960. The rapidity with which Brussels decolonized
      was arguably based on the belief that the newly-independent state would still need to rely upon
      Belgium for support, given the lack of experience of Congolese politicians and administrators.
      The desired neocolonial relationship based on dependency did not happen as Brussels hoped.
      Congolese political parties/movements based on regional and ethnic support emerged (Kasavubu’s
      Abako party, Tshombe’s Conakat, Lumumba’s MNC (Congolese National Movement)) and the
      resulting coalition government failed to promote stability. Military mutinies and the secession of
      the mineral-rich province of Katanga under Tshombe supported by the Belgian mining corporation,
      Union Miniere, led to appeals by Kasavubu (president) and Lumumba (prime minister) for UN
      intervention to prevent the total collapse of the new state. UN Secretary General Hammarskjöld
      agreed to provide a UN force (United Nations Operation in the Congo; ONUC) to help resolve
      the crisis.

      Superpower involvement took the form of Soviet claims that the UNO was working under US
      influence, and that the UN itself was guilty of being an agent of Western imperialism due to
      its reluctance to act against the secessionist government of Tshombe. For Moscow, the Congo
      crisis offered an opportunity to attack what it perceived as a UNO that it believed was a tool
      of Washington. When Lumumba, angered that the UN would not countenance action to end
      Katanga’s secession (since it was an internal matter and therefore beyond the mandate of the UN),
      appealed for Soviet aid, Kasavubu sacked him. The United States, worried by Lumumba’s socialist
      leanings, supported the move. In September 1960, a military takeover led by Mobutu Sese Seko
      occurred – backed by Washington. Soviet personnel were expelled from the Congo and Lumumba
      arrested and assassinated by Tshombe, with the alleged help of the CIA. The problems of the
      Congo continued until late 1964/65, when Mobutu declared himself president.

      The events in the Congo allowed Moscow to portray the UNO as a partisan organization, and to
      appeal to the newly emerging decolonized states as the friend and defender of such states against
      Western imperialism – to establish its revolutionary credentials in the “Third World”. For the US,
      the Congo represented an attempt to halt the possible spread of socialism (via Lumumba and
      Soviet involvement) as well as to safeguard the valuable resources of the Congo for the West.

29.   Evaluate the causes of the change in US-Chinese relations after 1969.

      Candidates should address the reasons from both the US and Chinese perspectives and produce an
      assessment of the reasons for change that occurred in each country. The emphasis is on
      understanding the reasons not in providing a narrative or catalogue of events. Candidates should
      demonstrate some awareness of the historical context from 1969 onwards and how this contributed
      to the desire of both states to seek a change in their relationship.

      The reasons for the US to seek a change in relations with China may include: the war with
      Vietnam had weakened the American economy and both its ability and desire to continue its
      containment policy against Communism; it sought to enter a new relationship with China to reduce
      tensions in Asia; it sought a new Chinese relationship as a means to pressure the USSR into
      agreeing to détente through which the arms race and Cold War competition could be reduced with
      resulting declines in tension and economic expenditure. The influence of Henry Kissinger, a
      practitioner of realpolitik, was also important as he helped to move the United States away from its
      ideological hostility to Communist states. The ongoing hostility of China towards the USSR could
      be used by the Americans as a counter to Russian attempts to gain greater influence in the Third
      World. In subsequent years the United States sought to further improve its relations with China as a
      means of increasing opportunities for US industry and investment. This economic relationship
      expanded dramatically after the death of Mao and the adoption of new economic policies in China.

      The reasons for China to seek a new relationship with the US may include: China’s relationship
      with the USSR which had continued to deteriorate since 1960. China was increasingly concerned
      about the USSR: armed conflict had broken out in 1969 between the two and there was a fear of
      further Russian aggression (possibly nuclear). In addition China was on bad terms with other
      neighbouring states such as North Korea. China needed to establish the possibility of a relationship
      with the US in order to diminish the possibility of Soviet aggression. In addition the Chinese
      economy was in a poor condition after the Cultural Revolution and would benefit from the ability to
      develop trade and technology links with the US. The withdrawal of the US from Vietnam reduced
      the possibility of conflict between the US and China in Asia and opened the door for better
      relations. After the death of Mao, a more pragmatic administration sought to expand the Chinese
      economy through a better relationship with the United States.

30. “The break-up of the Soviet Union was the unintended result of policies introduced by
     Gorbachev.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

    Note the focus is the break-up of the USSR, not the reasons for the end of the Cold War.
    Candidates who produce rehearsed responses on “the reasons for the end of the Cold War” cannot
    score well.

    Candidates need to identify the aims Gorbachev set for the Soviet Union. A key point is the term
    “unintended”. More developed responses may consider whether the intention of Gorbachev’s
    regime was to revive an ailing political and economic system, whether the changes were meant to
    go beyond basic reform and whether changes, once inaugurated, proved impossible to control.

    Policies/programmes associated with the Soviet leadership from 1985 include those of perestroika
    and glasnost. Candidates could investigate the stated purpose for such policies and assess the extent
    to which the regime’s goals were met, or whether the forces unleashed were beyond the
    government’s expectations – and means of control.

    The “to what extent” command invites candidates to consider other factors that may be linked to the
    break-up of the Soviet state. Candidates may refer to: longer standing problems that produced a
    general economic malaise; the significance of the forces of minority nationalism inside the USSR
    (particularly evident later in the Baltic states, Armenia and Azerbaijan for example); the impact of a
    foreign policy requiring major expenditure and which proved taxing for the USSR; the weakening
    of control over the satellite states of Eastern and Central Europe (acting as both a symptom and
    a cause of Moscow’s declining power). The attempted coup of August 1991, by those seeking to
    turn back the clock and restore Soviet power after a period of liberalization, was a failure, but
    marked the dissolution of the Soviet state as the individual republics of the (former) Soviet Union
    broke free.

    The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their responses.
    However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

    Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
    “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.
