Optional Theme A — Freshwater – issues and conflicts

1.   (a)   Briefly describe four possible impacts of the flood on different types of traffic
           movement in the area shown on the satellite image.                                           [4]

           Award [1 mark] for each of four statements clearly relating to the photo, such as:
           • airport under water (air traffic)
           • Bruce Highway flooded (road vehicles)
           • river transport disrupted (river traffic)
           • isolation of Rockhampton from places to the west
           • possible closure of bridges
           • difficulty in crossing the flood plain (by any means of transport)
           • some city streets likely to be impassable
           • credit other valid suggestions eg “car parks flooded”.

           Responses must make some reference to two types of traffic (road, air) for maximum
           [4 marks] but do not expect every point to be explicitly linked to a particular type of
           transport.

     (b)   Explain two ways in which agriculture and/or irrigation on flood plains can
           affect water quality.                                                                      [3+3]

           Explanations are likely to refer to two of the following – salinization, eutrophication,
           the impacts of agro-chemicals, effluent run-off. In each case, award [1 mark] for the
           identification and up to [2 marks] for the explanation/developed exemplification.

           The most likely focus for candidates will be:
           Eutrophication [1 mark] occurs when fertilizers/nitrates are washed into a lake/river
           [1 mark]. Algae grow, and then die, leading to oxygen depletion [1 mark].
                                             –5–              M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine the factors that affect the response of a stream hydrograph to a
      rainfall event.                                                                            [10]

      Response of hydrograph should be addressed in terms of lag time, peak discharge,
      rising and recessional limb, overland flow/throughflow contributions, etc. Likely
      factors will include: basin shape, antecedent rainfall, rainfall intensity and duration,
      seasonality of rainfall, basin land use, type of farming soil and rock type, affecting
      porosity and permeability, basin relief, degree of urbanization, forest cover and
      seasonal changes.

      Possible responses include “flashy” response hydrographs (short time lag and very
      high peak flows), or a response that does not differ markedly from baseflow under
      some conditions (chalk lithology).

      At band D at least two factors should be described and linked to a valid
      response/change that may be observed in stream hydrographs.

      At band E, either a range of factors should be explained and linked with hydrograph
      features, or there is an examination of how certain factors interrelate
      eg, human/physical combination leads to very flashy response.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                 –6–              M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


2.   (a)   Define the terms drainage divide and wetlands.                                          [2+2]

           Drainage divide – the line defining the limit of a drainage basin [1 mark] separating
           it from neighbouring basins [1 mark]. Also known as a watershed [1 mark].
           Credit alternative phrasing.

           Wetlands – areas that are regularly saturated [1 mark] by groundwater or surface
           water [1 mark]. These include freshwater marshes, swamps and bogs [1 mark].
           Credit alternative phrasing.

     (b)   Explain how stream discharge is related to channel size and shape.                        [6]

           • Award [1 mark] for defining/calculating discharge.
           • Award [1 mark] for establishing a link between discharge and channel size
             (eg higher discharge in a larger/lower course channel).
           • Award [1 mark] for establishing a link between discharge and channel shape
             (lower discharge in wide, shallow or deep, narrow channels, or equivalent point
             made).

           The remaining [3 marks] should be awarded for explanatory points, such as:
           • role of hydraulic radius
           • importance of wetted perimeter
           • idea of friction in relation to stream efficiency
           • further development of width/depth or shape explanation.
                                            –7–               M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Using examples, examine the hydrological impacts that can result from the
      construction of a dam and reservoir across a river channel.                             [10]

      Responses could cover downstream impacts such as more regular discharge,
      differences in seasonal flow (regime), fewer floods with longer delay and lower
      peaks.

      Upstream impacts could include lower gradient, local base level, increased
      evaporation and seepage.

      In extreme cases lower discharge can cause severe environmental problems eg, the
      Nile Delta erosion and red water famine at Aswan, the discharge of the lower River
      Colorado.

      Accept references to changes in sediment transport immediately downstream or
      upstream, possibly causing clear water erosion and deposition and effects on fluvial
      landforms.

      Impacts that are not hydrological should not be credited; limited credit may be given
      for geographical knowledge of some issues about a recognizable dam/reservoir.

      At band D, responses are likely to be descriptive and at least two hydrological
      impacts should be related to changes resulting from dam construction.

      At band E expect either a greater range of impacts or an evaluation of how impacts
      may vary eg, positive/negative, short-term/long-term.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                   –8–                M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Optional Theme B — Oceans and their coastal margins

3.   (a)   (i)    Define the term littoral drift (longshore drift).                                    [2]

                  The transport/movement of sediment along a coast [1 mark] by wave
                  action/swash and backwash [1 mark]. Credit alternative phrasing.

           (ii)   Briefly describe one named feature caused by littoral drift.                         [2]

                  Accept spits, bars, tombolos, cuspate forelands, beach cusps, drift-aligned
                  beaches as the named feature. There should be a brief description of the
                  chosen landform eg, a spit [1 mark] is a ridge of shingle that is attached to the
                  mainland at one end [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain the formation of two ocean floor landforms associated with volcanic or
           tectonic activity.                                                                         [3+3]

           Features include underwater volcanoes, black smokers, trenches, transform faults,
           mid-ocean ridges and rifts, seamounts, guyots. The explanation should refer to either
           processes at divergent boundaries (upwelling magma and sea floor spreading) and/or
           processes at subduction zones.

           In each case, award up to [2 marks] for identification and description of the land
           forms and up to [2 marks] for explanation of its formation (maximum [3 marks]).

           For example, an ocean trench [1 mark] is a very deep area of water parallel to the
           coast [1 mark] where one plate subducts under another [1 mark].

     (c)   “The loss of coral reefs is not just a local concern.” Discuss this statement.             [10]

           Economic and environmental issues can be investigated at both the local and other
           scales, for instance coral reefs have global biological importance in terms of high
           biodiversity, potential for medicine, while locally coral reefs also protect coasts by
           absorbing the strength of hurricanes and tropical storms. Economically they are
           important breeding grounds for fish and support local incomes, while globally coral
           reefs can be used to stimulate international tourism in visiting coral reefs. A local
           issue could include income generated from activities on coral reefs or that use coral
           eg, souvenirs, jewelry etc.

           To achieve band D, responses will describe a few concerns probably at one scale
           only.

           At band E, expect either a more detailed range of issues (concerns) such as
           economical/social/environmental, local and global, positive and negative or some
           explicit discussion of the statement (might contrast local/economic concern with
           global/environmental concern).

           At band F, expect both.

           Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
                                                  –9–            M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


4.   (a)   (i)    State which of these photographs shows an advancing coast.                     [1]

                  Photograph B

           (ii)   Identify one landform in the photograph you have chosen that shows it is
                  an advancing coast.                                                            [1]

                  Raised beach or abandoned/relict cliff

           (iii) Define the term advancing coast.                                                [2]

                  Advancing coasts are coasts that are growing [1 mark] as a consequence of
                  deposition/sediment deposit and/or the infill of coastal marshes [1 mark] or
                  due to a sea level fall (or uplift of land) [1 mark].

     (b)   Distinguish between the climatic conditions experienced on the east coast and
           the west coast of the Pacific Ocean during an El Niño event.                          [6]

           During El Niño events there is low pressure [1 mark] off the west coast of
           South America, rising air, and therefore rain (and floods) [1 mark].

           Whereas off the east coast of Australia there is high pressure [1 mark], descending
           air and drought [1 mark].

           Award the remaining [2 marks] for further development, eg, upper level winds blow
           westwards, surface level winds blow eastwards, or the use of a diagram/diagrams.

           Award up to [2 marks] for an answer that correctly links pressure and weather but
           confuses east and west.

(c)   Using examples, examine the geographic consequences of the pollution of oceans.          [10]

      The consequences are varied and could include environmental (eg, oil spills affecting
      coastal ecosystems), social (shrimp fishermen affected by death of shrimps and their
      food supply), economic (falling revenues) and political (who pays, cleans up, etc).
      Implications could be divided into short-term and long-term implications for people
      (health, employment, potential for tourism, etc). There may be other valid
      approaches.

      Good answers may do more than list consequences for a single place; they may show
      how geographic consequences are interrelated (eg pollution in one local area has
      consequences for other global areas also, due to oceanic circulation; oil pollution in
      Gulf of Mexico brought a temporary halt to deep oil exploration in other countries;
      transmission of toxic chemicals through marine food chains/webs may result in worst
      consequences being experienced at a distance to the actual pollution point source).

      For band D, responses should describe at least two consequences related to pollution.

      At band E expect either a greater range of consequences or some examination of how
      consequences for different places/scales are interrelated. At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme C – Extreme environments

5.   (a)   (i)    Identify and describe a landform of glacial erosion in area A on the map.          [2]

                  A – Glacial trough/U-shaped valley; accept truncated spurs, hanging valleys.

                  Award [1 mark] for the identification and [1 mark] for a brief description of
                  shape, size or appearance. For example, a glacial trough [1 mark] shown as a
                  deep, straight valley [1 mark].

           (ii)   Identify and describe a landform of glacial erosion in area B on the map.          [2]

                  B – Corrie/Cwm/Cirque. Accept corrie lake/tarn. Do not accept “lake”.

                  Award [1 mark] for the identification and [1 mark] for a brief description of
                  shape, size or appearance of the landform. For example, a corrie lake [1 mark]
                  which is about 1 km wide [1 mark].

     (b)   Using map evidence, suggest two reasons why the area shown on the map has a
           low population density.                                                                 [3+3]

           Award [1 mark] for a reason, [1 mark] for map evidence and [1 mark] for some
           development.

           Reasons may include, but are not limited to:
           • steep relief/gradients/rugged [1 mark] so a challenge for economic
             activity/construction/settlement [1 mark] and identifies area of map using names
             or grid reference [1 mark]
           • high relief/altitude [1 mark] leading to low temperatures / short growing season so
             less than optimum conditions for agriculture [1 mark] and identifies area of map
             using names or grid reference [1 mark]
           • likely to be poor, thin soil [1 mark] due to mass wasting or gravity down slope
             [1 mark] and identifies area of map using names or grid reference [1 mark]
           • inaccessibility/remoteness [1 mark] due to limited transportation [1 mark] and
             identifies area of map using names or grid reference [1 mark].

(c)   “Mineral resources in extreme environments rarely bring benefits to the
      local people.” Discuss this statement.                                                    [10]

      Some candidates may argue benefits are not/rarely realized due to environmental
      challenges. Others may focus on the inequities of who benefits. Either approach is
      acceptable. A range of mineral deposits offer potential wealth to people in extreme
      environments (eg uranium, silver, gold, rare earths etc). However, there are physical
      challenges to resource exploitation eg, permafrost in cold environments or lack of
      transport infrastructure in sparsely populated arid areas. Indigenous people may lack
      the technology to overcome challenges so outsiders/TNCs gain some/most benefits.
      However, there may still be gains for local people. Potential benefits include more
      employment, higher wages, investment, health care and infrastructural
      improvements.

      Another approach might be to argue that minerals bring problems not benefits.
      Problems could include dependency on benefits among indigenous people, conflict
      with economic migrants, leakage of money overseas (remittances), possible
      environmental pollution, conflict over scarce resources (water and land) in arid areas.
      The environment and local society may no longer be sustainable as a result of
      mineral exploitation.

      Do not credit tropical rainforests.

      At band D, responses are likely to be descriptive accounts of the benefits local people
      could gain/do not gain. Alternatively, a simple account is given of why local people
      do not gain benefits.

      At band E expect either a more detailed account of the mineral resources found in
      extreme environments and the benefits they bring / do not bring to local
      people/others or an evaluation of who benefits most from mineral resources
      (carefully weighs up the benefits for local people and TNCs, for example).

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

6.   (a)   (i)    Define the term desertification.                                                    [1]

                  The spread/intensification of desert/arid conditions. Credit alternative phrasing
                  which implies change, such as turning/becoming eg “the desert has expanded”.

           (ii)   Describe the pattern of areas with a high risk of desertification shown on
                  the map.                                                                            [3]

                  Award [1 mark] for each of the following to a maximum of [3 marks]:
                  • adjacent to existing deserts
                  • identification of anomalies eg, Western Australia
                  • limited to central and western Australia (not east)
                  • reference to place names/tropics/latitude.

     (b)   Suggest three reasons why some rainstorms in hot, arid environments result in
           flash floods.                                                                 [2+2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each reason and [1 mark] for a suggested link with flooding.

           Reasons could include:
           • torrential precipitation [1 mark] leads to overland flow/surface water [1 mark]
           • precipitation exceeds infiltration rate [1 mark] thereby causing overland flow
             [1 mark]
           • sparse vegetation leads to less interception [1 mark] and rapid run-off/less storage
             [1 mark]
           • run-off may be rapidly concentrated in wadis and canyons [1 mark] which
             overflow [1 mark]
           • nature of desert surfaces (crusts, rocky, impermeable) [1 mark] also causing rapid
             run-off [1 mark].

           Award a maximum of [4 marks] if the reasons do not clearly relate to flash floods in
           an arid environment, as opposed to generic flooding.

(c)   Examine how human activity may be affected by global climate change in one
      named extreme environment you have studied.                                              [10]

      Candidates may choose to approach this question in terms of current observable
      changes or predicted change. Either approach is acceptable.

      In cold environments, melting permafrost may give benefits or costs. Benefits could
      include longer growing seasons, potential for sedentary agriculture, potential for
      commercial forestry, more rainfall in cold environments, more potential for tourism,
      and increased accessibility of minerals. There may also be less, but unpredictable
      sea ice making sea routes more accessible but potentially more hazardous / increased
      fish availability due to changing sea conditions (increasing fishing potential).

      Problems could include traditional ways of life based on hunting and fishing are
      threatened; out-migration of the younger people, unstable buildings and
      infrastructure.

      Possible loss of snow and its impact on ski resorts in mountainous areas, and the loss
      of water supply from retreating glaciers, impacting on a range of human activities, is
      also a valid response.

      In hot environments: changes in rainfall patterns may give benefits or costs, benefits
      may lead to better grazing potential, more food production and more reliable water
      supplies. Lower rainfall could make marginal land impossible to live on as grass
      disappears and fuel wood becomes limited. Rainfall patterns could become more
      extreme, either more flash floods or extreme droughts. Food shortages may become
      more frequent/intense leading to environmental migration.

      Award credit for an evaluation that takes a considered view of how wealthy people in
      extreme environments may be in a better position to adapt to change eg, water
      management in Dubai.

      Do not credit tropical rainforests.

      At band D, expect some description of two ways in which human activity may be
      affected by climate change in a recognizable extreme environment.

      At band E expect either a more detailed account of a greater range of impacts, or
      some explicit evaluation of a variety of different kinds of impact (positive/negative
      or short-term/long-term).

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme D — Hazards and disasters – risk assessment and response

7.   (a)   Describe the changes shown from 12 August to 14 August in:

           (i)    Storm intensity;                                                                   [2]

                  Increases from category 1 to category 4 [1 mark] and provides dates or
                  locations for this [1 mark].

           (ii)   Storm direction.                                                                   [2]

                  Moves towards north-west then moves towards north-east/swings left then
                  right/moves clockwise [1 mark] and provides dates or locations for this
                  [1 mark].

     (b)   Explain two factors that affect the formation and development of hurricanes.            [3+3]

           Award [2 marks] for a description of each factor and [1 mark] for the explanation.

           Answers could include:
           • temperature of ocean [1 mark], ( 26 C–27 C ) [1 mark], water depth (at least
             60m) to allow evaporation for the energy of hurricanes [1 mark]
           • distance from the equator/latitude [1 mark], between approximately 5o – 30o of
             the equator [1 mark] as coriolis force [1 mark] is sufficient away from the equator
             to generate spin [1 mark]
           • movement of hurricanes away from tropical oceans [1 mark] as they move over
             colder ocean areas and/or land masses [1 mark] they decline because of loss of
             energy [1 mark]
           • other possible factors include wind shear, wind speeds, converging winds,
             development of an equatorial wave.

(c)   Using examples, examine the demographic and socio-economic factors that
      affect the vulnerability of a community to hazard events.                             [10]

      Responses should show an understanding of the term vulnerability and include a
      range of demographic factors (these may include population density, migration,
      gender, age) and socio-economic factors (these may include education level, wealth,
      awareness, experience, the level of development, technology, insurance).
      Many hazard events are socially selective eg, Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans
      (2005) had a disproportionate impact on poorer communities than on richer
      communities.

      To access band D, demographic and/or socio-economic factors should be described
      and an example named.

      To access band E either a good examination of vulnerability should also be provided
      or a wider range of demographic and socio-economic factors for recognizable
      location(s) examined.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

8.   (a)   With reference to either earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, describe two ways in
           which people’s quality of life deteriorates at point A on the diagram.                   [2+2]

           Award [1 mark] for each impact on people (eg their home lost) and [1 mark] for how
           this affects quality of life (eg have to sleep in the open), or some detail of how the
           hazard led to this (ground shaking, liquefaction, volcanic ash).

           Accept other valid statements.

     (b)   With reference to either an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, distinguish
           between the types of response to the hazard event that occur at point B and
           point C on the diagram.                                                                    [6]

           B represents short-term response such as:
           • emergency search and rescue of collapsed buildings
           • the provision of emergency aid / food / shelter
           • the arrival of specialist personnel (external agencies)
           • evacuation in case of aftershocks / further eruptions
           • other valid short-term suggestions.

           C represents longer term organized response, such as:
           • reconstruction (possibly with improved design or land zoning)
           • wreckage clearance
           • salvage operations
           • care and rehabilitation (physical/mental)
           • other valid long-term suggestions.

           Award [1 mark] for each appropriate response that is outlined and [1 mark] for any
           further development of that point (may use examples, or qualify statements in other
           ways).

           Award up to [4 marks] for either B or C; balance is not expected. Maximum
           [3 marks] if ideas do not relate to earthquake or volcano.
                                            – 18 –            M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   “Improved building design is the most effective way for people to reduce their
      vulnerability to hazards.” Discuss this statement.                                       [10]

      Improvements in building design could include modifications such as steel
      reinforcement, base isolators, movable hydraulic joints, strategies to reduce building
      shaking, shatter proof glass, deep foundations. Low cost designs include wooden
      buildings that shake in an earthquake, low density buildings, buildings on stilts,
      reinforced roofs etc. Similar improvements in building design/modification could be
      discussed with reference to volcanoes, hurricanes and other hazards.

      A detailed description of building design is not required, although there should be a
      sound understanding of its importance.

      Discussion should include other ways to reduce vulnerability including land-use
      zoning, early-warning systems, hard engineering structures such as sea walls, soft
      engineering structures such as mangrove swamps and belts of trees, response and
      awareness training, evacuation planning, emergency shelters, investment in
      emergency services, improved monitoring and prediction of natural hazards,
      insurance schemes.

      At band D, responses are likely to be descriptive and might only cover building
      design or other simple ways of reducing vulnerability.

      At band E, responses should either consider more ways in greater depth or offer
      some more explicit evaluation eg, a combination of ways is needed.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme E – Leisure, sport and tourism

9.   (a)   (i)    Define the term environmental carrying capacity.                                   [2]

                  The (maximum) number of people/visitors [1 mark] before the local
                  environment/area becomes damaged/harmed [1 mark]. Accept alternative
                  phrasing.

           (ii)   Define the term perceptual carrying capacity.                                      [2]

                  Award up to [2 marks] for any of the following:
                  • amount of people before the environment/area/activity is spoiled/not
                    enjoyed by those people or others
                  • provides details of different user groups and their perceptions/feelings
                  • provides detail of specific issues linked to negative feelings eg noise,
                    congestion.

     (b)   Referring to specific activities, analyse why the leisure facilities in a central
           business district (CBD) differ from those in the rural–urban fringe.                      [6]

           Differences could include different types of activity or differences in the size, scale
           and target users of the facilities.

           Award up to [2 marks] for the range of activities covered by the answer (should have
           at least two in each case). Typical facilities in a CBD could include cinemas,
           theatres, restaurants, museums, whereas the rural–urban fringe may contain specialist
           sports grounds, garden centres, multiplex cinema, country parks. Also credit rural
           activities eg mountaineering facilities, ski slopes, mountain biking facilities.

           Award up to [4 marks] for an analysis of why differences exist. Likely reasons that
           can be identified for [1 mark] each include:
           • high accessibility in CBD attracts activities requiring many visitors
           • land prices are lower at fringe so attracts activities needing space (do not credit
              simply “more space”)
           • CBD may be old, so home to historic visitor attractions
           • younger people in CBD / older at fringes and this affects local facilities
           • outdoor facilities linked with forest (eg paintballing), topography, etc
           • clustering of activities in CBD where tourists gather
           • high profits in CBD (due to high footfall) attract high threshold retailing (lower
              profit/not for profit at fringes).

           Alternatively, two reasons, well explained (uses examples or concepts like threshold)
           would merit [4 marks].

(c)   “Sport and recreation are an effective means of regeneration for urban areas.”
      Discuss this statement.                                                                 [10]

      Candidates may agree or disagree with this statement. Barcelona and Beijing are
      often given as good examples of how sport can help regenerate a city. The London
      2012 Olympics is considered to be a major success in the regeneration of London’s
      East End whereas Atlanta and Athens may be examples of where sport has had less
      success. Other methods could be discussed, such as property-led regeneration, new
      retail developments, urban development corporations, provided they are legitimate
      spin-off effects from the initial investment in sport rather than entirely alternate
      strategies.

      The effectiveness of some strategies may only be evident over the long-term, and it
      may not be possible to assess “effectiveness” in the case of recent case studies such
      as the 2012 London Olympics.

      Different groups mays have differing perspectives on whether the changes are
      “effective” for them or others, eg those displaced by gentrification or those who do
      not like the noisy visitors that sport can attract.

      At band D, responses are likely to be descriptive and might only consider one side of
      the argument.

      At band E, expect either a wider range of more detailed impacts of sports/recreation
      regeneration for urban areas or some more explicit discussion of effectiveness.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

10.   (a)   Describe the distribution of the participating teams.                                    [4]

            Award [1 mark] for any of the following:
            • they are globally dispersed / spread out / scattered
            • covering most continents
            • often only one or two per continent
            • they are mainly between the tropics
            • although England is an exception
            • only the West Indies and Guyana are west (of the prime meridian/western
              hemisphere) / most are east (of prime meridian)
            • they are mainly coastal
            • although Zimbabwe is an exception
            • with the exception of England, this sport is mainly played in a country that has a
              neighbouring country that also plays this sport
            • credit other distributional points.

            Do not credit “mostly LEDCs” or “ex-colonies of the UK” (as these are not
            descriptive points).

      (b)   Using examples, suggest how social and cultural factors can affect people’s
            participation in international sports.                                                   [6]

            The focus should be on social/cultural factors. Credit economic/cost factors if linked
            to idea of social groups / classes / poverty / inequalities in society.

            There are many possible factors to discuss:
            • some sports are associated with relatively affluent people – equestrian, polo, golf
            • other sports are associated with poorer people – football, boxing
            • gender/ethnicity have played a role now or in the past in barring access eg,
              women and boxing
            • some sports are associated with diasporas (Gaelic football and hurling with the
              Irish diaspora, for example)
            • sports associated with political developments, eg, in cricket most of the countries
              were part of the former British Empire
            • more recent adopters could be related to media exposure/TV access (credit as
              social factor)
            • links with education, aspirations and role models.

            Award [1 mark] for each factor that is correctly linked to a sport and is a valid
            influence on participation. Also award [1 mark] for a further development/rationale
            (eg, cost of buying golf clubs, etc for those in low-income social groups).

            Full marks could be achieved by three factors with development example or rationale
            provided, or six factors identified. Do not expect explicit separation of social and
            cultural factors.

(c)   “Physical factors influence the location of tourist activities more than
      human factors.” Discuss this statement, with reference to examples.                       [10]

      Physical factors include climate, relief and landscape, flora and fauna, oceans, lakes
      and rivers. These give rise to a wide variety of tourist activities such as beach
      holidays, climbing, skiing, bird watching, diving, sailing, surfing, fishing and so on.
      However, physical factors alone can never be sufficient to generate a tourism
      industry, as tourists require transport, accommodation and catering.

      Human factors include transport (accessibility), culture, heritage, food and drink,
      political, entertainment, family, economic (affordability), and the provision of
      secondary tourist resources (hotels, airports, catering). They also include factors
      relating to the tourists themselves (age, gender, wealth, culture).

      Most types of tourism depend on a mix of physical and human factors.
      Coastal resorts (eg, Costa del Sol) depend on sun, sand and sea but also air transport,
      hotels, catering and entertainment.

      Responses that achieve band D are likely to be descriptive accounts, and might only
      consider physical or human factors.

      At band E candidates should either provide some balanced explanation of physical
      and human factors supported by examples, or some explicit evaluation of the
      statement (eg, answer depends on type of tourist activity).

      At band F, expect both (explanation and evaluation).

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme F — The geography of food and health

11.   (a)   Referring to the map, describe the spread (diffusion) of this disease between
            2005 and 2009.                                                                            [4]

            Award [1 mark] for each of the following:
            • starts in a single place
            • starts in Central Africa/East Africa
            • moves in waves, or a sequence
            • first wave ends in two places, second wave in three places, etc
            • disease jumps/leapfrogs over many unaffected places
            • spreads from low to high income places
            • shows a pattern of diffusion by relocation/expansion/recognizes types of diffusion
            • uses map evidence to identify at least three affected places (eg, Australia, USA,
              France/Europe).

      (b)   Suggest three possible reasons why the disease spread to some countries and not
            others.                                                                         [2+2+2]

            Possibilities include movement of tourists/travellers; location of transport links such
            as regular flights; transmission to relatives living in another country; effective
            prevention campaigns in some countries (hence it did not spread there). Accept
            comments about commonality of climate provided they are related to countries or
            regions of broadly similar climate (eg, from Madagascar to Bahamas).
            Also accept: preventative measures, vaccinations, border controls, migration,
            transport, trade.

            Award [1 mark] for each reason, with a further [1 mark] for development or
            exemplification, which should be related to country–country spread.
            For each reason, award only [1 mark] if reference is only made to spread within a
            country.

            For example: disease only spreads to some countries with very regular flights
            [1 mark] eg, Australia and France, as these are rich countries where people fly
            frequently [1 mark]. Or, the disease spreads to countries where many citizens have
            moved abroad [1 mark] as economic migrants may return home at intervals
            [1 mark].

            Credit may be given for reference to a disease other than the one shown on the map.
                                             – 24 –           M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Referring to named areas, examine the reasons why their populations may
      experience food deficiency.                                                                [10]

      A clear understanding of food deficiency is expected in stronger responses. In a
      broad sense, food deficiency refers to an overall lack of available food. This food
      deficiency may result from: physical factors such as climate, droughts, soil
      degradation; human factors such as overcrowding; economic factors such as
      insufficient income to purchase; demographic factors such as rapidly rising
      population; political factors such as reluctance or inability to trade in world markets.

      Food deficiency may also be used to describe situations where the dietary needs of
      (some) people for a healthy life are not met, despite a sufficient quantity of food
      being available (eg, lack of vitamins in the diet). However, it is not necessary to
      include this aspect to be awarded full marks.

      At band D, at least two reasons should be described and related to food deficiency.
      Responses that do not refer to a specific area (whatever the scale) may be credited as
      high as band D.

      At band E there should be either more than two reasons examined/discussed, in more
      detail, with example(s) (eg rapid population growth in LEDCs and climate problems
      such as drought) or an examination that shows the reasons are
      complex/interrelated/do not apply to all parts of the population.

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be awarded according to the markbands.
                                                  – 25 –           M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


12.   (a)   Referring to the graph, describe the global pattern of land available for farming.      [4]

            Award [1 mark] for each valid descriptive statement. Possibilities include:
            • sub-Saharan Africa has the most available farmland
            • in sub-Saharan Africa more than 50% of land is more than six hours from the
              market
            • in Latin America only 25% of land is more than six hours from market
            • East/Southeast Asia has the least
            • almost all the available land is in low-income regions
            • the region with the most available land within 6 hours of markets is Latin America
              and Caribbean
            • the region with the least land within six hours of markets is East/Southeast Asia,
              etc.

            If there is no quantification, maximum [3 marks].

            Very simple listing should be limited to [2 marks].

      (b)   Using examples, explain how trade barriers and/or trade agreements can affect
            the production of food.                                                                 [6]

            Examples may be given of trade barriers/agreements (EU), of food (bananas), or
            both. (There should be at least two examples of trade agreements/barriers, or of food
            such as bananas.)

            Award [1 mark] for each example of a barrier/agreement/country eg, EU/CAP and
            [1 mark] for each basic explanation of how production is affected by a rule eg,
            import tariffs. Award [1 mark] for further development or exemplification eg,
            difficulties created for Kenyan farmers seeking access to EU markets.

            Other barriers/agreement that could be explained include:
            • choice of crops
            • amounts grown (quotas)
            • preferential trade access
            • agreement to use GM crops
            • health hazards/bans
            • set aside
            • fair trade.

            If no actual examples of barriers/agreements given, no more than [4 marks] should
            be awarded.

            Two exemplified ideas, well-explained, can gain [6 marks].

(c)   Contrast the geographic impacts of two named diseases.                                       [10]

      The command term “contrast” requires candidates to give an account of the
      differences between the two diseases (not their similarities).

      The focus should be on the impacts of the diseases, rather than their causes. Impacts
      could be related to contrasting levels of economic development (LEDC versus
      MEDC).

      The impacts will depend on the two diseases chosen. Some imbalance in the
      coverage of the two diseases is acceptable, even when awarding full marks.
      Geographic impacts may be subdivided into demographic, economic, social,
      political, etc, or by scale into local, national, regional, international. Either approach
      is acceptable for full marks, though it is likely that stronger responses will combine
      these approaches in some way.

      The term “impacts” is understood to include measures taken with respect to the
      prevention, treatment, cure (if applicable) and management of the diseases, as well as
      mortality rates, lost working hours, health care costs, etc.

      Responses at band D are likely to be a descriptive account of the impacts of any two
      diseases (do not expect balance).

      At band E expect either a range of impacts of two named diseases
      examined/discussed or some explicit contrast(s) made using concepts such as scale,
      timescale, severity, etc.

      At band F expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

Optional Theme G — Urban environments

13.   (a)   (i)    Define the term urbanization.                                                      [1]

                   Urbanization is the increasing percentage/proportion of a country’s population
                   living in towns and cities. Accept alternative phrasing. Do not accept
                   rural–urban migration.

            (ii)   Describe the changes in the distribution of millionaire cities as shown on
                   the maps.                                                                          [3]

                   Award [1 mark] each for:
                   • there are more millionaire cities in all continents
                   • major growth along coasts
                   • may identify regional clusters, eg, India, Japan
                   • makes a valid north–south contrast
                   • credit other valid points or attempt at quantification, eg, has risen from two
                     to five in Australia, or uses phrasing to show very significant growth/more
                     than doubled.

      (b)   Explain three reasons for the movement of named economic activities within
            urban areas.                                                               [2+2+2]

            Possible economic activities include retail, services, manufacturing, leisure.
            There are many possibilities:
            • land values too high in CBD so shops/offices move to edge of town
            • new attractions of new road/rail links attract a range of businesses
            • business parks established in new areas with good accessibility
            • brownfield site redevelopment for offices/shops may have advantages eg, cost
            • enterprise zones/export processing zones have cost/benefits for light industries.

            Award [1 mark] for each basic reason for movement (advantage should be clear) and
            [1 mark] for further explanation/exemplification. For example, services in Cardiff
            have relocated to the accessible Cardiff Gate business park [1 mark] which has much
            lower costs per square metre than the CBD [1 mark].

            Award a maximum of [4 marks] if no economic activities are named.
                                           – 28 –             M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   Examine the reasons why it is difficult to manage urban areas sustainably.              [10]

      Sustainability should be defined – good answers will acknowledge
      environmental/economic/social dimensions. Candidates may discuss aspects such as
      housing, population growth, pollution, transport, housing and employment.
      Contrasting case studies of sustainable urban management might be used. These
      may be drawn from high-income countries and low-income countries. Examples
      may include Curitiba, the London Olympics, Masdar City. Credit any valid example
      at any urban scale.

      Reasons are likely to include:
      • cost – eg, the cost of developing a new sustainable transport system, housing etc
      • availability of money – this can operate at a household level/city government level
        eg, being able to afford solar panelling
      • political will – corruption may be a problem in some locations /
        vote-catching / NIMBYism (people not wanting new developments such as a
        recycling scheme in their locality (“back-yard”))
      • available technology – some debt-ridden cities may not be able to afford new
        forms of renewable energy, for example
      • rapid population growth and rate of consumption of resources – over-consumption
        of resources as standards of living rise
      • high population densities
      • legislation – introduction of Agenda 21 statements
      • waste output – encouraging people to re-use, recycle, reduce.

      To access band D at least two reasons should be described.

      At band E expect either a greater range or depth of reasons for management
      challenges (may offer contrasting examples) or some explicit examination of what
      sustainable   management        actually   involves,   and      the    challenge
      it brings.

      At band F expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.

14.   (a)   (i)    Identify one group of working people that have been classified as “not
                   formally employed”.                                                               [1]

                   People in the informal sector. Also accept charity work, carers, criminal
                   activity or specified groups of informal workers eg, car windscreen cleaners.

            (ii)   Distinguish between the main employment characteristics for the two
                   areas shown.                                                                      [3]

                   Award [1 mark] for any of the following, up to [3 marks]:
                   • area A has most people in “skilled manual”/category 4
                   • area B has most people in “not formally employed”/category 7
                   • area B has an even spread across groups 3–6 / different types of
                     manual work
                   • area A has a high category 2–3 / lower professional groups
                   • credit other valid significant points, or attempts at quantification.

      (b)   Explain two population movements taking place within large cities.                     [3+3]

            For each population movement, award [1 mark] for the identification of a population
            movement and [2 marks] for reasons explaining why the movement occurs.
            These can be outlined push or pull factors, but do not double-credit “mirrored”
            reasons (eg, less space in inner city, more space out of town).

            A range of answers are possible, for example:
            • the movement of families with children from the inner city to the suburbs
               [1 mark]
            • due to push factors such as pollution from traffic [1 mark]
            • the pull factors such as better education opportunities [1 mark].
                                           – 30 –             M14/3/GEOGR/BP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   “Most large cities suffer from a serious problem of urban poverty for which
      there is no solution.” Discuss this statement.                                        [10]

      There are many problems related to poverty that candidates can use. These include
      deprivation, overcrowding, poor quality housing, crime and inequality.
      Candidates may agree or disagree with the statement. Likely contrasts will be made
      between high-income countries and low-income countries.

      Urban poverty and deprivation can take many forms – unemployment and
      underemployment, poor diet, lack of clean water. Solutions may be very costly, and
      there might not be the political will to invest resources on the most deprived.
      Overcrowding can lead to pressure on resources (water, sanitation) and it may help
      spread disease. Solutions include new housing developments, site and service
      schemes, provision of piped water and improved sanitation.

      Solutions could include informal/shanty towns, new towns, new cities, affordable
      housing, rural development. The fundamental problem is that as long as cities are
      attractive places for people to live and work, they will continue to attract more
      people, thereby making it difficult to solve the problem of poverty.

      Credit answers that argue that urban poverty can be resolved (Curitiba, economic
      growth in China, India pulling people out of poverty).

      At band D, responses are likely to describe either some urban problems or one or
      more possible solutions. Evidence may be generalized or lacking.

      At band E, expect either a greater range of problems and/or solutions to be covered
      or some explicit discussion of the truth of the statement (eg, recognizes the urban
      context determines the severity of the problem and/or the solutions sought).

      At band F, expect both.

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands.
