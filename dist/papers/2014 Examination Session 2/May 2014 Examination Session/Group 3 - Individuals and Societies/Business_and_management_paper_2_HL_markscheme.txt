                                              SECTION A

1.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    debtors                                                                         [2 marks]

                  Debtors are customers that have received goods or services, but have not yet
                  paid for them. Debtors appear as a current / short-term asset on the balance
                  sheet as it is expected that the accounts will be settled within 30 days, or
                  within whatever is the agreed credit period.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

           (ii)   fixed assets.                                                                   [2 marks]

                  Fixed assets are long-term assets owned by a business, last more than 1 year,
                  and are used to produce the products, or services the business sells. Fixed
                  assets are usually made up of premises, land and equipment.


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].
                                             –6–              M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   Explain one advantage and one disadvantage for AH Ltd of working at full
      capacity.                                                                [4 marks]

      It would be expected that if AH Ltd is working at full capacity, then unit costs are
      likely to be at their lowest and the business will be more efficient. Lower costs
      per unit will result in higher profit. Working at full capacity will also ensure the
      possibility to generate more total revenue and possibly needed cash to maintain
      short-term liquidity.

      One disadvantage to work to full capacity is likely to be that with no spare
      capacity, AH Ltd will not be able to take advantage of sudden increases in demand.
      AH Ltd may find that its equipment, the climbing gear, which is integral to its
      operation and success, is worn out and is of a lesser quality, as stated in the
      stimulus and has to be replaced or attended to a lot quicker and more often to
      ensure customer safety. This may impact on costs and brand image.

      Faulty climbing gear while working at full capacity may result in AH Ltd turning
      away customers - a loss of potential income and much needed profit. Employees
      may become stressed.

      Accept any other relevant advantage / disadvantage with an explanation.


      Mark as 2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct advantage / disadvantage for
      AH Ltd working at full capacity identified and [1 mark] for an appropriate
      explanation that directly refers to AH Ltd up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   (i)   Using the information provided from AH Ltd’s accounts, prepare a
            balance sheet for AH Ltd as at 31 March 2014.                    [3 marks]

            N.B. It is expected that the candidates use the IB format.

            For [1 mark], there are two or more errors in calculation. However, the
            candidate must demonstrate some understanding of how to construct a
            balance sheet.

            For [2 marks] there is one error in calculation, or they are inappropriate or
            missing one of the classifications.

            For [3 marks], the balance sheet is clear and accurately presented with
            matching calculations of total net assets and capital employed. There is no
            omission of the heading classifications and any figures.

            N.B. Given that only [3 marks] are awarded for this question, do not
            penalize if only the title is missing.

     Capital Employed                                                8.824

     It is assumed that the accumulated depreciation will be subtracted from
     retained profits as there is no profit and loss account present.

     N.B. Given that the candidates have to rewrite the balance sheet as in the
     previous question, do not give credit for correct format, relevant headings
     and title. Attention should be paid to the adjustment of the figures.

     At the same time do not double penalize for inappropriate format, missing
     title/heading etc.

     Award [1 mark] where there is some indication of an adjustment made, but
     it is not clearly identified. The balance sheet is not correct, but there is
     some attempt to include a change. Only one side of the balance sheet may
     have been adjusted.

     Award [2 marks] where the adjustment for depreciation is included and the
     adjustment in profitability is noted but they are not correct. The balance
     sheet does not balance, but there is an attempt to recognize that two items
     are affected.

     Award [3 marks] where both adjustments have been included and
     incorporated correctly into the new balance sheet. There are no errors.

(d)   Explain one advantage for AH Ltd of using a straight line method of
      depreciation instead of a reducing balance method of depreciation.  [2 marks]

      Using a straight line method is simpler and relatively quicker, especially for
      AH Ltd who has not used any method before, due to unawareness of the need and
      possibly the methods needed to depreciate its assets. The depreciation allowance
      will be identical for the three years = $500 000.

      Choosing the correct and the most realistic percentage for the reducing balance is
      crucial. Perhaps, Jose does not have to worry too much about choosing the
      correct percentage with which to depreciate the assets. Inaccurate choice can lead
      to highly inaccurate book value and depreciation allowance that affects the
      recorded profit.

      Using the straight line method, the depreciation allowance will be lower for the
      first and the second years hence, AH Ltd is likely to show in the early stages of
      operation, higher net book value and higher retained profit perhaps to attract funds.

      Accept any other relevant advantage with an explanation.


      Award [1 mark] for a relevant and correct advantage of AH Ltd for using the
      straight line method of depreciation identified and [1 mark] for how this would
      benefit AH Ltd over using the reducing balance method up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].

      If, however, a candidate explains that one advantage is that the straight line
      method is easy to calculate without further elaboration, award [1 mark].

(e)   Examine two appropriate sources of finance for AH Ltd to fund the
      replacement of the old equipment.                                 [6 marks]

      The current liquidity situation of AH Ltd is worrying with working capital being
      negative. The business is effectively insolvent and funds from the NGO have
      been exhausted.

      Given this context, sources of finance are going to be limited. However, a quick
      look at the balance sheet reveals that AH Ltd’s fixed assets are healthy compared
      to current assets. AH Ltd could sell some of these premises and land / fixed assets
      and lease them back from the purchaser. The buildings are not essential parts of
      the operation of AH Ltd and this would release much needed funds.

      These fixed assets may have to be re-purchased at a higher cost and the business
      loses a valuable source of collateral against future loans.

      Moreover, given the location of the outdoor activity, it might be difficult for
      AH Ltd to find buyers. Also, unless the capital release is successfully used to
      raise additional revenue, the lease payments, monthly, or every 6 months for
      example, may put short-term financial strain on AH Ltd.

A second source could be a longer term loan guaranteed against the current value
of the fixed assets (excluding equipment). However, banks may be wary of
lending to AH Ltd if the funds are principally going to be used only to pay off
debts and replace existing equipment. High interest rate is likely to be charged
which can put further financial constraints on the short-term position of AH Ltd as
short-term liability increases.

AH Ltd can further issue private shares to some friends and family who are
interested in the existence and success of the company. Jose can control the
number of shares so he does not lose control. However, the funds may not be
sufficient if only a small amount of shares are sold, or, Jose may have to give up
some control of the business with possible interference in the decision-making
process. Perhaps this is an expensive and risky source of fund to finance the
equipment.

Given the nature of AH Ltd’s business, it might be possible for the business to
source funds through venture capitalists or social entrepreneurs such as online
micro-finance banks. However, the sums involved may be small and venture
capitalist may exert unwelcome pressure, to force AH Ltd to offer services which
are more profit driven in contrast with the objectives of the NGO.

Similarly, although AH Ltd is a limited company and hence assumes to be profit
focused, its NGO funding suggests more of a social objective. Raising additional
investment from private investors may not sit well with its NGO funder.

Accept the option of hire purchase and/or sponsorship from an equipment
manufacturer provided the answer is balanced.

A subsidy from the government and the use of retained profit are not really
appropriate source of finance given the nature of an NGO and the liquidly crisis
unless the candidate argues these issues in a balanced manner.

Accept inappropriate sources of finance only if a balanced analysis is provided.

A balanced analysis is one that incorporates one relevant argument for and one
relevant argument against each option

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis award up to a maximum
of [3 marks]. For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, with no analysis
award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

2.   (a)   (i)    Define the term unique selling proposition (USP).                                 [2 marks]

                  The unique selling proposition (point) is the attribute, or characteristic that
                  makes a business special and differentiates it from the competition in the
                  minds of customers.


                  Candidates are not expected to word the definition exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the statement above.

                  N.B. It is expected that candidates comment on the differentiation created
                  by the USP.

                  External stakeholders might include the following:

                  • clients – eg the trekkers
                  • suppliers – eg the local guides, yak providers and porters
                  • local entrepreneurs – eg lodge owners, food and drink sellers and
                    equipment hirers
                  • special interest groups – eg save the environment groups, political
                    groups
                  • local community – eg local farmers, herders and villagers
                  • government – eg central and regional
                  • accept any other relevant external stakeholder.


                  Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct external stakeholder identified,
                  up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(b) (i)   Calculate how many clients (trekkers) HT would need to meet its target
          profit figure of $400 000 per year (show all your working).            [3 marks]

          The target profit formula is:
                                      Fixed Cost + Target Profit
          Target Profit Quantity =
                                    Price − Variable cost (per unit)

                    800 000 + 400 000
          And so:                     = 240 trekkers
                      10 000 − 5000

          Accept any other relevant method.

          Award [1 mark] for an incorrect answer but with clear working shown.
          Award [1 mark] for a correct answer and no working.

          Award [2 marks] for the correct answer but some of the working may be
          unclear or missing.

          Award [3 marks] for the correct answer with clear working. The figures are
          identified with relevant classifications / headings.

(ii)   Using the financial information provided, prepare a fully labelled break-
       even chart for HT for 2013.                                                           [6 marks]

                                             fixed cost
  =
  Break even quantity              = 160 trekkers
                                   Price − Variable cost (per unit)




            Do not double penalize candidates.

            Award up to a maximum of [6 marks] for any of the following:
            • [1 mark] for appropriate labelling of both axes.
            • [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled fixed costs curve.
            • [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total revenue curve.
            • [1 mark] for an accurately drawn and labelled total costs curve.
            • [2 mark] for identification of the break-even point with the
            corresponding level of output and total revenue on the diagram.

            $10 000 ×160 = $1600 000 . Candidates can calculate total costs at the
            break-even point. The results should be the same.

            If the candidate produces a table rather than a chart, award [0 marks].

            Award a maximum of [3 marks] if the chart is not neat, not drawn with a
            straight-edge, or is not to scale, but real figures for calculations are used.

(c)   In 2014, the following changes occurred:
      • annual fixed costs increased by 20 %
      • rising fuel costs of flights increased average variable costs by 40 % per trekker.

      The average price charged per trekker remained the same ($10 000) as did the number
      of clients (300).


      (i)   Taking these changes into account, calculate the new break-even
            quantity and margin of safety for HT in 2014 (show all your working). [4 marks]

            The increase in fixed cost (FC) is $160 000.
            The increase in variable cost (VC) is $2000.

                                             Fixed cost                960 000
  =
  Break even quantity              =
                                   Price − Variable cost (per unit) 10 000 − 7000
                                 = 320 trekkers

            Margin of safety = actual (sales) quantity – break-even quantity

                              = 300 – 320 = –20 trekkers

      Mark as 2 + 2.

      Award [1 mark] for the correct answer of the new break-even quantity / margin of
      safety and [1 mark] for working for each calculation, up to a maximum of
      [2 marks].

      N.B. Do not penalize the candidates that showed clear working of the new break-
      even quantity without showing how the new FC and VC is arrived at as long as
      the figures are correct.

      If the new VC and/or FC are/is incorrect, without working, do not allow candidate
      own figure rule (OFR).
                                      – 16 –           M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(ii)   Explain one possible response from HT to the change in the break-even
       quantity and margin of safety calculated in part (i).                 [2 marks]

       Possible responses by HT include:
       • Increase prices – the total revenue curve will increase and HT will reduce
         the break-even point – brand loyalty is very strong so customers are
         likely to be price inelastic.
       • Reduce variable costs, such as shorter itineraries to save on fuel, less
         food, or lower quality food. The reduction in variable cost will reduce
         the total cost linear line and HT will break even at an earlier point.

       Award [1 mark] for the identification of a relevant possible response by HT
       and [1 mark] for the explanation of the response.

       N.B. For full marks, candidates must explain why an increase in price will
       result in an increase in total revenue. An assertion is not sufficient.

       N.B. Changing fixed costs is not possible; candidates should not be
       rewarded for choosing this option as trekking permits are set by the
       government and are outside the control of the trekking business – they are
       fixed.
                                            – 17 –            M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(d)   Examine why changing attitudes to social responsibility might be important
      for HT.                                                                    [6 marks]

      Changing attitudes may be important for HT because it could lead to the following
      benefits:
      • HT may be able to further exploit its USP to reduce the bargaining power of
         consumers and competition. Furthermore, a brand image that is based on being
         socially responsible may enable HT to increase the price, as socially
         responsible customers are likely to be more price inelastic. More clients who
         appreciate HT’s approach will create more repeat clients and enhance brand
         loyalty.
      • Stronger relationships with the local community which might ensure excellent
         local guides, better and possibly cheaper supply of food and so on.
      • Stronger relationships with regional and central governments which might
         increase the bargaining power of HT for obtaining licences/permits possibly at
         a reduce cost in the future.
      • Help motivate all internal stakeholders especially employees. As HT provides
         a service, employee performance is very important and can further add to HT’s
         competitive edge.

      Accept any other relevant factor.

      However,
      • The competitive advantage based on the current USP of being socially
        responsible may be short lived. Any competitor can do the same.
      • Some of the practices used such as sourcing local food, employing only
        experienced staff with social responsibility practices, employing local guides
        may actually increase costs and reduce profits.
      • Attitudes can change further over time, if HT relies on high prices in order to
        remain socially responsible, the demand may fall. Moreover, the niche, or
        segment might not be big enough despite the positive changing attitudes
        toward being socially responsible.
      • There could be the possibility of HT becoming too popular and this may create
        issues with capacity utilization, or even create a negative effect on its USP /
        positioning / branding image to become a mass market operator.

      Accept any other relevant factor.

      Accept any other relevant issue.

           Price skimming is a pricing method where a business charges a high price for a
           highly differentiated, unique and often innovative new good, or service, at the
           early stage of the product life cycle.

           N.B. Do not award marks for a response that refers to premium or prestige pricing.

           Key features of random sampling are:
           • respondents are equally likely to be chosen by the researcher to participate in a
             survey hence, there is no bias in the selection of consumers for a market
             research
           • the outcome of the research is likely to be more accurate
           • the research is simpler, possibly quicker and cheaper.

           Accept any other relevant feature


           Award [1 mark] for each relevant and correct feature of random sampling
           identified up to a maximum of [2 marks].

(c)   Explain the importance of people, process and physical evidence for Turners.         [6 marks]

      For Turners, the people element of the marketing mix is critical, given the
      intangibility and the unique nature of the service. As the hotel is perceived as
      having the highest quality of customer service and the staff / people enabled
      Turners to create a USP. It would appear that until recently, this aspect had
      allowed Turners to differentiate itself away from the competition.

      Process involves the ability of Turners to successfully allow customers to book
      and pay for services offered. Currently, the online booking system is slow and
      unreliable and this will impact on the process element of the mix and impact on
      customer service, which from the point above is also under threat. The interaction
      between the customers and the staff can also be explained as process. It is clear
      from the stimulus that guests judge their experience based on the interaction with
      the staff, hence this element of the marketing mix is also very important.

      Again, given the intangible nature of a service, a high quality hotel with price
      skimming such as Turners will also depend on the physical evidence
      (surroundings) to reinforce its positioning. Untidy leisure facilities and an
      overbooked restaurant will hardly help the positioning/perception of the hotel.
      Importantly, business customers are indicating that the competition is offering
      improved services for no extra charge. Shane will have to address this issue
      quickly.


      Mark as 2+2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for the importance of each P described, award an additional
      [1 mark] for the development of the response and application to Turners up to a
      maximum of [2 marks] for each P.

(d)   Examine the usefulness for Turners of using Handy’s shamrock organization. [6 marks]

      Handy’s shamrock organizational structure could be applied and examined in the
      following way:
      • Core Staff – Shane retains a group of experienced managers as well as
         employees to perform the core important tasks at Turners, to ensure that the
         positioning and traditions of Turners remain intact. The core employees will
         benefit from job security and a career path which is highly motivating. It is
         hoped that the increase in motivation will result in the much needed
         improvement in the quality of the service and should enable Turners to retain
         older customers who may have become frustrated with the declining levels of
         customer service. However, the core employees are likely to be paid a
         relatively higher wage which might mitigate the original reason for the change
         in structure.

      • Part-time / peripheral staff may allow Turners to introduce greater flexible
        working opportunities, allowing Turners to offer additional business services
        24/7 to compete with the newer hotels in the area. Moreover, the flexible
        worker with only a short-term contract without many other benefits and rights
        are definitely cheaper for Turners. Shane will be able to cut costs as well as
        improve the flexibility needed for the cyclical nature of the hotel business.

        However, the lack of job security can severely impact on employee motivation.
        A sense of injustice may arise. The possible lack of motivation may affect the
        quality of the service provided by those employees, which can cause a further
        deterioration of the service quality.

        Culture clashes may occur between the permanent staff and the temporary ones
        who might not be able to grasp the USP and the unique way of operating /
        customer service at Turners with negative consequences on the service
        provided.

      • Contractors / subcontractors could be employed to fix the Internet booking
        issues and any other IT issues in order to catch up with the competition. The
        subcontractors are not part of Turners and they are employed to carry out a
        particular project. Similarly, the training could be subcontracted as well, as
        suggested by Shane.

        As the employees are paid by project, Shane might be able to negotiate a
        reasonable price and save a lot on costs. Even if a high price is paid for the
        expertise, it is only temporary as these employees are not on the payroll of
        Turners. Still, these external employees might not be familiar with the culture
        of Turners.

        The short-term disruption to Turners’ and Shane’s routines in addition to costs
        of re-organizing and monitoring the new working patterns will be considerable.
        Profits at Turners may fall in the short term due to the introduction of the
        shamrock. Job descriptions will need to be redrawn and there will be
        inevitable redundancies of some key established workers. This may impact on
        the goodwill of the business and could have some de-motivating influences on
        the remaining staff.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(e)   Evaluate whether Turners should outsource its staff training programme.                [9 marks]

      Outsourcing Turners’ training programme, which is currently on-the-job, will
      allow Shane Peterson to focus on the key competitive issues, such as marketing/
      strategic planning and the state of its IT provision facing the hotel. Currently,
      Turners is facing increased competition and other changes in the external
      environment that are negatively affecting the established hotel.

      The issues against outsourcing the training programme revolve around finding a
      suitable agency to run the programme that will be able to meet the high standards
      demanded by Shane. Shane should be able to find a reputable company that
      provide an excellent training programme.

      Business customers who have complained about the level of customer service
      may be reassured that by outsourcing the training of future employees Shane is
      serious about providing the latest and possibly most effective level of customer
      service. By communicating with its stakeholders that the training programme will
      better the level of customer service will protect Turners’ current positioning.

      The above can be seen as a very significant argument in favour of this option.

      Moreover, the training provider that Turners outsources to is likely to experience
      economies of scale and hence be cheaper than in-house training. It is said in the
      stimulus that Turners will see a 9 % cut in training costs while improving quality.
      It is evident that the current on-the-job training method is no longer effective.

      The employee might be exposed to new and even higher standards of customer
      service by an outsider to improve on their current deficiencies and further enhance
      future USP.

      However,
      Would Turners wish to risk handing over customer service to a third party. How
      will the quality be monitored? With the number of complaints rising about
      overbooking and the business services, outsourcing the training function may add
      to employee anxiety. What other services will be outsourced in future?

      Moreover, some employees who were trusted with the training may feel demoted,
      or feel that the job enlargement has been taken away from them, with some
      consequences on their motivation that can further deteriorate the quality of
      customer service at the hotel. Perhaps this argument is of less significance as
      there are clear deficiencies with the current training.

      Conclusions/judgment
      It appears as if the arguments for the option of outsourcing are of more
      significance than the arguments against, given the current problem that the hotel is
      facing. Shane needs to take action now, in the short run, to turn the fortunes of
      the hotel around. By reducing costs and improving customer service, some of the
      issues will be addressed, but there is a significant risk of uncertainty and further
      de-motivation given the number of changes Shane is proposing. Clear
      communication around the intentions of the move to outsourcing will be needed.

Despite possible resentment from some employees in the short run, in the long run
the quality of the service will increase and other opportunities can be given to
employees to further develop their skills and interest.

Moreover, the outsourcing of the training programme fits very well with the
structural strategic changes proposed. Shane should outsource.

Accept a different recommendation / evaluation as long it is applicable and
substantiated.

N.B. accept the use of the term subcontracting in the candidate’s response.

Given the command term, a judgment is expected.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two relevant issues for and at least
two relevant issues against.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [3 marks].
For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of
[4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows
balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.

4.   (a)   Define the term public limited company.                                              [2 marks]

           A public limited company (plc) is an incorporated organization in the private
           sector, which is allowed to be quoted / listed on the stock exchange. A plc has a
           widespread of owners all with limited liability.

           N.B. It is expected that the candidate mentions more than just sells shares in the
           stock exchange, see some suggestions above.


           Candidates are not expected to word their definition exactly as above.

           Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

           For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus award [1 mark].

     (b)   Describe the method of growth used by the proposed merger.                           [2 marks]

           The method of growth suggested in the stimulus is external / inorganic growth.
           Such growth comes from outside the business by acquiring a stake in, or
           merging with another firm. (In the stimulus Walgreens has made an offer to
           acquire a 45 % stake in Alliance Boots).


           It is not expected that the candidates cover the benefits or otherwise of such a
           method.

           N.B. If a candidate describes, but does not use the term “external growth” or
           “inorganic”, award [1 mark] for a different description, for example of horizontal
           growth / integration.


           Award [1 mark] for a basic description that conveys partial knowledge and
           understanding.

           Award [2 marks] for a full, clear description that conveys knowledge and
           understanding similar to the answer above.

(c)   Explain the changes to two of Porter’s five forces resulting from the proposed
      merger.                                                                        [6 marks]




      [source: “The Five Competitive Forces that Shape Strategy” by Michael E. Porter, Harvard Business review,
                                                   January 2008]

      It is not expected that the candidate draws the model to answer this question, but a
      short explanation of the essence of the model is expected. Candidates can choose
      any two of the five forces, provided they explain the changes in relevant and
      applicable ways.

      The creation of the world-leading pharmaceutical chain of more than 11 000 stores
      could potentially reduce the bargaining power of the buyer, especially in the UK
      and perhaps in the US. The reason why is the newly formed organization’s ability
      to determine / affect price in the market to a large extent.

      The combined resources and specific knowledge in R&D, distribution and
      retailing might erect barriers to entry to other pharmacies / drug store companies
      hence the ease of entry will become lower. The threat of new entry which is
      relatively low anyway due to significant start-up costs in this industry will be
      further reduced.

      If Alliance Boots’ own brand products are introduced to the US market and are
      well respected by the customers, one may argue that the availability of substitutes
      in the eyes of Walgreens’ customers may reduce by the creation of the USP and
      differentiation.

      The bargaining power of various suppliers may be reduced. The newly formed
      company is likely to purchase a large amount of ingredients and be able to
      negotiate a very good price. The ability to distribute medicine in 11 000 stores
      may allow irresistible opportunities for the suppliers of ingredients. Hence lower
      prices for the new company.

      The integration of the two large organizations will reduce the competitive
      intensity in the market.

      Accept any other relevant explanation with application.

      N.B. Do not penalize candidates that use other terms apart from merger, such as
      acquisition of 45 % of the company.

      Accept different arguments / explanation regarding the competitive nature of the
      industry. For example, competitors may be able to maintain the bargaining
      power of suppliers, buyers, threat of substitutes. One may argue that the ability of
      each company to put its own products in each other stores may actually increase
      the availability of substitutes for consumers.


      Mark as 3 + 3.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying each appropriate change to the relevant force,
      [1 mark] for an appropriate explanation and [1 mark] for a further development of
      this explanation with reference to the organization. Award a maximum of
      [3 marks].

      Award up to a maximum of [2 marks] for each change to the force explained if no
      relevant reference is made to the stimulus material.

(d)   Examine the claim that the merger would result in “increased internal
      economies of scale”.                                                  [6 marks]

      On one hand, one can argue that the merger will indeed result in increased internal
      economies of scale and the average cost per unit of the combined organization
      will fall as scale of production increases. A joint marketing/advertising strategy
      can lead to marketing economies of scale. A jointly implemented promotion
      strategy can significantly reduce costs per unit given the global reach / larger
      number of customers; as well as purchasing economies of scale created due to
      very strong bargaining power of the combined large organization. Together they
      will be able to secure cheaper prices from the suppliers of the medicines, or any
      other product sold in both chains. Moreover, financial economies of scale can be
      created as the bigger organization should be able to secure, if needed, more loans
      in more favourable terms for the planned expansion strategies into China and
      other countries.

      Accept any other type of economies of scale provided each type is relevant and
      applied to the newly formed organization and the specific industry.
                                      – 27 –            M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


However, diseconomies of scale can be created due to the large size of the new
organization.      Managerial diseconomies in particular due to break of
communication and coordination between the various administration offices,
distribution centres etc, located in at least two continents and stores in different
countries, the issue of control which are raised by the opponents.

Motivation of employees may also be reduced due to the fact that they will be
working for a large organization with less direct relationship between
management and employees and with other employees. Inefficiency will
contribute to higher average costs

Some cultural clashes between the American and the British way of running a
business can be created between the managers as well as between the employees
which could cause miscommunication, inefficiency and possibly diseconomies of
scale.

Accept any other relevant and applied argument.


To achieve the top markband candidates must give a balanced analysis of two
relevant internal economies of scale and two relevant internal diseconomies of
scale.

It is expected that the candidates explain, not just assert, how unit costs are
reduced for their chosen types of economies and diseconomies of scale.

A specific classification for internal economies of scale is expected. For
diseconomies of scale, accept relevant issues and examples – specific
categorization might not be given

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum
of [3 marks]. For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a
maximum of [4 marks].

For one relevant internal economy of scale and one relevant internal diseconomy
of scale award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

For a relevant generic/theoretical response with no application at all, award up to
[4 marks].


Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(e)   Discuss whether the proposed merger of Walgreens with Alliance Boots will
      result in the positive outcomes stated (apart from economies of scale).   [9 marks]

      It is expected that the candidates will use the information provided to base their
      applicable response, but then go beyond just the information provided.
      Candidates should not just reproduce some points mentioned in their previous
      answer as there may be a slight overlap, but this should be minimal. It is also
      expected that the candidate looks at the two companies for their
      discussion/evaluation.

      Possible arguments in favour:

      For Walgreens:
      A synergy can be created between the two organizations. There are examples
      provided for the candidates to use. Walgreens can benefit from product
      development due to the R&D as well as the introduction of Alliance Boots, a
      reputable brand in the UK, into the US. One can also judge the move as possible
      related diversification. Alliance Boots can also provide enhanced manufacturing
      capability and improved customer service, for example, the 3 extra Ps – people,
      process and physical evidence which are relevant for retailers.

      Alliance Boots has considerably higher number of ready-made outlets for
      Walgreens to use. This is a quick and relatively cheaper option to expand globally.
      Walgreens can benefit from quick entry to Europe and beyond – market
      development strategy.

      For Alliance Boots:
      It is a friendly merger. There should not be much if any resistance to change / to
      the merger / acquisition as the decision had to be approved by all of the private
      shareholders anyway.

      Alliance Boots can benefit from immediate market development strategy to the US
      market which can enhance future profit. The shareholders of Alliance Boots
      clearly sees many benefits, especially less reliance on the stagnated European
      markets and possible future marketing expansion into other continents with the
      finance provided by Walgreens.

      However, regarding Walgreens:
      Will Walgreens be able to purchase part of Alliance Boots given the 10 % fall in
      its sales? Analysts believe that the friendly merger is not the right strategy for the
      organization. They suggest that Walgreens need to pursue a different strategic
      move.

      With a 45 % stake, Walgreens may not be able to push through any changes not
      acceptable to Alliance Boots.
                                       – 29 –            M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


Why are the shareholders not satisfied? Being a plc, Walgreens’ CEO and its
executives must pay attention to the investors’ opinion. Dissatisfaction may lead
to further sale of shares and a further fall in market value. The new group may be
subject to takeover by a different company, pharmaceutical or retailer. Cultural
clashes or rather misunderstandings between the management and possibly staff in
the UK and the US. Stakeholders are strong, significant and powerful and the
management need to listen to their opinion about this strategic move.

Regarding Alliance Boots:
The organization may lose its brand image / positioning as a reputable British
drug store. A fall in the share price and possibly a further decline in Walgreens
revenue may result in Alliance Boots not being able to pursue its market
development strategy into China and South America. Diseconomies of scale can
occur but it is not expected that the candidate will elaborate on this issue given the
previous question.

Conclusions / evaluation
Candidates can provide any judgment provided it is well supported and hence
substantiated. It is crucial however, that candidates provide substantiated
judgment not just some repetition of previous arguments.

A candidate may judge that one organization is likely to benefit overall and
another candidate may judge otherwise not. The exact nature of judgment is not
really important. What is important is the strengths of the arguments and the
candidates’ ability to incorporate relevant issues, their significance, from which
stakeholders’ point of view and so on. Provided the above is done, credit any
judgment.


N.B. It is not expected that the candidates incorporate all of the above points/issues.

A balanced response is one that covers at least two relevant issues for and at least
two relevant issues against.


For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [3 marks].
For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of
[4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows
balanced analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the
stimulus material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

5.   (a)   Define the following terms:

           (i)    family branding                                                                   [2 marks]

                  Family branding can be formed as part of a marketing strategy that involves
                  selling several related products under one brand name. (Family branding is
                  also known as umbrella branding).


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definitions exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding.

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus material award
                  [1 mark].

           (ii)   contribution to fixed costs.                                                      [2 marks]

                  Contribution to fixed costs refers to the difference between the sales price of
                  one unit of production and the variable costs needed to make that unit of
                  production. The difference between the two is “how much” each sale (per
                  unit) contributes to the payment of fixed costs.

                  If a candidate writes the formula for calculating contribution, but does not
                  define the term, award [1 mark].


                  Candidates are not expected to word their definitions exactly as above.

                  Award [1 mark] for a basic definition that conveys partial knowledge and
                  understanding

                  Award [2 marks] for a full, clear definition that conveys knowledge and
                  understanding similar to the answer above.

                  For only a relevant: example or application to the stimulus material award
                  [1 mark].
                                            – 31 –           M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(b)   With reference to MTC, explain the difference between objectives, strategies
      and tactics.                                                                 [6 marks]

      An objective is where the business wants to be in the future, its goals. Objectives
      can be strategic – long term, tactical – medium term and operational – short term
      and are often SMART. The objective for MTC is to increase revenue.

      A strategy is how the organization MTC is going to get there. A strategy is a
      broad plan of action used by an organization as to how to achieve its aims and
      strategic objectives. It usually involves long-term, overall corporate decisions.

      Accept any strategy mentioned in the stimulus.

      Tactics are concerned with smaller-scale and/or short-term decisions, or actions,
      aimed at reaching more limited and measurable goals. Tactics are set to facilitate
      strategies.

      Accept any tactic mentioned in the stimulus.

      Given the nature of the question, please do not penalize information directly
      quoted from the stimulus material.

      Accept any other relevant explanation.


      Mark as 2+2+2.

      Award [1 mark] for identifying/defining each element and [1 mark] for an
      appropriate explanation with reference to MTC. Award a maximum of [2 marks].
                                             – 32 –           M14/3/BUSMT/HP2/ENG/TZ0/XX/M


(c)   With reference to MTC, examine the dynamic nature of organizations and
      the relative importance of driving and restraining forces.             [6 marks]

      MTC, like any other organization that is facing new challenges, both internally
      and externally, suggests the needs for change. Indeed the Managing Director, Seb
      and the Marketing Director Tina, identified the need to change and to respond to
      the challenges in the external environment. One can therefore say, given the
      stimulus, that MTC is operating in a very dynamic environment.

      Factors for change (driving forces):
      • Increasing competition: if nothing is done, it represents a threat to the business.
      • Falling contribution from restaurant may have impact on profits.
      • Overworked / stressed workforce may reduce quality of service and hence the
        number of members.

      Factors causing resistance to change (restraining forces):
      • The objection of Alex as well as the employees who are already overworked.
        Stressed employees will be unmotivated with further deterioration in service
        quality.
      • Membership is already at saturation point – MTC’s management should be
        worried about the negative impact on the atmosphere of the club. Current
        members might leave if more members are to join as the atmosphere of the
        club and the exclusivity of the service might be eroded.

      Accept any other driving force for change and restraining forces causing
      resistance to change with relevant explanation and application.

      It is expected that the candidates go beyond the regeneration of the stimulus
      material and fully explain each driving and restraining forces.

      Candidates are not expected to draw the Lewin model.


      For one relevant force (either driving or restraining) explained, award up to a
      maximum of [3 marks]. For more than one relevant force with no examination
      (either driving or restraining), award up to a maximum of [4 marks].

      For full marks, a minimum of two well-explained relevant driving forces and two
      well-explained relevant restraining forces are expected.

      N.B. This question asks for examination, hence evaluation / substantiation is not
      required as perhaps the wording of the question might imply when asking for the
      relative importance. Award a maximum of [5 marks] if there is no reference at all
      to the importance of the forces.

      If only the Lewin model is presented as a list with some arrows and possibly
      figures without explanation, award a maximum of [2 marks].

      Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 3.

(d)   Discuss the likely success of Seb’s five-year plan to achieve an increase in
      revenue for MTC.                                                             [9 marks]

      Arguments suggesting that Seb’s five-year plan might be successful:
      • Five years is quite a long time to make changes. The employees, managers and
        possibly members will have time to adjust. The plan could be adapted
        throughout the years if needed. Tina’s tactics look achievable over a long time
        period.
      • Some of the changes are relatively easy to make, eg opening the restaurant to
        the general public, opening a shop. These changes are unlikely to affect
        MTC’s culture and corporate image.
      • Seb seems to be a person with drive. He has Tina on his side. Management
        unity to start with, is likely to result in a smoother implementation of any
        strategic plans. Moreover, collaboration and consultation between the two
        managers is likely to result in: a better understanding of the situation, better
        and possibly more varied strategies and better implementation.
      • With a clear plan, MTC might be able to raise funds more easily from investors
        or financial institutions.

      Arguments against:
      • The competitor, Best Sport, being a MNC with probably better and more funds,
        can easily react to the strategies and tactics used by MTC, especially in terms
        of promotion and price reduction. A price war with a MNC could destroy
        MTC.
      • Employees and the HR Manager are worried about stress level and low wages.
        A lack of motivation can seriously affect the performance of the employees
        who are vitally important in this kind of business / service.
      • How successful will the tactics be?            For example would decreasing
        membership fees increase revenues? Depends on elasticity.
      • How effective is social networking and advertising?
      • Has MTC’s management, researched if there is a market for over 60s and
        young people? The market might not be sufficient.
      • The idea of family branding might not be viable. How effective is the branding?
        Could the brand image be negatively affected if any of the new ventures are a
        failure.
      • Given the fall in contribution and higher break-even point before profit is made,
        will MTC have sufficient funds? Borrowing might result in further financial
        difficulties.
      • Alex’s resistance to change might impact on the implementation of the
        strategies. He is the HR Manager and people/employees hold key roles in
        running a tennis club.

      Accept any other relevant argument with an appropriate discussion.

Conclusions/ judgment:
It appears that the strategies and tactics suggested, despite some acceptable
objection on behalf of the HR Manager, seem achievable and realistic. They are
not extremely drastic, hence likely to be overall successful especially if
implemented incrementally over the designated 5 years. Tactics especially are
easy to change and the overall objectives of MTC do not seem to be objected by
any. The HR Manager is worried about the employees being overworked,
overstressed and underpaid. These issues can be resolved rather easily with
negotiation, recruitment, flexible working etc. Hence the 5 year plan is likely to
be a success albeit perhaps not brave and risky enough.

Accept any other relevant and substantiated conclusion.

Candidates are not expected to include in their response all of the issues above.


A balanced response is one that covers at least two relevant issues for and at least
two relevant issues against.

For one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of [3 marks].
For more than one relevant issue that is one-sided, award up to a maximum of
[4 marks].

Award a maximum of [5 marks] if the answer is of a standard that shows balanced
analysis and understanding throughout the response with reference to the stimulus
material but there is no judgment/conclusion.

Candidates cannot reach the [5–7] markband if they give judgment/conclusions
that are not based on analysis/explanation already given in their answer.

Marks should be allocated according to the markbands on page 4.
