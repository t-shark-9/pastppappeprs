These sources and questions relate to the impact of revelation in the Meccan period, and relations between
the early Muslims and the Christians of Ethiopia.

SOURCE A                 Extract adapted from Layers of Time. A History of Ethiopia by Paul B Henze,
                         London (2000). Paul B Henze is a former American diplomat and historian.

There was an Ethiopian Christian community in Mecca consisting of traders, artisans and soldiers with
whom Muhammad is likely to have had contact. He probably gained a favourable impression of Ethiopians
from knowledge of their opposition to Jews and Persians in South Arabia. As Muhammad developed
his mission, he fell into difficulty with the Quraysh. Some of his followers felt endangered and decided
to flee. He advised them, according to a well-known tradition: “If you were to go to Abyssinia [Ethiopia],
it would be better for you until such time as Allah shall relieve you from your distress, for the king there will
not tolerate injustice and it is a friendly country.” Later, the Prophet is reported to have said: “Leave the
Abyssinians in peace as long as they do not attack you.” No jihad was ever declared against the Aksumite
empire by the early Muslims.


SOURCE B                 Extract adapted from A History of Islamic Societies by Ira M Lapidus,
                         Cambridge (2002). Ira M Lapidus is Emeritus Professor of History at the
                         University of California, Berkeley, US.

As Muhammad’s mission unfolded it became clear that it involved not only the presentation of the Quranic
revelation, but also the social leadership of the community. We have a concrete sign that, as early as the
year 615, Muhammad had become the leader of a community, and that those who believed in his teachings
constituted a group which was set apart from other Meccans. In that year, a group of his followers left
for Abyssinia. For the sake of religion, people were willing to leave their families and clans and take up
life together in a foreign land. The bonds of common belief were stronger than the bonds of blood. In this
way, the new religion threatened to dissolve the old order of society and to create a new one.

SOURCE C               Extract from Muhammad. His life based on the earliest sources by Martin Lings,
                       Cambridge (1983). Martin Lings was a British scholar and convert to Islam who
                       died in 2005.

Not for all of the Muslims had the emigration been a necessity. The families of some had given up trying
to make them give up their new faith. Their presence was a source of strength to the exiles in Abyssinia
[Ethiopia], and among them was Jafar, an eloquent speaker who had been chosen by Muhammad to preside
over the community of exiles. The [Ethiopian] king asked him if he had any revelation from their Prophet.
Jafar recited a passage from surat Maryam, which had been revealed shortly before their departure.
When he heard it, the king and his bishops wept. Then the king turned to two envoys who were there
from the Quraysh and said: “You may go. For, by God, I will not hand them over to you. They will not
be betrayed.”


SOURCE D               Extract from the reported speech of Jafar ibn Abi Talib to the king of Aksum
                       [Ethiopia], reported in The Life of Muhammad by Ibn Ishaq (English translation
                       by Alfred Guillaume; Oxford, 1955). Ibn Ishaq (d. 761) was a biographer and one
                       of the earliest historical sources for the early Islamic period.

O king! We were plunged into the depth of ignorance and barbarism… we knew no law except that of the
strong. Then, Allah raised among us a man, who has called us to the oneness of God, and taught us not to
associate anything with Him. He forbade us the worship of idols; and he commanded us to speak the truth,
avoid evil, offer prayers, give alms, and observe fasting. We have believed in him and have accepted his
teachings. We have allowed what God has allowed, and prohibited what He has prohibited. For this reason,
our people have risen against us and persecuted us in order to make us leave the worship of God and return
to the worship of idols. They have tortured and injured us, so we have come to your country, and hope that
you will protect us from oppression!

Prescribed subject 2                The kingdom of Sicily 1130–1302

Read all the sources carefully and answer all the questions that follow.

These sources and questions relate to King Roger II’s relations with Muslims, and the trial and execution
of Philip of Mahdiyya in 1153.

SOURCE A                Extract adapted from a Latin note on the margin of Romuald of Salerno’s
                        Chronicon, probably dating from the late 12th century. Romuald was the archbishop
                        of Salerno and spent much time at the royal court of William I and William II
                        in Palermo.

King Roger II had a eunuch called Philip who was very dear to him. Because Roger trusted him and found
him to be very capable, he appointed him to be in charge of his entire palace. As time went by, he made him
admiral of his fleet, which he sent to Buna [in North Africa]. He took the town, plundered it and returned
to Sicily in triumph. However, Philip only appeared to be a Christian: in mind and deed he was completely
Muslim. He hated Christians; he very much favoured Muslims. He did not like to enter church and did not
worry about avoiding meat on Fridays or at Lent. He sent his messengers with offerings to a mosque of
Muhammad, and had made himself very agreeable to the priest of that place. When these and others of his
sins reached the king’s ears, Roger accused him of specific crimes in his court. Fearing the justice of the
king, Philip began to ask for his pity and to commit himself in future to being a Christian. Then, the king,
bursting into tears said, “let the laws be upstanding and may they strike the enemy of the faith and bring
terror to the infidels.” Then the counts, nobles and judges pronounced their sentence: “We decree [order]
that Philip is to be burned alive.” By this action, it was clear that King Roger was a most Christian ruler
who, in punishing a crime of faith, did not even spare his servant brought up as one of his own sons, but,
for his own honour and glory, sent him to the fire.


SOURCE B                Extract from Ibn al-Athir’s famous chronicle of Islamic history, al-Kāmil
                        fī’l-ta’rīkh. It dates to the early 13th century, but much of it is based on older
                        sources.

In the year 1153, the fleet of Roger II, king of the Franks in Sicily, set out for the town of Buna [in North
Africa], and in charge of it was his servant Philip of Mahdiyya. They besieged the town, and captured it
during October 1153. However, they were gentle towards the communities of the religious allowing them
to leave with their families and possessions to the countryside. Philip returned to Sicily and Roger arrested
him for his kindness towards the Muslims of Buna. It is said that he, Philip, and all his servants were
Muslims, and that they used to hide this fact. His opponents testified against him that he did not fast and
that he was a Muslim. So, Roger gathered the bishops, counts and knights and they decided that he should
be burned to death. He was burned during Ramadan [from 20 November to 19 December 1153]. This was
the first blow dealt to the Muslims. Roger died shortly afterwards. A blockage of the throat had made him
ill and he was nearly eighty years old. His reign had been for sixty years.

SOURCE C                Extract adapted from The Muslims of medieval Italy by Alex Metcalfe, Edinburgh
                        (2009). Alex Metcalfe is lecturer in medieval history at Lancaster University, UK.

In his dying days, Roger’s political and religious predicament was clear and his royal justice risked exposure
as inconsistent: apostasy [conversion] from Christianity was contrary to the laws of his own kingdom, yet
it was apparently acceptable in his own palaces. Indeed, many of the officials of his administration were
Muslims or converts from Islam, and the king himself was said to have spoken Arabic, like Sicily’s mainly
Muslim population. His sacrifice of Philip served less as an act of religious piety than as a concession to
the Latin nobility, who had successfully anticipated the political shape and direction of the future kingdom.
Unwilling to appear openly rebellious when the great king was still alive, they instead forced his hand in
their own favour at a crucial period in the kingdom’s development by gaining ground at the expense of the
palace officials and servant-officers.


SOURCE D          Extract adapted from The Normans in Sicily by John Julius Norwich, Harmondsworth
                  (1992). John Julius Norwich is a writer of popular academic histories.

The manifest improbability of this account [of Romuald’s], coupled with the fact that it is so
obviously a later addition to the manuscript, justifies our dismissing it as a complete fabrication.
Roger had grown up with Arabs; he spoke their language; he had trusted them, even more than
his fellow Normans, all his life. Many of the highest offices in the central government were
Muslim-staffed. Both the army and the navy relied on Saracen strength. Commercial prosperity was
assured by Arab merchants, treasury and mint were under the control of Arab administrators. Arabic was
an official language of the state. Just as his father, Roger had refrained from playing any active part in
the Crusades. It was inconceivable that he should now publically prosecute his admiral on religious
grounds, opening the way to almost certain confessional strife [religious dispute] from which his kingdom
might never recover.

                 the centre. Each liturgy was designed for a different religious community of the kingdom.
