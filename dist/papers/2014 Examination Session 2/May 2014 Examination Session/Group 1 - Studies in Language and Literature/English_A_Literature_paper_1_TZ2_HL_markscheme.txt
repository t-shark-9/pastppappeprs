These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

      An adequate to good literary commentary will:

       identify the girl’s situation
       consider the differing relationships which emerge between the girl and her father, the girl and
        her mother, and the mother and father
       discuss the girl’s reaction to her new school, and how it is presented
       comment on how the girl’s deafness and its effects are conveyed, through both the lack of
        hearing and her reliance on other senses
       comment on the final two paragraphs.

      A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

       evaluate the way in which the parents’ characters are revealed through their different behaviour
        towards the girl throughout the passage
       more specifically, discuss what is revealed about the girl’s relationship with her mother in the
        opening and closing dialogues
       consider how the language used conveys the opening up of the girl’s perspectives;
        for example, the expansion of the possibilities for communication, changes in her mood,
        enhancing of her happiness
       discuss in more detail the use of sensory imagery and other devices.

2.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

        discuss the situation of the speaker in different periods of his life
        show awareness of the speaker’s attitudes towards his memories
        discuss the effect of some of the imagery
        make some comment on the structure.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

      analyse more fully the nature of the speaker’s response to his three different situations,
       commenting on line 14 and the final lines
      discuss the way contrast is used (for example, between the speaker’s willed and unwilled
       memories and between the old man and the speaker)
      recognize the impact of the sensual imagery (for example, “moist nights”, “muscular water”,
       “muddy seedtime”)
      discuss a variety of other devices and their impact (for example, caesuras, relationship of
       structure to meaning, repetition).
