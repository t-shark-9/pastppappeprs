1.

            There were three of us, and he now made the fourth. We hadn’t expected to add to our tight number:
            cliques and pairings had happened long before, and we were already beginning to imagine our
            escape from school into life. His name was Adrian Finn, a tall, shy boy who initially kept his eyes
            down and his mind to himself. For the first day or two, we took little notice of him: at our school
     5      there was no welcoming ceremony, let alone its opposite, the punitive induction. We just registered
            his presence and waited.
                   The masters were more interested in him than we were. They had to work out his intelligence
            and sense of discipline, calculate how well he’d previously been taught, and if he might prove
            “scholarship material”. On the third morning of that autumn term, we had a history class with
     10     Old Joe Hunt, wryly affable in his three-piece suit, a teacher whose system of control depended on
            maintaining sufficient but not excessive boredom.
                   “Now, you’ll remember that I asked you to do some preliminary reading about the reign of
            Henry VIII.” Colin, Alex and I squinted at one another, hoping that the question wouldn’t be flicked,
            like an angler’s fly, to land on one of our heads. “Who might like to offer a characterisation of that
     15     age?” He drew his own conclusion from our averted eyes. “Well, Marshall, perhaps. How would
            you describe Henry VIII’s reign?”
                   Our relief was greater than our curiosity, because Marshall was a cautious know-nothing who
            lacked the inventiveness of true ignorance. He searched for possible hidden complexities in the
            question before eventually locating a response.
     20            “There was unrest, sir.”
                   An outbreak of barely controlled smirking; Hunt himself almost smiled.
                   “Would you, perhaps, care to elaborate?”
                   Marshall nodded slow assent, thought a little longer, and decided it was no time for caution.
            “I’d say there was great unrest, sir.”
     25            “Finn, then. Are you up in this period?”
                   The new boy was sitting a row ahead and to my left. He had shown no evident reaction to
            Marshall’s idiocies.
                   “Not really, sir, I’m afraid. But there is one line of thought according to which all you can
            truly say of any historical event – even the outbreak of the First World War, for example – is that
     30     ‘something happened’.”
                   “Is there, indeed? Well, that would put me out of a job, wouldn’t it?” After some sycophantic
            laughter, Old Joe Hunt pardoned our holiday idleness and filled us in on the polygamous
            royal butcher.
                   At the next break, I sought out Finn. “I’m Tony Webster.” He looked at me warily.
     35     “Great line to Hunt.” He seemed not to know what I was referring to. “About something happening.”
                   “Oh. Yes. I was rather disappointed he didn’t take it up.”
                   That wasn’t what he was supposed to say.
                   Another detail I remember: the three of us, as a symbol of our bond, used to wear our watches
            with the face on the inside of the wrist. It was an affectation, of course, but perhaps something more.
     40     It made time feel like a personal, even a secret, thing. We expected Adrian to note the gesture, and
            follow suit; but he didn’t.

                                                                   Julian Barnes, The Sense of an Ending (2012)

                                                   Moon

                              Last night, when the moon
                              slipped into my attic room
                              as an oblong of light,
                              I sensed she’d come to commiserate.

                          5   It was August. She traveled
                              with a small valise
                              of darkness, and the first few stars
                              returning to the northern sky,

                              and my room, it seemed,
                        10    had missed her. She pretended
                              an interest in the bookcase
                              while other objects

                              stirred, as in a rock pool,
                              with unexpected life:
                        15    strings of beads in their green bowl gleamed,
                              the paper-crowded desk;

                              the books, too, appeared inclined
                              to open and confess.
                              Being sure the moon
                        20    harbored some intention,

                              I waited; watched for an age
                              her cool gaze shift
                              first toward a flower sketch
                              pinned on the far wall

                        25    then glide down to recline
                              along the pinewood floor,
                              before I’d had enough. Moon,
                              I said, We’re both scarred now.

                              Are they quite beyond you,
                        30    the simple words of love? Say them.
                              You are not my mother;
                              with my mother, I waited unto death.

                                                                     Kathleen Jamie, The Overhaul (2012)

      (a)   Comment on the links between the mother, the moon and the speaker.

      (b)   Discuss the use of imagery and its contribution to the meaning of the poem.
