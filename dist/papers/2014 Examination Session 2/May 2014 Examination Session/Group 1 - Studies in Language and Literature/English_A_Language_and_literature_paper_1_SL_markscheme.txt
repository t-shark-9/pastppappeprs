Text 1

The text is an interview in the “celebrities” section of OK! Magazine with the winner of a Big Brother
“reality” TV game show in Australia.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• give examples of some of the features of the interviewee’s speech such as the use of exclamation,
  hyperbole and cliché, the way verb phrases replace adjectival ones (“I was like …”, “I thought …”)
• recognize the role the interviewer’s questions play in presenting Ben and give some examples
• identify the sensational style of the journalism and the kind of audience it is likely to appeal to
• make comments on the attitudes, values or assumptions that appear to be important to the participants
  such as the excitement and tension of the show’s climax, the reflected glory of meeting celebrities, or
  the notion that the winner’s life has been changed for the better.


A good to very good analysis will also:

• analyse more fully the stereotypical features of the interviewee’s responses, showing awareness of the
  triviality or silliness of some of his remarks (such as, “I literally felt like my head was going to
  explode”, “I hyperventilated!”, “Stacey gave me this Humpty Dumpty set”)
• explore more fully the style of the extract including the directional role of the interviewer
• comment more extensively on the attitudes and values expressed or the assumptions that are being
  made
• comment on the naivety of the interviewee and the ways in which he and others have been
  manipulated by the media machine, perhaps reflecting on the ways in which Ben is representative of
  the aspirations of many.

Text 2

The text is part of a lecture given by William Morris to an artisans’ guild in 1877 about how the
decorative arts can improve the lives of ordinary people.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• recognize that the speaker is trying to convince an audience likely to be sympathetic to the notion of
  improving the lives of ordinary people
• make some observations about the wider context in which the speech was made, such as the
  consequences of the industrial revolution or the democratization of society
• comment on aspects of the text’s structure and its stylistic features, particularly the use of
  personification of art and science, and the speaker’s rhetorical strategies in persuading the audience
• comment on how the use of diction and imagery reflect Morris’s time and resonate with the modern
  reader.


A good to very good analysis will also:

• show a deeper understanding of Morris’s view of the role of art in people’s lives
• show an awareness that Morris’s ideas and ethics may well have seemed radical at the time
• show further relevant knowledge of context
• analyse more fully the stylistic features of the speech and its tone as well as the way in which the
  speaker has structured his argument
• offer a concluding comment about the possible relevance of the text to today’s world.
