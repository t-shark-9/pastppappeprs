Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you have
studied and compare and contrast these works in response to the question. Answers which are not based
on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score high marks.

Drama

1.    Drama often generates levels of meaning that are not directly stated (sometimes called sub-text).
      Explore some examples of the presence of sub-text and its dramatic importance in at least two of the
      plays you have studied.


2.    Some plays use an identified narrator or chorus, while others force us to make unfiltered meaning of
      events. How has the presence or absence of such a commentator helped or hindered you in finding
      meaning in at least two of the plays you have studied?


3.    In what ways and to what ends have at least two of the plays you have studied made use of either
      compressed or expanded time frames?



Poetry

4.    “Poetry is language that always means more.” Referring closely to at least two poets in your study,
      explore the creation and effectiveness of multiple levels of meaning.


5.    With reference to at least two poets you have studied, discuss why lines of poetry end where they do
      and consider the importance of these choices to the poets’ overall purposes.


6.    Poets address a vast range of subject matter. Discuss the means and techniques by which at least two
      poets have distilled something focused and personal from a broad and/or impersonal topic, such as
      love, knowledge, work, nature and so on.



Prose: novel and short story

7.    Using at least two works you have studied, show how and to what extent authors have created
      interesting characters whose thoughts remain hidden.


8.    Discuss the importance of the journey as an organizing structure in at least two works you
      have studied.


9.    Discuss the means by which authors endeavour to control our sympathy in at least two works you
      have studied.

Prose other than fiction

10.   Discuss the techniques with which the authors of at least two works you have studied establish a clear
      picture of unfamiliar settings and/or experiences in their works?


11.   “Reading non-fiction has the effect of interesting us in the author as much as in the subject matter.”
      Referring closely to the stylistic and/or narrative features of at least two works you have studied,
      discuss the extent to which you agree with this statement.


12.   “Prose non-fiction often has a pointed purpose.” How and to what extent is a purpose made clear in
      at least two works you have studied?
