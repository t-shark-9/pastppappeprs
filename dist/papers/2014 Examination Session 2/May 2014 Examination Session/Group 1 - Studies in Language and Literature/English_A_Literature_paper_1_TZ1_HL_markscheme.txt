These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to
the published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive
and fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or
angles not offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers
which do not include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

      understand the general context of the narrator’s family relationships and situations
      show an awareness of Mona’s developing maturity and/or independence
      discuss structural features such as repetition, short paragraphs, long sentences etc.
      consider some of the images and figures of speech eg the bed “standing in the middle of
       the front lawn like a cow.”
      comment on the focus upon numbers and math in the passage
      show an awareness of how unconventional a person the narrator is.


     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

      discuss the workings and functions of the humour in the passage whilst seeing some of the
       darkness of the piece
      see significance in the insistent reference to numbers by the narrator
      engage persuasively with the idea of “knocking on wood”
      notice the distinctive treatment of the father and his sickness
      have more to say about the personality of the narrator and her “protecting” of “the world”.
                                                –4–           M14/1/AXENG/HP1/ENG/TZ1/XX/M


2.
     An adequate to good literary commentary will:

        show awareness of the context and actions of passengers on a busy ferry
        offer some suggestion as to the significance of the activity of watching in the poem
        consider some of the effects of imagery (“Stared like a saint”, “domed like satyrs”, etc.)
        recognize the fact that the dolphins are not actually seen
        recognize the stanzaic structure of the poem and detect some of its possible effects
        offer some suggestion about the significance of the final lines/stanza of the poem.

     A very good to excellent literary commentary may also:

      recognize the “spirituality” of the poem, possibly in terms of the “wanted epiphany” of
       which it speaks, or its use of religious or mythological images (Christian, Ancient Greek
       etc.)
      consider the part played by an imagined appearance of the dolphins
      discuss in greater depth the significance of dolphins not being seen
      offer a persuasive reading of the final stanza.
