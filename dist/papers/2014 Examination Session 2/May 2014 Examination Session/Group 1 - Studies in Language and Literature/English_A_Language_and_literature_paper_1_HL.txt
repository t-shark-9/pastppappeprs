                                I watched him as he entered
                                watched how he sat there
                                hands deep in pockets
                                face clenched in total black defiance
                            5   eyes moving now from nothing
                                to rove in angry unconcern
                                watched how the lips relaxed
                                just barely
                                when his eyes passed my face

                                wondered if to recognise perhaps
                                with cautious smile
                                moved again
                          15    with the easy coldness
                                born of lifelong practice
                                born of practical experience

                                but face not quite so clenched now
                                for silently he had recognised
                          20    another passenger whose averted eyes
                                could not possibly mean
                                offence at errant2 blackness

                                and as I recognised and shared his pain
                                my mind wandered
                          25    to his history
                                to our struggles
                                to our beauty
                                to our pain

                          30    I wondered
                                wondered so hard that when I looked up

            Are You Trying to Rob Your Kids?
            Posted by Fatherhood Admin on Thu, April 21, 2011 @ 7.25 AM



     5      Since I worked in banking, I often use financial lingo when I am discussing
            fatherhood principles. For example, I talk about how important it is to “invest” in your
            child’s life and how critical it is for dads to make regular, substantial, and consistent
            “deposits” in their children’s relationship “bank accounts.” Frankly, if you have not made
            these deposits, the conversation could go something like this…

   10       (Scene – You rush into the lobby of the ‘First National Bank of Your 15-year-old
            Daughter’s Heart’ and quickly approach her window.)

            Your Daughter: Good afternoon. How may I help you?
            You: Hi. I need to make a big withdrawal fast!
            Your Daughter: Ok, Sir. No problem. Could you please let me see some ID?
   15       You: Sure.
            (You hand her a copy of her birth certificate where you are listed as “Father.”)
            Your Daughter: Everything looks in order, Dad. Please wait just a minute while I check
            your account.
            You: Is there a problem?
   20       Your Daughter: Yes, sort of. I clearly see that you opened an account here a long time ago,
            but it doesn’t appear to have a sufficient balance for you to make a withdrawal. When was
            the last time that you made a deposit?
            You: Well, I don’t remember. I guess it’s been a while. You know, I have been very busy
            working and stuff like that. But, my wife has been making lots of deposits. Seems like
   25       every time I turn round she is heading here. Since we are married, can’t I just make a
            withdrawal from her account?
            Your Daughter: Dad, no you can’t because we don’t offer joint accounts here.
            You: Oh yeah … That’s right … I remember hearing that. What about a loan? Can I get
            one of those?
   30       Your Daughter: I’m sorry … We don’t offer loans either. You can only withdraw what you
            have deposited.

            (You start to get a bit upset …)
            You: Well that just doesn’t seem fair! I clearly have an account. And, well, I need to make
            a withdrawal. Can’t you make an exception? After all, I am DAD.
    35      Your Daughter: Dad. I am sorry. I just can’t help you…
            (You are becoming more upset …)
            You: Well, doggone* it, I am not going to take no for an answer.
            (Your daughter gets a concerned and stern look on her face and you can see her reaching
            under the counter to push the button for security.)
    40      Your Daughter: As I said, I can’t help you. You knew the rules when you opened
            the account. How can you expect to withdraw funds that you didn’t deposit? That’s just
            not the way it works here. All you had to do was to make consistent deposits. Even small
            ones would have been fine because “interest” – your interest – would have compounded
            these deposits substantially over time. Taking deposits that don’t belong to you is,
    45      well, robbery. So I need to ask you to leave now. Or, do I need to call security?
