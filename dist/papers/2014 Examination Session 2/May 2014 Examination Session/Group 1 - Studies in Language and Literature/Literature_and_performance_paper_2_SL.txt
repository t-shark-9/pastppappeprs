Answer one question. Refer closely to the works of at least two poets you have studied.

1.    Attentive readers discover much about a poem’s meaning though its tone, ie the attitude a poet takes
      to the subject or audience of a poem. In the tone, the emotional attitude a poet takes to a subject,
      attentive readers hear many clues about the intended meaning. In the work of at least two poets you
      have studied, discuss how they have used tone to shape your understanding of and response to poems.


2.    The passage of time and its significance can be handled in many ways in poetry. Consider the ways
      in which at least two poets have included aspects of time in their poetry through their effective use
      of stylistic techniques.


3.    Resistance and rebellion at either a personal or a larger, social level, can lead to very interesting poetic
      explorations. By what means and with what effects have at least two poets you have studied included
      such impulses and actions in their poetry?


4.    Colour and sound provide some of the most vivid effects in poetry. How have at least two poets that
      you have studied used such visual and auditory aspects as these to enrich their poems?


5.    Patterns, aimed at the mind, the heart or the ear of the reader, are used by poets to achieve
      their purposes. In the work of at least two poets you have studied, examine various patterns and
      their effects.


6.    While some poems focus exclusively on a personal or private experience, others reflect on the place
      of the individual in the larger human community. In the work of at least two poets, explore the ways
      in which poems have conveyed the poet’s sense of the world beyond the private sphere.
