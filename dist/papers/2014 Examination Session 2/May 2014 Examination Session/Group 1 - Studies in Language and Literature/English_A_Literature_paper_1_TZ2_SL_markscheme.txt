These notes to examiners are intended only as guidelines to assist marking and as a supplement to the
published external assessment criteria for written paper 1. They are not offered as an exhaustive and
fixed set of responses or approaches to which all answers must rigidly adhere. Good ideas or angles not
offered here should be acknowledged and rewarded as appropriate. Similarly, answers which do not
include all the ideas or approaches suggested here may still be very good answers.

Of course, some of the points listed below will appear in weaker papers, but are unlikely to
be developed.

1.

      An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

      • describe the basic situation of the classroom, including the qualities of some of the different
        characters
      • identify and comment on some of the devices used in portraying the characters
      • comment on the narrative perspective.

      A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

      • analyse the situation of the classroom in greater detail, to include the nature of the relationship
        of old Joe Hunt and the students
      • comment in greater detail on the devices used in characterization, linking specific implied
        character traits to particular details
      • develop the discussion of narrative voice to show, among other things, the individuality
        of Finn
      • discuss the role of humour and its contribution to tone in the passage.

2.

      An adequate to good guided literary analysis will:

      • discuss some of the links between the moon, the mother and the speaker
      • show some awareness of the moon as a visitor
      • comment on the use of imagery and how it contributes to the meaning.

      A very good to excellent guided literary analysis may also:

      • pay particular attention to the italicized lines, analyzing in detail how the speaker relates to
        both the moon and her mother
      • discuss in greater detail the ways in which the imagery relating to the moon and the room
        conveys meaning
      • comment on the structure and change of tone in the poem
      • discuss the atmosphere and how it is created
      • make some comment on the last two lines, which can be interpreted in different ways:
        candidates should be rewarded for the quality and consistency of their argument.
