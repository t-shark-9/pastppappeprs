Maximum marks will be given for correct answers. Where an answer is incorrect, some marks may be
given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. Write your answers in the answer
boxes provided. Solutions found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working,
for example, if graphs are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer.

5.   In this question give all answers correct to two decimal places.

     Dumisani has received a scholarship of 5000 US dollars (USD) to study in Singapore.
     He has to travel from South Africa and must change USD for his air fare of 6600 South African
     rand (ZAR).

     The exchange rate is 1 USD = 8.2421 ZAR .

     (a)   Calculate the number of USD that Dumisani must change to pay for his air fare.                              [2]

     On arrival in Singapore, Dumisani changes 3000 USD to Singapore dollars (SGD) to pay for
     his school fees.  There is a 2.8 % commission charged on the exchange.

     (b)   Calculate the value, in USD, of the commission that Dumisani has to pay.                                    [2]

     The exchange rate is 1 USD = 1.29903 SGD .

     (c)   Calculate the number of SGD Dumisani receives.                                                              [2]

14.   Two propositions are defined as follows:

                    p : Quadrilateral ABCD has two diagonals that are equal in length.
                    q : Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.

      (a)   Express the following in symbolic form.

                       “A rectangle always has two diagonals that are equal in length.”                                      [2]

      (b)   Write down in symbolic form the converse of the statement in (a).                                                [1]

            equivalent.                                                                                                      [2]
