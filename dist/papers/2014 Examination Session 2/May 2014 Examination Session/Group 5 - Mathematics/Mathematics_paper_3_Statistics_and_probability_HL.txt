Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

      The following table gives the average yield of olives per tree, in kg, and the rainfall, in cm,
      for nine separate regions of Greece. You may assume that these data are a random sample from
      a bivariate normal distribution, with correlation coefficient ρ .

      A scientist wishes to use these data to determine whether there is a positive correlation
      between rainfall and yield.

      (a)   State suitable hypotheses.                                                                   [2]

      (f)   Determine the angle between the regression line of y on x and that of x on y . Give your
            answer to the nearest degree.                                                                [6]
