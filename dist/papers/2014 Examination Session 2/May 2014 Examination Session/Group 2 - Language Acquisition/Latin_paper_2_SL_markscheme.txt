General notes:
• The following paragraphs are to be considered suggestions, rather than prescriptions, that is, all points
  made by candidates to be marked on their merits.
• Any attempt to answer should be acknowledged as such; that should be followed especially in
  translation, when some candidates depart from literal in favour of a more poetic rendition, faithful,
  of course, to the original idea.
• The second use of the same figure of speech to answer a style question should be penalized, by not
  being taken into account: for example, double mention of alliteration.

            of the body (like hands and feet); according to the Greeks, perception is not located in a
            specific part of the body; but is a sort of vital habit; we can have pleasure from one part of the
            body and pain from another; the mind like the body can get sick; just as the body feels pain or
            pleasure or anxiety, so does the mind; while the body sleeps there can still be something
            awake.

            (tense, number, etc); [2 marks] for answers with two or three minor errors or one major error;
