         Monitoring volunteers needed!
         Our extensive research and monitoring
         programme in the Peak District and South
         Pennine moorlands is an essential part
         of the work we do and we welcome the
         assistance of volunteers.

         We are currently looking for reliable and
         committed volunteers who can assist with
         our monitoring of the amount of water in
         the soil of restoration sites. High water
         levels in the peat* are a key feature of bogs and are vital to protect this globally important
         habitat. Healthy peat bogs with good vegetation cover can be important in managing flood
         risk in the valleys below.

         Volunteers should be available on a day each week, with the option of either working on
         Black Hill on Mondays, or Kinder Scout on Wednesdays.

         These monitoring opportunities offer volunteers the chance to learn more about the
         moorland and peat of the Peak District National Park and South Pennines and the benefits they
         bring to people and place. Volunteers will acquire new skills and learn about our restoration
         and conservation work.

         General Requirements for Field Volunteers
         This work takes place in the Peak District National Park, north of Edale, and in the
         South Pennines around Rochdale. Many of our sites are remote and so a reasonable level
         of fitness is required. Volunteers should have clothing appropriate for working outdoors and
         should expect to do full days out in the field. Please also note that there is no mobile phone
         reception at our sites.

         Own transport is essential for most projects – the Research Team will repay reasonable
         travel expenses.

         For more information please contact the Research Team on 01629 813 579.

         To apply, please complete a registration form and email to moors@peakdistrict.gov.uk.

         Video Conferencing and Learning
         Have you taken origami* lessons from a teacher
         in Japan? Have you visited Cape Canaveral for the
         launch of a space shuttle? It might surprise you that
         there are primary school students in Australia who
  5      have done these things and more.

         Video conferencing is changing the way that students
         and teachers interact with each other and with their
         global community.

         With the power of video conferencing, the world
10       becomes your classroom.        The ways to enrich
         the curriculum and achieve learning outcomes become
         endless.

         Video conferencing opens the door so as to
         incorporate technology into the classroom through
15       blended learning. Not only that, but:
         • Students can collaborate with each other, with their teachers, and with their peers – wherever
             they are in the world. One junior class in Melbourne has begun a modern pen-pal system
             and they “meet” and chat with students in a class in rural Alice Springs. The former are now
             setting up a similar connection with children in a school in Seoul, Korea.
20       • Schools in remote areas can virtually “visit” a museum, just as students who are studying
             geography can “visit” the country they are learning about.
         • Art, computer technology, drama, health, mathematics, science and social studies through
             virtual ﬁeld trips and video resources – all can take great advantage of video conferencing.

         By using this facility for individual or group conferencing to discuss topics or work through issues,
25       students and teachers can share ideas and expand their horizons.

                                                                                              Text used with permission.

       Zambian artists use a rhino
       statue to raise awareness




       In front of Lusaka’s largest shopping centre, Bayou’s, there is a huge rhino sculpture
       made of steel and wire and stuffed with plastic rubbish. Our reporter Pascally Musonga
       went to interview the two artists who created this rhino, Alexis Phiri and Almakyo Banda.
       Both young men have enormous talent and enthusiasm.

 5     Pascally: What made you decide to create this statue?

       Alexis:   There are two reasons. The first is that I believe that art is one of the
                 most effective ways to communicate to people the importance of saving
                 Zambia’s wildlife. Secondly, plastics are a problem, they are killing us.

       Pascally: [ – X – ]

10     Almakyo: The main object of this project is to help in sensitising the public of the need
                to stop slaughtering and poaching Africa’s wildlife. The few rhinos that are
                left in this region are constantly under threat.

       Pascally: [ – 24 – ]

       Alexis:   This is part of this year’s World Rhino Day and we hope to send a loud message
15               to everyone, including the authorities, on how vital it is to preserve this
                 country’s wildlife.

       Pascally: [ – 25 – ]

       Alexis:   The continued slaughter of Africa’s wildlife is robbing our children and
                 grandchildren of their birthright and their national heritage. It is also causing
20               the loss of tourists who come to see our African animals and who bring us a lot
                 of trade.

       Pascally: [ – 26 – ]

       Almakyo: Zambia had a huge population of rhinos in the early 1970s, thousands
                of them. Now poaching and unregulated hunting have nearly made
25              them extinct. The latest government survey shows that only 20 rhinos are left
                in Zambia’s game reserves.

        Pascally: [ – 27 – ]

        Alexis:   Plastic is now becoming the unofficial national flower of Zambia and this is a
                  huge problem. It’s important that we all realise that we need to play a part in
30                protecting our environment.

        They showed me around their studio: all the local residents, including children, are now
        bringing their dry waste to them. Plastic, foil, metal and paper are made use of and
        anyone interested in art is made very welcome at Kachere Art Studio.

        Alexis and Almakyo want all Zambians to become environmental managers and help keep
35      the country clean and be proud of that.

                              Why Bilinguals Are Smarter
            Speaking two languages rather than just one has obvious practical benefits in an
            increasingly globalized world. But in recent years, scientists have begun to show
            that the advantages of bilingualism are even more fundamental than being
            able to converse with a wider range of people. Being bilingual, it turns out,
 5          makes you smarter.

            Bilinguals, for instance, are apparently more
            adept than monolinguals at solving certain
            kinds of mental puzzles. The evidence from
            a number of such studies suggests that the
10          bilingual experience improves the brain’s
            “executive function” – the ability to direct
            the attention processes that we use for
            planning, solving problems and performing
            various other mentally demanding tasks.
15          These processes include ignoring distractions to stay focused, switching attention
            deliberately from one thing to another and holding information in mind.

            The key difference between bilinguals and monolinguals might be a
            heightened ability to monitor the environment. “Bilinguals have to switch
            languages quite often – you may talk to your father in one language and to your
20          mother in another language,” says Albert Costa, a researcher at the University
            of Pompeu Fabra in Spain. “It requires keeping track of changes around you in
            the same way that we monitor our surroundings when driving.” Mr Costa and his
            colleagues found that the bilingual people not only performed better, but they
            also did so with less activity in parts of the brain involved in monitoring, indicating
25          that they were more efficient at it.

            The effects of bilingualism also extend into the later years of life. Tamar Gollan
            of the University of California, San Diego, found that individuals with a higher
            degree of bilingualism were more resistant than others to the onset of
            dementia and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease: the higher the degree
30          of bilingualism, the later the age of onset.
