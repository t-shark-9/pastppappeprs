Please start each question on a new page. Full marks are not necessarily awarded for a correct answer
with no working. Answers must be supported by working and/or explanations. In particular, solutions
found from a graphic display calculator should be supported by suitable working. For example, if graphs
are used to find a solution, you should sketch these as part of your answer. Where an answer is incorrect,
some marks may be given for a correct method, provided this is shown by written working. You are therefore
advised to show all working.

      Let f (n) = n5 − n , n ∈  + .

      (a)   Find the values of f (3) , f (4) and f (5) .                                                  [2]

      (b)   Use the Euclidean algorithm to find

		(i)              gcd ( f (3), f (4) ) ;

		(ii)             gcd ( f (4), f (5) ) .                                                                 [4]

      (c)   Explain why f (n) is always exactly divisible by 5.                                           [1]

      (d)   By factorizing f (n) explain why it is always exactly divisible by 6.                         [4]

2.    [Maximum mark: 10]

      (a)   Use the pigeon-hole principle to prove that for any simple graph that has two or more
            vertices and in which every vertex is connected to at least one other vertex, there must be
            at least two vertices with the same degree.                                                   [4]

      Seventeen people attend a meeting.

      (b)   Each person shakes hands with at least one other person and no-one shakes hands with
            the same person more than once. Use the result from part (a) to show that there must be
            at least two people who shake hands with the same number of people.                           [4]

      (c)   Explain why each person cannot have shaken hands with exactly nine other people.              [2]

      For the remainder of the question you may find the cheapest route between any two towns
      by inspection.

      It is given that the total cost of travelling on all the roads without repeating any is $139.
      A tourist decides to go over all the roads at least once, starting and finishing at town A.

      (b)       Find the lowest possible cost of his journey, stating clearly which roads need to be
                travelled more than once. You must fully justify your answer.                               [6]

      Andy and Roger are playing tennis with the rule that if one of them wins a game when serving
      then he carries on serving, and if he loses then the other player takes over the serve.
