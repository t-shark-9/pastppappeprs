4.   In this question give all answers correct to two decimal places.

     Albena travels to Bulgaria on a business trip. She is paid 3550 Bulgarian levs (BGN) at the end
     of her trip. She converts all her BGN into euros (EUR), at an exchange bureau that sells 1 EUR
     for 1.95 BGN and charges 3 % commission.

     (a)   Calculate the amount that Albena receives in EUR.                                                           [4]

     At the airport shop, Albena buys chocolates that cost 34.50 BGN. She uses 20 EUR to pay for
     the chocolates but receives her change in BGN. The shop’s exchange rate is 1 EUR = 1.90 BGN.

13.   A potato is placed in an oven heated to a temperature of 200 °C .

      The temperature of the potato, in °C , is modelled by the function p=  (t ) 200 − 190(0.97)t ,
      where t is the time, in minutes, that the potato has been in the oven.

      (a)   Write down the temperature of the potato at the moment it is placed in the oven.                              [2]

      (b)   Find the temperature of the potato half an hour after it has been placed in the oven.                         [2]

      After the potato has been in the oven for k minutes, its temperature is 40 °C .

      (c)   Find the value of k .                                                                                         [2]
