 Context should be understood in the widest possible sense. It may include the social and/or
 historical setting of the work or the context of its literary genre; it may include the context of a
 situation within the work or contexts of production and reception of a work.

 In addition to the notes below, responses should be structured with a logical sequence and
 development. Clear, varied and accurate language should be used, as well as appropriate
 register, style and terminology.


1.   An adequate to good answer will single out examples from the works studied showing the
     representation of women and discuss how such representations reflect the historical, social
     and cultural contexts within the works.

     A good to excellent answer may offer more detailed or more nuanced examples of the
     representation of women and explore more fully the historical, social and cultural contexts of
     to the works.


2.   An adequate to good answer will offer some examples of violence in the works studied,
     discuss how the violence is depicted and explore why this is significant to the work.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more detailed and complex understanding of violence
     and its depiction, exploring more closely why violence with its many possible historical,
     social and cultural contextual links is significant to the work.


3.   An adequate to good answer will define and identify “brevity” and/or “change” as the
     candidate perceives and discusses the significance of one or both of these notions in the works
     chosen.

     A good to excellent answer may look more closely at the prompt and consider “brevity”
     and/or “change” with a greater degree of sophistication and may offer a more nuanced
     discussion of, for example, the essence of brevity or the inevitability of things coming to an
     end or changing, and show how such ideas are significant to and represented in the works.


4.   An adequate to good answer will look at choices made by the writers regarding settings
     (in terms of time and place) in the works and discuss how such choices give order to and
     shape meaning within the works.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more cogent analysis of the writers’ choices about
     time and place, discussing persuasively how such choices give a structure to the work and
     help shape ideas.

5.   An adequate to good answer will define either directly or by inference what is meant by
     “goodness” and/or “virtue” and identify and discuss examples from the works that support
     whether or not such values are responsible for the work’s importance. Some awareness of the
     role of the contexts of time and place may be shown.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more nuanced understanding of “goodness” and/or
     “virtue”, developing a persuasive argument for whether or not the “showing the way to
     goodness” is related to the work’s overall importance.


6.   An adequate to good answer will offer examples of symbols in the works studied and discuss
     to what effect those symbols were employed.

     A good to excellent answer may offer a more nuanced discussion of the use of symbols in the
     works, examining, perhaps, how the relationship between the concrete and the abstract was
     shaped by the writer or, perhaps, by the contexts of time, place or genre.
