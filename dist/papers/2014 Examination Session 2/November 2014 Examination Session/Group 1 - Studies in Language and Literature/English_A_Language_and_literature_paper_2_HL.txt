Answer one essay question only. You must base your answer on at least two of the Part 3 works you
have studied. Answers which are not based on a discussion of at least two Part 3 works will not score
high marks. Your answer should address the ways in which language and context contribute to your
reading of each work.

1.    It could be argued that in some societies or cultures women are at a disadvantage to men or even
      actively discriminated against. To what degree is this evident in the way women are represented in
      at least two of the works you have studied?


2.    The depiction of violence in some form (cultural, political, physical, psychological, etc) is a central
      preoccupation of many works of literature. In at least two of the works you have studied discuss
      how violence is depicted and explore its significance.


3.    “Nature is fleeting and life is in a state of flux.” What is the significance of brevity and/or change in
      at least two of the works you have studied?


4.    How do authorial choices regarding setting (time and place) create order and influence meaning in
      at least two of the works you have studied?


5.    In the past it was believed that literature achieved its importance due to its ability to show people the
      way to goodness and virtue. To what extent can this be said of the importance of at least two of the
      works you have studied?


6.    Symbols can help a writer convey ideas, develop characters, establish atmosphere, etc. To what
