This question asks candidates to analyze a humorous article by Tom Purcell, “Genetically
Engineered Children,” found on Daryl Cagle’s The Cagle Post: Cartoons and Commentary at
www.cagle.com.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• consider the intended audience as, perhaps, a rather broad group of readers who are attracted to
  humorous discussions of current issues or even those who are attracted by the cartoon to read the
  article
• consider contextual elements such as time, place, and content
• discuss the presentation of the article (eg, the format of the Cagle Post website, the large
  embedded cartoon, the use of dialogue, the use of question and answer, the use of terminology,
  references to various famous and respected individuals, etc) and what makes it ironic
• consider  some of the stylistic features of the text, such as dialogue, informal language despite the
  professional context and irony. Consider also the relevance of the cartoon to the ideas in the
  article, possibly commenting on the hands of the doctor, the juxtaposition of cell phone and
  umbilical cord, the adult hands and closed eyes of the baby
• discuss the portrayal of the doctor and the parents and how the values of each are revealed: that
  the doctor seems to be promoting a “product” and the parents are concerned with “the meaning
  of life”
• consider the purpose of the article and perhaps the moral or philosophical issues it raises.

A good to excellent analysis may also:

• consider more closely the nature of the audience: their understanding of “genetically engineered”
  as indicated in bold in the title, their recognition of the proper names mentioned, their ability to
  discern the satirical nature of the article, etc, all of which might indicate an informed and
  educated audience
• explore in greater depth the visual and textual presentation of the article and how that
  presentation offers insight into both contextual understanding and the shaping of ideas expressed
  in the text
• explore in greater depth the role of dialogue in the presentation of ideas, looking more closely at
  stylistic features including perhaps the shifts in tone that characterize the speakers or the ideas
  that they put forward
• consider more closely the conflict of values between the doctor and the parents
• offer a closer discussion of the role of humor or irony in this piece and an analysis of how this is
  conveyed both visually in the cartoon and verbally in the dialogue
• explore in greater depth the purpose of this article, perhaps seeing a humorous parody of a
  serious conversation that needs to take place regarding the ramifications of genetic engineering.

Text 2

This question asks candidates to comment on the eulogy for Mahatma Gandhi delivered by
Jawaharlal Nehru on February 2, 1948.

An adequate to good analysis will:

• consider the intended audience as the Constituent Assembly of India
• consider the contextual elements such as time and place
• discuss the content and organization of this speech: the greatness of Gandhi, his suffering and
  sacrifice, the shifts in focus from the past, to the present and the future, and the shifts from
  Gandhi to the audience
• consider some of the techniques used in this speech: direct address, alliteration and consonance,
  the repetition of words and phrases both at the beginnings and endings of clauses, and the larger
  repetition of ideas throughout the speech, the use of metaphor, the choice of words that are
  largely soft and quiet (even “peril” and “desolate” and “forlorn”), emotive shifts in sentence
  structure, the powerful introduction and conclusion, the juxtaposition of “he” and “we” the use
  of pauses as indicated by periods and dashes, and the controlling word “yet”
• give some consideration to the purpose of the text: that this is a time of speaking well of the
  person who has departed, and, in fact, almost deifying him, but, also, that this is a very public
  speech in which the reaction of the audience towards the untimely death of a famous public
  figure must be taken into consideration and strong feelings to some degree allayed.

A good to excellent analysis may also:

• consider the intended audience in much greater depth – that perhaps the speech must not only
  commemorate the dead and appease the members of the Indian Parliament, but leave a lasting
  impression on the rest of the world as well, that this is a speech with a multi-layered and
  complex set of listeners
• consider the contextual elements of time and place with greater awareness and understanding
• explore the presentation of the speech with greater sensitivity and depth, looking at many of the
  elements listed above (and others) with detailed and considered concern for their effects on
  the listener
• explore the rhetorical nature of the speech with a clear and sensitive understanding of the nature
  of the spoken word
• offer a sensitive and detailed analysis of various possible purposes that could be seen to be
  embedded in this speech, seeing not only the allaying of fears of the untimely death of a great
  leader, but anger at the assassin and others of his way of thinking (note the euphemism of
  “hand of a child” to describe the assassin), but also feelings of overwhelming depression and
  despair (“we shiver in the cold and dark”), as well as the fear that Gandhi's ideals might
  fade away.
