The following bands provide a précis of the full markbands for Paper 2 published in the History guide on
pages 71–74. They are intended to assist marking but must be used in conjunction with the full
markbands found in the guide. For the attention of all examiners: if you are uncertain about the
content/accuracy of a candidate’s work please contact your team leader.

    16–20: Answers are clearly structured and focused, have full awareness of the demands of the
           question, and if appropriate may challenge it. Detailed specific knowledge is used as
           evidence to support assertions and arguments. Historical processes such as comparison
           and contrast, placing events in context and evaluating different interpretations are used
           appropriately and effectively.
    13–15: Answers are clearly focused on the demands of the question. Specific knowledge is
           applied as evidence, and analysis or critical commentary are used appropriately to
           produce a specific argument. Events are placed in context and there is sound
           understanding of historical processes and comparison and contrast. Evaluation of
           different approaches may be used to substantiate arguments presented.
    10–12: Answers indicate that the question is understood but not all implications are considered.
           Knowledge is largely accurate. Critical commentary may be present. Events are
           generally placed in context and understanding of historical processes, such as comparison
           and contrast are present. There may be awareness of different approaches and
           interpretations but they are not based on relevant historical knowledge. There is a clear
           attempt at a structured approach.
    8–9:   The demands of the question are generally understood. Historical knowledge is present
           but is not fully or accurately detailed. Knowledge is narrative or descriptive in nature.
           There may be limited argument that requires further substantiation. Critical commentary
           may be present. There is an attempt to place events in historical context and show an
           understanding of historical processes. An attempt at a structured approach, either
           chronological or thematic has been made.
    6–7:   Answers indicate some understanding of the question but historical knowledge is limited
           in quality and quantity. Historical context may be present as will understanding of
           historical processes but underdeveloped. The question is only partially addressed.
    4–5:   There is little understanding of the question. Historical details are present but are mainly
           inaccurate and/or of marginal relevance. Historical context or processes are barely
           understood and there is minimal focus on the task.
    1–3:   Answers do not meet the demands of the question and show little or no evidence of
           appropriate structure. There are no more than vague, unsupported assertions.
    0:     Answers not meeting the requirements of descriptors should be awarded no marks.

  Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the “best fit”
  to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so. If an answer
  indicates that the demands of the question are understood and addressed but that not all implications
  are considered (eg, compare or contrast; reasons or significance; methods or success), then
  examiners should not be afraid of using the full range of marks allowed for by the markscheme:
  ie, responses that offer good coverage of some of the criteria should be rewarded accordingly.

Topic 1   Dynasties and rulers

1.   Compare and contrast the methods used by two medieval European rulers to obtain and
     consolidate their power.

     Candidates should select two rulers. The focus of the response should be on the methods used by
     the rulers to obtain and legitimize or consolidate power. Narratives of the life of the chosen rulers
     will not score well.

     The methods used to acquire power may include but not be limited to: military conquest or
     invasion; the defeat of internal rivals; inheritance; support of powerful groups both secular and
     religious; respect gained as a war leader or statesman.

     The methods used to legitimize/consolidate power may include but not be limited to: alliances with
     powerful individuals or groups; support of religious authorities; elimination/suppression of rivals;
     issuing laws and edicts to reinforce one’s authority; increasing military power to suppress
     opposition; increasing economic power; constructing a loyal bureaucracy to supervise and enforce
     authority; successful wars or conquests to improve image and reputation.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


2.   Examine the methods used, and the degree of success achieved, by William I (1066–1087) in
     his attempt to establish his rule in England by 1071.

     The methods used by William may include but not be limited to: his gaining of papal support for his
     claim to the throne; his victory at Hastings killed his chief rival Harold and his brothers leaving no
     natural leader or rival to oppose him; he gave extensive lands to his supporters and built castles to
     establish his authority; his maintenance of Anglo-Saxon laws. He suppressed revolt through his
     military power and skill, and systematically destroyed all opposition in a severe fashion that
     discouraged future revolts. Examples may include: the Harrying of the North and Hereward the
     Wake; his transfer of more land and power to his Norman followers after 1069; the reduction in the
     wealth and power of Anglo-Saxons; his claim that all land in England belonged to the king and was
     held by nobles in return for feudal service.

     The results may include but not be limited to: the fact that there were no further revolts after 1071
     as rivals were either dead, banished or had submitted to him; he had strong military control over the
     country; he tightened the feudal system to ensure control by and loyalty to the king; he retained the
     Anglo-Saxon laws which gained him support of the population; he was able to control all aspects of
     society including the Church; he established a firm foundation of royal authority which lasted for
     generations; the English monarchy had more control over its lands than other European monarchs.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

3.   Examine the reasons for the overthrow of the Umayyads by the Abbasids.

     The reasons for the Abbasid success are related to the declining power of the Umayyads. The
     reasons for this decline may include but not be limited to: expansion of the empire made governing
     and maintaining unity increasingly difficult; the defeat by the Byzantines marked the end of
     expansion and caused a lack of confidence in the leadership; there was widespread discontent
     amongst non-Arab Muslims who were discriminated against by the dynasty; tribal feuds erupted
     throughout the empire resulting in widespread violence and civil war. The finances of the empire
     were weakened by the decision to allow more converts to Islam – they no longer paid taxes which
     reduced revenues; a renewed dispute about the legitimacy of the Caliph was launched by factions
     who supported the descendants of the fourth caliph, Ali. Other religious opposition was based on
     the criticism that the Umayyads had become corrupt power seekers who were not following the
     precepts of Islam. The merger of many of these opposition groups in the 740s led to an uprising
     under Abu Muslim which defeated the Umayyads and replaced them with the Abbasids.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


4.   “The creation and administration of legal codes were crucial to rulers seeking to expand their
     authority.” With reference to one medieval European or Islamic ruler, to what extent do you
     agree with this statement?

     The ways in which the creation and administration of legal codes were crucial may include but not
     be limited to: the issuing of laws added to the prestige of the ruler; the new law codes allowed him
     to eliminate local practices and limit the power of local authorities who might oppose him; the new
     laws might gain the support of influential groups in society such as religious or urban interests. The
     concept of a powerful central authority would be reinforced. The administration of the laws would
     require the creation of courts and judges, which would enforce the laws throughout the land, replace
     local courts, and collect fines and fees to enrich the ruler. The royal courts with their attendant
     bureaucracy would provide another means of supervision and control of the territory and further
     reinforce royal authority.

     Popular examples may be Charlemagne, Henry II, Abd al-Malik.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

5.   With reference to ‘Abd al-Malik (685–705) or ‘Abd al-Rahman III of Spain (912–961) or
     Frederick I (Barbarossa) (1155–1190), examine his success as a ruler.

     Candidates must produce an analytical response, supported by relevant content, that addresses the
     level of success achieved by the chosen ruler.

     ‘Abd al-Malik (685–705)
     His accomplishments include but are not limited to: great territorial expansion of Islam, the
     suppression of revolts and civil wars including the second fitna; great administrative changes:
     creating a postal service, issuing the first Arabic coinage as a sign of power and influence of the
     Arabs and Islam, and making Arabic the language of the administration. He asserted the power and
     influence of Islam by an enormous building campaign including such important structures as the
     Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which overshadowed the buildings of other faiths. He was
     determined to display not only the power but the pre-eminence and permanence of Islam. This
     building also created the basis of Islamic art and architecture. It forbade figurative art in religious
     buildings which were decorated with verses from the Qur’an. He established the caliphate as an
     effective dynastic state as opposed to a religious one – this caused opposition and criticism from
     those who opposed this apparently worldly attitude.

     ‘Abd al-Rahman III (912–961)
     He was successful in defending his territory by suppressing rebellion, resisting an assault by the
     Fatimid and continuing to attack the Christian kingdoms in Spain.
     He was a major patron of the arts and developed the library at Cordoba to its greatest extent – it
     rivalled any other in the world.
     His reign marked the height of Umayyad power in Spain – his wealth and power were shown in the
     construction of his palace at Madinat al Zahra – one of the most opulent and sophisticated
     constructions in the world.
     His reign was almost entirely successful although his attempts to expand his kingdom met with
     limited success.

     Frederick I (Barbarossa) (1155–1190)
     Frederick’s aims included expanding his royal authority and power in Germany, creating internal
     peace in Germany, and recovering his power and influence over Italy and the Papacy.
     In Germany, he was able to restore his authority by making peace with his rivals and powerful
     nobles. He forbade private wars in order to promote peace and order. He increased his authority by
     gaining firm control of the German Church through the appointment of bishops.
     He was not successful however in maintaining his prohibition on private war and he was not able to
     develop a strong central bureaucracy which could enforce his policies.
     He was absent from Germany for long periods of time and thus was not able to achieve his goals in
     the long term.
     His attempts to recover Italy and control the papacy were unsuccessful and the numerous wars and
     conflicts reduced his strength and weakened his hold on Germany as well.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

6.   Evaluate the reasons for, and the results of, the efforts to limit the power of the nobility by
     either Angevin or Capetian rulers.

     The reasons for either the Angevins or Capetians to seek limits on noble power may include but not
     be limited to: nobles were a threat to royal authority, as they possessed financial, military and legal
     power that could challenge the monarch; some nobles claimed rights to the throne and might
     challenge the ruler for his position; nobles might join together or with rulers from other territories to
     challenge royal authority or replace the ruler; their wars with each other brought disorder and
     disunity to the kingdom; the desire of rulers to expand their authority and influence might be
     frustrated by the power of the nobility.

     The results of the desire to limit noble power by both Capetians and Angevins may include but not
     be limited to monarchs: allying themselves with groups such as the Church and the middle class in
     order to increase their financial power and their authority in the kingdom; developing bureaucracies
     and legal systems to limit noble rights and enforce feudal duties on them; increasing their financial
     power, which allowed them to develop armies to suppress, defeat or eliminate rivals; increasing
     their moral authority and prestige by gaining religious support. Also, urban areas allied with the
     ruler and helped to undermine the power of the nobles whose privileges and power they resented
     and wished to limit.

     It might be noted that this process of limiting noble power was a long term process and was not
     always successful. The nobility in England was able to limit the power of the ruler through Magna
     Carta, the Provisions of Oxford and the establishment of Parliament.

     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

Topic 2   Society and economy

7.   Discuss the reasons for the changing status of European peasants and serfs in the medieval
     period.

     The reasons for the change in the status of the medieval serf/peasant may include but not be limited
     to: the growth of towns and trade, which provided alternative employment and residences for
     serfs/peasants, and which increased their wealth and freed them from feudal bonds. Many,
     however, were dispossessed from the land by the growth of the enclosure movement and the change
     to stock-raising from farming; this made many poor and homeless although towns might have
     provided a refuge. Famines and plagues decreased rural populations and gave the survivors a better
     standard of living, more economic power and an end to feudal obligations in some cases.
     Commercial agriculture brought an end to feudal systems and landholders adopted a more profit-
     oriented approach requiring fewer workers and changing feudal dues to tenancy agreements. The
     growth of central governments and the influx of new ideas in law, religion, etc caused a decline in
     traditional systems, reduced the importance of local lords and put emphasis on modernization and
     efficiency. This further eliminated the traditional feudal system and liberated peasants/serfs from
     the land and the control of the nobles.

     Overall the status of peasants changed but one must note that not always for the better. While
     peasants might be freed from bondage to the land and feudal obligations, they might also lose their
     security and be forced into poverty and destitution.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


8.   Evaluate the impact that improved transportation had on medieval Europe.

     Candidates should address the results of improved transportation and not merely list the various
     methods. The results of improved transportation may include but not be limited to: increased trade
     and growth of urban centres especially seaports; importation of new products from the Middle East
     and Asia; increased volume of trade within Europe, which expanded the merchant class, raised
     standards of living and developed new industries, occupations and towns. Ease of transportation
     aided government administration and the administration of complex organizations such as the
     Church. Improved transportation allowed for the spread and dissemination of knowledge over a
     wider area. It may also have aided in the spread of disease and plague.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

     Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
     “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

9.   Examine the role of the clergy in either medieval Europe or the Islamic world.

     For a full analysis, candidates should examine both the religious and non-religious roles of the
     clergy in their responses.

     The religious role of the clergy might include but not be limited to: the conduct of religious
     services, ceremonies and rites; the maintenance of shrines, organization of religious festivals,
     pilgrimages and celebrations may be addressed. In addition, missionary work was an important
     religious activity. Instructing individuals in the tenets of the faith was also important. The clergy
     also served as inquisitors to detect and eliminate heresy or opponents of Church doctrine or Islamic
     legal codes.

     The non-religious roles of the clergy might include but not be limited to: teaching in church or
     mosque schools that went beyond religious instruction; operating orphanages, hospitals, refuges and
     other charitable activities, maintaining and administering religious property and finances; acting as
     counselors to members of the congregation in both religious and secular matters. In addition, they
     undertook the creation and administration of religious law and courts. Clergy also acted as advisers
     to rulers and served as officials, clerks and scribes in royal administrations. Others were judges,
     administrators of estates and legal experts.

     The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
     responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

10.   “The importance of women in society was nearly always overlooked.” With reference to
      either medieval Europe or the Islamic world, to what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Women played important roles, both economic and non-economic, in the medieval European and
      Islamic world. Their work is often overlooked or minimized in the historical record. Some reasons
      for this may include but not be limited to: the fact that virtually all rulers were male and therefore
      historical accounts are weighted in their favour; power, both feudal and administrative, was
      exercised by men and thus historical accounts contain only accounts of males in these fields;
      women possessed fewer legal rights than men in many societies and were often seen as possessions
      of their families to be used for political or financial gain (women were seen as adjuncts of their
      husbands or fathers not having any real independent role to play in business or society); the
      medieval period was dominated by war where men were the dominant personalities; the chroniclers
      were men, often priests, and often with a low opinion of women: rather like the medieval Church by
      and large. This meant that women’s contributions were not studied, were minimized or not
      understood.

      These factors also applied in the Islamic world in much the same manner with perhaps even tighter
      restrictions on women with respect to property ownership, ability to operate businesses and act as
      rulers.

11.   “The growth of urban centres was the greatest force for social and economic change in
      medieval Europe.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Candidates who wish to support the statement may include but not be limited to the following in
      their responses. Urban centres: undermined the basis of the rural feudal world; they introduced new
      social classes and occupations to challenge the aristocracy for power; they introduced new forms of
      government as an alternative to traditional forms. The citizens of urban areas were not governed by
      the feudal system, and as their power grew, they further undermined the traditional feudal
      relationships of medieval Europe. Urban areas were centres of new ideas, products, business
      models and politics, essentially dynamic regions in contrast to the conservatism of the rural areas.
      Urban centres allied with monarchs to support central government and eliminate the power of the
      traditional aristocracy.

      Their trade and manufacturing supported technological change, introduced and expanded banking
      and transportation, all of which served to change the medieval economy from subsistence to
      commercial agriculture. Urban centres imported and produced a range of products, which not only
      improved wealth and living standards but offered new opportunity to rural populations.

      Those who wish to challenge the statement might argue that: change came from the importation of
      new ideas from the Islamic world; experiences during the Crusades had an impact; that the
      expansion of literacy and knowledge through universities and schools was significant; that the
      monasteries and other church institutions introduced much economic change, alongside
      technological and intellectual developments.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

12.   Examine the reasons for the design of the model Islamic city.

      Islamic cities were centres of religion, education, culture and economic activity.

      They were organized to satisfy these major roles.
      The central focus of the city was the great mosque and the buildings which housed activities related
      to the mosque.
      The other central focus was the market where important commercial transactions would take place.

      The population lived outside the central areas in residential quarters, which would have walls and
      be organized on the basis of religion, tribal or ethnic origin or occupation. These were self-
      contained and had mosques, markets and walls.
      Further from the centre would be found the industrial areas, workshops and industries that were
      noisy, dirty and unpleasant.

      The city was organized on the basis of function, to provide security to its inhabitants and to
      maintain the important values of Islam.

      The government was not housed in the city, with the exception of police forces and market
      supervisors. The rulers had distinct cities devoted to government activities and containing the royal
      palace, garrisons, courts, and administrative offices.
      The rulers lived separately for reasons of security, to express power and to be free of popular
      pressure.

Topic 3    Wars and warfare

13.   “The territorial ambition of rulers was the most important cause of wars in the medieval
      period.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question deals with the various causes of medieval wars. Candidates should select at least two
      wars and determine to what extent territorial ambition was the most important cause of the wars.
      The focus should be on the causes of the wars chosen not the events or outcomes. Popular choices
      will be the Crusades, the Hundred Years War, Wars of the Roses, Anglo-French wars of the 12th
      century, the wars of Charlemagne, the Reconquista and the struggles of the Holy Roman Emperor
      in Germany and Italy. Candidates should present a well-structured response supported by analytical
      content.

      Causes other than territorial ambitions may include but not be limited to: religion; dynastic
      ambitions; personal rivalry or hatred; family quarrels or disputes; a desire to assert or defend one’s
      right and powers as in the case of the papacy versus temporal rulers; desire for recognition and
      fame; control of trade routes or commercial centres.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


14.   Examine the military success of two of the following war leaders: Louis VII (1137–1180);
      Richard I (1189–1199); Edward III (1307–1327); Khalid ibn al-Walid (d.642); Nur al-Din
      (1146–1174); Salah al-Din (Saladin) (1174–1193).

      Candidates must analyse the military career of the chosen leaders, rather than narrative and/or
      descriptive accounts of their lives.

      Candidates should assess the extent to which these leaders were able to achieve their military goals
      or aims. This may involve some discussion of the methods, tactics and strategies employed in an
      attempt to achieve their goals or objectives.

15.   “Good leadership was the most important reason for the Muslims’ defeat of the crusading
      movement.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      This question deals with the reasons for the defeat of the Crusading movement by the Islamic
      world. Candidates must determine to what extent the leadership of the Islamic world as shown in
      such individuals as Salah al-Din, Nur al-Din and Baybars was the most important factor in the
      defeat of the Crusaders.

      The contribution of these leaders was significant in that they unified the Islamic opposition and
      were able to defeat the Crusaders in the Second Crusade and prevent the West from recovering
      Jerusalem in the Third Crusade, recover Islamic territory, raise Islamic morale and end the disunity
      which had weakened Islam at the time of the First Crusade. Baybars and the Mamluks completed
      the defeat of the Crusaders in the 13th century.

      Candidates will have to analyse the importance of leadership in relation to other factors such as the
      divided leadership of the Crusaders and the internal struggles that weakened them, their small
      numbers insufficient to garrison their conquests, the lack of support from Europe and the diversion
      of Crusading resources to internal crusades such as the Albigensian Crusade. The failure of the
      Second and Third Crusades further weakened the movement and reduced support from Europe. In
      addition, the loss of support from the Byzantine Empire and the retreat of the Mongols also
      weakened the Crusading movement.

      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

16.   “English success in the Hundred Years War during the period 1337 to 1396 was the result of
      French errors and weakness.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      The reasons for English success in this part of the Hundred Years War will involve a discussion of
      both English strengths and French weaknesses and/or errors. Candidates should demonstrate an
      awareness of both elements although the response need not be evenly divided between the two.

      The evidence of English strength may include but not be limited to: the military leadership of
      Edward III and the Black Prince was superior to the French leaders; the English army had
      developed new tactics such as use of the longbow and the decision to fight on foot that had been
      learned in wars with Scotland and Wales. These tactics and weapons were superior to those of the
      French. England was also aided by alliances with Flanders, which posed a threat to France in the
      north, and the rulers of Brittany and Normandy who gave support to England.

      The French weaknesses that contributed to the English victory may include but not be limited to:
      internal dissent in France and resentment of the government that caused some provinces to defect to
      the English; French military tactics were very poor in the face of the English resulting in disastrous
      defeats which destroyed their armies and reduced the prestige of the government; the capture of the
      French king John in 1356 further undermined the ability of France to resist or defeat England. The
      internal dissension in France increased with the demands of the Estates-General in 1356, the
      separatist movement of several provinces and the anarchy in the country caused by the constant
      depredations of the Free Companies.

      All of this divided and impoverished France so that organized resistance to the English was weak
      and unsuccessful.

      It might be noted that when France was able to produce a more effective leader in the form of
      Charles V, they achieved some success but this was neither consistent nor long-lasting.

17.   Evaluate the impact of the civil wars (fitna) of 656 to 661 and 683 to 685 on the Islamic world.

      The question refers to the two civil wars or fitna that took place in the 7th century.

      The results of the first fitna: Ali was deposed as caliph and replaced by Mu’awiyah who founded
      the Umayyad dynasty. Discontent over the deposition of Ali led to the formation of the Kharijite
      sect that wanted a purer form of Islam. The deposition of Ali also led to the formation of the Shia
      sect who opposed the Umayyad caliphs – this created permanent division amongst Muslims. The
      centre of the Islamic world moved from Mecca and Medina to Damascus, and this was one of the
      causes of the second fitna as was the continued debate over the succession that resulted from the
      supporters of Ali refusing to accept the caliph as legitimate.

      The second fitna resulted in the death of Ali’s son Husain, this intensified the anger of the Shia and
      further deepened the divisions in the Islamic world. Civil war continued after the death of Husain
      and was not finally ended until 691 when all the rebel groups were crushed. This confirmed the
      power and rule of the Umayyads.

18.   Examine the challenges that faced medieval European rulers in raising and maintaining
      their armies.

      The difficulties experienced by medieval European rulers in raising armies may include but not be
      limited to: powerful vassals may have refused to fulfil their obligations to provide troops and the
      monarchs lacked the power to compel them; many nobles were reluctant to leave their estates
      undefended through fear of attack from rivals; poor transportation and communications meant that
      the process of assembling an army was slow and difficult; monarchs often lacked the money to hire
      troops, collect supplies and equipment necessary for an army; the monarch’s reputation as a military
      leader may have made it difficult to gather support.

      The challenges in maintaining an army may include but not be limited to: difficulty in acquiring
      adequate supplies of food, equipment to maintain the army in camp and on campaign; the feudal
      levy was often only of 40 days duration, after which many nobles and their troops would leave;
      supply systems made it impossible to feed large numbers of troops for any length of time;
      disagreements amongst powerful nobles might lead to a division or break-up of the army;
      campaigns could only be conducted in the summer after which the troops often went home to take
      part in the harvest. Disease was a major problem which decimated armies.

Topic 4    Intellectual, cultural and artistic developments

19.   Examine the origins of the 12th century renaissance in medieval Europe.

      The reasons for the origins of the 12th century renaissance may include but not be limited to: a
      revival of the study of classical disciplines such as law and medicine, which brought new interest in
      ancient texts both in terms of knowledge and methods of reasoning; the influx of new ideas from
      Spain of both classical and Islamic knowledge provoked debates on religious doctrine, logic and
      science; the growth of the number of schools produced intellectual activity that led to the
      emergence of teachers and thinkers like Abelard who sought to question traditional beliefs; the
      introduction of Aristotle and other classical scholars provoked widespread debate on many issues;
      the exposure to new ideas and cultures as a result of the Crusades was influential as was the
      emergence of a wealthy leisure class who had time to engage in thinking and intellectual pursuits.
      New ideas in art and architecture such as Gothic inspired new directions in many cultural areas.

      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.


20.   Discuss the influence of the Christian religion on medieval European cultural activities.

      The influence of the Christian religion on medieval European cultural activities was very
      substantial.

      Medieval cultural activities such as fairs, festivals, processions and pilgrimages were usually
      inspired by religious events such as Easter, Christmas, Lent or individual figures such as saints.
      Saints’ days were often holidays and a time for celebration, games, feasting and drinking that were
      a part of medieval cultural life. The medieval calendar was based on the activities of the Church
      from the Sabbath to saints ‘days to activities related to a specific religious activity such as
      Christmas, Easter etc.

      All festivals and celebrations in the medieval period would include a religious element or activity
      such as a religious-themed procession, mass or pilgrimage.

      There were few cultural activities that were not related to religion as art and architecture and
      literature were dominated by religious themes, supervised, patronized and inspired by the church or
      holy scriptures. Education was dominated by the Church; nearly all writers and literature were
      either churchmen or church-inspired.

      The cultural life of most medieval Europeans was very limited due to poverty and lack of education.
      What culture they were exposed to would have been overwhelmingly dominated or influenced by
      religious institutions and themes

21.   Examine the impact of religion on the intellectual development of either medieval Europe or
      the Islamic world.

      The ways in which cathedrals and mosques contributed to intellectual development may include but
      not be limited to: the fact that they were the creators and supporters of schools and learning centres
      within their buildings; the clergy of these institutions acted as teachers of both religious and non-
      religious subjects; they were the models for other schools founded by governments, private
      individuals or smaller religious centres; their wealth allowed them to fund and support students who
      wished to attend but who lacked resources and their libraries became centres for study and
      scholarship; they attracted great scholars who based themselves in the mosque or cathedral from
      which they were able to instruct other teachers and scholars and thus expand knowledge. The
      respect that individuals had for cathedrals and mosques added to the status of scholarly pursuits and
      education in society. Cathedral schools became the genesis of medieval universities in many cases.

22.   To what extent was the medieval period a cultural golden age in the Islamic world?

      The medieval period was the height of the Golden Age in the Islamic world. Candidates may refer
      to the numerous areas of scholarship and intellectual development in all disciplines: mathematics,
      medicine, philosophy, literature, poetry and theology.
      The scholarship carried out in Spain in this period, as well as the inspiration of the Abbasid dynasty
      under Harun al-Rashid, were major forces in the development of the Golden Age. The rise of other
      groups who celebrated scholarship such as the Fatimids further increased the achievements in this
      period. It can be contrasted with the decline of intellectual development with the Mongol invasions,
      collapse of the Fatimids and the decline of Muslim rule in Spain.

23.   “The universities of Europe were a powerful force for change.” To what extent do you agree
      with this statement?

      Candidates are required to produce an analytical response which contains their degree of support for
      the statement in this question.

      In support of the statement the points may include but not be limited to: the development of
      universities into intellectual centres where new ideas, methods of reasoning and thinking were
      constantly developing and changing, for example, the works of individuals such as Peter Abelard,
      which challenged traditional views, were widely discussed in them; they were centres for pragmatic
      disciplines such as law and medicine, which expanded knowledge and challenged traditional ideas;
      they also expanded the study of experimental science that changed the view of the world, and
      challenged religious explanations of the natural world; they were conduits for the revival of
      classical knowledge and the intellectual developments from Islam that came by way of Spain.
      Aristotle and other classical thinkers became popular as a result of the work of the universities.
      This forced changes in theology as shown by the work of Aquinas.

      Universities were dynamic centres for change where new ideas could be discussed and developed.
      The graduates of the universities took these new ideas into government, the Church, law, science
      and business, and helped promote change in many fields. In addition, they were multi-cultural
      institutions which attracted students from all over Europe. These students returned to their home
      countries and helped spread the new ideas more widely.

      Those who wish to challenge the statement may point out that many universities were controlled by
      both the government and the Church and thus their ability to create change was, to a degree, limited.
      It might be pointed out that other factors were as crucial or more crucial in causing change such as
      the changing economic structure of Europe, new central governments, wars and plagues, increasing
      wealth and literacy.

      The above material is an indication of what candidates may elect to write about in their
      responses. However, the list is not exhaustive and no set answer is required.

      Examiners and moderators are reminded of the need to apply the markbands that provide the
      “best fit” to the responses given by candidates and to award credit wherever it is possible to do so.

24.   Examine the impact of increased scientific study on medieval Europe.

      This is a broad topic that will allow candidates to consider the impact of areas such as medicine,
      optics, chemistry, cartography and mathematics. In addition candidates may choose to comment on
      the impact created by scholars who had an interest in science such as Bacon and Grosseteste, as
      well as the medical schools of Italy and those examining the classical science texts coming from
      Spain. The teachings and reputation of these individuals may be seen as having an important
      impact as they created a new area of scholarship in the universities, published books and pamphlets
      and attracted many adherents who wished to pursue scientific studies.

      Candidates may wish to comment on the effect of science as creating challenges to church doctrine
      and how this may have weakened faith or led to heretical developments. Increased knowledge had
      economic impacts, it expanded university curricula and created a new group of scholars and
      teachers interested in science. New technologies also emerged as a result of the expansion of
      knowledge in areas such as chemistry. The Church was forced to respond to the challenges that
      science helped to create, and this led to the founding of the Franciscan and Dominican orders as
      well as the work of Aquinas.

      The study of Greek and Roman science was expanded as interest and awareness developed and this
      improved man’s knowledge of the world and led to a greater confidence in man’s ability to
      understand the physical world. This was a component of the 12th century renaissance and a
      foundation of the humanism of the 15th century Renaissance. In addition the new interest in
      science led to an increase in demand for books as more individuals became interested in the
      discipline.

      Overall, candidates should see the expansion of science as a force for change and the beginning of a
      more secular focus in the European world. There are a number of areas that may be discussed and
      any relevant material should be credited.

Topic 5     Religion and the state

25.   Examine the reasons why the temporal power of the Papacy increased in Europe during the
      medieval period.

      The temporal power of the Papacy increased significantly from the 11th century onward. The
      reasons for this increase may include but not be limited to: Gregory VII asserted in the Dictatus
      Papae that popes were superior to temporal rulers and could depose them for bad conduct; this
      encouraged a number of activist popes to exert their influence over temporal rulers in many non-
      religious areas such as the law, dynastic disputes and territorial disputes; the possession of extensive
      landholdings also caused the Papacy to increase its military and financial power in order to defend
      and expand its holdings against other rulers.

      The papacy collected taxes and controlled estates in many areas of Europe which involved it in
      contracts, legal and territorial disputes in defence of its wealth and influence. The papacy
      intervened against temporal rulers to protect the rights of clergy, church property and the right to
      collect taxes against the desire of many rulers to put these matters under their control.

      The moral authority of the papacy allowed it to influence the behaviour of medieval rulers in
      temporal matters. Many rulers sought the support or influence of the pope in disputes with rivals
      over land, dynastic rights, marriages, divorces and finances. This gave the papacy increased
      influence in the temporal affairs of many states. The ability of the pope to impose sanctions on
      rulers such as excommunication also gave the papacy great power which it could use to expand its
      authority or defend its interests against the efforts of temporal rulers to limit papal rights to
      property, taxes etc.

      The reliance of many rulers on clerics as government administrators, educators and advisors was
      another vehicle by which the influence of the papacy in temporal affairs could be increased.

      Candidates should support their answers with relevant content and references to specific popes and
      rulers.

      Popular choices for rulers will be Henry IV, the Holy Roman Emperor, John I, Henry II, Phillip II.
      Popular choices for popes may include: Urban II, Gregory VII, Innocent III, Alexander VI.

26.   Compare and contrast the religious life and work of one monastic and one itinerant order.

      The monastic orders were the first ones established by the Church. They began under the rule of St
      Benedict in the 6th century.

      They were established in remote locations as retreats from the violence and confusion of the world.
      The tradition remained that they should be remote places of prayer and contemplation: refuges
      where individuals could go to seek salvation through prayer, work and contemplation.

      Their work, apart from providing models of religious devotion and asceticism, became of a
      charitable nature as they established schools, hospitals and orphanages within the grounds of the
      monastery. Monasteries housed libraries and produced manuscripts as part of their work of study
      and contemplation. Individuals went to the monastery to seek help. The monks did not go out
      amongst the population to any great degree. Some monks became popes and were leading
      spokesmen for the Church in the early years. Monasteries were permanent foundations with
      property and income.

      The itinerant orders were founded in the 13th century and had a very different role to play. Their
      work was to be focused in urban centres amongst the population. They had no permanent
      establishments at the outset but wandered through the towns and countryside. They were to live an
      active life with the people; not apart from them as was the case for the monastic orders.

      Their role was not contemplation or prayer but preaching and teaching. The particular goal was to
      combat heresy which was increasing in the 13th century. In this way they became the leaders in the
      persecution of heretics through the Inquisition. Their activism also led them to take a leading role
      in missionary work in the Middle East and the New World.

      Their other notable role was as scholars and teachers at the universities. Itinerant orders and their
      members were devoted to a life of poverty and humility and were admired for this in contrast to the
      monasteries, which were often seen as wealthy and corrupt. They were also different from monks
      in that they took on the roles of the priests and became part of Church administration as pastors,
      bishops, and inquisitors.

27.   Examine the reasons for the Sunni/Shia divide.

      The reasons for the Sunni-Shia divide may include but not be limited to: the Sunni/Shia divide dates
      from the first fitna and is based on a dispute over the succession to the caliphate. The Shi’ites
      supported the claim that only those descended from the Prophet could be caliph, while the Sunni
      position was that the caliph could be chosen based on merit.
      The Shi’ites recognized only Ali as a legitimate leader amongst the first four caliphs and demoted
      the first three caliphs as not being true imams.

      The two fitnas in which the descendants of Ali were defeated and killed deepened the conflict
      between the two groups and made it a permanent part of the Islamic world.

      The divide was also caused by rivalry for the Caliphate and territorial conflicts, as between the
      Ottomans and Safavids.

28.   “Religious institutions limited the social and political development of medieval Europe.”
      To what extent do you agree with this statement?

      Religious institutions would include cathedrals, churches, monastic and itinerant orders, and
      schools.

      Some points in support of the statement may include but not be limited to: religious institutions
      were centres of education and founded schools and universities, monastic orders such as the
      Cistercians made significant improvements in agriculture; religious institutions supported the work
      of artist and architects and developed new styles and approaches; religious institutions supported
      the work of scholars like Bacon, Aquinas and Grosseteste who promoted science and the study of
      new ideas; religious institutions also supported political changes in favour of central governments
      and a more ordered society.

      Some points which would contest the statement would include but not be limited to: religious
      institutions were opposed to change that threatened their privileged positions or beliefs; they sought
      to limit discussion of science or philosophical concepts that would challenge church doctrines; they
      used the Inquisition to persecute anyone who sought to challenge their doctrines; they supported
      hierarchy and traditional social structures and sought to protect their wealth and power from any
      form of challenge: social, political, religious or economic.

29.   Evaluate the reasons why one religious opposition movement developed in either medieval
      Europe or the Islamic world.

      Candidates are asked to assess the reasons for the growth of a religious opposition movement. The
      response should focus on the reasons and not simply recount the history of the movement.

      The reasons for the growth of religious opposition movements may include but not be limited to:
      doctrinal disputes between different groups; disputes over the leadership of the religion; emergence
      of new ideas or interpretations to challenge orthodox views; accusations of corruption or
      misconduct against religious leaders, charismatic individuals who encourage criticism of the
      religious establishment.

30.   Examine the reasons for, and the results of, anti-Semitism in medieval Europe.

      The reasons for anti-Semitism in Europe may include but not be limited to: religious condemnations
      as Deicides, increasing religious fanaticism associated with the Crusades and the persecution of
      heretics, general ignorance which accused Jews of practising blood rituals with abducted Christian
      children; holding them responsible for the Black Death and other natural calamities. Jews were also
      persecuted by rulers and nobles who owed them money; killing or expelling Jews allowed the
      debtors to escape their obligations. The increasing number of Jews after CE1000 may also have
      caused hostility as they played a larger role in the growing economy as merchants and money-
      lenders. The fact that Jews often lived apart, dressed differently and had different customs caused
      hostility and suspicion.

      The results of this anti-Semitism may include but not be limited to: repeated attacks on Jewish
      populations resulting in many deaths and destruction of property; Jews being expelled from
      European countries at different times, or having their property confiscated; they were forbidden to
      take part in many aspects of medieval life and had limited rights. Europe suffered considerable loss
      of talented individuals – many went to the Islamic world where they were well-received. Their
      work strengthened the Islamic world in many areas of scholarship, science and medicine.
